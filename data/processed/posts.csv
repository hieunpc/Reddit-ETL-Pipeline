1p7ho3k,Aspiring Data Engineer – should I learn Go now or just stick to Python/PySpark? How do people actually learn the “data side” of Go?,PixelBot_556,dataengineering,"Hi Everyone,I’m fairly new to data engineering (started \~3–4 months ago). Right now I’m:* Learning Python properly (doing daily problems)* Building small personal projects in PySpark using Databricks to get strongerI keep seeing postings and talks about modern data platforms where Go (and later Rust) is used a lot for pipelines, Kafka tools, fast ingestion services, etc. My questions as a complete beginner in this area:1. Is Go actually becoming a “must-have” or a strong “nice-to-have” for data engineers in the next few years, or can I get really far (and get good jobs) by just mastering Python + PySpark + SQL + Airflow/dbt?2. If it is worth learning, I can find hundreds of tutorials for Go basics, but almost nothing that teaches how to work with data in Go – reading/writing CSVs, Parquet, Avro, Kafka producers/consumers, streaming, back-pressure, etc. How did you learn the real “data engineering in Go” part?3. For someone still building their first PySpark projects, when is the realistic time to start Go without getting overwhelmed?I don’t want to distract myself too early, but I also don’t want to miss the train if Go is the next big thing for higher-paying / more interesting data platform roles.Any advice from people who started in Python/Spark and later added Go (or decided not to) would be super helpful.

1pbiodi,I spent 6 months fighting kafka for ml pipelines and finally rage quit the whole thing,gurudakku,dataengineering,"Our recommendation model training pipeline became this kafka/spark nightmare nobody wanted to touch. Data sat in queues for HOURS. Lost events when kafka decided to rebalance (constantly). Debugging which service died was ouija board territory.

Found duplicates constantly, maybe we configured wrong but after 3 weeks of trying we gave up. Said screw it and rebuilt everything simpler.Ditched kafka entirely, we went with nats for messaging, services pull at own pace so no backpressure disasters. Custom go services instead of spark because spark was 90% overhead for what we needed and cut airflow for most things, use scheduled messages. Some results after 4 months: latency 3-4 hours to 45 minutes, zero lost messages, infrastructure costs down 40%.I know kafka has its place.

However I think that building HDI on AKS was a great opportunity to innovate with containerized Spark. Once finished, it may have been an even more compelling and cost-effective than Spark on Databricks!

Has anyone solved this before?,Dry-Woodpecker9626,dataengineering,"Hey folks,I have an extremely normalised dataset. Way more than I personally like. Imagine something like:movie → version → presentation → external\_idsBut none of the child tables store the movie\_id. Everything is connected through these relationship tables, and you have to hop 3–4 tables to get anything meaningful.Here’s a small example:* movies(movie\_id)* versions(version\_id)* presentations(pres\_id)* external\_ids(ext\_id)  Relationship goesMovie → version → presentation → external\_idI am trying to achieve a denormalised version of this table, like smaller data marts, which makes my life easier for sharing the data downstream. This is just one of the examples; my goal is to create smaller such data marts, so it is easier for me to join on this ID later to get the data I need for downstream consumersA normal full query is fine — Example SELECT  m.movie_id, v.version_id,  p.pres_id,  e.value FROM movies m JOIN movie_to_version mv ON m.movie_id = mv.movie_id JOIN versions v ON mv.version_id = v.version_id JOIN version_to_pres vp ON v.version_id = vp.version_id JOIN presentations p ON vp.pres_id = p.pres_id JOIN pres_to_external pe ON p.pres_id = pe.pres_id JOIN external_ids e ON pe.ext_id = e.ext_id; The actual pain is incremental loading. Like, let’s say something small changes in external\_ids. The row with ext\_id = 999 has been updated.I’d have to basically walk backwards:ext → pres → version → movieThis is just a sample example, in reality, I have more complex cascading joins, I am currently looking at in future around 100 tables to join, not all together, just in all, to create smaller denormalised tables, which I can later use as an intermediate silver layer to create my final gold layer.Also, I need to send incremental changes updated to the downstream database as well, that's another pain in the ass.I’ve thought about:– just doing the reverse join logic inside every dimension (sounds nasty) – maintaining some lineage table like child\_id → movie\_id – or prebuilding a flattened table that basically stores all the hops, so the downstream tables don’t have to deal with the graphBut honestly, I don’t know if I’m overcomplicating it or missing some obvious pattern.

1p8f3lu,DE managing my own database?,lilde1297,dataengineering,"Hi,Im currently in a position where I am the lead data engineer on my team. I develop all the pipelines as well as create majority of the tables, views, etc for my team. Recently, we had a dispute with the org dba because he uses SSIS and refused to implement ci/cd, as the entire process right now is manual and frankly very cumbersome . In fact when I brought it up he said that doesn’t exist for SSIS and then I had to say that it existed since 2012 with the project deployment model. This surprised the dba’s boss and it’s fair to say that the dba probably does not like me right now. I will say that I have brought this up to him privately before and he ignored me so my boss decided for us to meet with his boss. I did not try to create drama but make a suggestion to make the prod deployment process smoother.Anyway that happened and now there are discussions for me to maybe just get my own database since the dba doesn’t want to improve systems. I am aware of data engineers sometimes managing databases also but wanted to know what that is like. Does it make the job significantly harder or easier? now you understand more and have end to end control so that sounds like a benefit but it is more work. Anything that I should watch out for while managing a database aside from grants users only the needed permissions?Also one interesting thing to me would be what roles do you have in your database if you have one?

1p7kfwe,Streaming Aviation Data with Kafka & Apache Iceberg,ichbinV,dataengineering,"I always wanted to try out an end to end Data Engineering pipeline on my homelab (Debian 12.12 on Prodesk 405 G4 mini). So I built a real time streaming pipeline on it.It ingests live flight data from the OpenSky API (open source and free to use) and pushes it through this data stack: Kafka, Iceberg, DuckDB, Dagster, and Metabase, all running on Kubernetes via Minikube. Here is the GitHub repo: https://github.com/vijaychhatbar/flight-club-data/tree/mainI’ve tried to orchestrate the infrastructure through Taskfile - which uses helmfile approach to deploy all services on minikube. Technically, it should also work on any K8s flavour. All the charts are custom made which can be tailored as per our needs. I found this deployment process to be extremely elegant for managing any K8s apps. :) At a high level, a producer service calls the OpenSky REST API every ~30 seconds, publishes the raw JSON (converted to Avro) into Kafka, and a consumer writes that stream into Apache Iceberg tables which also has schema registry for evolution.I never used dagster before, so I tried to use it to make transformation tables. Also, it uses DuckDB for fast analytic queries. A better approach would be to use dbt on it - but that is something for later.I’ve then used a custom Dockerfile for Metabase to add DuckDB support as the official ones don’t have native DuckDB connection. Technically, you can query directly Iceberg realtime table - which I did to make realtime dashboard in Metabase.I hope this project might be helpful for people who want to learn or tinker with a realistic, end‑to‑end streaming + data lake setup on their own hardware, rather than just hello-world examples.

Until now all sources are structured data**- Size:** <10MB for everything and about 10-12K (maybe 15k 'til end of the year) lines summing all tables**- Current Approach:** gather everything on Power BI, making ingestion (full load), ""storage"", schemas and else there.**- Main bottleneck:** it takes 1+ hour to refresh both fact tables**- Desired Outcome:** to use a data ingestion tool for the API calls (at least twice a month), to use a transformation tool, a proper storage (Postgre SQL for example) and then display the info on PBIWhat would you recommend?

1p84rmp,"SCD2 in staging table, how to cope with batch loads from sourcesystem",Crazy-Sir5935,dataengineering,"Hi all, N00b alert! We are planning to do a proof of concept and one of the things we want to improve is that currently, we just ingest data directly from our source systems into our staging tables (without decoupling). For reference, we load data on a daily basis, operate in a heavily regulated sector and some of our source systems endpoint only provide batch/full loads (as they do tend to offer CDC on their end points but it only tracks 50% of the attributes making it kind of useless).In our new setup we are considering the following:1. Every extraction gets saved in the source/extraction format (thus JSON or .parquet).2. The extracted files get stored for atleast 3 months before being moved to cold storage (JSON is not that efficient so i guess that will save us some money).3. Everything gets transformed to .parquet4. .parquet files will be stored forever (this is relative but you know what i mean).5. We will make a folder structure for each staging table based on year, month, day etc. So now you understand that we will work with .parquet files. We were considering the new method of append only/snapshot tables (maybe combine it with SC2) as then we could easily load the whole thing again if we mess up and fill in the valid from/valid to dates on basis of a loop. Yet, a couple of our endpoints cause us to have some limitations. Let's consider the following example:1. The source system table logs hours a person logs on a project.2. The data goes back to 2015 and has approximately \~12 mln. records.3. A person can adjust hours going a year back from now (or other columns in the table in the source system).4. The system has audit fields so we could only take changed rows but this only works for 5 out of 20 columns thereby forcing us to do batch loads on a daily basis for a full year back (as we need to be sure to be 100% correct).5. The result is that, after the initial extraction, each day we have a file with logging hours for the last 365 days.**Questions**1. We looked at the snapshot method, but even not looking at the files, this would result in 12 mln records per day added? I'm surely no expert but even with partitioning, this doesn't sound very durable after a year?2. Considering SCD2 for a staging table in this case. How can we approach a scenario in which we would need to rebuild the entire table? As most daily loads consider the last 365 days and approximately 1 million rows, this would be hell of a loop (and i don't want to know how long it's going to take). Would it in this case make sense to make delta parquet's specifically for this scenario so you end up with like 1000 rows a file and making such a scenario easier?We need to be able to pull out 1 PK and see the changes in time for that specific PK without seeing thousands of duplicate rows, that's why we need SCD2 (as f.e. iceberg only shows the whole table in a point of time).

A few weeks ago I shared Rigatoni, my CDC framework in Rust. I just published comprehensive benchmarks and the results are interesting! TL;DR Performance: \- \~780ns per event for core processing (linear scaling up to 10K events) \- \~1.2μs per event for JSON serialization \- 7.65ms to write 1,000 events to S3 with ZSTD compression \- Production throughput: 10K-100K events/sec \- \~2ns per event for operation filtering (essentially free) Most Interesting Findings: 1. ZSTD wins across the board: 14% faster than GZIP and 33% faster than uncompressed JSON for S3 writes 2. Batch size is forgiving: Minimal latency differences between 100-2000 event batches (<10% variance) 3. Concurrency sweet spot: 2 concurrent S3 writes = 99% efficiency, 4 = 61%, 8+ = diminishing returns 4. Filtering is free: Operation type filtering costs \~2ns per event - use it liberally! 5. Deduplication overhead: Only +30% overhead for exactly-once semantics, consistent across batch sizes Benchmark Setup: \- Built with [Criterion.rs](http://Criterion.rs) for statistical analysis \- LocalStack for S3 testing (eliminates network variance) \- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions \- Detailed HTML reports with regression detection The benchmarks helped me identify optimal production configurations: Pipeline::builder().batch\_size(500) // Sweet spot.batch\_timeout(50) // ms.max\_concurrent\_writes(3) // Optimal S3 concurrency.build() Architecture: Rigatoni is built on Tokio with async/await, supports MongoDB change streams → S3 (JSON/Parquet/Avro), Redis state store for distributed deployments, and Prometheus metrics. What I Tested: \- Batch processing across different sizes (10-10K events) \- Serialization formats (JSON, Parquet, Avro) \- Compression methods (ZSTD, GZIP, none) \- Concurrent S3 writes and throughput scaling \- State management and memory patterns \- Advanced patterns (filtering, deduplication, grouping) :bar_chart: Full benchmark report: [https://valeriouberti.github.io/rigatoni/performance](https://valeriouberti.github.io/rigatoni/performance) :crab: Source code: [https://github.com/valeriouberti/rigatoni](https://github.com/valeriouberti/rigatoni)Happy to discuss the methodology, trade-offs, or answer questions about CDC architectures in Rust!For those who missed the original post: Rigatoni is a framework for streaming MongoDB change events to S3 with configurable batching, multiple serialization formats, and compression.

Here is what it says: 'The default refresh for a materialized view on serverless attempts to perform an *incremental refresh*. An incremental refresh processes changes in the underlying data after the last refresh and then appends that data to the table. Depending on the base tables and included operations, only certain types of materialized views can be incrementally refreshed. If an incremental refresh is not possible or the connected compute is classic instead of serverless, a full recompute is performed.The output of an incremental refresh and a full recompute are the same. Databricks runs a cost analysis to choose the cheaper option between an incremental refresh and a full recompute.Only materialized views updated using serverless pipelines can use incremental refresh. Materialized views that do not use serverless pipelines are always fully recomputed.When you create materialized views with a SQL warehouse or serverless Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines, Databricks incrementally refreshes them if their queries are supported.

1p8ew4k,"Declarative data processing for ""small data""?",lobster_johnson,dataengineering,"I'm working on a project that involves building a kind of world model by analyzing lots of source data with LLMs. I've evaluated a lot of dataproc orchestration frameworks lately — Ray, Prefect, Temporal, and so on.What bugs me is that the appears to be nothing that allows me to construct *declarative*, functional processing.As an extremely naive and simplistic example, imagine a dataset of HTML documents. For each document, we want to produce a Markdown version in a new dataset, then ask an LLM to summarize it. These tools all suggest an imperative approach: Maybe a function `get_input_documents()` that returns HTML documents, then a loop over this to run a conversion function `convert_to_markdown()`, and then a `summarize()` and a `save_output_document()`. With Ray you could define these as _tasks_ and have the scheduler execute them concurrently and distributed over a cluster. You could batch or paginate some things as needed, all easy stuff.In such an imperative world, we might also keep the job simple and simply iterate over the input every time if the processing is cheap enough — dumb is often easier. We could use hashes (for example) to avoid doing work on inputs that haven't changed since the last run, and we could cache LLM prompts. We might do a ""find all since last run"" to skip work. Or plug the input into a queue of changes.All that's fine, but once the processing grows to a certain scale, that's a lot of ""find inputs, loop over, produce output"" stitched together — it's the same pattern over and over again: Mapping and reducing. It's map/reduce but done imperatively.For my purposes, it would be a lot more elegant to describe a full graph of operators and queries.For example, if I declared `bucket(""input/*.html"")` as a source, I could string this into a graph `bucket(""input/*.html"") -> convert_document()`. And then `-> write_output_document()`. An important principle here is that the pipeline only expresses flow, and the scheduler handles the rest: It can parallelize operators, it can memoize steps based on inputs, it can fuse together map steps, it can handle retrying, it can track lineage by encoding what operators a piece of data went through, it can run operators on different nodes, it can place queues between nodes for backpressure, concurrency control, and rate limiting — and so on.Another important principle here is that the pipeline, if properly memoized, can be fully differential, meaning it can know at any given time which pieces of data have changed between operator nodes, and use that property to avoid unnecessary work, skipping entire paths if the output would be identical.I'm fully aware of, and have used, streaming systems like Flink and Spark. My sense is that these are very much made for large-scale Big Data applications that benefit from vectorization and partitioning of columnar data. Maybe they could be used for this purpose, but it doesn't appear like a good fit? My data is complex, often unstructured or graph-like, and is I/O-bound (calling out to LLMs, vector databases, and so on). I haven't really seen this for ""small data"".In many ways, I'm seeking a ""distributed Make"", at least in the abstract. And there is indeed a very neat tool called [SnakeMake](https://snakemake.github.io/) that's a lot like this, which I'm looking into. I'm a bit put off by how it has its own language — I would prefer Python to declare my graph, too — but it looks interesting and worth trying out.

1p8auj1,What has been your relationship/experience with Data Governance (DG) teams?,mdecav,dataengineering,"My background is in DG/data quality/data management and I’ll be starting a new role where I’m establishing a data strategy framework.

Any resources that you're aware of in this space would also be of benefit for me to reference. Thanks!1) Data quality (DQ): technical controls vs business rules. In my last role there was a “handshake” agreement on what DQ rules are for Technology to own vs what Data Governance owns. Typically rules like reconciliations, timeliness rules, and record counts (e.g. file-level rules vs field- or content-level rules) were left for Technology to manage.2) Bronze/silver/platinum/gold layers. DQ rules apply to the silver or platinum layers, not the gold layer. The gold layer (i.e. the ""golden source"") should be for consumption.3) Any critical data elements should have full lineage tracking of all layers in #2. Tech isn't necessarily directly involved in this process, but should support DG when documenting lineage.4) Any schema changes DG should be actively aware of, even before the changes are made. Whether the change request originates from Technology or the Business, any change can have downstream impact for data consumers for example to Data Products.",2,0.63,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1p8auj1/what_has_been_your_relationshipexperience_with/,2025-11-27 19:28:42,2025-12-03 01:43:27

1p7bpun,I built an MCP server to connect your AI agents to your DWH,karakanb,dataengineering,"Hi all, this is Burak, I am one of the makers of [Bruin CLI](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin). We built an MCP server that allows you to connect your AI agents to your DWH/query engine and make them interact with your DWH.A bit of a back story: we started Bruin as an open-source CLI tool that allows data people to be productive with the end-to-end pipelines. Run SQL, Python, ingestion jobs, data quality, whatnot. The goal being a productive CLI experience for data people.After some time, agents popped up, and when we started using them heavily for our own development stuff, it became quite apparent that we might be able to offer similar capabilities for data engineering tasks. Agents can already use CLI tools, and they have the ability to run shell commands, and they could technically use Bruin CLI as well.Our initial attempts were around building a simple [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) file with a set of instructions on how to use Bruin. It worked fine to a certain extent; however it came with its own set of problems, primarily around maintenance. Every new feature/flag meant more docs to sync. It also meant the file needed to be distributed somehow to all the users, which would be a manual process.We then started looking into MCP servers: while they are great to expose remote capabilities, for a CLI tool, it meant that we would have to expose pretty much every command and subcommand we had as new tools. This meant a lot of maintenance work, a lot of duplication, and a large number of tools which bloat the context.Eventually, we landed on a middle-ground: expose only documentation navigation, not the commands themselves.We ended up with just 3 tools:* `bruin_get_overview`* `bruin_get_docs_tree` * `bruin_get_doc_content` The agent uses MCP to fetch docs, understand capabilities, and figure out the correct CLI invocation. Then it just runs the actual Bruin CLI in the shell. This means less manual work for us, and making the new features in the CLI automatically available to everyone else. You can now use Bruin CLI to connect your AI agents, such as Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, or any other agent that supports MCP servers, into your DWH. Given that all of your DWH metadata is in Bruin, your agent will automatically know about all the business metadata necessary. Here are some common questions people ask to Bruin MCP:* analyze user behavior in our data warehouse* add this new column to the table X* there seems to be something off with our funnel metrics, analyze the user behavior there* add missing quality checks into our assets in this pipeline Here's a quick video of me demoing the tool: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=604wuKeTP6U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=604wuKeTP6U)All of this tech is fully open-source, and you can run it anywhere.

1p715sk,How do you usually import a fresh TDMS file?,Responsible_Path_634,dataengineering,"Hello community members,I’m a UX researcher at MathWorks, currently exploring ways to improve workflows for handling TDMS data. Our goal is to make the experience more intuitive and efficient, and your input will play a key role in shaping the design.When you first open a fresh TDMS file, what does your real-world workflow look like? Specifically, when importing data (whether in MATLAB, Python, LabVIEW, DIAdem, or Excel), do you typically load everything at once, or do you review metadata first?Here are a few questions to guide your thoughts:•The “Blind” Load: Do you ever import the entire file without checking, or is the file size usually too large for that?•The “Sanity” Check: Before loading raw data, what’s the one thing you check to ensure the file isn’t corrupted? (e.g., Channel Name, Units, Sample Rate, or simply “file size > 0 KB”)•The Workflow Loop: Do you often open a file for one channel, close it, and then realize later you need another channel from the same file?Your feedback will help us understand common pain points and improve the overall experience.

1p7c4n4,Structuring data analyses in academic projects,ConclusionForeign856,dataengineering,"Hi,I'm looking for principles of structuring data analyses in bioinformatics. Almost all bioinf projects start with some kind of data (eg. microscopy pictures, files containing positions of atoms in a protein, genome sequencing reads, sparse matrices of gene expression levels), which are then passed through CLI tools, analysed in R or python, fed into ML, etc.There's very little care put into enforcing standardization, so while we use the same file formats, scaffolding your analysis directory, naming conventions, storing scripts, etc. are all up to you, and usually people do them ad hoc with their own ""standards"" they made up couple weeks ago. I've seen published projects where scientists used file suffixes as metadata, generating files with 10+ suffixes.There are bioinf specific workflow managers (snakemake, nextflow) that essentially make you write a DAG of the analysis, but in my case those don't solve the problems with reproducibility.General questions:1. Is there a principle for naming files? I usually keep raw filenames and create a symlink with a short simple name, but what about intermediate files?2. What about metadata? \*.meta.json? Which metadata is 100% must-store, and which is irrelevant? 1 meta file for each datafile or 1 per directory, or 1 per project?3. How to keep track of file modifications and data integrity? sha256sum in metadata? Separate csv with hash, name, date of creation and last modification? DVC + git?4.

1p9ujws,Establishing GCP resource hierarchy/governance structure,Master-Ad-5153,dataengineering,"Going in, I already have some thoughts drafted down on how to tackle this issue alongside having solicited advice from some Google folks when it comes to the actual implementation, but I figured why not get some ideas from this community as well on how to approach: Without giving away the specifics of my employer, I work for a really large company with several brands all using GCP for mostly SEM and analytics needs alongside handling various Google APIs used within product applications. Our infrastructure governance and management teams explicitly don't work within GCP, but instead stick with on-prem and other clouds. Therefore, data governance and resource management is chaotic, as you can imagine.I'm working on piloting a data transfer setup to one of the mainstream cloud providers for one of the brands, which may eventually scale to the others as part of a larger EDW standardization project, and figured now would be the right time to build out a governance framework and resource hierarchy plan. The going idea is to get support from within the brand's leadership team to work across other brands to implement only for the initial brand at this time as a pilot, from which adjustments can be made as the other brands eventually fold into it through the aforementioned EDW project. However, the main concern is how to handle a partial implementation - adding structure where there previously wasn't any - when org admin users from other brands can still freely go in and make changes/grant access as they've done thus far? Afaik, there's no way to limit these roles as they're essentially super users (which is an issue within itself that they're not treated as such).",0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1p9ujws/establishing_gcp_resource_hierarchygovernance/,2025-11-29 17:28:07,2025-12-03 01:43:27

1paixj7,Rest API design,EcstaticJob347,learnprogramming,"Hey, I’ve been building my REST API and recently stumbled upon a design problem. I’m working on an app for managing a car repair shop. I currently have a few routes, such as:* `/api/clients`* `/api/cars`* `/api/car`* `/api/jobs-histories` (where we store each car’s repair history)Recently, my frontend developer asked me to create an endpoint that would allow him to **send a client and a car in a single request**, and also to **fetch a client and their car in a single request**. Now I’m wondering how to handle this in a RESTful way.I’ve considered several options, but none of them seem ideal:1. Allow passing a car object to the `/clients` route so that both objects are created together. But this feels wrong because the operation is supposed to create only a client, not a client and a car.2. Introduce a new route like `/api/registration`. But the name feels misleading, and creating a new representation for every such scenario seems odd.3. Add some kind of action endpoint like `/api/client/with-car`, but this looks like an anti-pattern since verbs should not appear in REST endpoints.4. Create a generic actions/transactions endpoint like `/api/actions` or `/api/transactions` and put things like `/api/actions/client-with-car` under it. But this also feels like an anti-pattern.Do you have any tips on which approach I should take? What is the correct way to solve this in a RESTful manner? UPDATE:Hey guys, I think I’ve found a way to address this. Thanks for all the answers.The frontend needed this additional query mostly for convenience and to reduce latency in the app plus to make operation easier for frontend. After thinking about it, I realized that the first solution isn’t as bad as I initially thought. It’s actually quite reasonable: the **Client** is an aggregate root and it owns the **Car**, so creating both in a single request is acceptable(car as optional param)I can also later support an `include` query parameter that allows the caller to decide whether they want the client returned with the car or not. This makes the route much more flexible and makes the entire API more expressive, because we’re not creating artificial endpoints for every possible data representation.I think that API should describe **business entities**, not implementation details (like different representations of the same thing). So I’ll go with the first solution.Thanks for all the answers!",50,0.92,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1paixj7/rest_api_design/,2025-11-30 13:59:00,2025-12-03 01:43:28

1p9uf6a,Best stack for personal project,Ill-Floor6264,learnprogramming,"I’m more of a beginner who’s just starting to learn to code, using AI coding assistants (Cursor, Copilot, etc.) as “training wheels” while I learn fundamentals along the way. In February I’ll start studying at a university where I’ll be surrounded by people who really know software engineering and are happy to help me, so I’ll have good support in real life as well.I have a big long-term project in mind and I’d love your advice on the best technical foundation so I don’t have to switch stacks later.What I want to buildI want to create my own “personal operating system” for ultra high performance, with:A fully custom calendar (not Google Calendar) where I can plan my days, weeks, and months.Project and task management (similar to a mix of Notion / Asana) with goals, priorities, and deadlines.Meditation module with different practices and routines that I can schedule, track, and reflect on.Fitness and sleep integrations using APIs like WHOOP and Oura to pull in data on recovery, strain, sleep quality, etc.A system for goal setting, tracking, and reflection (short-, mid-, and long-term goals).An AI “specialist agent team” for different domains (energy management, focus, planning, reflection, learning, etc.).A main AI “orchestrator” that:Has access to my data (calendar, tasks, biometrics, notes, habits, etc.).Tracks my patterns over time.Gives me suggestions on how to structure my days/weeks, improve performance, and recover better.Dashboards that combine:My current energy / recovery state.Upcoming tasks and projects.Sleep and training history.AI-generated insights and recommendations.On top of that, I have a strong interest in beliefs, mindset, identity, and habits of highly successful people. I want a feature where I can:Store detailed notes about successful people (beliefs, identity, habits, principles, etc.).Have these notes automatically processed into a meta-dashboard that shows common patterns across many people (like an evolving “success blueprint” for myself).Store lots of notes in a flexible way (somewhat Notion-like), with tagging, search, and later analysis by AI.Design requirementsDesign is very important to me:It should look and feel premium, very smooth and beautiful.I want full theming, especially light, dark, and maybe a “galaxy / universe” style theme (I like the look of tools like Comet).I care a lot about micro-interactions, animations, and the general “feel” of the app, not just functionality.Other notes:I don’t want to constantly change programming languages later if I can avoid it. I know migrations are possible, but I’d like to pick a stack that can scale with me from “learning projects” to something potentially serious.I’m okay with starting web-first (desktop browser), and maybe adding mobile later once the core works.Of course I am sure I will have more ideas on what to add in the future so I want the possibility to do so and not be limited by my stack.What I’m currently thinkingRight now, I’m leaning towards:Frontend: React (with something like Tailwind + a modern UI library such as shadcn/ui / MUI / similar for beautiful, customizable components and theming).Backend: Node.js with Express (or maybe NestJS later) for APIs.Database / backend-as-a-service: something like Supabase or Firebase for auth, database, and possibly real-time features.AI layer: calling external APIs (OpenAI / Claude etc.), possibly adding a separate Python microservice later for heavier analysis / agents if needed.My questions to you:What do you think about React + Node.js as the core stack for this kind of project, given that I’m a beginner but will use AI coding assistance and have access to knowledgeable students at university?Are there any major reasons I should consider a different stack (for example, Python + Django, Next.js fullstack, something else) for this type of long-term personal system?From a long-term perspective (maybe turning this into a real product if it gets good), is React + Node + Postgres a solid foundation, or would you pick something else today?Thank you for any advice, architecture ideas, or “don’t do this, you’ll regret it later” warnings.",20,0.74,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p9uf6a/best_stack_for_personal_project/,2025-11-29 17:22:35,2025-12-03 01:43:28

Anyway, for personal interest I have started this course and at the same time i began university (computer science, i am 35 now), and i’m finding it extremely difficult. in particular , drawing the circuit is not an easy task at all, you have to know boolean algebra pretty well, and manipulate boolean expressions, or use karnaugh maps. all things that are not explained in the course and you have to learn yourself and takes quite a lot of time. writing hdl is trivial, but those damn circuits.… i read old posts where people were able to complete this in no time, while i struggled a lot just to do the first module and I had to look up for the solutions of many circuits. i am kinda depressed. i think my problem was i was looking for some easy procedure or algorithm to solve the implementations, but there is not since this is a NP problem. the procedure i follow is usually to start from the truth table and then using the Disjunctive Normal Form. Of course this is not needed for AND, NOT and OR but still these basic three where not trivial either for me . Anyway, this is just a rant.

I know this sounds weird but my situation is complicated, if I were to explain it this post would be way too long. I'm getting treatment for it and maybe I'll be able to resume college next academic year. I really wish I could just continue instead of wasting my time bc my coach is underestimating me but I need a decent alternative that doesn't cost me a fortune and maybe helps me get through college faster later on if possible. I just want that degree ASAP really.I'm mainly interested in learning programming so I can have a career related to it later and can maybe develop an indie game or two in my off time, before I started with college I had basically zero programming experience, now I have a little but it's not enough really. I thought ""I'll just go through college and when I have my degree I'll be all set""I learned from boot.dev from a few sponsorships and bought a subscription once but I barely felt like using it bc the opinions on it were mixed and I refunded it. Now there's a pretty good deal for it from Black Friday. I often have trouble with motivating myself to study and getting enjoyment out of it so maybe this helps. Seems like a good fit for an introvert like me I guess? It says you can get hired after 12 or so months of using it but is that actually legit or is it just false advertising? I've also heard mixed opinions about whether the certificates you can get from it, or from anywhere really, are actually useful, or whether employers actually care for them. I know getting a degree is important and I want to get one at some point, this is just an alternative to pass the time until next academic year while I'm getting treatment. I'm not sure if this will actually shorten the time I have to wait before I can get that degree tho.Has anyone here actually taken courses from boot.dev and what are your opinions on it? Were the certificates actually useful? How long will it take me to go through it if I try to use it as a substitue for college and spend like say 40 hrs a week on it? So is this actually useful enough to me or should I go argue with my study coach?EDIT: Just wanted to point out that while I do want to make indie games, I know I most likely won't be able to do it for a living so I do want to get a career that's adjacent to something like that and put programming experience and other CS-related things to use.

1pceges,Where should i start ?,MoAd340,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I posted here before saying that I’m a Software Engineering graduate who feels completely lost, and many people told me to either try getting an internship or start building small projects to figure out if I even enjoy programming. The problem is that during university I mostly studied just to pass exams, not to really learn, so even though I worked with front-end, Java, C++, and a few other things, I honestly forgot most of it because I never practiced. I also feel like there are a lot of basic concepts I should already know but don’t.Another thing that’s been holding me back is applying to companies. Most places ask for a CV, and I honestly don’t feel confident putting mine out there. It’s not that the things I list are “wrong”—I really did study them—but I don’t master them and barely remember anything. That makes me hesitate to apply for internships or entry-level positions because I feel like I don’t truly deserve the skills I say I have.At the same time, I always felt like things like HTML or even C++ are “easy” and that anyone can learn them, so I’m not sure if I should learn completely different languages like Java or Python, or if I should just stick to one clear track and build from there.Right now I want to restart properly from zero, but I don’t know where to begin. I see a lot of people recommending The Odin Project—would that be a good starting point? I can study around 4–6 hours a day, but I don’t want to waste time on something too basic or something that won’t help me get anywhere. I’m also not sure whether to focus on front-end, back-end, or try both at the same time. And I’m confused about how people even start building small projects—do you follow certain websites for ideas, or specific courses?What’s also discouraging me is AI. It feels like AI can now build a full website in minutes while a beginner needs days. Is this actually true, or am I overthinking it? Should I look into mobile development instead, or try something that fits the market better?Any advice or a clear roadmap for restarting would really mean a lot.

1p7ax9h,Naming Things in really complex situations and as codebase size increases and glossry for common terms.,Dizzy-Complaint-8871,learnprogramming,"Naming has become a real challenge for me. It’s easy when I’m following a YouTube tutorial and building mock projects, but in real production projects it gets difficult. In the beginning it’s manageable, but as the project grows, naming things becomes harder.For example, I have various formatters. A formatter takes a database object—basically a Django model instance—and formats it. It’s similar to a serializer, though I have specific reasons to create my own instead of using the built-in Python or Django REST Framework serializers. The language or framework isn’t the main point here; I’m mentioning them only for clarity.So I create one formatter that returns some structured data. Then I need another formatter that returns about 80% of the same data, but with slight additions or removals. There might be an order formatter, then another order formatter with user data, another one without the “order received” date, and so on. None of this reflects my actual project—it’s not e-commerce but an internal tool I can’t discuss in detail—but it does involve many formatters for different use cases. Depending on the role, I may need to send different versions of order data with certain fields blank. This is only the formatter situation.Then there are formatters that include user roles, order formatters that also include product details, and other combinations. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to separate order and product formatters, but in rare cases I need a product formatter with only an order number or something similar, so I end up creating another formatter because the original one didn’t include it.Beyond formatters, naming functions, classes, methods, getters, and setters also becomes difficult. I know that when naming becomes hard, it may indicate that the code isn’t following the Single Responsibility Principle. But I’m not always sure how to handle this.For example, I might be building an interface that lets users update their data. An admin can update emails, phone numbers, and roles, but a regular user can only update their name. This leads to functions like `update_user_with_role`, `update_user_normal`, `update_user_with_email`, and so on.Most of my projects have role-based access control, and different roles can view or update different fields. Sometimes even the displayed values differ. For example, if an admin views an order, they might see quantity 100, but a vendor might see quantity 70 because the order is split between two vendors. That means writing multiple getters, different database queries, and various ways of manipulating the data. This leads to many functions and a lot of naming decisions.Inside a single function, I often deal with dictionaries (like objects in JavaScript). I might fetch raw data from the database, give it a long descriptive name, remove some parts, process it again, and so on. I end up naming the same dictionary multiple times in different forms, and the names become long and messy. I’m unsure what the right approach is here.Tutorials usually cover only obvious examples aimed at beginners. They say things like “If you calculate tax, call it `calculate_tax`,” which is obvious. But my real-world cases aren’t that simple. If discounts depend on user roles, sure, the logic should be inside the function, but I still need to express it clearly. I also don’t want to get stuck overthinking names because that delays the project.Name collisions happen a lot. For example, I once wrote a function called `get_user` to fetch a user by ID. Later I needed to fetch users by email, username, and other fields. I ended up writing multiple versions, and the original vague name became a problem because it was created early in the project. I eventually renamed it, but it was painful. That’s why I want a better approach from the start so I don’t spend hours worrying about names.Sometimes it feels easier to write the logic itself. I never use meaningless names like `a` or `x1`, but I do end up writing temporary or placeholder names like “this\_has\_to\_be\_renamed”. Then I move on to the next function and write “this\_is\_not\_right\_first\_has\_to\_be\_renamed”, and so on. These names aren’t helpful, but they let me continue writing code without getting stuck on naming.So I’m looking for any guide, project, or glossary I can refer to—something with common naming patterns. For instance, I used words like “collection” or “group” earlier, but “batch” made more sense in my context. I’ve used AI suggestions often; sometimes they help, sometimes they produce vague names because they don’t have the full context.I’m not sure if there is any practical guide, but if there is, please share it. Or share any tips that can help me improve. Naming shouldn’t be something that holds me back; I’d rather focus on the logic instead.

1p7spfl,How useful might learning Python be for my purposes?,SamOLamb,learnprogramming,"Hello everyone. I'm a junior in college studying civil engineering, a degree in which you don't need to know anything about anything when it comes to coding. Despite that, I've started learning Python with Harvard's free online CS50 course. This is because:1) I find it personally interesting 2) I'd like to have a marketable skill that sets me apart from my peers 3) I'd like to be able to work on projects for some side incomeI chose Python because it's quite beginner-friendly and has applications in data processing, scraping, automation, among others.I don't think that I'm interested in achieving mastery of the language. I want to reach a level where I can write code well and be able to market my skills as a freelancer. I'm expecting this to take at least 1.5-2 years of learning and practice with coding projects. It's honestly a dream of mine to be able to travel the world in my 20s, and to be able to have a source of income (even if it's not much) from doing remote work cleaning data (or something similar) would be even better. This is on top of the benefit that I think I'd receive in my career from having this skill. My questions are:1) Look, I know developers are crucial and can't be easily replaced by robots. But do y'all think that a couple years of actively learning Python will make me competitive against AI that can write fast, free code? I'm not trying to offend anyone, but it's just that at this point I clearly don't know how good AI's code is or what I could be capable of after 2 years. 2) Assuming I stick to a niche like web scraping or automation, do y'all think I could get paid well by doing projects for people as a freelancer?

We did databases, OS, Python, C — but none of it feels like it actually stayed in my brain. I love learning new things, but when it comes to applying them in real work, I’m pretty terrible. Before this, I worked full-time doing photo editing and product upload stuff. My actual skills were fine, but I was \*slow\*, and I got yelled at a lot because of it. And being slow is basically a crime in real jobs. So now I’m worried — if I struggled with that, how am I supposed to survive in IT, where deadlines are everything? So yeah. I’m low-key scared I might just be bad at programming.During winter break (3 months), I’m planning to self-study like crazy to catch up. Stuff like: \- reviewing C (loops, ifs, pointers, arrays — basically everything I should already know but don’t :loudly_crying_face:) \- rewriting C logic in Python to understand better \- studying English \- using AI tools to learn more \- and drawing again, because I used to draw before getting into design I checked my old drawings recently and realized I’ve never finished a single one — everything is just rough sketches I abandoned. So my goal is simply: finish one drawing. Doesn’t matter if it’s good. Just finish something for once.If I still have time, I want to build small personal projects.

I make real progress, I build things, I feel motivated as hell. But the moment school starts again, everything falls apart. I barely touch code, I lose consistency, and by the time the next break arrives, I feel like I have to relearn half the stuff I already knew.It’s frustrating because I actually love programming and the math behind it — it’s the one thing that really clicks for me — but the school system forces me to spend most of my time studying subjects I honestly don’t care about. Biology, geography, or whatever. They’re fine, but they don’t move me toward the future I actually want. They suck all life out of me.Here’s where I feel stuck:The safer option basically involves me staying in the more academic track. But there’s also a more practical track with a computer science option that seems like it would fit me better. I’m tempted by it… but people around me keep telling me not to go there. They say “that’s where the loud teens who got expelled went,” or “the curriculum isn’t good,” but the thing is — they don’t actually know. It’s all rumors, and I can’t tell if switching would help me or completely screw me long-term. I can still do university after this track, but people say it's difficult because the academic track teaches you how to process stupidly large amounts of information and study. I think I'm fine if I catch up on all the math myself.At the same time, I keep hearing that the programming market is oversaturated, everyone wants to code now, etc. So I’m also second-guessing myself there. Am I wasting my time? Or should I push through because I’m genuinely passionate about this?Honestly, I just want one full year of being able to truly focus on programming so I can grow without losing everything the second school starts again. But that obviously isn’t happening anytime soon.I’m really confused and stuck between all these choices — school tracks, university prep, trying to stay consistent, trying not to fall behind.Has anyone else dealt with this?How do you stay consistent during the school year?Does switching to a more practical track hurt your future?Is the job market actually that bad, or is it just fearmongering?Any real advice or experiences would help a lot.

It used a couple of tools which is mainly known for being used in production especially when multiple pods are running. Truth is I don’t know well about those tools or software.I asked Claude to explain how it helps, read documentation on it and learnt how it could be used but I feel guilty and also wrong somewhere because I kind of implemented something which I don’t know completely about or I didn’t read a lot about it.

I was tested on designing UI's for semiconductor (switches, data center etc) data visualization, as well as javascript fundamentals. I initially asked, wouldn't you want a graphic designer since bulk of the work is UI/UX design? but they said no, they could never understand the technicals of FE dev nor EE. they wanted someone who knew UI/UX design, FE, AND EE. So i was a unique fit for the role.**Stats:**\-TC: Years 1-4: 248k -> 276k -> 303k -> 330k (Includes estimate of guaranteed refreshers)\-High level role with mostly design + telling other devs what to create, less coding\-4 days a week, 30mi commute 10AM-2:30PM, avoids traffic, 45mins. On call for overseas folks 8-10PM. + Occasional travel overseas to india.\-highly rated on glassdoor, low layoffs compared to peers\-incredibly smart EE folks with buncha guys PhD from MIT in Physics\-I studied EE in college but pivoted to FE dev and now this is almost going back to my roots.Interview:\-I didn't even expect a call back, the position seemed out of my league, but behold, i did. Told recruiter my background in FE dev, not a pro UIUX designer but i know the concepts and i work with them. Said he'll get back to me and the next week they want me for a GIGA HARDCORE FINAL ROUND with 6 directors/vps/staff engineers. 6 1:1's PLUS a presentation to all 6.Oh my god I’ve never got grilled on UX design this hard in my life. One of the directors (PhD from MIT) asked me: Say aliens are invading earth. You need to design a control panel for a missile defense system that is user friendly to the operators. Button? Console; command line etc? What’s the design like, how about communication? How do u communicate to others, alarm system? Should there be a mute button? If the operator is in a hurry and needs split second decision how do u ensure the cleanest UI design? Security?Another director (ex-AWS) asked: Say u have a data center with servers and switches that transmit data, but data can be failed / low quality / bad transmission, design a gui for this.VP asked me: Say there’s a bar graph. X axis is quality and Y is number of items. Title of graph is “amount of items of various qualities over the past 24 hours”. Now, we don’t like this presentation and instead want the X axis to be time. But we still want to show the data for quality/# , so we’re adding another data point. How do we display the graph now?Staff FE dev grilled me on js fundamentals such as closures and promises. I fumbled on a few questions but managed to get most, explaining thought process.Crazy interviews, hiring manager told me as a closing thought ""This position is challenging to fill"" and i had that thought RACING in my head 24/7. what could it mean? Did he like me and i'm a contender? Or did it mean ""this is a tough role to pass""; i asked chatGPT and it said ""THIS IS A HUGE GREEN SIGNAL"" i was like lolwut really? ok then!Week later recruiter emails me ""I wanted to connect with you regarding feedback and next steps"" im like NEXT STEPS?? GG? lets fkin goooooooooo. and boom offer.Craziest part is i couldn't prepare for these UI questions, came leftfield, i just winged it and somehow i had enough intuition to pass them. Recruiter told me many candidates were able to pass coding, but struggled/froze on the Design Mission Control System design question. I guess i have some semblance of talent in UI design?\----Some FE coding questions I had this year:**Discord -** tech screen - failedCreate a UI for a formula parser that has fields a, b, c. You can type numbers in the field and the output of the fields would be those numbers, but you can also type letters in the fields and they would add up the numbers stored. For example in field A if you type 3 the output of field A is 3. Then if you type A in field B the output of B is 3. In field C if you type in AB you get 6 (3+3) the reqs were so ambiguous so it took me awhile to understand the problem. NO AI, write on own IDE with screenshare.**Crunchyroll** \- tech screen - passedCreate a react app that renders a collection of anime titles and its image, from json data;for(var i=0; i<5; i++) setTimeOut console.log(i) ""trick"" question whats the output and why?**Crunchyroll -** final coding round - failedPolyfill the ""getElementsByClassName"" function.

Despite all the talk of ethics and codes of conduct, corruption runs deep in IT – from C-suite kickbacks on mega-contracts to freebies for devs. ​**Recent examples I came across** * A few months back, an internal audit flagged a conflict: the eCommerce vendor for our marketing team was owned by the eCom director’s husband. We scrambled to switch vendors and migrate services overnight.* In another case, the country IT head got fired after auditors discovered his wife was a key partner in the firm building our new data centre.**How It Plays Out at Every Level*** **Top Brass**: Execs skim a “small percentage” from huge outsourcing deals with ISVs and preferred partners. Kickbacks may hit spouse accounts as “consulting fees,” or come as all-expenses-paid Vegas/Hawaii retreats, plus holiday hampers and gift cards. * **Middle Management (VPs/Directors)**: They steer SOWs and contracts to “preferred vendors” – think brother-in-law’s startup – for their cut. * **Lower Levels (Managers/Devs)**: Free conference passes with airfare, SWAG-stuffed goodie bags, vendor open bars, and hackathon gift cards are routine “*appreciation*.”This stuff feels like par for the course in IT, even as companies preach zero tolerance.

1pbca1r,We’re heading into a society of less thinking.,SystemIntuitive,cscareerquestions,"Hi,AI is already reshaping how we think. The brain runs on a simple principle: use it or lose it. Whenever a tool automates a skill, the neural circuitry behind that skill weakens over time. We’ve seen this with GPS and navigation ability, calculators and mental arithmetic, spell check and spelling. AI is now scaling that effect across almost every domain.The next generation of workers will grow up in a radically different cognitive environment. A huge part of what we call ""skill"" is repeated cognitive strain, and AI removes that strain.Critical thinking follows the same rule as physical training: stop working the muscle and it atrophies. If you skip the gym for 6 months, your body changes; skip mental effort for 6 months, your mind changes.Problem solving won’t decline because people are getting “dumber,” but because the incentives to think deeply are disappearing. When an answer is always one prompt away, the cognitive machinery for generating answers naturally weakens.It creates a double bind:1. Use AI heavily and you outsource your thinking. 2. Avoid AI and you risk falling behind everyone who does.We’ve never faced a technological shift that directly competes with our core cognitive processes. As experienced workers with decades of intuition retire, we may end up with a workforce whose baseline thinking is increasingly shaped and limited by the tools they rely on.If this trajectory continues, we’re heading toward a society where AI performs most of the critical thinking, and humans gradually lose the habit and even the ability to do it themselves.",43,0.69,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pbca1r/were_heading_into_a_society_of_less_thinking/,2025-12-01 13:06:00,2025-12-03 01:43:29

I don’t have a massive passion for CS but I think it’s cool and like problem solving. I went through college learning a lot about ds/algo and the basics of software engineering but vibe coded my way through senior year.

I studied a lot and broke into an ML job in big tech but now I really feel like I have no idea how to actually code. I can solve a leetcode problem and explain on a high level what different parts(front end, backend, etc.) of software does but have no idea how to actually build anything. (ask me to build a working scalable MVP of anything I doubt I could do it) I feel like I can’t keep up without using AI but then I have an over dependence on AI.

1p914ke,What Market Comp Means,SuhDudeGoBlue,cscareerquestions,"I've been pretty active on both sides of the hiring/interviewing gauntlet for the last few months, and just wanted to share the following thoughts on what I believe are some huge misconceptions around compensation (that candidates, recruiters, companies, and other have).1. Engineers are not commodities. We are non-fungible and there are HUGE differences in the amount of value we can bring, even when you try to classify us into strata like junior, middle, senior, staff, etc. Engineers are more like real estate. There can be huge differences in pricing for a 1500 sqft abode, depending on factors like location, build, amenities, etc.2. Not every company can make the same use of a talented engineer. Just because you are worth $500k at Citadel does not mean Walgreens can realistically get as much value out of you.These 2 realities result in interesting dynamics, where one company may pay their junior engineers more than another company on the same street pays their principal engineers. Both may be acting rationally. It also results in some interesting dynamics where a junior engineer may thumb their nose at opportunities that may be a huge step up in title and responsibilities, and they are acting rationally too.3. The above should make you question the concept of ""market pay"". It is not a meaningful measure. However, if you want to use it, do not use job posting data to figure out ""market pay"". A job posting is an \*unfilled\* role. There are 2 good sources of ""market pay"". 1. Current pay of employed engineers in a similar role and setting. and 2. Recent offers that are accepted by engineers for a similar role and setting. The latter is a better/more effective measure for evaluating a new role as a candidate / determining how to budget for a role you are trying to hire for.",26,0.84,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p914ke/what_market_comp_means/,2025-11-28 17:45:47,2025-12-03 01:43:29

1pa181g,I am in a very bad situation and I need help,One_Cranberry4321,cscareerquestions,"In 2021 I was in my last year of university and I started applying for jobs and got an offer from a CRO to do statistical programming. That was not the job I wanted but I accepted the offer as they offered me a really good salary so that I could finally leave my mother who struggled with addiction. 3 months after that my country (Russia) started the war in Ukraine. My company offered everyone relocation to the UK with a relocation agreement so that one will have to work for them for 2 years. I thought that this would be my last chance to get out of the country and decided to go for it. So, it’s been 4 years since I’ve been working for them doing mostly SAS and R programming. With the recent change of rules in the UK I will not be able to get the residency here and, therefore, right to work. No one in my company has been promoted in the past 3 years and so I am still Junior Programmer and can’t meet the salary threshold requirement. In other European countries I will also need a visa. Unfortunately, during these years I dragged behind the market massively. I have been mostly producing outputs (datasets, tables, listing and a little bit of graphs) using SAS and R (fortunately mostly R in the past 2 years). We also finally stated to use Git/gitlab 2 years ago. I really want to get out of this job and switch to something more in demand. I will probably not be able to secure any visa in Europe and will have to leave but I am open to moving temporary anywhere other than my home country.

1p8azzg,Is this normal or am I the problem?,Theprocastinator213,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR at the bottom.I joined a start up about 8 months ago and it hasn’t been going well. I’ve been having a lot of trouble with different teams and the codebase, and I’m looking for an outside perspective on whether this is common or if I’m contributing to problem.Some background:-I have 3 YoE, mid level SWE, this is my first tech company. -The company has this product with multiple teams working on different parts of it.-My role requires me to work on the product in other team’s domain and set up integrations. -The company has about 500 employees and is doing quite well. From the start, I was having a difficult time working with the team that maintains the core code of the product since the manager on that team can be pretty aggressive and difficult to work with (not just my experience, have heard from multiple people about this). The code isn’t that great either, hard to reason about, plenty of side effects, hard to test, and PR reviews tend to focus on superficial code styling vs catching issues and forward thinking (another opinion shared by others). From what I see, there isn’t a big initiative to fix or improve things but rather keep patching on top of it, and a lot of people dislike that team’s work as they have to use it and deal with the problems.This has made it so that the features I have worked on have been quite messy and buggy, where I’m constantly at odds trying to do my work in the best way but constantly have to implement workarounds or just do more work outside of scope so it doesn’t completely break. I’m always waking up to messages to fix things or staying up late to debug (not just my work), there are features that have had the same bug for months that I haven’t been allowed to fix. I have started to slow down, constantly review my work, afraid that I’ll cause another issue and have to deal with 20 slack messages the next day. All of this has taken a toll on me where I’m regularly stressed and frustrated by what’s going on and what I’m doing.I used to be very excited but nowadays I’m quite drained by the experience, I don’t work on side projects anymore and have started to stop caring about what I work on. I understand that start ups have problems but I don’t mind usual start up problems, I’m used to working a lot and moving quickly. My manager is great and we talk often, he agrees that things are messed up and says I’m doing fine, but I certainly don’t feel that way. I’ve noticed that I have reverted back to a junior mindset of slowing down my pace, staying silent in meetings, and constantly checking in with my manager because I can’t trust the work I do to not fail, yet it still does.Is this a normal thing? I am very open to feedback and everyone I talk to says that I’m doing well and things are messy, but I seriously feel like I haven’t progressed in any way since I’ve started working here and have gotten worse.TL;DR: Mid-level SWE (3 YoE, first tech company) at a ~500-person startup, 8 months in. My work depends on a messy, hard-to-test codebase owned by a difficult manager, so my work ends up buggy, I’m constantly firefighting, and I’m losing confidence and motivation even though my own manager says I’m doing fine.

I feel like I only know how to work at my company though..,dj292,cscareerquestions,"A little backstory about myself..Prior to my job now I was working HVAC for about 6 years, to say the least I was miserable.. Hated my boss, hated just feeling like I wasn't doing any fulfilling, hated that someone said I was going to be a lifer.. Fast forward too 2018, I took the leap, after doing some code academy and attempting to teach myself the basics of code, I applied and was accepted to do a 12 week immersive web dev program in Boston (General Assembly). Right before going to this program, my girlfriend at the time was a dental hygienist, she was making small talk with a client and he mentioned he was a software engineer. She mentioned how i was going to be going to an immersive program in Boston, he gave her his number for me to contact him, i did, we met up for coffee and talked goals and web dev in general. Fast forward to the 10th week of my program, I get a call from that guy and he asked if I wanted interview. I interviewed it was your typical interview but I feel like they were pretty relaxed about it because they knew how green I was. I mean shit, i'm pretty sure the tech challenge they let me use my own personal project I developed through the program.. Anyways they hired me probably believing they could mold me into what they wanted, although there wasnt much molding, there was a lot of extremely late nights of me trying to figure things out because I knew absolutely NOTHING. Long story short there were grueling years of teaching myself a lot but also kind of only teaching myself stuff that would get me through a specific task. I feel like I never really took a step back and really dove into soft skills or design concepts or why you would use a certain pattern for certain scenarios..Now, 8 years later I'm still at my current company and over the past 3 my company as a whole does not feel secure. I've survived big layoffs, clients leaving, entire company not getting raises, etc. I have a family now, I own a house, and I need security.. I've had one job interview over the past year and I completely botched it. The technical interview I froze, it was plain javascript and I couldn't solve it.. I was so embarrassed and couldn't believe it. Now I feel like if it was nextjs and my companies codebase? I wouldn't have had any issues what so ever because i've been working here for so long and I feel like my knowledge of nextjs is very good but thats not going to cut it if I want a new job, which obviously I do with more security.. Just getting an interview almost seems impossible though, then I'm dreading the whole interview process because quite frankly I feel like my soft skills, tech terminology, and overall understanding of frontend development is lacking and I'm so used to my companies codebase I feel like im going to be a deer in headlights during an interview process.I just need some advice on how I should go about getting a new job, do I zoom out and go back to strengthening my soft skills of javascript, do I use some platforms like TheGreatFrontend? What are some concepts companies are absolutely looking for that I should either learn or freshen up on? Any advice would be helpful.

I do ETL work and requests given by customers using SQL, and of course manage loads every month with on-call/production support.The pay is great and I also live at home with my parents, so I am indeed getting comfortable. I'm not in any relationship and I don't really wish to be at all any time soon. The only thing I'm wondering though is how badly I'm hindering my career by staying here skills wise. The data engineering space seems like it is changing a lot, and our tech in our current team doesn't use any of the new tech that's in the current climate.When I first entered this team, I was hoping to use a more modern tech stack, it looks like thought it's a bit limited to just Oracle. I'm fine with the work and I am learning everyday so I'm not complaining about what I have currently. But I do want to progress my career a bit more with more skills. There isn't any Python, Airflow, Spark, AWS, Kafka or any other modern orchestration tools, a bit of a gap in what others would be using.I'm aware that this is a good position, but I do want to progress as a data engineer and become higher impact in the future for maybe a different company or even a startup.**If I stay here for too long, would that make me a bit unmarketable for more current positions with more modern stacks?****Do I stay 1–2 years and risk locking myself into legacy SQL work, or move now while I’m still early?****Is it smarter to grind this job for money or take a risk and pivot sooner?**In terms of urgency, I was considering moving out to a different company within 6 to 8 months but just want some advice.I really want to move to a city as well and move out as well, but with this current position I'm just conflicted on what the move should be. Some have suggested to switch internally within the company, which I could consider. Others have suggested to start applying for other roles in other areas. I want to know some thoughts.tldr; current position is only Oracle. Worried that it isn't up to date to current climate.

1pazioq,Stay in full stack position or return to mobile?,xxxTheBongSquadxxx,cscareerquestions,"Hey, just looking for some opinions and/or advice here.I'm a pretty versatile dev with 5 years of experience - 4 of them as an iOS developer, and now one year as full stack (typical TS/Java stack). I'm based in northeastern Europe for reference.For the past year, I've been working full stack at a smaller company in the healthcare field. Both the application and domain are pretty complicated, but the work itself is mostly enjoyable. It's supposed to be one day in office, but fully remote in practice for now. Unfortunately the management side leaves to be desired, as there are barely any (SCRUM) processes and everything feels very ad-hoc. There are also no dedicated designers or testers.After a period of crunch a few months ago, I got fed up with the stress and lack of project management and applied for a position as a senior iOS developer at a bigger corporation. The position would entail me taking over development and maintenance of a streaming application, working together with a PM and the Android devs.They quickly made an offer at €37k net + 0-15% bonus, though I'd be unable to do much anything to affect the size of the bonus. There would also be five weeks of vacation, instead of the standard four. The position would be fully remote. I signed the contract and would be starting in January.After handing in my resignation, my current job countered with €40k net (no bonus afaik). They also offered a promotion to senior, and ownership of a module of the application. I'd probably be able to also ask for additional vacation time, as they seem desperate for me to stay.Now I don't really know which one to choose, as the current job is really not that bad, and having experience as a full stack senior might be better for future prospects than a more specific mobile role. Also, if I left just one year in, I'm not 100% sure I'd be easily able to return to a similar role elsewhere if I wanted to.Meanwhile at the new place I'd practically have free reign over the technical side of the application and from what I've heard, much less workload. I'm slightly worried about the bonus aspect of the pay though, as there is no guarantees over the amount. It's also unclear how big the budget for raises would be in the future, considering the corporate environment. Does it make sense to double down on my existing mobile experience, or try to build up more full stack credibility? Anyone been in a similar situation? Either way, I'd continue building up more backend experience on my own time as well.Thanks in advance!",8,0.84,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pazioq/stay_in_full_stack_position_or_return_to_mobile/,2025-12-01 01:25:39,2025-12-03 01:43:29

I graduated from college this past May from a top 5 CS school with a degree in data science. To be honest, I originally applied to this program because I was having a tremendous amount of trouble landing a job in the data science industry (makes sense, since data scientist isn't an entry level role). However, I lucked out and eventually received an offer for a junior data scientist position after 1000+ applications.I like my current job, but the location isn't ideal. I'm a lot farther away from my family, and I'm only seeing them once or twice a year, and that has been very hard for me to deal with on top of adjusting to a much colder northeastern city. I was hoping a master's will help me job hop back to california in a year or two, and that's also a reason why I have decided to not take a break from school. With the deadline to deposit coming, I am having a really hard time deciding whether this program is for me. I have listed some pros and cons below:Pros:1. employer reimbursement - I will only have to pay around 20k for the entire program2. UPenn name and prestige3. asynchronous lectures, which is actually a plus for me because I tend to zone out during synchronous lecturesCons:1. After talking to some people who attended my undergrad school and this program, it seems like there's a lot of overlap in terms of course content. So, i'd be learning a lot of the same things all over again2. I want to become a data scientist, so maybe a CS program would improve my coding skills more. I've heard GT omscs is good, but I also heard it's hard, and I don't know if I'll be able to handle work with omscs.3.

1p6w8f6,Different side of the industry,SirSmith149,cscareerquestions,Hey there! Soon to be new grad here this December. I see many posts on here that seem to focus on the core SWE and FAANG positions in the industry and the interview process for them that can range from simple to nightmarish coding assignments and leetcode problems. But I'd like to talk about another corner of the industry that I see talked about less on here. As my specialization that I have focused into has been game development. I have a Associates degree in game programming from one college and will have a standard CS Bachelors with a certificate in game from another college. So my questions for here is what is the interview processes like for these places?Do they do the standard leet code/coding assignments/oral tests or is it more portfolio based?Should I look for standard CS work while also looking for game work or just focus on one?How would my portfolio look to standard CS jobs? Would they like the passion or shy away because of its focus in games?I have a couple projects I have worked on through school and outside of school that I have in my current portfolio that I hope would make me stand out as a new grad in the field. So anyone with experience in the field id love to know your interview experiences and tips you could give me in it!I think it's also important to note that I plan to attend GDC this coming March to network and would love any tips you have for doing that as well!,3,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p6w8f6/different_side_of_the_industry/,2025-11-26 02:40:23,2025-12-03 01:43:29

When I joined, my salary was normal or slightly above average for a junior. After my first year I received a raise of around 16 percent. It was fine, although my performance ratings were strong.For my second year, the company delayed raises and bonuses for six months. During these six months I suggested taking on a team lead role because I had enough experience and leadership ability to handle it. They agreed, and the CEO told me that my compensation package would be adjusted at the end of the year based on the new responsibilities.We are now approaching December and I want to negotiate properly this time. Last year the CEO simply told me the percentage on a Zoom call and I accepted immediately. This year the situation is more ambiguous and I want to handle it in a more strategic way.Here is the context. I am expecting at least a 50 percent increase because my responsibilities as a team lead are significant and I know my contribution is central to the product. My target would be around a 75 percent increase. I know senior engineers in the company making five to six times my current salary, and even though I understand this is a startup, I also know we are not short on funds at the moment. The CEO comes from a corporate background, so he tends to think about raises in the corporate range. On a personal level, I am introverted and not naturally comfortable pushing back or negotiating in the meeting.My questions are the following.Should I anchor him before the meeting with an email laying out expectations? Should I frame it entirely in terms of business value, responsibilities, and the role change? If the CEO says he is offering 50 percent, how do I confidently say that I believe more is appropriate without sounding confrontational? If he offers 80 percent, is it reasonable to still push for more given the expanded scope of work?

I want to know the realistic ground situation for Android roles vs other tech roles.If anyone has gone through a similar journey (moving from Asia → UK tech), I’d really appreciate your advice, mistakes to avoid, and what path you’d recommend. Your advice will be highly appreciated.Thanks in advance!",2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p7dbuv/moving_to_the_uk_from_asia_5_yoe_android_dev_need/,2025-11-26 17:10:53,2025-12-03 01:43:29
1pbjboa,"Should I take this part time job opportunity right now (60% chance unrelated to CS), or just use this time for self studying?",ArdnyX,cscareerquestions,"I am a 3rd-year CS student from the Philippines, currently on an exchange program in Taiwan. I need advice on whether to take a part-time job or focus on self-study.My tuition and dorm are covered, and my parents provide enough for basic living expenses (though the 2x exchange rate is kinda making things a bit expensive). I don’t *need* a job to survive based on my parents, but the extra income would be significant allowing me to save for (maybe..certifications) and just generally, extra funds. We just walk (2-3 minutes) to our school anyway.The part time rules in here is that 20 hours per week only (in our case, it will be done after our classes. So that would be 6pm to 10pm. There is a huge probability that the role is factory/production work. Although these are tech companies, HR was vague, and these roles for foreigners are rarely coding-related (for part time hunters, and this was what we've been told by a fellow half-Filipino student who is also studying in here).The part time salary is no joke though (it's big because we just need to spend on food and personal things, but if we were to spend on things like rent yeah it isn't enough, **which is not the case for us**)We have a dedicated internship semester next year (and that one will be related to our major, and we can choose our specializations depending on the company), so this is purely for extra budget right now.If I decline the job, I plan to dedicate those hours to Nand2Tetris and HTB Academy + using my student discount, as my goal is a career in Cybersecurity, Networking, or System Admin. And maybe improving a bit of programming on the side since I kinda suck at it right now.Is the financial gain and ""work experience"" (even if unrelated to CS) worth losing 20 hours of study time per week? I am considering letting my peers take the jobs first to see if the work is relevant, and joining next semester if it is.As for my time, this is the year when I have the most free time. When I was in the Philippines, I was commuting 3 hours every single day (get home at 7-8pm), and I have to do chores on home, and schoolworks. Barely had any time for studying things that I am interested in. Since my classes end at 4-5pm, that's huge time saved.",1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pbjboa/should_i_take_this_part_time_job_opportunity/,2025-12-01 17:42:54,2025-12-03 01:43:29
