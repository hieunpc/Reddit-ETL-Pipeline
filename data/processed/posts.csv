1qdv3wh,Getting off of Fabric.,FirefighterFormal638,dataengineering,"Just as the title says. Fabric has been a pretty rough experience.I am a team of one in a company that has little data problems. Like, less than 1 TB of data that will be used for processing/analytics in the future with < 200 people with maybe \~20 utilizing data from Fabric. Most data sources (like 90 %) are from on-prem SQL server. The rest is CSVs, some APIs.A little about my skillset - I came from a software engineering background (SQLite, SQL Server, C#, WinForms/Avalonia). I’m intermediate with Python and SQL now. The problem. Fabric hasn’t been great, but I’ve learned it well enough to understand the business and their actual data needs.The core issues:* Random pipeline failures or hangs with very little actionable error output* Ingestion from SQL Server relies heavily on Copy Data Activity, which is slow and compute-heavy* ETL, refreshes, and BI all share the same capacity* When a pipeline hangs or spikes usage, capacity shoots up and Power BI visuals become unusable* Debugging is painful and opaque due to UI-driven workflows and preview featuresThe main priority right now is stable, reliable BI. I'm open to feedback on more things I need to learn. For instance, better data modeling.Coming from SWE, I miss the control and being granular with execution and being able to reason about failures via logs and code.I'm looking at Databricks and Snowflake as options (per the Architect that originally adopted Fabric) but I think since we are still in early phases of data, we may not need the price heavy SaaS.DE royalty (lords, ladies, and everyone else), let me know your opinions.

1qcw5qe,Data modeling is far from dead. It’s more relevant than ever,eczachly,dataengineering,There’s been an interesting shift in the seas with AI. Some people saying we don’t need to do facts and dimensions anymore. This is a wild take because product analytics don’t suddenly disappear because LLM has arrived. It seems like to me that multi-modal LLM is bringing together the three types of data:\- structured \- semi-structured\- unstructured Dimensional modeling is still very relevant but will need to be augmented to include semi-structured outputs from the parsing of text and image data. The necessity for complex types like VARIANT and STRUCT seems to be rising. Which is increasing the need for data modeling not decreasing it.

I started my career as a Software Engineer working on Python-based full stack applications for 2 years and later moved into a Data Engineer role at a new company because there were very few Python backend opportunities at the time.Over the last three and a half years, I’ve realised that I never really got to work as a “proper” data engineer.

I never worked with Spark or large-scale data pipelines.Now that I’m trying to switch jobs, I’m in a confusing spot. Based on my experience, companies expect me to be a Senior Data Engineer, but I don’t have hands-on experience with many of the tools they expect at that level. At the same time, when I get considered for junior roles, the pay is around 50 percent lower than what I make today. It’s also hard not to compare myself to people with fewer years of experience who seem to have worked on far more complex data systems.I’m willing to start now, learn Spark seriously, build strong projects, and put in the effort.

I am worried that my companies limited tech stack / my narrow role is limiting my career progression - not sure if what my day to day work looks like is normal? My role is primarily around building internal facing data products in Snowflake for the business. I have owned and delivered a significant and highly used 'customer 360' MDM data product as the main/sole data engineer in my team, but my role is really just that - I don't do much else outside of Snowflake.

I don't really know what containerisation is, I don't know how to spin up VM's, all the different Azure/AWS tools. In terms of technical skills, I would rank myself as the following:* SQL - Intermediate (maybe creeping into advanced here and there but I need AI help).

1qexmyu,"""semantic join"" problems",kotrfa,dataengineering,"I know this subreddit kinda hates LLM solutions, but I think there is an undeniable and underappreciated fact about this. If you search on various forums like SO, reddit, community forums of various data platforms etc. for terms like (would link them, but can't here):1. fuzzy matching2. string distance3. CRM contact matching4. software list matching5. cross-referencing \[spreadsheets\]6. ...and so on, you find hundreds or thousands of posts dealing with seemingly easy issues where you have the classic example of not having your join keys exactly matching, and having to do some preprocessing or softening of the keys on which to match. This problem is usually trivial for humans, but very hard to generically solve. Solutions range from stuff like fuzzy string matching, levenshtein distance, word2vec/embedding to custom ML approaches. I personally have spent hundreds of hours over the course of my career putting together horrendous regexes (with various degrees of success). I do think there is still use for these techniques in some relatively specific cases, such as when we are talking about big data and stuff, but for all those CRMs systems that need to match customers to companies that are under 100k rows of rows and so on, it's IMHO solved for negligible cost (like dollars compared to hundreds or thousands of hours of human labour). There are different shades of ""matching"" - I think most of the readers imagine something like a pure ""join"" with matching keys, a pretty rare case in the world of messy spreadsheets or outside of RDBMs. Then there are some trivial cases of transformation like capitalization of strings where you can pretty easily get to a canonical form and match on that. Then there are those cases that you still can get quite far with some kind of ""statistic"" distance. And finally there are scenarios where you need some kind of ""semantic distance"". The latter, IMHO the hardest, is something like matching list of S&P500 companies, where you can't really get the results correct unless you do some kind of (web)search. Example is e.g. a ticker change for Facebook in 2022 from FB to META. I believe today LLMs opened the door to solving all of those.For example, a classic issue companies have is matching all the used software by anyone in the company to licenses or whitelisted providers. This can be now done by something like this python-pseudocode: software = pd.read_csv(""software.csv"", columns=[""name""]) suppliers = set(pd.read_csv(""suppliers.csv"", columns=[""company""])) def find_sw_supplier(software_name: str, suppliers: set[str]) -> str | None: return call_llm_agent( f""Find the supplier of {software_name}, try to match it to the name of a company from the following list: {suppliers}. If you can't find a match, return None."", tools=[WebSearch], ) for software_name in software[""name""]: supplier = find_sw_supplier(software_name, suppliers) df.loc[idx, ""supplier""] = supplierIt is a bit tricky to run at scale, and can get pricey, but depending on a task it can be drawn down quite significantly depending on the usecase. For example, for our usecases we were able to trim down the cost and latency in our pipelines by doing some routing (like only sending to LLMs what isn't solved by local approaches like regexes) and by batching LLMs calls together and ultimately fit it into something like (disclosure: this is our implementation): from everyrow.ops import merge result = await merge( task=""Match trial sponsors with parent companies"", left_table=trial_data, right_table=pharma_companies, merge_on_left=""sponsor"", merge_on_right=""company"", )and given these cases are basically embarrassingly parallel (in the stupidest way, you throw every row on all the options), the latency mostly boils down to the available throughput and longest-llm-agent-with-search, in our case we are running virtually arbitrary (publicly web-searchable) problems under 5 minutes and 2-5$/1k of rows to merge (trivial cases are of course for 0, most of the cost is eaten by LLMs generations and web search through things like serper and stuff). This is of course one of the few classes of problems that are possible now and weren't before. I don't know, but I find it fascinating - in my 10-year career, I haven't experienced such a shift. And unless I am blind, it seems like this still hasn't been picked up by some of the industries (judging based on the questions from the various sales forums and stuff).

1qahyip,Best Bronze Table Pattern for Hourly Rolling-Window CSVs with No CDC?,SoloArtist91,dataengineering,"Hi everyone, I'm running into bit of dilemma with this bronze level table that I'm trying to construct and need some advice. The data for the table is sent hourly by the vendor 16 times in the day as a CSV that has transaction data in a 120 day rolling window. This means each file is about 33k rows by 233 columns, around 50 MB. There is no last modified timestamp, and they overwrite the file with each send. The data is basically a report they run on their DMS with a flexible date range, so occasionally we request a history file so they send us one big file per store that goes across several years.The data itself changes state for about 30 days or so before remaining static, so that means that roughly 3/4s of the data may not be changing from file to file (though there might be outliers).So far I've been saving each file sent in my Azure Data Lake and included the timestamp of the file in the filename. I've been doing this since about April and have accumulated around 3k files.Now I'm looking to start loading this data into Databricks and I'm not sure what's the best approach to load the bronze layer between several approaches I've researched.Option A: The bronze/source table should be append-only so that every file that comes in gets appended. However, this would mean I'd be appending 500kish rows a day, and 192m a year which seems really wasteful considering a lot of the rows would be duplicates.Option B: the bronze table should reflect the vendors table at the current state, so each file should be upserted into the bronze table - existing rows are updated, new rows inserted. The criticisms I've seen of this approach is that it's really inefficient, and this type of incremental loading is best suited for the silver/warehouse layer.Option C: Doing an append only step, then another step that dedupes the table based on a row hash after a load. So I'd load everything in, then keep only the records that have changed based on business rules.For what it's worth, I'm hoping to orchestrate all of this through Dagster and then using DBT for downstream transformations.Does one option make more sense than the others, or is there another approach I'm missing?",10,0.87,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qahyip/best_bronze_table_pattern_for_hourly/,2026-01-12 01:51:22,2026-01-18 01:58:17

1qa4iwo,Newbie looking for some advice/guidance - long post,PPEverythingg,dataengineering,"Hey guys, so I’m very new to all of this so trying to sort it all out. Looking for help! I did go through the search by on this page, and found a decent amount of answers - however I honestly need it explained like im 5 and then I have some follow ups.. and then FAQ won’t open for me. So I’ll start with my background and situation -I’m 29 years old, and I am a EHS (environmental health and safety) manager for a FAANG company. It’s a stable career. However I am not very content there. I kind up ended up in this career on accident, and then ran with it. I used to be a computer science major, and spent a year or so learning coding through books and online programs as well. I withdrew from the course, because honestly I siked my self out of it. I convinced myself the market for that field is just too competitive and that it would be a waste of time for me. Reason I felt I didn’t have a chance is because I’m not really in a position to be able to internships as I cannot leave my job to do any (sole provider family of 5) so I felt I was at too big of a disadvantage.Well I finally decided, I do want to pursue tech because that field is what I truly enjoy. This is part where I need help, I’m having a hard time figuring out exactly what role I should pursue/what the natural progression is for these roles? So to breakdown my interest - I am really interested in all things data, I love engineering/coding, and I’m a big excel nerd. I would like to get into power BI as well, just haven’t jumped on. I do a decent amount of data work at my role now, because my company is huge on metrics/data. I use excel daily to deep dive data and analyze trends and what not on there, and I’ve made a lot of tools/trackers as well.So what I’ve kinda narrowed down for the main data roles areData AnalystData ScientistData EngineerBusiness Intelligence AnalystSo do all these roles progress together like advance through them, or are they all entirely separate paths? I wanted to see if someone could explain them to me like I’m 5, and then maybe tell me which kind of degree is recommended for each one? I have a decent understanding of data analyst/BI Analyst- so are those starting points to eventually become data engineers? Im also confused on this, because everything I’ve read online is that it seems none of them are entry level, so how would I start?The two degrees im tossing around right now are from WGU - either Data Analytics or go back to Computer Science. Are there other/better degrees out there I should explore for this field?TLDR - Questions:\- can someone break down the main different data roles simply and how/if they progress together?\- What’s the better option for a degree - Data Analytics, Computer Science, or is there something else I should explore?\- Which degrees are beneficial for each different data role?\- Is it dumb for me to want to leave my stable career to pursue this?\- Do I even have a chance without really being able to any internships?\-What’s the best role for breaking into this field?Sorry guys I know this a lot!

1qe02ol,Pragmatism and best practice,Weird-Yesterday5119,dataengineering,"Disclaimer: I'm not a DE but a product manager who has been in my role managing our company's data platform for the last ten months. I come from a non-technical background and so it's been a steep learning curve for me. I've learnt a lot but I'm struggling to balance pragmatism and best practice. For context:\- We are a small team on a central data platform \- We do not have any defined data modelling standards or governance standards that are implemented\- The plan was to move away from our current implementation towards a data mart design. We have a DA but there's no alignment at the senior leadership level across product and architecture so their priorities are elsewhere\- Analysts sit in another department The engineers on my team are understandably advocating for bringing in some foundational modelling, standards work but the company expects quick outputs. I want to avoid over-engineering but I'm concerned we will incur a lot of tech debt later on down the line that will need to be unpacked - that's on top of the company not getting the value it envisioned with a platform.For anyone who has been in this situation do you have any guidance on whether you have:\- Taken a step back to focus on foundational work? I know a full-scale enterprise data model is not happening at this point but is there something we can begin to bring into our sprints for our higher value use cases? \- Do you have a definition of 'good enough' to help keep you moving while minimising later pain?

1qd17gs,Many DE tasks and priorities to organize,hegardian,dataengineering,"Where I work, there is no Scrum. Tickets keep coming in, and the coordinator distributes them and sets priorities. There are no sprints, because management frequently overrides priorities due to requests from the board and other management areas—almost on a daily basis. It’s basically a ticket queue that we execute as it comes.During the day, I receive many different demands: validating data, mapping new tables, checking alerts from failed processes, discussions about possible data inconsistencies, reviewing PRs, helping interns, answering questions from people on other teams, etc.Sometimes more than 10 people message me at the same time on Teams. I try to filter, organize priorities, and postpone what is not feasible to do on the same day, but more demands arrive than I can realistically handle, so tasks keep piling up.We do have a team board, but I don’t like tracking everything there because some tasks are things like “talk to person X about Y” or “validate what person X did wrong,” which I don’t want to expose directly to colleagues and managers. So on the board I keep things more generic, without many commentsLately, I’ve been putting everything into a single markdown file (tasks and personal notes). The most urgent items go to the top of the list as a simple TODO, but it keeps growing and sometimes it becomes hard to manage tasks and prioritiesNaturally, there are tasks that never get done. My manager is aware of this and agrees that they should only be prioritized when it makes sense, but new ones keep coming in, and I miss having a tool where I could search for similar tasks or something along those linesHave you ever faced this difficulty in organizing tasks? Do you have any tips for a simple workflow? I tried using some tools like Todoist and Taskwarrior, but I ended up preferring the ease of searching in a single file, even though it grows very large very quickly and eventually becomes messy and difficult to manage.

1qel3sz,Seeking advice,Zealousideal-Lab5074,dataengineering,"Hello everyone, I’m a 2025 graduate in Big Data Analytics and currently looking for my first job. It’s been about 5.5 months since my internship ended, and during this time I’ve been doing a lot of reflection on my academic journey. The program was supposed to prepare us for roles like Data Analyst, Data Engineer, or Data Scientist, but honestly, I have mixed feelings about how effective it really was.Over three years, we covered a huge range of topics: statistics, machine learning, big data, databases, networking, cybersecurity, embedded systems, image processing, mobile development, Java EE/ spring bot, SaaS development, ETL, data warehousing, Kafka, spark, and more. On paper, it sounds great. In practice, it often felt scattered and a bit inefficient.We kept jumping between multiple languages (C, java, python, javascript) without enough time to truly master any of them. Many technical modules stayed very theoretical, with little connection to real-world use cases: real datasets, real production pipelines, proper data engineering workflows, or even how to debug a broken pipeline beyond adding print statements. Some courses were rushed, some poorly structured, and others lacked continuity or practical guidance.I know university is meant to build foundations, not necessarily teach the latest trendy tools. Still, I feel the curriculum could have been more focused and better aligned with what data roles actually require today, such as:* strong SQL and solid database design* Strong python for data processing and pipelines * Real ETL and data modeling projects * Distributed systems with clear, practical applications* A clear separation between web development tracks and data tracks* Better guidance on choosing ML algorithms depending on the use caseInstead, everything was mixed together: web dev, mobile dev, low-level systems, data science, big data, and business, without a clear specialization path.Now I’m trying to fill the gaps by self-studying and building real projects, mainly with a data engineering focus. For context, here are the main projects I worked on during my internships:1. Machine test results dashboard * A web application to visualize machine test results. * Stack: Django REST Framework, MongoDB, React.It was a 2-person project over 2 months. I was responsible for defining what should be displayed (failure rate, failure rate by machine/section, etc.) and implementing the calculation logic while making sure the results were accurate. I also helped with the frontend even though it was my first time using JavaScript. A lot of it was assisted by chatgpt and claude, then reviewed and corrected with my teammate.2. Unix server resource monitoring system A server monitoring platform providing:* Real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, and network via websockets * Historical analysis with time-series visualization* ML-based anomaly detection using Isolation Forest* Server management (CRUD, grouping, health tracking)* Scalable architecture with Kafka streaming and redis cachingStack: Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, redis, Kafka, Angular 15, all containerized with Docker.I admit the stack is more “web-heavy” than “pure data engineering,” but it was chosen to match the company’s ecosystem and increase hiring chances (especially Angular, since most of their tech team were web developers). Unfortunately, it didn’t lead to a position.Now I’d really need advice from people already working in data engineering:* What core skills should I prioritize first? * How deep should I go into SQL, Python, and system design?* What kinds of projects best show readiness for a junior data engineer role(and where can i get the data like the millions of rows of data aside from web scraping)?* How do you personally bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry expectations?* What are your thoughts on certifications like those on Coursera?* And for the love of god … how do you convince HR that even if you’ve never used their exact stack, you have the fundamentals and can become operational quickly?Any advice, feedback, or shared experience would be greatly appreciated.\---\*\*TL;DR\*\* My data program covered a lot but felt too scattered and too theoretical to fully prepare for real data engineering roles. I’m now self-learning, building projects, and looking for guidance on what skills to prioritize and how to position myself as a solid junior data engineer.",4,0.84,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qel3sz/seeking_advice/,2026-01-16 16:45:23,2026-01-18 01:58:17
1qejnn6,Messy Data Problems: How to get Stakeholders on Board,BuissnessRake,dataengineering,"Hello! This is my first post in this sub. I’ve seen a lot of strong practical advice here and would like to get multiple perspectives on how to approach a messy data cleanup and modeling problem.Until recently, I worked mostly at startups, so I never dealt with serious legacy data issues. I just joined a midsized private company as an “Analyst.” During the hiring process, after hearing about their challenges, I told them it sounded like they really needed a data engineer or more specifically an analytics engineer. They said nope we just need an analyst, which i thought was odd. FYI: They already have an ERP system, but the data is fragmented, difficult to retrieve, and widely acknowledged across the company as dirty and hard to work with.Once I joined, I got access to the tools I needed fairly quickly by befriending IT. However, once I started digging into the ERP backend, I found some fundamental problems. For example, there are duplicated primary keys in header tables. While this can be handled downstream, it highlights that even basic principles like first normal form were not followed. I understand ERPs are often denormalized, but this still feels extreme.Some historical context that likely contributed to this:* In the past, someone was directly injecting data via SQL* The company later migrated to a cloud ERP* Business processes have changed multiple times since thenAs a result, naming conventions, supplier numbers, product numbers, and similar identifiers have all changed over time, often for the same logical entity. Sales data is especially messy. Some calculated fields do not align with what is defined in the ERP’s data dictionary, and overall there is very little shared understanding or trust in the data across the company.Constraints I am working under:* I have read-only access to the ERP and cannot write data back, which is appropriate since it is the raw source* of-course the ERP is not a read-optimized database, so querying it directly is painful* There are over 20,000 tables in total, but after filtering out audit, temp, deprecated, and empty tables, I am down to roughly 500 tables* Total row count across those tables is likely 40 to 50 million rows, though normalization makes that hard to reason about* I am the first and only data-focused hireThe business context also matters. There are no real long-term data goals right now. Most work is short-term:* One-week automations of existing manual processes* One to two month dashboard and reporting projectsStakeholders primarily want reports, dashboards, and automated spreadsheets. There is very little demand for deeper analysis, which makes sense given how unreliable the underlying data currently is. Most teams rely heavily on Excel and tribal knowledge, and there is effectively zero SQL experience among stakeholders.My initial instinct was to stand up a SQL Server or PostgreSQL instance and start building cleaned, documented models or data marts by domain. However, I am not convinced that:1. I will get buy-in for that approach2. It is the right choice given maintainability and the short-term nature of most deliverablesAs a fallback, I may end up pulling subsets of tables directly into Power BI and doing partial cleaning and reshaping using Power Query transformations just to get something usable in front of stakeholders.So my core question is: **How would you approach cleaning, organizing, documenting, and storing this kind of historically inconsistent ERP data while still delivering short-term reports and dashboards that stakeholders are expecting?**If I am misunderstanding anything about ERPs, analytics engineering, or data modeling in this context, I would appreciate being corrected.",4,0.84,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qejnn6/messy_data_problems_how_to_get_stakeholders_on/,2026-01-16 15:53:40,2026-01-18 01:58:17

1qbilj6,Is my storage method effective?,UselessKnave4,dataengineering,"Hi all,I’m very new to data engineering as a whole, but I have a basic idea of how I want to lay out my data to minimise storage costs as much as possible, as I’ll be storing historical data for a factory’s efficiency.Basically, I’m receiving a large CSV file every 10 minutes containing name, data, quality, data type, etc. To save space, I was planning to split the data into two tables: one for unchanging data (such as name and data type) and another for changing data, as strings take up more storage.My basic approach was going to be: **CSV → SQL landing table → unchanging & changing data tables**We’re not yet sure how we want to utilise the data, but I essentially need to pull in and store the data before we can start testing and exploring use cases.The data comes into the landing table, we take a snapshot of it, send it to the corresponding tables, and then delete only the snapshot data from the landing table. This reduces the risk of data being lost during processing.The changing data would be stored in a new table every month, and once that data is around five years old it would be deleted (or handled in a similar way).I know this sounds fairly simple, but there will be thousands of data entries in the CSV files every 10 minutes.Do you have any tips or advice? Is it a bad idea to split the unchanging string data into a separate table to save space? Once I know how the business actually wants to use the data, I’ll be back to ask about the best way to really wow them.Thanks in advance.",4,0.84,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qbilj6/is_my_storage_method_effective/,2026-01-13 05:07:26,2026-01-18 01:58:17

1qaamfb,Low retention of bronze layer record versions and lineage divergence,Personal-Quote5226,dataengineering,"In the bronze layer, our business is ok (and desires) the clean up of older versions of records. In fact, we can't guarantee that we'll be able to keep this history forever. We'll always keep active records and can always re-build bronze with active records. However, we do have gold level data and aggregate fact table, and it's possible that some of the records in gold could be from a snapshot in time. Let's say there are 3 records in a gold fact that summarize a total. Record 1: ID=1, ver=5 ,Amount=$100 Record 2: ID=2, ver=5, Amount=$100 Record 3: ID=3, ver=3, Amount=$50There will be a point in time where this gold fact will persist and not be updated even if Record with ID=1 has a change in the amount in bronze layer. This is by design and is a business requirement.Eventually in bronze, record with ID=1 changes to ver=6 and Amount now=$110.This time, we don't want to update the gold fact for this scenario, so it remains as ver=5.Eventually, in bronze, due to retention, we lose the bronze record for ver=5, but we still keep v=6. The gold still has a record of what the value was at the time and a record that it's based on the record being v=5.The business is fine with it; and in fact they prefer it. The like the idea of being able to access the specific version in bronze as it was at the time, but if it's lost due to retention then they are ok with that because they will just trust the number in the gold fact table; they'll know why it doesn't match source by comparing the version value. As a data expert, I struggle with it. We lose row-version lineage back to bronze, but the business is ok with that risk. As data engineers, how do you feel about this scenario? We can compromise on the implementation, and I believe we are still ensuring trust of the data in other ways (for their needs) by keeping the copy of the record (what the value was at the time) in gold for the purposes of financial review and analysis.

The existing logging approach is to write the logs from all of these jobs to a continuous text file (one log file for each job, for each day) and a different batch job also inserts the logs into a MySQL table for ease of querying and auditing. Debugging is done through either reading the log files on the server, or the YARN logs for any failed instances, or the MySQL table. This approach has a few problems, mainly that the debugging is kinda tedious and the logs are very fragmented. I'm wondering if there's a better way to design this.

We are currently recruiting and amount of junior, mid and sometimes even senior developers, who cannot write a simple code by their own without using AI is absolutely ridicoulous.AI can be helpful at work, but when you learn, it can hurt you more than it helps. It gives you answers too fast. You paste the code, it runs, and you feel good for a moment… but you don’t really know why it works. Then later you get a different problem, something small changes, and suddenly you are stuck. And the worst part is: you don’t build the “debug muscle”, and debugging is a big part of programming.I see this with juniors sometimes. They can produce code, but when I ask “why did you do it this way?” they can’t explain. When tests fail, they panic. When an error shows up, they don’t know what to try first. It’s not because they are not smart. It’s because AI took the hard part away, and that hard part is exactly what builds skill and confidence.When you learn, the best thing is to struggle a little. Write the code yourself. Read the error message. Try to understand what the program is doing. Use print logs or a debugger. Read docs. It feels slow and annoying at first, but this is how you become strong. This is how you start to “see” problems.If you really want to use AI, use it like a helper, not like a driver.

Maybe I’m just overthinking it, but it really gets to me. Another thing is that when I try to learn something new, it takes me a really long time to understand it.

Then I learned its actually the opposite.Most of my time goes into subtraction not addition. Removing dependencies that nobody needs. Cutting connections between systems that shouldnt talk. Simplifying whats already there before building something new.The hardest part is saying no to complexity that feels exciting but solves yesterdays problem.Good architecture is invisible. When it works developers dont fight the system they flow with it. When it fails every change becomes a negotiation with technical debt.Heres what a typical week looks like for me.Monday a new requirement arrives that breaks three assumptions from last quarter. Back to the drawing board.Tuesday and Wednesday are deep work days. Sketching out how systems should interact or better yet how they shouldnt. Looking for the natural grain of the problem.Thursday is code reviews and design discussions. This is where theory meets reality. Developers will tell you very quickly if your elegant solution makes their lives harder.Friday is documentation. Not the kind nobody reads but the kind that answers why did we do it this way when Im not around.The real skill isnt knowing every design pattern or framework. Its knowing when NOT to use them.The best code is code you dont write. The best dependency is one you removed. The best architecture feels obvious in hindsight.Will I miss writing code every day?

I only learned this after I spent months iterating on the same project and weighing tradeoffs against one another.To keep this short, I want to know what else you can add to my observation.

It's not that I dont like my work, in fact i love doing it, i love fixing bugs and solving problems, but when i hear others talk, especially people younger or also having the same year of experience as i have, talk about programming, using terminologies in which i have no idea what they are or what they mean, using different tools and knowing lots of stuff a beginner programmer should know, i cant even do the technical stuff like setting up projects, i keep thinking to myself that i am nowhere as good as my peers. I start to doubt my work and losing hope on improving. One of the main reason i learned how to program (learnt more on the job than i did in college majoring in programming) and do my work is due to the already existing code and learning from it, and i guess i can understand basic programming logic, also being reliant on AI.

Like when learning promises, I'd link it back to callback functions and explain how they solve callback hell. Building a web of connected knowledge instead of isolated facts.I also keep a running list of common mistakes I make in a separate doc. Like forgetting to return in array methods or mixing up async/await syntax. Reviewing my actual errors is way more useful than rereading correct examples. Stack overflow obviously helps when I'm stuck but I try to understand WHY something works instead of just copying the solution.My current setup is a mix of tools that work together pretty well. I use vscode obviously for coding, github for version control and tracking my projects. For learning and retention, I keep my notes in remnote cause it automatically makes flashcards and quizzes from my notes. I also use codepen for quick experiments when I want to test something without setting up a whole project.Still got a long way to go but at least now I'm not forgetting everything I learned last week.

But I’ve recently been reading about the job market for ux/ui design (which is my area of interest and eventual job seeking) and have read that the barrier of entry is a lot higher and that AI will be doing a lot of the front-end work for companies. I’m concerned that I’d be wasting my time only focusing on front-end and not have it pay off. I like programming because you have to keep up with emerging technologies and always have to improve. With that said I have some questions:1. Will getting a cs degree actually help me find a job? From what I read on this subreddit it seems like everybody recommends that you have a degree to stand out and land a job. 2. Should I continue my self study and switch to a full stack learning program to stand out? (Which I’m seriously considering) And if I do what additional learning should I do? I’ve read on here that DSA is something that companies look for when hiring, should I add that to things I should study? What projects should I create that will help me stand out to companies when I feel competent enough in my skills? (Again under the assumption I switched to full stack) I welcome all feedback!

1qbu5z8,Interested in learning to code for the purposes of career pivot but only have an old laptop w linux. What are my options?,Crapahedron,learnprogramming,"I'm a manual QA who is interested in learning to code with the purposes of moving out of QA and into a jr role (eventually. I know it's a long game.) My unit is going to be downsizing over the next year or two as our automation platforms increase in scope weening out the need for largescale manual testers. This will be the second time I'm going to get downsized out in replacement for devs. I want to avoid going through this cycle a third time, so I'm making it a priority to start learning development so perhaps I can move into something a little more stable longterm. (Let's pretend AI isn't a thing at the moment.) Here's the issue: I don't really own any personal computers. I've always had work issued machines, and I can't use it for personal projects. What I do have is an old thinkpad (I'm talking really old.) I've since swapped the old harddrive out and replaced it with an SSD and doubled the ram so it's at least functional... I then installed Ubuntu on it. With legacy hardware such as this (it's a thinkpad x220 from 2011....that keyboard tho!) what are my actual options? I know I won't be building native iOS apps on this brick.... but what are some domains I could actually consider working towards some subject matter learning? Coming from a windows only work environment, I'm actually very excited to work in a *unix environment proper. Here are things I'm interested in:* Ruby / Rails (ruby is so funky)* Webdev in general (html/css/js + framework of choice)* C development / OS dev / Kernel Dev (out of my league difficulty wise but probably the most doable on legacy linux machine)* infosec / security (I can mangle this laptop, nobody will care.)* stretch option: windows app dev with c# and visual studioI'm very curious about programs like The Odin project for one of the first two points. Looking through it, its interesting that it forces you to use git and pull down and push up your work into a github repo which is FANTASTIC to replicate a real life workflow. I really don't like writing in the browser based editor for freecodecamp (though, it might migrate me to an editor later in the program I dunno)Given that linux is a brand new thing to me, I'm finding it to be an amazing environment to move around in. It's just so fascinating. It would be a good place to learn C because I'm not afraid of blowing up the machine by messing with a kernel file or something. (I have ubuntu on a bootable USB and can full wipe/install in about 20 minutes)AS someone who only has cursory domain knowledge of these areas of interest, there are likely things I'm not fully aware of, or considering when making a decision.

1qd6me9,Looking for algorithm ideas to solve engineering routing problem (battery connections): extremely constrained grouping + routing problem,Green_Bee1235,learnprogramming,"Hi all — I’m looking for help thinking about a problem that’s well outside what I normally work on. I don’t have a strong background in search / constraint solving / routing algorithms, so explanations at a conceptual or introductory level are very welcome.This link should show the geometry of the problem and some attempts I made with explanations of why I rejected them, but hopefully the problem makes sense without it.

I don't **KNOW** that there exists a solution with the constraints I've set forth but i think there probably should be. If anyone can show that there cannot exist a solution for some reason and suggest alternate constraints that most closely match what I have while having a solution that would be appreciated too.# What I’m asking for* Is this a known class of problem (or combination of problems)? I've looked at a number of approaches but none of them seem to fully encapsulate the problem.* Are there standard algorithmic approaches or heuristics for problems like this?* Is this usually approached with backtracking, graph search, maze-routing ideas, constraint programming, or something else?* Are there examples of similar problems (even outside batteries) that might be good references?I’m not (necessarily) looking for a turnkey solution (though if i was provided with a simple answer I would not be upset) I’m trying to understand **how people normally reason about and structure problems like this** so I can move in a productive direction.This kind of combinatorial / routing problem is *not* what I usually work on, so I may not know the right terminology or standard methods. If you have suggestions, explanations, or even “you should look up X” pointers, I’d really appreciate it.Thanks for reading, and I’m happy to clarify details if needed.",7,0.9,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qd6me9/looking_for_algorithm_ideas_to_solve_engineering/,2026-01-15 01:59:49,2026-01-18 01:58:17

1qduo1k,Design problem: grouping raw punch events into overlapping shifts,MERAKtaneous,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone, I’m running into a time-based data processing problem and would love some design advice.I have two modules: one imports raw punch events from biometric machines (just employee ID + timestamp), and the other lets me define shifts. Using these, I try to figure out which shift an employee worked, whether they were late, overtime, etc. Day shifts work perfectly fine, but night shifts and overlapping shifts are causing issues.Shifts are very flexible: some start early, others late, many cross midnight, and some overlap. Because of this, grouping punches by calendar day doesn’t work. Processing is done by a scheduled job that must run at a specific time. The problem is that at that moment, some shifts are still in progress while others are starting, which leads to incomplete or incorrect grouping—for example, a punch during a night shift might be interpreted as a full shift or a very short one.I’m looking for a general approach to assign raw timestamped events to shifts when shifts can overlap or be incomplete at processing time.

1qattkj,Do you ever feel like recruiters are the reason you are not able to get your dream job?,CommandGrand1484,cscareerquestions,"The number of jobs in the past few years has definitely gone down and it is far more difficult to get an interview call today.But on the other hand, I have been rejected without an interview call from jobs that I would be a perfect fit. I have exactly the skills they want. And at times, it feels like it's these recruiters who are making the decisions on who is a good fit for the job or not. They call you, discuss with you and write some notes for the hiring manager. And the hiring manager sometimes blindly trusts the notes that the recruiter is giving them.For example: 1. I told a recruiter I have 6 years of experience in Java. Then her immediate question was ""How many years of experience do you have in ExpressJS"". I said I am not that experienced in Javascript/typescript. To which she responded with ""But you said you have 6 years of experience in Java"". This was one of those job postings that are really vague and don't specify which programming language experience they want. ""Need to have at least 5 years of experience in a modern programming language like Java, Golang, Rust or Javascript/Python"". I applied for the job and had the first screening call with the recruiter.2. Another time I had a call with a recruiter who asked me what I was doing. I told them that I am working in ARM there is an open source library called DPDK, people use it to be networking stacks in userspace. I am working on bench-marking some of the functionality of that library on ARM processors. We are trying to change some of the functionality of that library to use Arm Neon SIMD instructions.She let me blabber on for like 15 mins and then she said ""Alright I need you to repeat everything you told me so far. I need to write notes for the hiring manager"". I sighed and then started repeating everything. And then the second time around she is like ""What is a library?"". ""What is ARM?"". ""Does ARM make processors?"". ""What does it mean that you are optimizing code in a library? Are you a Frontend engineer or a backend engineer?"".At that point, I was like let me write those notes for you. And she was like I need to write these notes myself. And then out of politeness I said ""Look I am not a native English speaker. Let me type out some text for you. You can copy that into your notes. I am not that good at verbal communication."" This was around the point in the call where she asked me to explain to her what SIMD instructions are. She declined that offer.And after the call, I got rejected. This was specifically for a job that required people with experience in ARM Neon.Sometimes I wish I could directly talk to the hiring manager or a software engineer in the team.

I think I was kind of still warm and fuzzy from being glazed so much that I just kind of immediately said yes (also in my experience when someone higher up, asked you to do something you say yes, that’s just kind of the way I’ve gotten as far as I have in my career, it sucks, but it’s paid off for me). He also mentioned that by accepting this, I was not allowed to hand code anything, I had to “fully embrace, vibe coding“ whatever that means. I also managed two other teams, that work on five other products and when I asked this individual “ what’s gonna happen there?” he basically was like “ you’ll pretty much be able to do this on the side!” :flushed_face:Basically, since then, I have pulled down the code and it’s a absolute mess, aside from the fact that the performance is utterly atrocious and it’s extremely slow and unintuitive, the code is literally a trash fire pile of AI generated slop. Absolutely no organization, insane architectural decisions that for the sake of anonymity, I won’t go into. And overall, just like an insane volume of code that it would take a human being a very very very, very, very, very, very long time to read through and understand even half of it.All the while I’ve been trying to make heads or tails of the code base the executives keep pushing 1 million commits a day, they are like rejoicing in their slack channel. They are so over the moon that finally they can just build whatever they want. Ironically they don’t see the pattern that every time they push something they report a bug or report something else being broken, but I’m also not banking on them noticing that pattern.They keep making remarks about how companies that aren’t doing exactly what they’re doing right now are going to fail. They keep making remarks that they finally solved the puzzle. It’s becoming clear that they do not value software engineers and they’ve got it all figured out, from their perspective.I’m not really sure what to do here, I have a product manager that has been tapped to product manage this and we had a call today where we were basically”WTF is going on”. We have a meeting next week to level set, but I’m just kind of anxious for the outcome of that part of me kinda just wants to say in the most professional way possible “ I don’t know what you guys really need me for it seems like you’ve got it figured out and if you don’t mind, I’d like to focus on my day-to-day tasks”.Like gun to my head, I think the idea of shipping this to customers is suicidal for our company. It’s an insane amount of code that no one really understands what’s going on, which means the only person that can effectively fix bugs is Claude and I’ve heard horror stories of Claude really not being able to handle big projects.I just don’t know what to do because I feel like if I was trusting my gut, I would say let’s slow down and talk about what we actually want to build, take some time to actually pass through the code and make sure that we’re making smart choices. But I just know that that would be met with such resentment and distain. I feel like this is a group of individuals that is so angry that for so long people that know what is going on have gotten in the way of what they want, which is more more more now now now.Has anyone else experience this?

The ceo even undercut that criticism by saying i certaintly could do my job better and look even if it was perfect I dont think it would effect this decision. Its just the stage were in and if this project were to ever pick back up we would love to you have you back. he said he thought the world of me and said i should know hes not the type to mince words but he said he would give a recommendation to whoever. My manager was all quiet in the corner and kinda just said he echoed what the ceo said and just said at this stage of the development we expected to be in a certain spot and it didnt happen.(I almost took that as a personal critique but idk its just raw right now). Apparently they made the decision during christmas but didnt want to tell me until now. I told them I would just walk out quietly at the end of the day(we only had 10 minutes left.) they both seemed genuinely sad but idk I expected my manager to say more knowing he knew but he was just tucked away quiet. Anyway im ranting but I guess thats just the nature of these types of jobs I guess. I kinda saw it coming when we were burning money and they couldnt get people fully on board with the beta. I just feel kinda used.Just kinda wanted some advice on what jobs are more stable. Ive literally done product oriented jobs with a established product. Consulting and now a start up.

Ended up getting a job at a FANG company straight out of college. Left the FANG company for a startup that offered double the pay. But got laid off after almost 2 years on the job. Then, I decided to do independent contracting, which lead me to being hired by staffing agency to contract for the same FANG company that I left. My contract ended in December. The recruiter from the staffing agency offered me another job interview for a different company. I got the job offer, cleared the background check, and was cleared to start in January.The recruiter called to serve me bad news. They stated the job wasn’t approved for budget by the executives. Now, I’m left scrambling for a job. I’m fatigued, drained, and sad. I can’t stop crying about all the hurdles I have to experience just for a career. I no longer feel like applying myself in tech. 1.

1qb477w,"Insulted by my company's ""Promotion"" and now I am wondering what I should do.",YoureHottCupcake,cscareerquestions,"Hey y'all, I just got off the phone with my boss with my promotion details and I just need some help figuring out what I should do, because their offer was quite insulting.My company back in November asked if I would do a trial run to be the new Technical Lead for my team since my current one was leaving, this trial run would last two months. So its January and I just got off a call with my company where I was told they like me in this role and are giving me the title and a pay raise to go with it. However, the pay raise was only 7k a year, my total pay is now 85k a year for a technical lead position. I have people below me in this position that make more than I do. Not only is the pay way less than I expected, but my company had a job posting for a Technical Lead where the listed salary was 120k, which is still low but 35k more than I was offered. I feel incredibly insulted by the offer they gave me.I have a few thoughts on what I should do:1. I am thinking about messaging them back and asking for either 130k a year or my old role back. The extra work from the role is worth way more than 7k extra a year, so if I can't get more pay I would rather just be in an individual contributor role and not leadership.2. Or take the offer and try and job hop as soon as I can. While the pay sucks the title is good and could help me land a new role somewhere ill actually get paid well.With that said I am not really in a position to lose this job unless I have something else lined up and while I have been looking for a new role already, I haven't had much luck at all with the market being so bad. I would hope the new title would help, but I am unsure with that. So what do you think I should do? Any advice is appreciated.EDIT: I forgot to add that I never really wanted this role either, the only reason I accepted it to begin with is because I thought it would have nice pay and my family and I could purchase a home. Now it just feels like a role I don't like and the pay sucks, this is why I might ask for my old role back.EDIT 2: I have 6 YOE as a developer almost half of which is with this company. My title before this promotion was junior developer so the jump is pretty significant and why I was expecting my pay to have a significant jump as well.EDIT 3: This is my final update, I spoke with my company and got an extra 10k added to my salary. Its still not where I would like to be but it is better at least. I will probably stick it out another year to have a full year with the title then I will bounce to somewhere that will pay me more.

Most of my interviews have been for analyst and analytics engineer roles though.Lately, interviews themselves haven't been the issue. I'm consistently making it to final rounds, and the feedback has actually been positive. Stuff like great culture fit, strong skillset, asks the right questions, etc. No glaring red flags. But… I keep getting rejected at the very end. Usually it's the classic: ""The other candidate had more experience with X tool"" or ""We went with someone with a PhD."" Sometimes, it'll be ""The role was closed due to budget."" I'm honestly getting a bit jaded. I don't think I've ever had this hard of a time and it feels like there are way more interview rounds now than when I first started my career.What's stressing me out more is my personal situation.

Called “Today, I did it.” Basically enter within a field different activities you did for the day, run that though an ai api to quantify that action in numbers and spit it back out. There’s a daily meter/quota to fill and maybe some kind of currency that can be used to buy trophies (not sure yet). It definitely aligns with how I feel today, because I’ve been in a mental standstill for a long time now, and trying to push throughI guess my ultimate questions are:1. What are my options on getting back on my feet?2. Is programming completely out of the question at this point?3. What fields could I possibly pivot to with a computer science degree?4.

This team is entirely focused on replacing an existing internal platform within the company and I've been stuck on doing mindless CRUD work for the entire 2+ years I've been working. The product is essentially created out of a war started between two directors who disagreed on the current approach of the platform at the company.Besides the messy team origins, my biggest difficulty has been gaining a deeper domain knowledge and be able to insert myself into key initiatives. I'm not sure if it's bad luck or just me not being smart about which work I pick up, but I somehow always end up taking tasks that don't help me to stand out or make a huge noticeable impact. Our team suffers from very poorly written stories and constantly unclear product requirements so it tends to be a roulette when taking on work for the sprint.Additionally, sometimes seniors and tech leads are secluded from ad hoc conversations that happen between leadership, so requirements get changed on the fly at times or critical information is missed leading to mistakes and constant miscommunication of requirements.Regardless, I screwed up during these few years and couldn't make a name for myself within my org. I've missed my chance to work on more impactful projects and take ownership on bigger features. I've fallen into the state of being a feature monkey and don't see myself going forward any further nor do I think it's worth as several engineers and managers have already begun leaving my org.This experience has made me question whether I should even bother continuing engineering as a career. I'm starting to think I'll be capped as a junior / mid level engineer due to my inability to play the game right. I already feel so behind compared to my peers and have really nothing impressive to talk about in interviews in terms of feature ownership.Overall, working at corporate has started to make me dislike development and I have no motivation or energy to upskill or tackle side projects anymore. I'm pretty lost as for what to do at this point as no team is willing to hire internally and my current endeavors for external opportunities has been absolutely awful.

1qe5sth,Failed Amazon Final Loop - my experience,MemoryNeat7381,cscareerquestions,"This was for Delivery Consultant. My understanding, is that it's like a consulting arm of AWS where consultant go to clients and act as temporary employees more or less.Have 5YOE, been out of work for a year. Just got the AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification and then applied to the role. 2 months ago, contacted by recruiter after applcation and passed OA. My recruiter asked me to prep 10 STAR stories as well as LeetCode and to wait 3 weeks before scheduling the phone screen which I thought was overkill, but could appreciate that she wanted me to be as prepped as possible. Phone screen was with a chill friendly guy I believe one of the hiring managers for this department. We did 1 STAR with some follow ups, as well as a AWS system design problem which went over smoothly, and then a basic coding challenge which was easy to complete. He hinted that I would be moving forward, which I did 2 days later. Scheduled the final loop for a month right after the holidays.1st interview guy seemed chill and only asked LPs. Ended 15 min early.2nd interview, was with a woman who at end informed me she was not part of this department (so the bar raiser), had a friendly introduction. Again, only LPs where she did some follow up, but no hardcore grilling. Ended about 20 minutes early.3rd interview, was the hiring manager who also did only LPs with me. Again follow ups which I answered, but was prepared for. Halfway through the interview, she all of a sudden asks, you have experience working in small teams, but tell me about roles with big teams and organizations. I was a little off guard and asked if we were still doing the STAR format. She said if I wanted to. I gave a brief story about 3 years of my experience working at a large telecomm comapny (which I already answered with STAR stories from), and mentioned about the dozens of teams I interacted with, and how I worked in a major lift and shift project with microservices with over 50 services and 200 people. She went on and said how as an L5 they were looking for someone with experience leading large organizations, etc. even though at the beginning she said the role varies a lot (startups, large companies, short term and long term contracts) She then asked me the final LP. I asked if she wanted as story from the telecomm company. She glared at the screen and sharply answered ""sure"". I wasn't sure if this was hostility, or her following interview protocol, but I just mentioned I didnt have any stories left that I havent told her or answer that question, so I talked about one from my 1st job at a 6 person startup. At the end, she did a q and a, and then just said my recruiter would be the point of contact from now on. Again, didnt really read into it, but everyone else just mentioned ""oh, you got 3 interviews left, good luck"" or somethign like that. Ended 20 min early.4th interview next day, was friendly guy who did 1 LP, followed by some Leetcode. The coding was quite easy (easy/medium) and didn't really have much issues other than some syntax (like making sure 'self' was used when setting up the function). He was friendly and enthusiastic about me getting the optimal solutions. Ended on time.5th interview the following day was chill guy who did a few LP in the first half. The second half was a barrage of questions in sytem design. I got maybe 75% of them, especially the ones I remember from my SA Pro cert. The ones I didn't, he assured me it was ok, nobody gets them all. But who knows, maybe I missed some that I shouldn't have. We only had a minute left at the end for q and a, but he was willing to stay a bit overtime to answer questions for me.Next day, get the automated reject email. If I were to guess, it might have somethign to do with the 3rd interview with the hiring manager. From what I've read, most people feel they do well on their LPs, but who knows, maybe I didn't. I prepped the 10 STAR stories, and didn't reuse them for the same interviewer, but maybe I needed more across all of them? Researching, I've heard varying opinions. Finally, I dunno if I was just outclassed by another candidate or an internal candidate I don't know about. Just a bit down since I spent 2 months prepping LeetCode and refining and rehearsing my STAR stories.",24,0.82,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qe5sth/failed_amazon_final_loop_my_experience/,2026-01-16 04:06:03,2026-01-18 01:58:18

1qbc38w,What's next if you no longer want to code?,FinishTheBucket,cscareerquestions,"I would like to preface this by acknowledging that I'm in a fairly privileged position and I don't want this to sound like I'm not grateful for it. I've been working as a full stack engineer uninterrupted since early 2019. I started at a major US bank, went to a streaming service and now I'm working in ecommerce for a mid-major regional retailer; I don't think I'm anywhere near being a 10X whiz kid dev but I've never had anything less than Above Average ratings on performance reviews and I would say I'm generally perceived as competent at the least. My problem comes in that none of these jobs, tasks or projects have given me anything close to resembling satisfaction. I think I've come to realize that while I like solving problems, building tools for people to use and seeing all the cool things we can do, I don't like basically everything else that makes up our jobs as engineers. I don't find joy in upgrading Node versions or repositioning a button to increase customer retention; optimizing our add to cart functions feels like a waste of time to me when it already works and we see no impact on metrics in the slightest. I have trouble bringing myself to care about code coverage in tests for features that no one actually wants and likely only a handful of folks will ever use. I exercise, I eat enough, I drink water and pay my bills on time but I can't imagine myself doing this for the next thirty years of my life. So what's the ""escape plan""? I've considered going back to school for an MBA but having spoken to many consultants who have taken that path I don't think it's for me. For a while I also looked at going back for a Masters in CS but that felt like a great way to further pigeon hole myself into only being seen as Guy Who Codes. It also seems silly to just move laterally and become a pure 'product/manager' person who comes up with or supervises the new features that bum me out so much to build. Speaking to folks older than me, the common advice is go speak with a career counselor but the two experiences I've had with them reminded me far too much of those quizzes you had to take in middle school that suggested career paths. This forum has helped me out a lot in the past by giving good feedback, tough love, and even just hearing that others are in the same boat so I come to y'all hat in hand wondering - am I crazy for feeling like this? How does one take these skills into some other direction? Is the best advice here to just suck it up and double down on my hobbies, finding joy outside of work?

1qbb5z0,Some Tips For New Grads and Job Search in General,AccomplishedSea8675,cscareerquestions,"Strategy for Applying and How to get More Responses:* Do apply to any and all big companies. This includes Big Tech (tech companies such as Google, Datadog, OpenAI, FAANG etc.) but also includes big non-tech companies (think Walmart, Target, Ford, Epic to a certain extent). However, be prepared to never get responses from these. The conversion rate of responses from these is a lot lower than other companies. This is due to both the amount of people applying, you applying later than other people (they may just only look at the first X number of applications), but also the amount of company leadership, direction, and planning changes that are typical with these big companies (these are expected). You may not get a response and that may mean nothing with your resume or applications. Which leads us to...* Apply to startups and / or small businesses. There are a lot of startups out there that may benefit from your specific experience or skills. Where do you find these though? ycombinator, workatastartup, builtinnyc, wellfound are good places to start. More than applying, here is where you might need to ""network"". Look at the founders, look at the people working there. Referrals here are a lot more helpful than in Big Tech companies, because things at smaller companies are a lot more personal and less automated. This is how I found my early-stage startup job. So you might want to look at founders / early employees; see if you have any connections on LinkedIn or went to the same school. See if you have any secondary connections. Reach out to people. Even if not, you can cold message on LinkedIn. You may not get a lot of responses. That's ok / expected. * Startups are less cyclical in their hiring, meaning they may hire at random times / year round / for the right person / after fundraises. My experiences:* Have gone through extensive job searches 3X. This helped a ton. Each cycle required 300-700 apps each. Got a random job in 1, an early stage startup the 2nd time, Big Tech the 3rd time.* Anecdotal evidence: Applying with or without a cover letter does not seem to matter in my case, at least it didn't in my experience. The places I got interviews I didn't use a cover letter.* For startups, things are a lot more informal... even cold reached out to someone on LinkedIn (alum from my school) once to ask about their experience at their startup, and it turned into an interview lol (for which I got to the final round). They didn't even have a position open, but were willing to hire for the right engineer.* Have gotten Amazon, Datadog offers (and currently work at Datadog)",17,0.82,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qbb5z0/some_tips_for_new_grads_and_job_search_in_general/,2026-01-12 23:36:16,2026-01-18 01:58:18

1qby1e7,Feels like I'm stagnating at 3.5 YOE looking for advice on where to go next,jack3chu,cscareerquestions,"I'm at just about 3.5 YOE, making $95k at a non-tech, but large company (S&P 500) that feels like a pretty stable position. It's low stress, fully remote, and I like who I'm working with. But I'm itching for more. I don't feel particularly challenged here and I want to learn and use newer technologies and keep my skills sharp. I struggle with burnout often so I have no drive to build personal projects after my work day. I feel like the burnout could be fixed by moving to a job that interests me more, where I'm working on more exciting things.This job is safe, I'm set to get a promotion soon, but it doesn't have the growth potential I'm striving for, and it's getting kind of boring. I'm hungry for more exciting work and better compensation. I know it's possible to be paid double or triple what I'm currently making at my experience level elsewhere (I get that this sub is skewed but still, those higher salaries exist). Off the bat I don't expect a crazy pay boost, but I at least want to set myself up to get there. And, with the job market not so great, I don't expect to just suddenly will myself into a new job which is why I'm looking for advice. I frankly suck at leetcode and I haven't interviewed anywhere since getting my first job 3.5 years ago. Do I just have to take the next few months to grind out LC questions and hope to get good? Should I start looking and applying now or later? I don't use LinkedIn, do I really need to build a profile to land a better position or am I ok without it?

My only experience is 5 YOE at a well known media company and took 2 years off to do a bunch of thru-hikes and work on my mental health. I'm currently looking to get back into it and am now learning about how bad the job market is...not sure how much of that is doom and gloom mentality and how much of it is reality. I'm in NYC if that makes any difference.I did full stack at my old job, mostly with React and Node.js, along with mostly AWS services. Since I've only interviewed when I first started, I don't have a lot of experience interviewing and don't know what to expect nowadays. I've been studying full time mostly DSA and system design for the past two months and feel like I'm almost there with that. I'm thinking there will also be some live coding implementations that I'm going to incorporate more into my studies. Curious if anyone has good exercises or resources regarding what companies expect for the implementation round. Looking for insights on what to expect and resources outside of DSA/system design.

1qdrrse,I have a live coding session for round 2 at a large company and I am terrifid,plexto,cscareerquestions,"So long story short, I just recently graduated and have been working as an intern/contractor for a company for about 2 years now. I don’t think my company I work for now will be able to hire me due to a hiring freeze so I am applying to other jobs. I just recently did a pre screen interview with a recruiter from a big company that I was shocked even reached out to me as I hear nothing, and I passed that. The next step is a technical interview. I was told it will consist of 1-2 DSA medium questions which will be a majority of the interview, followed by some potentially light fundamental questions and talking about my background. I have no problem talking about my background, but the live coding really terrifies me. This is my first ever technical interview as my current company doesn’t do them. I feel the stakes are extra high because of how bad the market is, and the pay is very high. My DSA skills are horrid as is, and the idea of having to narrate live what I’m doing without going silent for too long and then receiving follow up questions makes me think there’s no chance I pass. I guess this post is more of venting than seeing assistance, but I guess I’m looking for some advice.

1qd1cy2,Company Emphasizes LLM Usage,Psycho351,cscareerquestions,"Please redirect me if my post should not be here. Roughly a week ago I interviewed with a company over an onsite entry level SWE role. The role requires me to relocate, they did not provide compensation but swears it is generous if given the role. Whether or not I receive the offer, I do not know how to reflect on my experience post-interview. The “interview” was not technical, but seemed to be more vibes-based. An emphasis on culture I suppose, but not necessarily triggering any alarm bells in my head. The description notes a requirement for prior LLM-usage/experience. I’m not against AI-assisted coding, but I do not like vibe coding. If you do it, cool, but it’s not for me. I’m worried that’s what they want from me. The job is advertised as just mostly prompting, and then cleaning up the output, and I’m not sure if this is common practice nowadays. I know this isn’t a new approach for a company to adopt, but if I get the role it will be my first FT SWE position barring an internship I had a couple years prior. Given this, I want to ensure this is a role I can grow in and actually learn. Another thing they emphasize is how they want to go all-in on AI. I’m no doomer, but I do think a bubble will pop at some point, and I don’t want to be left on the short end of the stick here. Do any of you have jobs like this? What is it like? Is it worth moving across the country for if compensated fairly? In all honesty, the job description read like a joke to me and the interview was extremely simple. If I get no offer I’ll probably be offended lol. But if I do get one, I’m not even sure if it’s the right choice.

1qafxa7,"Do Agents Turn us into ""Tactical Tornadoes?""",ewheck,cscareerquestions,"I'm reading John Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design* and Chapter 3's discussion of the ""tactical tornado"" led me to think about how we use LLMs and agents in our profession. The relevant section of the book goes as follows:>Most programmers approach software development with a mindset I call tactical programming. In the tactical approach, your main focus is to get something working, such as a new feature or a bug fix. At first glance this seems totally reasonable: what could be more important than writing code that works? However, tactical programming makes it nearly impossible to produce a good system design.>The problem with tactical programming is that it is short-sighted. If you’re programming tactically, you’re trying to finish a task as quickly as possible. \[...\]>Almost every software development organization has at least one developer who takes tactical programming to the extreme: a *tactical tornado*. The tactical tornado is a prolific programmer who pumps out code far faster than others but works in a totally tactical fashion. When it comes to implementing a quick feature, nobody gets it done faster than the tactical tornado. In some organizations, management treats tactical tornadoes as heroes. However, tactical tornadoes leave behind a wake of destruction. They are rarely considered heroes by the engineers who must work with their code in the future. Typically, other engineers must clean up the messes left behind by the tactical tornado, which makes it appear that those engineers (who are the real heroes) are making slower progress than the tactical tornado.I do not work at a company that has widely adopted the usage of agents (a handful of people in my department have access to Devin), but I have noticed most pro-agent discourse revolves around how you can improve the speed of development and ship faster. From the passage I quoted, it seems like speed of development is not considered a universal good by all and focusing on it can have drawbacks.Since I do not have the experience to comment on this, my question for those who have heavily adopted the usage of agents themselves (or work on teams where many others have) is have you seen any of these negative outcomes whatsoever? Have you experienced any increase in system complexity that may have been easier to avoid had you iterated more slowly?Ousterhout's alternative to tactical programming is strategic programming:>The first step towards becoming a good software designer is to realize that **working code isn’t enough**. It’s not acceptable to introduce unnecessary complexities in order to finish your current task faster. The most important thing is the long-term structure of the system. Most of the code in any system is written by extending the existing code base, so your most important job as a developer is to facilitate those future extensions. Thus, you should not think of “working code” as your primary goal, though of course your code must work. Your primary goal must be to produce a great design, which also happens to work. This is *strategic programming*.When I see the power users discuss how they operate with several different instances of Claude working concurrently, I can't help but think that it would be nearly impossible to work with a ""strategic"" mindset at that level. So again, a question for those who have adopted this practice, do you attempt to stay strategic when basically automating the code-writing? As an example of what I'm asking, if you feed an agent a user story to implement, do you also try to ensure the generated code will easily facilitate future extensions to what you are working on apart from the user story itself? If so, what does that process look like for you?",8,0.7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qafxa7/do_agents_turn_us_into_tactical_tornadoes/,2026-01-12 00:22:42,2026-01-18 01:58:18
