1rdv80s,"Am I missing something with all this ""agent"" hype?",KindTeaching3250,dataengineering,"I'm a data engineer in energy trading. Mostly real-time/time-series stuff. Kafka, streaming pipelines, backfills, schema changes, keeping data sane. The data I maintain doesn't hit PnL directly, but it feeds algo trading, so if it's wrong or late, someone feels it.I use AI a lot. ChatGPT for thinking through edge cases, configs, refactors. Copilot CLI for scaffolding, repetitive edits, quick drafts. It's good. I'm definitely faster.What I don't get is the vibe at work lately.People are running around talking about how many agents they're running, how many tokens they burned, autopilot this, subagents that, some useless additions to READMEs that only add noise. It's like we've entered some weird productivity cosplay where the toolchain is the personality.In practice, for most of my tasks, a good chat + targeted use of Copilot is enough. The hard part of my job is still chaining a bunch of moving pieces together in a way that's actually safe. Making sure data flows don't silently corrupt something downstream, that replays don't double count, that the whole thing is observable and doesn't explode at 3am. So am I missing something? Are people actually getting real, production-grade leverage from full agent setups? Or is this just shiny-tool syndrome and everyone trying to look ""ahead of the curve""?Genuinely curious how others are using AI in serious data systems without turning it into a religion. On top of that, I'm honestly fed up with LI/X posts from AI CEOs forecasting the total slaughter of software and data jobs in the next X months - like, am I too dumb to see how it actually replaces me or am I just stressing too much with no reason?",298,0.98,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rdv80s/am_i_missing_something_with_all_this_agent_hype/,2026-02-24 22:37:48,2026-02-27 02:09:05
1rdqsaz,My experience with DE Academy’s “job guarantee” program (1-year review),Hour-Yesterday-6197,dataengineering,"I wanted to share my experience for anyone considering DE Academy’s data engineering program with the job guarantee.I enrolled in February 2025 under a one-year agreement. The contract stated they would apply to 5–25 jobs per day on my behalf and provide unlimited support (mock interviews, Slack, coaching, etc.).In practice, that’s not what I experienced. The daily job applications were inconsistent, and access to some of the “unlimited” support resources wasn’t always available when needed.I stayed in the program for the full year and remained engaged throughout. By the end of the guarantee period:* I did not receive a data engineering job offer* My refund request under the guarantee was denied* I now have a one-year gap in my professional timeline due to participation in the programBased on my experience, I do not recommend doing business with them.

1rag36f,Red flag! Red flag? White flag!,Street_Importance_74,dataengineering,"I am a Senior Manager in Data Engineering. Conducted a third round assessment of a potential candidate today. This was a design session. Candidate had already made it through HR, behavioral and coding. This was the last round. Found my head spinning. It was obvious to me that the candidate was using AI to answer the questions. The CV and work experience were solid. The job role will be heavy use of AI as well. The candidate was still very strong. You could tell the candidate was pulling some from personal experience but relying on AI to give us almost verbatim copy cat answers. How do I know? Because I used AI to help create the damn questions and fine tune the answers. Of course I did. When I realized, my gut reaction was a ""no"". The longer it went on, I wondered if it would be more of a red flag if this candidate wasn't using AI during the assessment. Then I realized I had to have a fundamental shift in how I even think about assessing candidates. Similar to the shift I have had to have on assuming any video I see is fake. I started thinking, if I was asking math problems and the person wasn't using a calculator, what would I think?I ultimately examined the situation, spoke with her other assesers, my mentors, and had to pass on the candidate. But boy did it get me flustered. Stuff is changing so fast and the way we have to think about absolutely everything is fundamentally changing.

1rbk3ov,New CTO has joined and is ignoring me,anxiouscrimp,dataengineering,"Keen for any thoughts or feedback.Background - I’ve worked at my current employer, a mid-sized luxury retailer. We turn over about £200m annually. I’m the sole BI architect and have been for the last 5 years or so. I’ve been with the company for 11 years. I do everything - requirements, building out the data warehouse, building and maintaining the cubes, some SSRS development. In the last two years I’ve designed and built a new ELT framework for us to move away from SSIS and integrate to all of our various disparate systems - ERP, CRM, GA4, digital marketing platforms etc etc. Then I’ve cleaned all of this data, modelled it and built a PBI semantic model on top to bring everything together. That’s the first (and biggest) phase of replacing our existing estate.Challenge - I had a very good relationship with our previous CTO. Now a new CTO (a contractor) has joined and he seems to be completely ignoring me. We’ve barely had any interaction. He’s worked with GCP in the past and immediately has set up meetings with a google partner. In the first meeting they opened with ‘so we understand that you’ve got a very fractured data estate with no single source of truth’ which is just totally untrue. But this CTO seems to have no interest in engaging with me in the slightest and I’m hearing from other people that he just wants to ‘move us to bigquery’. We’re entirely on Microsoft for everything - not just BI - so this is an enormous piece of work without a clear benefit. In my opinion the issues we have are generally people based - not enough people and certainly not enough people translating data into something actionable or understandable. I’m open to the idea of moving some or part of our estate to GCP - but shouldn’t such a large move like this be considered in the context of ‘what problem are we trying to solve?’I’m feeling pretty upset - I’ve given a lot to this company over the years and this behaviour feels disrespectful and weird. I’m keen to hear from anyone if they’ve seen this behaviour in the past and how to approach it. At the moment my plan is to write a document outlining our current data estate for him to read and then talk him through. Obviously I’ll also update my CV.TLDR: new contract CTO has joined and is ignoring and sidelining me. He seems very intent on moving us to GCP despite not really understanding any of our actual challenges. Why is he doing this? Is this a strategy?",132,0.92,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rbk3ov/new_cto_has_joined_and_is_ignoring_me/,2026-02-22 12:00:41,2026-02-27 02:09:05

How do I navigate the title conversation.",Proof_Box_2548,dataengineering,"Senior DE at a large (ish) retail company, pre-IPO. Team of 4, I own the platform architecture and all vendor relationships. My manager has the title but zero technical involvement.The highlight reel:\- Presented a migration to the CTO that saves six figures annually. Built the entire business case, ran the pilot, did the presentation. Manager sat in the room and said nothing. CTO: ""amazing job.""\- I run two vendor negotiations. Manager delegated the business case writing to me, then won't sign off. One is a \~$20K/year tool well within his budget. He still escalates to the CTO for permission.\- A credit card registration (literally 2 minutes) for an approved migration took 10+ days. When I nudged him on a CTO-visible thread, he pulled me aside and made it clear he didn't appreciate being called out in front of leadership. The tone was... not great.\- His weekly updates to leadership? Written by us. He copy-pastes our summaries.\- Forgot to process my contractually agreed bonus. Twice.

If you got promoted past your manager, title first or reporting change at the same time?3. When your manager starts getting defensive or hostile because they feel their position threatened, how seriously do you take that?4.

1rdf9gk,"Dev, test and prod in data engineering. How common and when to use?",No-Buy-3530,dataengineering,"Greetings fellow data engineers!I once again ask you for your respectable opinions. A couple of days ago had a conversation with a software engineering colleague about providing a table that I had created in prod. But he needed it in test. And it occured to me that I have absolutely no idea how to give this to him, and that our entire system is SQL server on prem, SQL server Agent Jobs - all run directly in prod. The concept of test or dev for anything analytics facing is essentially non-existent and has always been this way it seems in the organisation. Now, this made me question my assumptions of why this is. The SQL is versioned and the structure of the data is purely medallion. But no dev/test prod. I inquired AI about this seeming misalignment, and it gave me a long story of how data engineering evolved differently, for legacy systems its common to be directly in prod, but that modern data engineering is evolving in trying to apply these software engineering principles more forcefully. I can absolutely see the use case for it, but in my tenure, simply havent encountered it anywhere. Now, I want my esteemed peers experiences. **How does this look like out there ""in the wild"". What are our opinions, the pros and cons, and the nature of how this trend is developing.** This is a rare black box for me, and would greatly appreciate some much needed nuance. Love this forum!

We decided to slowly move away from redshift to something more modern.Now after 6 months I'm half way through, a lot of things work well. A lot of people also left the company due to restructuring including head of bi, leaving me with virtually no managers and (with help of an analyst) covering what the head was doing previously.Now we got a high-ranked analyst from the larger company, and I got the following from him: ""ok, so I created this SQL script for my dashboard, how do I schedule it in datagrip?"" While there are a lot of different things wrong with this request, I question myself on the viability of dbt with such technicality of main users of dbt in our current tech stack.

That's not self healing, that's just regular healing with extra steps.I get that there's a spectrum here. Some tools do automatic retries with exponential backoff which is fine but that's just basic error handling not healing. Some claim to handle api changes automatically but I'm skeptical about how well that actually works when a vendor restructures their entire api endpoint. The part I care most about is when a saas vendor changes their api schema or deprecates an endpoint. That's what causes 80% of our breaks.

I've had the wrong focus for a long time and can talk a lot about that.The thing is that you can be a technical expert in a specific stack, but if you can’t manage a seven-figure budget or explain the financial cost of your architecture, you’re just a technician. One bad architectural choice or an unmonitored cloud bill can turn you from an asset into a massive liability.Real seniority comes from becoming a ""load-bearing operator."" This means owning the unit economics of your data, building for long-term stability instead of cleverness, and prioritizing the company's survival over technical ego.I just promoted a data engineer to senior. Worked with her for year until she really started prioritizing ""the other side of the job"".I hope this will help some of you.",28,0.8,4,https://www.datagibberish.com/p/how-to-own-risks-and-boost-your-data-career,2026-02-23 19:51:32,2026-02-27 02:09:05

1ra5zg4,Does database normalization actually reduce redundancy in data?,Lastrevio,dataengineering,"For instance, does a star schema actually reduce redundancy in comparison to putting everything in a flat table? Instead of the fact table containing dimension descriptions, it will just contain IDs with the primary key of the dimension table, the dimension table being the table which gives the ID-description mapping for that specific dimension. In other words, a star schema simply replaces the strings with IDs in a fact table. Adding to the fact that you now store the ID-string mapping in a seperate dimension table, you are actually using more storage, not less storage.This leads me to believe that the purpose of database normalization is not to ""reduce redundancy"" or to use storage more efficiently, but to make updates and deletes easier. If a customer changes their email, you update one row instead of a million rows.The only situation in which I can see a star schema being more space-efficient than a flat table, or in which a snowflake schema is more space-efficient than a star schema, are the cases in which the number of rows is so large that storing n integers + 1 string requires less space than storing n strings.

All my SQL transformations are part of said python scripts.\- I develop/test my scripts on my laptop, then push them to my github repo, and pull them down on the VM where they are scheduled to run\- Total data volume is low, in the 100,000s of rows\- The SQL DB is really more of an expedient sandbox to get done what needs to get done. The main data table gets pulled in from S3 and then transformations happen in place to get it ready for reporting(I know this ain't proper)\- Power BI dashboards and other reporting/ analysis is built off of the tables in AzureEverything works wonderfully and I've been very successful in the role, but I know if this were a larger or faster growing company it would not cut it.

1r9z2o6,Recommendation for small DWH. Thinking Azure SQL?,Quick_Scientist_3605,dataengineering,"I’m 1 week in at a new org and I am pretty much a data team of one. I’ve immediately picked up their current architecture is inefficient. It is an aviation based company, and all data is pulled from a 3rd party SQL server and then fed into Power BI for reporting. When I say “data” I mean isolated (no cardinality) read-only views. This is very compute-intensive so I am thinking it is optimal to just pull data nightly and fed it into a data warehouse we would own. This would also play nice with our other smaller ERP/CRM softwares we need data from.The data jobs are fairly small.. I would say like 20 tables/views with \~5000 rows on average. The question is what data warehouse to use to optimize price and performance. I am thinking Azure SQL server as that looks to be $40-150/mo but wanted to come here to confirm if my suspicion is correct or there are any other tools I am overlooking. As for future scalability considerations… maybe 2x over the next year but even then they are small jobs.

1raf9oj,Spawn: PostgreSQL migration and testing build system with minijinja (not vibe coded!),Winsaucerer,dataengineering,"Hi! Very excited to share my project **spawn**, a DB migration/build system.For now, it supports PostgreSQL via `psql` to create and apply migrations, as well as write golden file tests (I plan to support other db's down the line). It has some innovations that I think make it very useful relative to other options I've tried.**GitHub:** [https://github.com/saward/spawn](https://github.com/saward/spawn)**Docs:** [https://docs.spawn.dev/](https://docs.spawn.dev/)Shout out to minijinja ([https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/)) which has made a lot of the awesomeness possible!Some features (PostgreSQL via `psql` only for now):* Create SQL (for tests or data insertion) from JSON data sources* Store functions/views/data in separate files for easy organisation and editing* `git diff` shows exactly what changed in a function in new migrations* Easy writing of tests for functions/views/triggers* Env-specific variables, so migrations apply test data to dev/local DB targets only* Generate data from JSON files* Macros for easily generating repeatable SQL, and other cool tricks (e.g., view tear-down and re-create)I started this project around two years ago. I’ve finally been able to get it to an MVP state I’m happy with.I created spawn to solve my own personal pain points. The main one was, how to manage updates for things like views and functions? There's a few challenges (and spawn doesn't solve all), but the main one was creating and reviewing the migration. The typical (without spawn) approach is one of:1. Copy function into new migration and edit. This makes PR reviews hard because all you see is a big blob of new changes.2. Repeatable migrations. This breaks old migrations when building from scratch, if those migrations depend on DDL or DML from repeatable migrations.3. Sqitch rework. Works, but is a bit cumbersome overall with the DAG, and I hit limitations with sqitch's variables support (and needing Perl) for other things I wanted to do.Spawn is my attempt to solve this, along with an easy (single binary) way to write and run tests. You:* Store view or function in its own separate file.* Include it in your migration with a template (e.g., {% include ""functions/hello.sql"" %})* Build migration to see the final SQL, or apply to database.* Pin migration to forever lock it to the component as it is now. This is very similar to 'git commit', allowing the old migration to run the same as when it was first created, even if you later change functions/hello.sql.* Update the function later by editing functions/hello.sql in place and importing it into your new migration. Git diff shows exactly what changed in hello.sql.Please check it out, let me know what you think, and hopefully it's as useful for you as it has been for me.

1rc1qde,"Same PKI, same raw data, two platforms (Databricks, Snowflake)… different results. Where would you even start debugging this?",MitocondrialPoro,dataengineering,"Hej all,I am running in to a metrics consistency problem in what felt like normal, decent architecture. But now it behaves more like a trains here in winter. Mostly works, until suddenly not.Here are the details.Data comes from:* Applications sending events to Kafka* Files landing in S3* A handful of databases (DB2, MySQL, Oracle)* A couple of SaaS systemsFrom there:* NIghtly spark jobs on Databricks create curated tables* Some of these curated tables are pushed into Snowflake* We also have streaming jobs writing to both Databricks and Snowflake* Snowflake is shared across multiple tenants. Same account, separate warehouses, ACLs in place.On architecture diagram this looks reasonable. In reality, documetnation is thin and mostcontrols are manual operational procedures. Management is crurently excited about “AI agents” than investing in proper orchestration or governance tooling, so we are working with what we have.**Problem**: A core metric, let’s call it DXI is calculated in Databricks using one curated table set, and in Snowflake suing another curated table set. Both sets are ultimately derived from the same upstream raw sources. Some pipelines flow through Kafka, others ingest directly from DB2 and land in Databricks before promotion to Snowflake. Sometimes the metric matches closely enough to be acceptable. Other times it diverges enough to raise eyebrows. There is no obvious pattern yet. What makes this awkward is that one of our corporate leaders explicitly suggested calculating the same KPI independently in both systems as a way to validate the architecture. It sounded clever at the time. Now it is escalating because the numbers do not match always and confidence in the architecture is getting shaky. This architecture is around 7 years old. Built and modified by multiple people, many are no longer here. Tribal knowledge mostly evaporated over time. **Question**: Since I have inherited this situation, where should I start? Some options I am struggling with:* Valdiate transformation logic parity line by line across about 350+ pipelines that touch the raw data and see where things could be diverging? This will take me forever, and I am also not very well versed with some of the complex Spark stuff that is going on in Databricks.* The lineage tool we have seems to overly simplify the lineage by skipping steps between curated tables and raw sources and just points it as an arrow. It gives no concept of how this could have happened as there are many pipelines between those systems. This is probably the most frustrating part for me to deal with and I am this close to giving up hope on using it.* I do notice sporadic errors on the nightly runs of pipelines and there seems to be a correlation between those and when the KPI calculation diverges on following days. But the errors seem pretty widely spread out and don’t seem to have a discernible pattern. * In the process of trying to find the culprint, I have actually uncovered data loss due to type conversion on three places, which although not related the KPI directly, gives me the impression that there could be such issues lurking all over the place.I am trying to approach this systematically, not emotionally. At the moment it feels like chasing ghosts across two platforms.

1rb6us1,Registering Partition Information to Glue Iceberg Tables,mike_get_lean,dataengineering,"I am creating Glue Iceberg tables using Spark on EMR. After creation, I also write a few records to the table. However, when I do this, Spark does not register any partition information in Glue table metadata.As I understand, when we use hive, during writes, spark updates table metadata in Glue such as partition information by invoking UpdatePartition API. And therefore, when we write new partitions in Hive, we can get EventBridge notifications from Glue for events such as BatchCreatePartition. Also, when we invoke GetPartitions, we can get partition information from Glue Tables.I understand Iceberg works based on metadata and has a feature for hidden partitioning but I am not sure if this is the sole reason Spark is not registering metadata info with Glue table. This is causing various issues such as not being able to detect data changes in tables, not being able to run Glue Data Quality checks on selected partitions, etc. Is there a simple way I can get this partition change and update information directly from Glue?One of the bad ways to do this will be to create S3 notifications, subscribe to those and then run Glue Crawler on those events, which will create another S3 based Glue table with the correct partition information. And then do DQ checks on this new table. I do not like this approach at all because I will need to setup significant automation to achieve this.",1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rb6us1/registering_partition_information_to_glue_iceberg/,2026-02-22 00:08:26,2026-02-27 02:09:05

All of them discoverable by browser-resident AI agents.WebMCP is a draft W3C spec that gives web apps the ability to expose structured, typed tool interfaces to AI agents. Instead of screen-scraping or DOM manipulation, agents call typed functions with validated inputs and receive structured outputs back. Chrome Canary 146+ has the first implementation of it.The technical write-up goes more into detail on the architectural patterns: [https://plotono.com/blog/webmcp-technical-architecture](https://plotono.com/blog/webmcp-technical-architecture)Some key findings from our side:* Per-page lifecycle scoping turned out to be critical.* Tools register on mount, unregister on unmount. No global registry.* This means agents see 8 to 22 focused tools per page, not all 85 at once.Two patterns emerged for us:* ref-based state bridges for stateful editors (pipeline builder, dashboard layout) and direct API calls for CRUD pages. Was roughly a 50/50 split.* Human-in-the-loop for destructive actions. Agents can freely explore, build and configure, but saving or publishing requires an explicit user confirmation.What really determined the integration speed was the existing architecture quality, not the WebMCP complexity itself.

Seemed reasonable. I had no idea what I was about to walk into.The first two hours were fine, I knew requests and BeautifulSoup from a tutorial.

Then I figured out rotating headers but the data was inconsistently structured across different listing types and my parser kept breaking in ways I couldn't predict.

1rauvm8,How to Learn JavaScript - From a Dev With 10 Years in JS,nikolaymakhonin,learnprogramming,"I want to share how I think you should learn JavaScript most effectively. My opinion is based only on my own experience, keep that in mind - I've never taught programming to anyone.Treat these tips as a roadmap you can use to understand where to go and how, but go wherever YOU want.These tips work for many other languages too (C++, C#, PHP, Python, Java, ...), except maybe functional languages - I have no experience there.My background: professional developer, around 20 years in different areas, self-taught my whole life, no courses whatsoever. Lots of experience with C++, C#, Java, PHP and JavaScript. Right now my main thing is JavaScript and frontend.---## TheoryI think the fastest way to learn a programming language is to study its building blocks one by one - the pieces programs are made of - while clearly separating the language itself from applying the language to anything: libraries, frameworks, web page manipulation, algorithms, architecture, all that stuff.The order for learning JavaScript should be roughly this:1. Data and how it's stored and processed in a computer2. Simple data types, including arrays3. Arithmetic and logical operations and expressions4. Core language constructs: if, switch/case, for, while, etc.5. Functions6. More complex data types: objects, maps, collections, ...7. Async programming. Async functions.8. OOP and Classes9. Iterators/Generators10. ...When you look for textbooks, the table of contents should roughly match this order. This way you'll at least have a learning plan and a rough idea of where you are - what you already know, what you don't yet. And you can skim the TOC to see what the language can do in general. This obviously doesn't mean you should throw away other textbooks and not read them.Gradually, as you study the language itself, you can also start learning how it's applied. Since there are many different applications and it's unclear what a person will end up doing, I can't give any advice here. The one thing universal for all JavaScript development directions is the language itself in its pure form.After JavaScript you can also learn TypeScript. Many companies require this skill, for example in React development. TypeScript just adds type annotations to JavaScript - increases code readability, simplifies development, catches many errors while you're still writing code. It's much easier to learn than JavaScript itself.Full JavaScript documentation: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/)---## PracticeIt makes sense to reinforce what you learn by solving short simple problems. If the problems are too hard and too long, you might not get enough satisfaction from them. They shouldn't be too easy either, or they'll become boring routine.Practice should be sequential just like theory. Free JavaScript problem sets: [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/), [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)There are also sites like CodeWars and CodeCombat - they have difficulty levels, but they're not for sequential learning, they're for training programming skills for people who already know the language.The format in these problem sets is the same: you write code in one window, press Test, your code gets checked. At first it can be hard to understand, especially why everything is set up so complicated - might be worth watching some YouTube videos on this, where people explain it in detail including why problem sets are structured this way. This knowledge will be useful in real work too, because this approach to development is used a lot in practice.---## Interest and Motivation**What feeds motivation:**- A sense of beauty in the language, roughly the same as the beauty of pure non-applied math.- Knowledge that will stay relevant for a long time. What you learn about JavaScript and TypeScript probably won't go obsolete in the coming decades. JS is way too firmly stuck in web development, because to this day it's the only language you can directly write browser programs in. And the knowledge you get from learning JS will help you learn other languages easier, since JS has procedural programming, object-oriented, and elements of functional programming. These concepts are very similar across many languages.- Solving small problems- Wanting to run an experiment- Wanting to make a pile of money- Wanting to build your own project (better keep it short and within your abilities)- Motivation goes up when you successfully reach a goal. If goals are long and hard to achieve, motivation drops. If goals are too simple, achieving them turns into boring routine. Stay in the middle with everything: choosing textbooks, courses, problems, projects, experiments, etc.**What kills motivation:**- Contempt. ""JavaScript is shit."" You can find plenty of flaws in JavaScript, no doubt. You can just know about them, keep them in mind, without feeling any negative emotions about it. And it's worth remembering - what matters in evaluating a language isn't a list of its pros and cons, but whether you can solve complex problems quickly and simply using this language in its area. My answer - absolutely yes.- Perfectionism.- Forcing yourself to finish a project, study a boring topic, complete a dull course. Early on you might have tons of unfinished projects and skipped topics you lost interest in, and that's great. It means perfectionism isn't running the show.- Wanting to read a textbook in strict order. Not wanting to try other textbooks or other courses until you finish the current ones. There's no single track for everyone.- Trying to push through a hard topic when your brain has already given up. At first it will be hard, and you need to let your brain rest and digest more often. Rest is a very important part of learning. Rest when you want to, as much as you want, and come back to learning when you feel like it.- Obsessions. If you want to kill your interest in programming for a long time or forever, obsessions are perfect for that. They'll suck all the energy and interest out of you, and when you come to your senses it'll be too late.---## Other Tips- **Marathon.** If you want to learn the language fast and start earning, learning to program shouldn't turn into playing in a sandbox - otherwise you'll spend a bunch of time on fun stuff with pictures, and end up not even reaching beginner level. To learn programming you have to strain your brain, let it rest, then strain it again, getting stronger each time, absorbing more material, same as people build muscle. The brain doesn't restructure and train overnight. Learning programming is a marathon over a very long distance. This marathon doesn't have to be self-torture though - straining your brain can actually be pleasant, and thinking about moving toward your goal is even more pleasant.- **You don't need to learn everything.** There's a lot of information, but not all of it is relevant right now, and of course you don't need to memorize everything down to the last detail. Often it's enough to just remember that a language feature exists - place short bookmarks in your head or in your notes, like markers on a map, so you can recall when needed that this feature exists and study it in more detail. No point loading your brain with things you're not using right now and won't use often in the future. Following this will seriously cut down your learning time and unload your brain. In the end, you'll remember well whatever you use often in practice - and that's the ideal use of your memory.- **Goal and path to goal.** To learn the language fast, you also need to move in the right direction. And to move in the right direction, you need to understand the end goal, the intermediate steps toward it, at least a rough plan. The main goal for a beginner, in my opinion, should be getting a job as an intern or Junior developer, because the real programming learning happens during actual work, especially if there's a mentor at work. Knowing this goal, you can build a rough plan to get there - for example find out what specific skills and knowledge most popular job listings require.- **Mentor.** To move in the right direction you also need to understand what's worth spending time on and what's not. A beginner can't figure this out, because you'd already need a lot of programming experience to know all these nuances. So early on a mentor will be useful - a person who is an experienced programmer themselves and can suggest the right direction, what to do and how, do code review, point out mistakes, answer questions, etc. This is common practice, many companies hire outside mentors to guide beginners.- **English.** English is very important in programming, but not because programming languages themselves are in English, or because many docs and books are in English - that's all small stuff. The main thing is being able to communicate with clients, managers, and other programmers who don't speak your native language. This skill will seriously expand your job search options, and to much higher-paying jobs at that.- **AI as a mentor.** LLM can work as a mentor for beginners but its expertise not enough for middle level. It also gives good suggestions for online services and textbooks.- **Deep understanding of the language.** Being able to read practically any code, understand it, execute it in your head - this really helps with understanding other people's code, debugging, designing. With this skill you get more ideas, you can find better solutions by eliminating impossible ones, and so on. It also helps with learning, since many ideas and algorithms are easier to express as code. A programming language is also, to some degree, a language programmers communicate with each other in. Often in their conversations you'll hear - stop talking, show me the code. Understanding every little thing in code really simplifies design, debugging, keeping code clean and quality, finding best solutions. Worth striving for - seek out things you don't understand and dig into them.- **Patterns.** Most of programming isn't inventing something from scratch, not reinventing wheels, but reusing template code over and over. There are thousands of these patterns and there's no point learning them all. They get remembered on their own as you gain programming experience, read other people's code, and pick up their ideas. Good code patterns for different tasks can be found at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), though even there you sometimes find upvoted garbage code.- **Rubber duck method.** If you can't figure out what the bug is in your program, try going through it step by step, explaining EVERY detail so that even a rubber duck sitting next to you would understand it all. This same method is often used to make sure there are no bugs in a program - I use it every time after writing a chunk of code, reviewing it and executing it in my head.- **Step-by-step debugging.** Step-by-step debugging tools really help you understand your own code, find bugs, make sure your understanding of the code matches reality. During step-by-step debugging you can literally watch code execute step by step and look at variable values on each step. This really helps when learning the language, understanding how everything works inside. You can run step-by-step JavaScript debugging in the browser, in DevTools - just paste code into the console but write the word `debugger` before the code. I use this when I need to make sure there are no obvious algorithm errors in complex code.- **Research skills.** Research is a very important and inseparable part of developing anything. Pick up any task - pretty much any of them requires research, unless you already have experience doing the exact same task. Research is basically finding the best answer to questions like: what tool to use here, how to organize the code, what architecture to apply to this task, what are this tool's capabilities, how to solve this, etc. Research is basically a mini scientific paper, because it's done using the scientific method: gather information, generate ideas, test ideas, pick the best one.- **Self-learning skills.** You need to keep learning the entire time you work as a programmer, constantly raising your level. Even if a programmer manages to land in a niche where there's nothing left to learn - learned everything, just work - most likely that'll be boring low-paying work with higher competition and less interest, because you're doing the same thing all the time. The best and highest-paid specialists are those who can solve any problems, including the hardest and seemingly unsolvable ones. That is the programmer's job after all - solving problems brought by clients, which are often complex or unusual. And you can only become that kind of specialist with self-learning skills and the ability to do independent research.",117,0.84,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rauvm8/how_to_learn_javascript_from_a_dev_with_10_years/,2026-02-21 16:06:53,2026-02-27 02:09:06

1reai3z,I enjoy learning programming but don’t have any clear use for it,Pcnoob333,learnprogramming,"Background: I started self-learning Python with the Helsinki Python Programming MOOC last June. After that, I went through CS50x because I was curious about more than just coding. I’ve also been doing some LeetCode on the side since it helps with problem-solving and thinking more clearly. Over the past few months, I’ve built a few small projects (mostly CRUD apps) using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL. With each one, I try to improve how I structure things and actually understand what I’m doing, instead of just following random tutorials.I genuinely enjoy backend development and learning system design concepts like caching, replicas, load balancing, etc. (stuff from the system design primer on GitHub)The problem is… I don’t really have any use for it.I don’t have a degree, I’m not aiming for a traditional path, and I live in a small town in Alabama where there’s basically zero demand for this kind of work. I even tried offering my city hall a dashboard/maintenance tracking system after noticing at town meetings that the five members sit there fumbling through giant stacks of papers. But when I presented them with the idea/MVP video, they said they wanted to keep doing things the way they always have and weren’t interested.Even in my personal life, I don’t really have anything to automate or problems to solve. So even though I enjoy learning this stuff, sometimes it feels like I’m just building things in a vacuum with no real direction.I’m about to start a job at a plant soon, and I worry I won’t still have it in me to spend hours a day self-studying APIs and coding while working 12 hour shifts haha.Has anyone else been in this position where you love learning something but don’t have a clear “why”?

Here's what I'm currently doing:Coding along with courses: I never just watch. I type everything out and modify it to make sure I understand it. Helps in the moment but doesn't seem to stick long-term.Anki flashcards: For syntax and common patterns. Jury's still out on whether this is actually useful for programming. Feels weird flashcarding code.Talking through concepts out loud: When I finally understand something, like really grasp WHY a list comprehension works the way it does and not just how to type one, I talk through it out loud and record it in Willow Voice. The transcript goes into a concepts folder I can review. Explaining it out loud cements it way better than just reading about it, and I have notes in my own words to reference later. This has been the most useful method so far, honestly.Small projects: Trying to apply each new concept in a tiny project instead of just doing textbook exercises. Made a basic CLI expense tracker last week to practice file I/O and it forced actual problem-solving versus following instructions.But I still feel like I'm missing something.

1rcgff0,Dockerizing my application made me feel like a senior engineer(LOL),Longjumping_Echo486,learnprogramming,"Hello, this is my first post here. Recently I started learning backend development and decided to build a purely backend focused project to actually understand how things work beyond tutorials.I built a CRUD API for a social media style application with users, posts, and votes tables. Creating the routes with FastAPI felt surprisingly straightforward at first. Authentication, however, was a completely different story. Integrating JWT took me a few days of going through videos, debugging, and trying to understand what was really happening under the hood. Eventually I got it working, which felt like a small breakthrough.For the database, I used PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy as the ORM to define my schemas. I also set up Alembic for migrations, which helped me understand how schema versioning works in real projects. That part made the project feel much more realistic.After finishing the core functionality, I realized that writing endpoints is only half the job. They need to be tested properly. So I created a tests directory and used pytest to cover different scenarios and edge cases. That was another learning curve, especially figuring out test databases and dependency overrides.The biggest hurdle for me was Docker. I had never containerized an application before, and initially it felt overwhelming. But after spending time reading the docs and experimenting, I finally managed to dockerize the app. That moment felt like a genuine win.I know this is still a basic backend project and there is a lot more to learn, like proper deployment and scaling. I am thinking of adding a load simulation using Locust to test with 1000 plus virtual users just to explore performance aspects.It may not be groundbreaking, but it feels like real progress to me. I am excited to keep improving it.Also, if anyone can suggest free platforms where I can deploy this as a college student, I would really appreciate it.Thanks for reading.",12,0.88,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rcgff0/dockerizing_my_application_made_me_feel_like_a/,2026-02-23 12:43:52,2026-02-27 02:09:06

Tell me whether they don't in fact contradict and I am missing something, tell me whether these two books are just opinions and nothing science-based, or tell me whether they apply in different contexts, if one is wrong and the other is right, or if there is a way to combine them.""A Philosophy of Software Design"" by John Ousterhout vs ""Grokking Simplicity"" by Eric Normand are highly recommended and praised books regarding how to write code. They both have very solid advice, but in some areas, they strongly contradict each other. I want to follow the advice in both books, because I see their point of view and I agree with them, but I am having a hard time doing it because in one of the most important aspects, function/method design, they have very different views.Even if they talk more in general, for the sake of making the problem simpler and for simpler exemplification, I will reduce their advice to functions. I use ""functions"", but I also refer to ""methods"".**A Philosophy of Software Design** suggests deep functions with simple interfaces. This means functions which hide a lot of complexity behind a simple-to-use interface. Many times in this book it is pointed out that functions with a lot of parameters increase a function's complexity, and thus increase the overall complexity of the program. The book is also against passing objects or data down through many functions, essentially creating parameters in functions whose only purpose is to pass data down. He suggests contexts or global objects for this. Also, small functions or functions which just call another function are recommended against in this book, as they do not result in deep modules, and create extra complexity through the increase in the number of functions and parameters that exist for developers to learn.**Grokking Simplicity** makes it very clear from the start that functions should be split into calculations (pure functions, with no side effects) and actions (functions which interact with the outside world). The main idea the book recommends is reducing as much as possible the number of actions inside a codebase by transforming actions into calculations or extracting calculations from actions. Extracting calculations from actions has the natural consequence of increasing the overall number of functions. Also, in order to create calculations, some implicit inputs need to be converted into explicit inputs, resulting in functions with multiple parameters. Because reading from / writing to a global variable is an implicit input/output, the book also suggests using functions which only pass parameters through many layers.As you can see, the two idioms are very contradictory.",9,0.74,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rdg2fh/a_philosophy_of_software_design_vs_grokking/,2026-02-24 13:20:49,2026-02-27 02:09:06

1rf5b75,"Learning how to think ""overall"" to people learning programming?",WinterGabe,learnprogramming,"A lot of learners don’t seem blocked by not knowing a language. They seem blocked by not knowing how to approach a problem. They try to write the finished solution in one go instead of drafting and refining. They don’t isolate the core logic of a function before building around it. They don’t reduce complexity before adding features.It makes me wonder:Do they actually teach people how to think in programming?They teach loops, conditionals, frameworks, and patterns. But do they explicitly teach:* Iterative drafting* Breaking problems into smaller pieces* Building the smallest working version first* Stripping a function down to its essence before expanding it* Using code as a tool for reasoning, not just producing an answerWhat thinking gaps have you noticed in programming? I've never taken a formal course so I am unsure if they teach programmers courses on how to approach problems. I taught myself Python, SQL, PowerShell, Bash, PHP, VB. Which makes me wonder if others have seen this and what are some examples - curious for personal growth since I am not a programmer by trade and my overall journey started with problem solving, order of operations, baselines, etc - all in frame. But then again - no one sat me down and taught me those things. They came from a need to solve real world problems and to be as effectual as possible over the course of my career.I'm asking because I come from a Systems background and I don't feel like I think like a programmer and I feel like that gap causes a disconnect in communication sometimes. When I sit down to build something, my mind immediately expands outward. I’m thinking about database design, developer experience, user experience, scalability, infrastructure, and long-term stack decisions and how what I am writing fits into all of that so I can tailer my approach to the end goal as a whole. Things like - this service is going to be running longer than 15 minutes, so a lamba function isn't an option.What are some gaps in regard to overall approach and problems solving you see? I feel like if I know more about that, it will help me bridge the gap.The two things I see the most is - 1. Not just getting the logic out in a draft *then* refining.2. Just focusing on making it work and calling it a day rather than thinking more into - how comfortable is this going to be to use.And I find it hard to explain why those two things are important.Thanks.",6,0.69,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rf5b75/learning_how_to_think_overall_to_people_learning/,2026-02-26 09:01:18,2026-02-27 02:09:06

1rascrr,REST vs GraphQL for CRUD applications,Xspectiv,learnprogramming,"I'm junior-mid so excuse me if I got some misconceptionso, if my terminology is wrong or if I'm over-engineering thisI am making a full-stack business deal inventory and time-tracking application, which fundamentally is very CRUD-based. Basically my stack now is:**Frontend** - React which will be built into the backend and served as a public / static assets.**Backend** - Node.js using TypeScript, currently with all CRUD functionality as REST.**Ingestion Service** - Uses Vertex AI to parse the body of emails with a particular label and body. It does validation in Zod and then is added to the DB. This is kindof a different related service on its own but handles the same data.**Database** - Currently PostgreSQL queried with Sequelize. These will be deployed to two different Cloud Runs (serverless) services on GCP where the ingestion service is scheduled and then there's the app. Haven't decided yet about where the DB is going to be ultimately but maybe CloudSQL makes sense and that integrates well with Looker studio analytics tool.For my use case TypeScript and a relational db makes more sense as there are many related tables and also data integrity of these business deals is important so schema validation needs to work well here.However, the amount of different columns in my tables is now around 30 and there might be more later so querying might become a bit performance expensive especially when there's eventually gonna be thousands of entries, if not tens of thousands.Also as a sidenote, I am later contemplating a chatbot AI like feature in the app which could use some form of NL2Query solution to get requested deal information from inquiries eg. ""How many people are assigned for x particular deals from last month?"" Everything except the frontend is set up and works well already and the amount of users and data is not that large yet.I guess my question is whether rethinking the REST and moving into GraphQL would be better for this use case instead of just keeping things as is and using Elasticsearch if more effective inqueries are needed?Thanks!",5,0.86,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rascrr/rest_vs_graphql_for_crud_applications/,2026-02-21 14:23:56,2026-02-27 02:09:06
1r9mz1u,"I am reading ""Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software second edition"" and I am confused by the adding of XOR gates on the input and output of the ""Add/subtract unit""",MindlessAssistance52,learnprogramming,"Hi,So I am at chapter 21 of the book, and the author has finished building a ""add/subtract unit"" part of the CPU. https://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter21/My confusion is about the subtract part of the arithmetic unit. When we start a subtraction, we use the opcode ""10"", which forces a CI of 1 for the two's complement operation. (Which ends up giving something like A + B inverted + 1) This is done for the first pair of bytes for a multibyte number. Afterwards, the next pairs are treated using the Opcode of ""11"".The actual CY In has no effect at this stage (Opcode 10), so the only things we are left with are the first part of the sum and a potential Carry out.Previously, the author built something called a ""triple byte accumulator"" which was a precursor (https://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter20/) where when doing a subtraction using two's complement, if you had a carry out generated during the operation, it would end up being used in the middle byte part, and if the middle byte sum ended up producing a carry out as well, it would end up being used in the high byte part of the operation of the 24 bit number.Now, the author, for some unknown reason to me, has introduced two ""XOR gates"" at the input and ouput of the arithmetic unit. He doesn't mention anything about them besides : > This is a little different from the circuits shown in the book in that the values of both CY In and CY Out are inverted for subtraction. (The entry in the lower-right corner of the table on page 322 should be inverted CY)In the book, at the point where I am, nothing is mentioned as to why or what is done with those inverted signals.During addition (Opcodes of 00 or 01), those XOR gates have no effect whatsoever as if they did not exist. When subtraction/""addition in two's complement"" is done, they do invert the Carry out signal of the adder ... but here is the strange thing:if my adder produces a Carry output of 1 , the XOR transforms it to 0 ... and when this tranformed signal is used in the next part of the operation for the next pair of bytes, the XOR gate at the input ""undoes"" the 0 so we end up having a raw bit of 1 ... as if nothing actually happened. The same logic happens if my carry output produces a 0, it is transformed to 1, and when it is fed back to the CY In, the XOR gates undoes the effect and we end up with a 0 again as the input to the adder.Clearly, then, those gates are not affecting the function of the actual ""subtraction"" and everything is functioning as I would expect it to. My question then would be : why exactly is the author adding those two XOR gates?The only reason I could think of is those inverted signals are going to serve some (unknown) use later on, but outside of that I can't really think of anything else.Any help or guidance would be much appreciated...",6,0.88,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r9mz1u/i_am_reading_code_the_hidden_language_of_computer/,2026-02-20 05:35:11,2026-02-27 02:09:06

You call a terminal and use the Get-Clipboard command to get the file path, Trim the quotes that Microsoft annoyingly packages with the file path in the clipboard, then use ii (invoke item) to open using the default application for that file extension.The trouble it that yes powershell can handle the long file path, when ii hands it off to the application, the application still can’t handle the long file path. I had the idea of taking all the drive/directories part of the file path and just mounting the last folder in the chain as a lettered drive which would effectively cut the character count to just the name of the file, plus a few characters and then unmounting it at the end of the script.

I’m looking for the highest quality content available, even if it’s expensive.I prefer courses that are:* Industry-relevant and modern* Deep explanations * Project-based or production-oriented* Structured learning paths (not random YouTube playlists)Some platforms I’ve heard about:• Educative • Udemy • Coursera specializations • Boot\[.\]dev • Backend Masterclass / specific instructor courses • Cloud certifications (AWS/GCP) • System Design courses (Grokking etc.)But I’m not sure which ones are actually worth the time.Would really appreciate recommendations from people working as backend engineers in industry.Thanks!",3,0.71,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1re764l/best_high_quality_courses_for_backend_cs/,2026-02-25 07:55:16,2026-02-27 02:09:06
1re5p24,"If you could do it again in 2026, how would you learn frontend development?",EngineeringRare1070,learnprogramming,"Hi all, I’m an experienced backend engineer who really wants to step into the frontend world without turning to AI for unreliable help. How would you start learning the fundamentals of how to build frontend applications if you had the chance to relearn? What would you focus on first, second etc, to build the right sequence of understanding? What takeaways have you learned that weren’t obvious earlier in your development journey? What helped you to learn how to structure frontend code? Any thoughts on these questions will certainly help me out.For context, I’m not totally clueless about frontend concepts, libraries and frameworks, html and css. But, I struggle to piece together the scraps of knowledge to put together a frontend application on my own, much less a well-structured, well-designed one on my own. My goal is to learn the skills from the ground up and build some small, skill-focused projects to go through the motions of building and solving problems to develop that mental model that I can use going forward.

1rdpj61,Websockets Vs MQTT vs HTTP LongPooling,Tito_Gamer14,learnprogramming,"I need to build a complex application, and to give you some context, there are 3 interacting entities: a Type 1 Client, a Server, and a Type 2 Client.The **Type 2 Client** will be web-based, mainly for querying and interacting with data coming from the server. The **Type 1 Client** is offline-first; it first captures and collects data, saves it in a local SQLite DB, and then an asynchronous service within the same Type 1 Client is responsible for sending the data from the local DB to the server.Here’s the thing: there is an application that will be in charge of transmitting a ""real-time"" data stream, but it won't be running all the time. Therefore, the Type 2 Client will be the one responsible for telling the Type 1 Client: ""start the transmission.""The first thing that came to mind was using **WebSockets**—that’s as far as I’ve gotten experimenting on my own. But since we don't know when the connection will be requested, an active channel must be kept open for when the action is required. The Type 1 Client is hidden behind **NAT/CG-NAT**, so it cannot receive an external call; it can only handle connections that it initiates first.This is where I find my dilemma: with WebSockets, I would have an active connection at all times, consuming bandwidth on both the server and the Type 1 Client. With a few clients, it’s not a big deal, but when scaling to 10,000, you start to notice the difference. After doing some research, I found information about the **MQTT protocol**, which is widely used for consuming very few resources and scaling absurdly easily.What I’m looking for are opinions between one and the other. I’d like to see how those of you who are more experienced would approach a situation like this.",3,0.72,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rdpj61/websockets_vs_mqtt_vs_http_longpooling/,2026-02-24 19:11:44,2026-02-27 02:09:06

Since C doesn't have dynamic lists, I decided to implement the board history using a linked list. Now I’m running into some weird bugs: the function sometimes detects a draw after four identical positions, and sometimes it says the game is drawn even if a position has occurred only twice.

Here's the function and the nodes: struct Position { char position[64]; char turn; int ep_square; // 0 = nobody can castle, 1 = white can castle, 2 = black can castle, 3 = both can castle int castling_queen; int castling_king; struct Position* next; }; static struct Position history_init = { .position = { 'r','n','b','q','k','b','n','r', 'p','p','p','p','p','p','p','p', /* ... empty squares ... */ 'P','P','P','P','P','P','P','P', 'R','N','B','Q','K','B','N','R' }, .turn = 'w', .ep_square = -1, // 'ep' means en passant .castling_king = 0, .castling_queen = 0, .next = NULL }; static struct Position* history_end = &history_init; int is_3fold_rep(){ struct Position* this_history = &history_init; struct Position* last_history = history_end; const char* desired_position = last_history -> position; const char desired_turn = last_history -> turn; const int desired_castling_king = last_history -> castling_king; const int desired_castling_queen = last_history -> castling_queen; const int desired_ep_square = last_history -> ep_square; int repetitions = 0; while (this_history != NULL){ int castling_match = (this_history->castling_king == desired_castling_king) && (this_history->castling_queen == desired_castling_queen); int ep_square_match = this_history->ep_square == desired_ep_square; int turn_match = this_history->turn == desired_turn; int rights_match = castling_match && ep_square_match && turn_match; if (rights_match && memcmp(this_history->position, desired_position, 64) == 0){ repetitions++; } this_history = this_history->next; } return repetitions >= 3; }If the snippet isn't clear you can check out full code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Puupalikka/simple-chess-engine).

The weird thing is, I keep noticing these parallels between logic games on the LSAT and writing conditional statements. When I'm building if/else chains or tracing through nested loops, it genuinley feels similar to solving a sequencing game where you have to track which constraints apply in what order. My brain seems to latch onto that kind of structured reasoning pretty fast.But I'm also running into walls my LSAT brain completley can't help with. Syntax errors are brutal because I'll understand the logic perfectly and still forget a colon or mess up an indentation and the whole script breaks. LSAT trained me to reason on paper in the abstract, so the hands-on debugging side feels like a totally seperate skill that I haven't even started building yet.

The codebase is chaos: in a month : 150k lines backend, 50k frontend, every line breaking something else, zero security, and the manager refuses to own mistakes, dumping all the pressure on the team.

Confused on future aspects with heavy cursor dependence on all stages of software development.,blackpearlinscranton,cscareerquestions,"My organisation ( a decent mid sized MNC ) has been doubling down on cursor adoption from past 7-8 months.

The engineering leadership has explicitly asked engineers to **not write code manually** their stand is to perform every aspect of development via cursor only. Bug analysis, technical design ( hld or lld), code implementation, test case design , tests implementation everything is forced via cursor. The JIRA timelines are set as such that even if you want to go through code manually or want to write code manually you won't be able to and their answer is to use cursor to do analysis and everything. Cursor usage is tracked and people with highest usage are awarded ( literally). I want to understand how to navigate this shift. Skills of understanding or writing code doesn't seem to matter now or learning different tools ( like docker etc etc )or tech stacks seems futile.

1rb2qb8,Put on pip. Should I try to pass it or take the severance? FMLA usage?,No-External3221,cscareerquestions,"About me: I work at the banana factory. 2.5 YoE. Have been wanting to hop for a mid-level promo, but have stuck on my current team due to the competitive job market.A couple of weeks ago, I was notified that I'm being put on a pip/ focus by my manager. There are a variety of ways that this could play out, but I'm only interested in two:1. Pass the pip. If I grind out the project, I think there's a fair chance that I could make it. My team is already -2 headcount I don't think my manager wants to lose me. Doing so would likely make getting a promotion or swapping teams hard/ impossible so that I'd need to switch companies anyway, though. The main benefits would be that I could more easily come back to the company later (no black mark for failing the pip), and/ or more time to find another job.2. Fail the pip and take the severance. This should let me *barely* hit my RSU vest date, and would give me 60 days of severance to find a new job. Including the time spent on pip/ focus, I'd have 4-5 months to interview and find something new. Since I'm looking to jump anyway, this option is appealing (2 months of free pay), but I'd have a black mark that would make it difficult to rejoin the same company again in the future.What should I do in this situation? I've also heard that taking FMLA can be beneficial during focus, but I'm not sure exactly how, as I'm not on a visa.",109,0.93,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rb2qb8/put_on_pip_should_i_try_to_pass_it_or_take_the/,2026-02-21 21:14:52,2026-02-27 02:09:07

1rfpgmh,Block slashes workforce by nearly half due efficiency from “intelligence tools.”,TraditionalMango58,cscareerquestions,"Block said Thursday it’s laying off more than 4,000 employees, or about half of its headcount.“Today we shared a difficult decision with our team,” Jack Dorsey, Block’s co-founder and CEO, wrote in a letter to shareholders. “We’re reducing Block by nearly half, from over 10,000 people to just under 6,000, which means that over 4,000 people are being asked to leave or entering into consultation.”Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the job cuts will position the company “for our next phase of long term growth.”“We are choosing to shift how we operate at a time when our business is accelerating and we see an opportunity to move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work,” Ahuja wrote.Dorsey said he expects other companies to similarly overhaul their workforces as they see more efficiency gains from “intelligence tools.”https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/26/block-laying-off-about-4000-employees-nearly-half-of-its-workforce.html",103,0.97,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rfpgmh/block_slashes_workforce_by_nearly_half_due/,2026-02-26 23:01:23,2026-02-27 02:09:07

1reyzy6,Feeling pessimistic about AI,ilovefamilyguy69,cscareerquestions,"I know this sub is filled with these types of posts but I just want to say. I do think a large number of people are coping so incredibly hard about AI in terms of the future of software engineering. I am about to graduate, and it feels pretty hopeless, though I would love to be proven wrong by someone with more knowledge/experience than me. My fear isn’t that “AI will replace software engineers”, I just think the rebuttals are lacking so much awareness of what will actually likely happen. “Companies are hiring more SWE’s, so how can they be replacing us?” Software engineers will not be replaced. I believe that the work will be devalued to the point that software engineering will be nothing more than a slightly higher than entry level job that maybe requires a certification after a short period of training, not a bachelors or higher in computer science. I fully expect to make $20/hr as a software engineer in 10 years and not be able to live in a major city. It will be like working tech support in the 2000s, all we will be doing is fixing a few minor issues here and there but mostly just consulting AI on how to fix AI code. Of course tech support is mostly AI now, so lol. If AI makes sloppy code now, what is stopping it from making good code in 5 - 10 years? What is stopping it from having the ability to check its own work and factor in countless variables that even humans struggle to think of? Of course I am totally open to being wrong and would love to be shown something that negates any of that, I just have yet to see something that factors in the reality of how dystopian our world is and will increasingly become. My only optimism stems from the fact that it seems a large amount of people are vehemently against AI, and hopefully will not want to engage with software they know is AI generated, but I don’t think most people will have a choice, the way we all hate social media but use it daily. My real question is this: what are the “safest” fields that will likely stay for a while? Should I just study COBOL and hope I will magically get hired?",98,0.79,167,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1reyzy6/feeling_pessimistic_about_ai/,2026-02-26 03:15:54,2026-02-27 02:09:07

1rawkys,"LLMs are bubble or not, I'm in a huge echo chamber and i don't know what to do.",TheKaritha,cscareerquestions,"**EDIT:** I think I wasn’t clear in my question. I’m not asking whether AI is a bubble or not. I’m asking for names of non-fanatical researchers and engineers to listen to or read. Most of the replies just prove my point. Even when I try to ask for resources, I end up being pulled into one side of the debate. \---I’m a newly graduated computer engineer. After a few months without a job, I decided to prepare for a government engineering exam for a stable, well-paid position. If I fail, I’ll return to job hunting. While studying, I still follow tech news and social media, where I see extreme views about AI/LLMs either denying they’re real or claiming there will be no jobs left.Personally, I use it for learning, translating (even after writing this text, I told AI to fix grammar mistakes without changing my text), and of course coding small projects that I don’t really care about, like a habit tracker or my static Jekyll blog. I believe it’s a great tool that will make our jobs easier, and the only bad thing I think we programmers might face is being pushed toward more productivity. I know ai is a new trend too, while interviewing on school I got pushed to add LLM to random apps that have zero usability like LLM powered graduation system etc. So I see myself at center. But both sides of the internet disagree with me, and I’m confused.**The Anti-AI** side claims the AI boom will collapse and disappear, leaving only old AI generated artifacts behind. They reject LLMs entirely. I disagree. if companies can make money from it, it won’t just vanish. They call entire LLM products slop (yes %90 of them are) but they get frustrated even when someone uses AI voice with their own voice. **The Pro-AI** side, on the other hand, says the AI bubble isn’t real and that if I don’t use AI everywhere, I’m doomed. They claim art and desk jobs are already dead. I don’t think that’s true either, at least for now. Many self-proclaimed “prompt engineers” don’t understand what good code actually looks like. It may work today on one machine, but that doesn’t mean it’s reliable everywhere.**TL;DR:** I’ve noticed social media is extremely polarized about AI. One side says it’s fake and will collapse, the other says it will replace all jobs and you’re doomed without it. I personally see AI as a useful tool that improves productivity, but not as something that will either disappear or completely replace human work.So my question is: I believe these two separate groups are in huge echo chambers that only hear what they want, and I just can’t research and learn about AI technologies without entering those chambers of insanity. I would love to learn from people who are trying to share information instead of propaganda. I would really appreciate it if you could share what you read or watch.",81,0.78,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rawkys/llms_are_bubble_or_not_im_in_a_huge_echo_chamber/,2026-02-21 17:12:44,2026-02-27 02:09:07

1rasanm,Starting as a student can quietly screw your salary later,Accomplished-Mail-13,cscareerquestions,"starting as a dev during college has its pros. Easier interviews. Lower expectations.I did that. Started part-time making roughly $30k/year equivalent ( converted to dollars for better understanding, don't take as exact numbers). I was just happy to get experience.After a year I converted to full-time at about $65k. I didn’t negotiate, since PM somehow made it clear that there may not be a full time place for me. I just worked hard, got good feedback. Then this year I expected to be reindexed closer to my peers — $100k+, which is normal for my level in my comp. Easiest promotion I thought, since compensation system tries to equal salaries for the same Grade + Position.Instead I got bumped to \~$80k. Manager said that’s all he could get from the project budget. Later I talked to another guy who also started as a student. Same numbers. We earn exactly the same. Then it clicked. We’re still classified in the system under a “Graduate” compensation track. Our peers are under the standard “Software Engineer” track. We do same work. we have same expectations.

1rfcymt,How do I politely unassign work from an incompetent coworker,munchingrice,cscareerquestions,"This might be a bit of a vent but I'm honestly so fed up with this man. I'm working on leading a new feature for our app and was assigned this dude to help me out. I just gave him some basic UI work, but his code still ended up being a AI generated mess. He doesn't even have the decency to not make it look AI generated, every single change has a comment before it explaining the code. I've been through three rounds of review with his PR, and it's like he has the inability to comprehend the English language (English is so very clearly his native language). I'm like 'hey can you fix these things' and he does like one change out of the seven things I commented on. At one point I'm like 'hey could you not code this way it's an anti pattern' and he was like 'oh yeah that was just copilot doing some set up for me, i can update that' and in the next iteration not only did he not change that section of code, he added ANOTHER section of code that had that exact same anti pattern.At this point I'd rather just do all the work myself, it would be easier than working with this man. I have no idea how to approach this, my manager/the higher up situation is a bit of a mess right now as there has been an org shift and I'm newer/younger to the team than he is. I don't want to get him in trouble or anything, I just don't want to work with him directly anymore. When I planned out the work for this project I had delegated him work for future sprints, but now I want to take that all back.

1r9px9f,Mid-level SWE feeling completely stuck,_hockeykubacki,cscareerquestions,"Hey all, just wanted to get this off my chest and see if there’s any outside opinions. In November of last year I was transitioned from my original organization to a new one within the same company due to some shady stuff pulled by the C-Suite.My previous team was all US based, but we were pulled into a new team which is a US/India split & now days start at 5:30am which I didn’t sign up for when I joined 3 years ago. Not to mention I was up for a promotion right before this transition and now I’m back to square 1.On top of this, when transitioning we were promised we would be rebuilding the existing native application with my language of expertise that I’ve worked with & loved my entire career. Our new engineering manager who has zero tech background has stonewalled this as she constantly needs “data” to validate it.The existing codebase is an absolute nightmare and all they do is defect/bug fixes with no innovation at all. I haven’t touched a line of code in 2.5 months and just got assigned the most absurdly simple defect ticket which they pointed to 3 story points. Myself and one other member from my old team have practically begged our manager to allow us to start working on the new POC as we are doing nothing.I find myself getting so angry after giving years of my life to this place and basically getting demoted… but that’s corporate America I guess.

1r9xk2m,I genuinely cannot tell if I’m good at my job or not,Dreadsin,cscareerquestions,"I’m a frontend engineer. I’ve been doing frontend for like 10 years now and feel very competent when it comes to actually developing software *on the frontend*. I’ve received lots of positive comments on my frontend code basically anywhere I worked, but it seems to not be that highly valuedHowever, I’ve always felt like I struggled in my career. Although I was ostensibly hired as a frontend engineer, I often find that I’m assigned to sort of ancillary projects. For example, I worked at (big company) and I think I barely even touched the frontend code and spent the majority of my time doing operational stuff and infrastructure. I felt I spent **far** more time being what effectively amounted to a SRE, which I didn’t feel particularly competent atAt this company, I occasionally pointed out that there were some things that were more difficult or tedious than they needed to be. As an example, the i18n had tons of problems; if you didn’t add translations using a **very specific, multi day process**, then the entire site would crash. One day, someone on the team triggered this bug, causing a huge problem. I brought up to my manager that this kind of bug is not normal. I offered to perhaps fix it, and offered multiple “levels” of fixes, with the most minimal being a 2 line change that’s forward-facing so at least it wouldn’t happen *again*He said I had no idea what I was doing, said I was lying on my resume, and told me whatever I learned in the past doesn’t matter here because this company is simply **better** than whatever companies I worked at before. He said he didn’t want to hear me talk about it again. He instructed me to “document the process” of adding a string to the i18n. It almost seemed like the frontend was so flimsy, they didn’t want anyone to touch it unless *absolutely necessary*.On the same note with that i18n, I noticed that the plurals were… all just wrong. People would have strings like “10 user(s) online”. I told them that this doesn’t work in other languages, and they asked me to prove it was actually a problem. I went through the spanish translations and pointed out at least 20, and a couple extra in other languages. I proposed using a built-in \`Intl\` library, and they said I was way overcomplicating things and that I still haven’t proved there’s a problem because they “don’t speak any language other than english” and “didn’t understand what was wrong with the spanish translation”. I didn’t really know how to respond; I showed them in google translate using “el angel” and “los angeles”, but they kept insisting I was making problems where none existedWhenever I talk to anyone at work about anything, it feels like I’m expending “good will tokens”. Like even just asking a simple yes/no question will take a week of work to earn back. I reeeeeally don’t like talking to anyone I work with, at any company I’ve been at. I can’t tell if I’m doing something wrong that’s pissing people off, so I try to lay low and do nothing wrong. Whatever technical skills I have seem more or less worthless these days, honestly. Sure, give me a ticket and I’ll get it done very quickly with thorough unit/integration/e2e tests before the deadline… but… **something** is gonna go wrong after that and none of that will matterI’m just wondering, is this what it’s like for most people, or is it like… genuinely me that’s the problem?",21,0.92,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r9xk2m/i_genuinely_cannot_tell_if_im_good_at_my_job_or/,2026-02-20 14:58:41,2026-02-27 02:09:07
1rdcbme,Are Junior engineers going to be able to adapt to the future of AI assisted coding?,Counter-Business,cscareerquestions,"Previously juniors were expected to get assigned a clearly defined ticket and implement the code. They were judged on how fast they can write code not so much their ability to reason through first principles thinking.Now that ai tools are so good, clearly defined prompts can be oneshot with no coding time required. All of a sudden your coding speed is irrelevant. The only things that matter is your ability to break problems down to first principles, review and evaluate the plan and output and to catch issues early.Essentially AI has replaced the role of the junior from 2 years ago. Are juniors going to adapt to this and begin learning systems engineering earlier or are they going to be left behind? A engineer who is unable to plan and design is useless now. If they don’t verify and fix small bugs with the ai then I end up spending more time in code reviewing than if I was to build the feature myself.Seniors now spend less time reviewing boilerplate and more time iterating on system design, which means juniors must be proactive in planning, reasoning, and taking ownership.",17,0.74,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rdcbme/are_junior_engineers_going_to_be_able_to_adapt_to/,2026-02-24 10:07:40,2026-02-27 02:09:07

Every company I've worked for in my career promoted based on merit, or at the very least, pretended to.I'm a manager of four very hard working junior developers and was told last week that they have no chance of ever getting promoted unless we can show the company a need for a promotion. For example, the software engineers that work for me are underpaid level 2 engineers. No matter how hard they work, they have no chance of getting to the next level unless we can prove to the company that we have some need for a level 3 engineer. I have a couple of engineers who are very ambitious and have made it clear that they want to advance. They're willing to do whatever it takes, but the hard truth is that their chances of advancing have almost nothing to do with their work.As I understood HR,.they would rather have an overqualified junior developer leave and replace them with a new junior developer than promote them and pay more for a more senior developer.Level 2 developers make around $80K at my company, which is located in Austin, Texas. I've seen the recruiter turn down great software developers who asked for $81k. If you couple that with the fact that there's almost no opportunity for wage growth or promotions, it's going to be very tough on me as a manager.There's a lot more going on with this company than this issue, as you may see from my other posts, but my current thinking is that I'm going to stabilize the office as much as I can and then head for the exit.

1ra40q0,CS New Grad Career Pivot From SWE to Data Analyst,iGanti_,cscareerquestions,"I just graduated from a state university in December, 2025. I started my CS degree in August 2021, and did pretty well in my classes until I had a mental health issue and resulted in me failing a bunch of classes. It forced me to use my summers to catch up on those classes so I never got the chance to do any internships. For me at that point I just wanted to graduate and get me degree. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my career but I liked programming ever since HS so I tried to focus on that. I took a bunch of electives around it like Full Stack in C# and doing a capstone where I made my own project with a couple other people. I hated it. I could never get over the OOP hump of just abstraction over abstraction. It never clicked with me. However, since my university's CS department was so behind in today's tech, our project was just a CRUD machine so I just got through it and passed the class. All of my classes were like that more or less. For my Mobile App dev class, our project was a Wordle Clone. For my Databases class, our project was a simple Flask and SQLite CRUD program. Looking back on all of my classes in CS, I never learned anything useful. Yeah, I have strong soft skills like problem solving and recognizing patterns, but I never learned any marketable skills. And I understand a CS degree isn't the same as SWE but what am I supposed to do now? Fast forward two months after graduating and I have no impressive projects or career experience. I tried to teach myself React and Javascript since we were never exposed to that in school and I'm so lost. I keep hearing BUILD, BUILD, BUILD but I don't even know where to begin. All of my theoretical knowledge of SWE is just a soup of classes, data structures, and OOP but I can't apply it. Maybe I'm just used to having professors give me a structed course and steps to learn but I just can't teach myself. I don't even know what I want to learn. Front-end, back-end, app dev, full stack, the list goes on. I decided last month that I wanted to create a full-stack app using React/Typescript/Firebase that connects local musicians together through a social platform allowing them to find others who share the same musical taste as them. For example, if someone who doesn;t know about the local music scene around them they could create an account and list the instrument they play, experience, and what music they like. And then others could find them on this site and message them and arrange a meet. I thought this would be a cool idea and I could show recruiters or whoever. Since I had no experience building anything at that scale with Auth, Email Verification, Rate limiting I used Claude Code to help me design it. Obviously I'm not a vibe coding monkey since I have the theoretical and programmer brain from my CS degree but I still had no idea what I was actually coding. I could see a chunks of code and understand it how it does a specific function but going line by line I didn't know what it actually did. But after a couple weeks I got a MVP, rough documentation of the systems, and rigorously debugged and tested it. And it works. Yeah there's some rough spots and the CSS/design isn't the best but it works. The thing is from this project I just learned how to do system design and product management. I created a product and got an output but I never understood the middle part, the actual programming. And now I finally understand that I just hate programming and it isn't for me. So now I'm having a career crisis (I haven't even started my career yet) and scrambling to find out what I need to do. The data world seems interesting so I started to lookup what it means to be a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and AI/ML Engineer. From what I understand, everything past a Data Analyst is heavy programming so I don't want to do that. I know intermediate Python and basic SQL and little bit of Excel so maybe Data Analyst is something I should do? I messed around with Pandas and CSV files and I like how I can see trends from just mounds of data. I also kinda like Stats and Prob in college but idk. I would like to pivot to become a Data Analyst but idek where to begin. Do I get a cert like the IBM Data Analyst or is that a waste of time.

Larger companies want someone who has been writing Python for the past 5 years, or has been writing C++ for the past 5 years.They want an experienced dev ops engineer that has only done dev ops, a database engineer that only optimizes databases, a researcher that has only been doing statistical modeling for the past 5 years.Because I will have a lot of free time very soon, I wanted to ask if anyone has experience going from working at a small company and needing to be proficient in everything to joining a larger company where they are only responsible for one thing.

I ended up building an app in Java for both Android and desktop, and that’s when I realized I actually enjoy building software.Being the nerd I am, I started digging into whether Java is enough to build real-world apps and land a dev job. That’s when I found out Kotlin is basically the go-to for Android now, so I switched and started learning it.Fast forward: I’ve built a few apps with Kotlin. I understand a decent amount, but I’m definitely not an expert yet. Still learning, still breaking things, still enjoying the process.What’s messing with my head is this:I’ve used AI agents to implement features in my apps that I haven’t fully learned yet, and they work surprisingly well. Almost too well. It made me wonder—should I really spend years learning all this deeply if tools can already do a lot of the heavy lifting?So I’m a bit confused about direction right now:* Should I double down on Kotlin and Android dev?* Does Kotlin/Android actually have a solid future career-wise?* Is it realistic to aim for a job with this path?* Or am I setting myself up to learn skills that’ll be half-automated by the time I’m job-ready?I enjoy building apps a lot, and I like understanding how things work under the hood.
