1pju9s2,"Mid-level, but my Python isn’t",kerokero134340,dataengineering,"I’ve just been promoted to a mid-level data engineer. I work with Python, SQL, Airflow, AWS, and a pretty large data architecture. My SQL skills are the strongest and I handle pipelines well, but my Python feels behind.Context: in previous roles I bounced between backend, data analysis, and SQL-heavy work. Now I’m in a serious data engineering project, and I do have a senior who writes VERY clean, elegant Python. The problem is that I rely on AI a lot. I understand the code I put into production, and I almost always have to refactor AI-generated code, but I wouldn’t be able to write the same solutions from scratch. I get almost no code review, so there’s not much technical feedback either.I don’t want to depend on AI so much. I want to actually level up my Python: structure, problem-solving, design, and being able to write clean solutions myself. I’m open to anything: books, side projects, reading other people’s code, exercises that don’t involve AI, whatever.If you were in my position, what would you do to genuinely improve Python skills as a data engineer? What helped you move from “can understand good code” to “can write good code”?EDIT: Worth to mention that by clean/elegant code I meant that it’s well structured from an engineering perspective. The solution that my senior comes up with, for example, isn’t really what AI usually generates, unless u do some specific prompt/already know some general structure. e.g. He hame up with a very good solution using OOP for data validation in a pipeline, when AI generated spaghetti code for the same thing",144,0.95,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pju9s2/midlevel_but_my_python_isnt/,2025-12-11 10:28:26,2025-12-14 01:53:05

I used to be part of the data department where everyone was either a data engineer or a data scientist with more or less seniority.

I am extremely worried because we are essentially building a data product, which means that this person will be tasked with making architectural decisions with no knowledge about data engineering, but also I'm worried about my professional development as I'm MUCH more experienced about data stuff compared to my new manager / team lead so I'm not sure exactly what I can learn from him in that area.I won't go into details, but essentially we're building data pipelines with complex models that require an understanding of a complex domain, and the result of this processing is displayed on a UI that is sold to the customer.Has something like this happened at some of your companies?

1pj0iyr,Spark uses way too much memory when shuffle happens even for small input,Aggravating_Log9704,dataengineering,"I ran a test on Spark with a small dataset (about 700MB) doing some map vs groupBy + flatMap chains. With just map there was no major memory usage but when shuffle happened memory usage spiked across all workers, sometimes several GB per executor, even though input was small. From what I saw in the Spark UI and monitoring: many nodes had large memory allocation, and after shuffle old shuffle buffers or data did not seem to free up fully before next operations.  The job environment was Spark 1.6.2, standalone cluster with 8 workers having 16GB RAM each. Even with modest load, shuffle caused unexpected memory growth well beyond input size. I used default Spark settings except for basic serializer settings. I did not enable off-heap memory or special spill tuning.I think what might cause this is the way Spark handles shuffle files: each map task writes spill files per reducer, leading to many intermediate files and heavy memory/disk pressure. I want to ask the community* Does this kind of shuffle-triggered memory grab (shuffle spill mem and disk use) cause major performance or stability problems in real workloads* What config tweaks or Spark settings help minimize memory bloat during shuffle spill* Are there tools or libraries you use to monitor or figure out when shuffle is eating more memory than it should",48,0.91,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pj0iyr/spark_uses_way_too_much_memory_when_shuffle/,2025-12-10 11:45:00,2025-12-14 01:53:05

Users get dashboards, visualizations, rich semantic models across multiple environments, and can define invariants/alerts when certain conditions are met or violated.We have paying customers and a working product, but the architecture has become more complex and ad-hoc than it needs to be (partly because we optimized for customer feedback over cohesion).

1pgcufv,Tired of Cleaning Broken Systems — Is It Time to Quit?,ShallowSeashore,dataengineering,"I am a 36-year-old accountant working in the UAE passionate about data and automation. I have been with a financial services company for more than 10 years. Over the years, my work has evolved: I started in front-office operations, then moved into complex reconciliations, later handled end-to-end accounting (A to Z) for a sister company, and eventually returned to financial services.My role has never been clearly defined. I am usually brought in to solve problems. I have access to an Oracle database now and I know basic SQL (not advanced). I also have strong Excel and VBA skills. I’ve regularly used these skills to solve operational problems, build logic, help write scripts, and set rules in vendor-provided tools to automate reconciliations. I also helped create Excel templates for reporting.I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, along with SQL courses and basic Python, although I can’t recall everything well now. I’ve done some reconciliation work in BigQuery using SQL (often with ChatGPT support), but in my actual day-to-day job I mostly use standard queries like SELECT, GROUP BY, WHERE, and HAVING—nothing very advanced.My dilemma is this: my company has huge backlogs, but the core problems are not about writing the right query or automating something. The real issues are poor initial setups, incorrect postings, bad historical decisions, and choosing the wrong cheap vendors to cut the cost. We’re trying to “clean the garage,” but the garage is fundamentally broken—missing data, open loops, and structural issues that can’t realistically be fixed.What makes it worse is that old staff are defensive. They won’t allow corrections that might expose their past mistakes because it affects their reputation. The expectation is: you’re here to fix things, but without the authority or data needed to actually fix them.Because I commute around 5 hours a day, I arrive at work already exhausted. I struggle to learn new skills consistently. This has left me stressed, stagnant, and feeling useless—trying to clean deeply broken systems alone, with no real progress in either my career or my technical growth.So I am stuck between these options:1) Stay with the company, learn very slowly, continue firefighting, take blame for issues I didn’t create, remain stressed, and feel that my career and skill set are not progressing.2) Go back to my home country, focus seriously on learning (properly and deeply), work on real projects, join something structured like Zoomcamp or another bootcamp, and try to move into freelance or remote work. I see people around me leveraging new tools, AI, automation, and platforms like n8n—while I feel stuck in a toxic environment with almost no time or energy to grow. My fear here is losing time and professional reputation.3) Any other option I’m not seeing?",36,0.91,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pgcufv/tired_of_cleaning_broken_systems_is_it_time_to/,2025-12-07 07:54:01,2025-12-14 01:53:05

1pjv8za,Apache spark shuffle memory vs disk storage what do shuffle write and spill metrics really mean,Old-Roof709,dataengineering,"I am debugging a Spark job where the input size is small but the Spark UI reports very high shuffle write along with large shuffle spill memory and shuffle spill disk. For one stage the input is around 20 GB, but shuffle write goes above 500 GB and spill disk is also very high. A small number of tasks take much longer and show most of the spill.The job uses joins and groupBy which trigger wide transformations. It runs on Spark 2.4 on YARN.

Spark then writes intermediate data to local disk under spark.local.dir and later merges those files.What is not clear is how much of this behavior is expected due to shuffle mechanics versus a sign of inefficient partitioning or skew.

1pjfyde,Choosing data stack at my job,Wild-Ad1530,dataengineering,"Hi everyone, I’m a junior data engineer at a mid-sized SaaS company (~2.5k clients). When I joined, most of our data workflows were built in n8n and AWS Lambdas, so my job became maintaining and automating these pipelines. n8n currently acts as our orchestrator, transformation layer, scheduler, and alerting system basically our entire data stack.We don’t have heavy analytics yet; most pipelines just extract from one system, clean/standardize the data, and load into another. But the company is finally investing in data modeling, quality, and governance, and now the team has freedom to choose proper tools for the next stage.In the near future, we want more reliable pipelines, a real data warehouse, better observability/testing, and eventually support for analytics and MLOps. I’ve been looking into Dagster, Prefect, and parts of the Apache ecosystem, but I’m unsure what makes the most sense for a team starting from a very simple stack.Given our current situation (n8n + Lambdas) but our ambition to grow, what would you recommend? Ideally, I’d like something that also helps build a strong portfolio as I develop my career.Obs: I'm open to also answering questions on using n8n as a data tool :)Obs2: we use aws infrastructure and do have a cloud/devops team.

1phaejg,Career isn't really moving in the right direction and I'm worried I'll turn into a reporting analyst. Can't tell if market is shit or I'm overvaluing myself,Captain_Strudels,dataengineering,"Went from senior analyst for a decently large tech company to intermediate engineer for an org a bit further along than ""startup"". I'm desperately trying to move my career to something closer to ""software engineer with data skills"" but I can't seem to land the right role. The org I've been with for the past year-ish has been focused on very grimy, hands-on data migrations for individual clients into our system - data entry with extra steps. I'm trying to take on projects that solve bigger problems, like getting involved with fleshing out our warehouse and providing reporting views for all of our customers rather than bespoke reports for individual customers.However the business seems REALLY keen on just keeping me in a little silo and handing off the important projects to our devs. I'm told migrations are the #1 priority, so proper pipeline building is sitting elsewhere as I keep the lights on. The migration work is absolutely soul destroying and mind numbing, but the volume of it keeps me from progressing more meaningful internal projects for my career.Whats more, the business has identified individual customer bespoke report building as an untapped revenue stream and is prepping to shift me much more onto it, so I seem to have even less room to negotiate doing anything else. And my attempts at working closer with the devs was dashed as we recently underwent something of a restructure that silo'd the data team further from them.I feel like my org just needs a cheap grunt to process customer data instead of an engineer, and that's totally cool, but I can't tell if my inability to climb internally or find a better role elsewhere is because I keep landing roles that fundamentally won't progress me or if I'm not learning the right skills in my own time. * I think my SQL skills are great - not like ""I can do the craziest shit in SQL"" amazing, but I've always been one of the better SQL writers in my orgs. I don't think I have much to say here.* I think my Python skills are mediocre but not a complete handicap. This year, since starting my new role, I've made some basic scripts to help me with processing data before pushing into our system, mainly with Polars/Pandas. But frankly this was largely prompted so I could deliver at speed. I'm fine with reading and debugging code on my own. But I've never been in much of a situation where I've needed to write code for the business, and when I review code written by our senior devs, I can tell I have no idea about proper project structuring. In prior analyst roles I mainly worked with R to solve complex data problems, so I'm not that unexposed to more traditional programming languages.* I haven't really had to work with LINQ but I've had exposure. It doesn't seem to come up in job listings so I assume it's more for SWEs who happen to be doing some data work in C#?* re: cloud tech, I'm not sure if I'm bringing anything to the table. Current org uses Azure, last org used GCP, haven't worked with AWS before. But ultimately none of this has affected me beyond using the company's choice of data interface, eg SQL Server, BigQuery, etc. In my current org I am lightly dabbling in Azure-specific key vaults and blob storage, but I don't know if I should suddenly be throwing this on the CV.* I think my GIT is fine? Like I'm not rebasing branches but I'm able to do the basics to contribute to a code base.* Soft skills I don't have the best measure on. I think they're good given my prior senior experience for a well-renowned org. My ""manager"" (part of senior leadership but the org is quite small so touches base once a week to confirm work is on track) suggested I consider trying to become the data team leader. I don't know if this is realistically happening in my time here.But then I look at senior roles and I don't feel I qualify. There's not much which I think is a product of the global market being a bit shit, and particularly where I live has been hit pretty hard. But the few roles there are skills like advanced Python or specific cloud tech exposure. And I'm like ""I could probably lie and learn it on the role"" but I'm worried I'm giving myself too much credit.Is this a common situation to be in? Is there a way out? Do I just need to grind out Python on my own time for like 6-12 months before I'm allowed to be senior?",22,0.87,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1phaejg/career_isnt_really_moving_in_the_right_direction/,2025-12-08 11:47:46,2025-12-14 01:53:05

1pjqkne,Am I out of my mind for thinking this?,Spooked_DE,dataengineering,"Hello.I am in charge of a pipeline where one of the sources of data was a SQL server database which was a part of the legacy system. We were given orders to migrate this database into a Databricks schema and shut down the old database for good. The person who was charged with the migration then did not order the columns in their assigned positions in the migrated tables in Databricks. All the columns are instead ordered alphabetically. They created a separate table that provided information on column ordering.That person has since left and there have been some big restructure, and this product is pretty much my responsibility now (nobody else is working on this anymore but it needs to be maintained).Anyway, I am thinking of re-migrating the migrated schema with the correct column order in place. The reason is that certain analysts sometimes need to look at this legacy data occasionally. They used to query the source database but that is no longer accessible. So now, if I want this source data to be visible to them in the correct order, I have to create a view on top of each table. It's a very annoying workflow and introduces needless duplication. I want to fix this but I don't know if this sort of migration is worth the risk.

1pjs562,"Am I using DuckDB wrong, or it's really not that good in very low-memory settings?",ihatebeinganonymous,dataengineering,"Hi. Here is the situation:I have a big-ish CSV file, ~700MB gzip and ~5GB decompressed. I have to run a basic SELECT (row-based processing, no group-by) on it, inside a Kubernetes pod with __512MB memory__.I have verified that the Linux gunzip command successfully unzips the file from inside the pod. DuckDB, however, crashes into OOM when directly given the gzip file. I'm using Java with DuckDB JDBC connector.As a workaround, I manually unzip the file and then give it to DuckDB as unzipped. It still failed with OOM. I also followed the advice in docs to set memory_limit, preserve_insertion_order, and threads. This gave me a DuckDB exception instead of the whole process getting killed, but still didn't fix the OOM :DI finally started opening the file in Java code, chunking it into 3000-line or so ""sub-files"", and then processing _those_ with DuckDB, after some try and fail. But then I was wondering, is that the best DuckDB can perform?All the DuckDB benchmarks I can remember were about processing speed, not memory usage.

1pjmcfz,Using higher order functions and UDFs instead of joins/explodes,echanuda,dataengineering,"Recently at work I was tasked with optimizing our largest queries (we use spark—mainly SQL). I’m relatively new to Spark’s distributed paradigm, but I saw that most time was being spent with explosions and joins—mainly shuffling data a lot.In this query, almost every column’s value is a key to the actual value which lies in another table. To make matters worse, most of the ingest data are array types. So the idea here was to1. Never explode2. Never use joinsThe result is a combination of transform/filter/flattens to operate on these array elements and map them with several pandas UDFs (one for each join table) to map values from broadcasted dataframes.This ended up shortening our pipeline more than 50x, from 1.5h to just 5 minutes (the actual transformations take ~1 minutes, the rest is one-time cost setup of ~4 minutes).Now, I’m not really in charge of the data modeling, so whether or not that would be the better problem to tackle here isn’t really relevant (though do tell if it would!).

1pkgak4,"Migrating to Microsoft Databricks or Microsoft Azure Synapse from BigQuery, in the future - is it even worth it?",tytds,dataengineering,"Hello there – I'm fairly new to data engineering and just started learning its concepts this year. I am the only data analyst at my company in the healthcare/pharmaceutical industry.We don't have large data volumes. Our data comes from Salesforce, Xero (accounting), SharePoint, Outlook, Excel, and an industry-regulated platform for data uploads. Before using cloud platforms, all my data fed into Power BI where I did my analysis work. This is no longer feasible due to increasingly slow refresh times.I tried setting up an Azure Synapse warehouse (with help from AI tools) but found it complicated. I was unexpectedly charged $50 CAD during my free trial, so I didn't continue with it.I opted for BigQuery due to its simplicity. I've already learned the basics and find it easy to use so far.I'm using Fivetran to automate data pipelines. Each month, my MAR usage is consistently under 20% of their free 500,000 MAR plan, so I'm effectively paying nothing for automated data engineering. With our low data volumes, my monthly Google bills haven't exceeded $15 CAD, which is very reasonable for our needs. We don't require real-time data—automatic refreshes every 6 hours work fine for our stakeholders.That said, it would make sense to explore Microsoft's cloud data warehousing in the future since most of our applications are in the Microsoft ecosystem. I'm currently trying to find a way to ingest Outlook inbox data into BigQuery, but this would be easier in Azure Synapse or Databricks since it's native. Additionally, our BI tool is Power BI anyway.My question: Would it make sense to migrate to the Microsoft cloud data ecosystem (Microsoft Databricks or Azure Synapse) in the future? Or should I stay with BigQuery? We're not planning to switch BI tools—all our stakeholders frequently use Power BI, and it's the most cost-effective option for us. I'm also paying very little for the automated data engineering and maintenance between BigQuery and Fivetran. Our data growth is very slow, so we may stay within Fivetran's free plan for multiple years.

1pgbhcq,Data lake as a service,ihatevacations,dataengineering,"Hey all, I had an idea for a data lake visualization tool but I don't know if this is a pain point that other engineers have as well. When I used to work on a team that built a data lake on top of AWS technologies (S3, DMS, Redshift, Glue, Athena, Lake Formation, etc) I found it a bit hard to visualize the data flow since everything was a bit scattered, though having the architecture diagram helped a little bit. Aside from visualization, the AWS monthly bill was eye watering and it had a bunch of operational issues. Observability was a bit of a pain too since we had to create alarms for each table and each database in Glue. This is just my experience from working on a data lake that was built from scratch.This might be a stupid idea but I was thinking about possible ways to make it easier to build data lakes and manage everything in an all-in-one platform, from prototyping to testing to observability. Especially for smaller companies that don't have the luxury of spending many hundreds of thousands of dollars per month in infrastructure costs, they can use smaller machines to setup a data lake and expand it as they go. To start off, the idea is to build a visualization tool where you can use your choice of hosting / tools, for example S3 or your own blob storage, and execute scripts to perform transformations on that data and build a data lake from there. It would include ways to automate observability by automatically setting up alarms as you connect different pieces together.Is this a pain point that others face as well? Does something like this exist already? And would something like this be worth building?",6,0.88,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pgbhcq/data_lake_as_a_service/,2025-12-07 06:29:43,2025-12-14 01:53:05

1pi4dtl,Protobuf schema-based fake data generation tool,SnooHabits4703,dataengineering,"I have created an open-source \[protobuf schema-based fake data creation tool\](https://github.com/lazarillo/protoc-gen-fake) that I thought I'd share with the community.It's still in \*very early\* stages; it does fully work and there is some documentation, but I don't have nice CI/CD GitHub Actions set up for it yet, and I'm sure as folks who are not me start using it, they will either submit issues or code improvements, but I think it's good enough to share with an avant garde group willing to give me some constructive feedback.I have used protocol buffers as a binary format / hardened schema for many years of my data eng / machine learning career. I have also worked on lots of brand new platforms, where it's a challenge to create realistic, massive scale fake data that looks believable. There are nice tools out there for generating a fake address or a fake name, etc., and in fact I rely upon the nice Rust \[fake\](https://github.com/cksac/fake-rs) package. But nothing did the ""final step"", IMHO, of taking a schema that has already been defined and using that schema to generate realistic, complex fake data of exactly the structure you may need.At its core, I have used protobuf's \[options\](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#options) as a mechanism to define what sort of fake data you want to generate. The package includes two examples to explain itself, here is the simpler one:\`\`\` syntax = ""proto3""; package examples; import ""gen_fake/fake_field.proto""; message User { option (gen_fake.fake_msg).include = true; string id = 1 [(gen_fake.fake_data).data_type = ""SafeEmail""]; string name = 2 [(gen_fake.fake_data) = { data_type: ""FirstName"" language: ""FR_FR"" }]; string family_name = 3 [(gen_fake.fake_data) = { data_type: ""LastName"" language: ""PT_BR"" }]; repeated string phone_numbers = 4 [(gen_fake.fake_data) = { data_type: ""PhoneNumber"" min_count: 1 max_count: 3 }]; }\`\`\`As you can see, you add the \`gen\_fake.fake\_data\` option type, providing things like the data type, the count of repetitions, and you can supply a language. In the example above, you would get a \`User\` type of data object created with fake data filed in for the UUID, first name, family name, and phone numbers.I'm hoping this can be useful to others. It has been very helpful to me, especially when testing for corner cases like when optional or repeated values are missing, ensuring UTF-8 is being used everywhere and, most importantly, being able to generate the SQL code and whatnot needed for generating downstream derived data before the backend has all the tooling in place to be able to supply the data formats that I need.As an aside, this also helps to encourage the \[data contract\](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/data-contracts) way of working within your organization, a lifesaver tool for robustness and uptime of analytics tools.",5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pi4dtl/protobuf_schemabased_fake_data_generation_tool/,2025-12-09 10:45:55,2025-12-14 01:53:05
1pi3lpb,How do you approach solution design? (And bit of a rant),Ulfrauga,dataengineering,"Maybe a dumb question, maybe not. In your data team, do you conduct solution design reviews? Do you even have a deliberate solution design phase?I might be wrong in my usage of ""solution design""; go ahead and correct me if so. What I mean is more simply - how do you intend to achieve the required output, or meet the requirements?Contrived example: What they want is the classic ""build a report"". Or maybe just the data model to hand over to someone else to build a report with. Raw data is not ingested. So, let's say that simply, you have to ingest, model, and deliver.* But what does the development of that outcome look like?* How do you break down the work?* What objects are you going to create?* Where do you put this information and decision points?* Does a peer review this ""design""?* Who ""sets"" this design?This is where I might be venturing off topic, but it's why I'm asking - how do others in the industry do this stuff, and to what standard? I'm not above thinking I might be looking for problems where there are none, or making drama and pointing fingers. On the other hand, maybe my concerns are valid.I'm the senior in my team (of two ICs). Not the manager, but the tech ""lead"". I've talked quite a lot with my more junior colleague about the benefits of planning stuff out, coming up with a ""design"", and going over it together. Two sets of eyes and all that. IMO it's a fundamental development concept. Applicable to data work as much as baking a wedding cake.I don't see a lot of planning, or pipeline and data model design being done. Maybe it happens on a paper notebook? That's fine to an extent, but it doesn't appear to be transferred to the ticket system, DevOps items, or even a Word doc in SharePoint. We have regular time slots to discuss current work and otherwise chat generally about what we do. It's meant to be pretty informal. This is sometimes when we might do a ""design review"" but it tends to be based on verbal description of what is being done, and a remote view of developmental code. I'll give feedback, but it's 50/50 if it drives any change.We use branching and PRs with reviews. The PR review has become an opportunity for reviewing the overall approach and design as much as code review. But at that point, it's sort of too late to be challenging or making suggestions about the overall design. There's been more than a few occasions where I know we have to deliver - value to the business! - but I'm seeing technical debt in the future. Undocumented, sometimes inconsistent, has the feel of thrown-together.I want to bring it up with my manager, I just need to frame it well. It could easily come across as complaining about someone who simply has a different work style to me.Any words of wisdom from the sub?",5,0.86,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pi3lpb/how_do_you_approach_solution_design_and_bit_of_a/,2025-12-09 09:57:17,2025-12-14 01:53:05

I even thought about using flink for this job, but that's maybe over doing it ? Since it's not that complicated of a task? I also wonder if spooldir wouldn't have to read all the file in memory to parse it ?

In simple terms, the purpose of this assistant is so that both customer clients and operations staff can use this assistant to query anything about the current page they are on and/or about their data stored in the db. Then, the assistant will answer based on the available data of the page and from the database. Basically how perplexity works but this will be custom and for this particular website only.For example, client asks 'which of my contracts are active and pending payment?' Then the assistant will be able to respond with details of relevant contracts and their payment details.For db related queries, i do not want the existing db to be queried. So i though of creating a separate backend for this AI assistant and possibly create a duplicate db which is always synced with the actual db. This is when i looked into datalakes. I could possibly store some documents and files for RAG (such as company policy docs) and it will also store the synced duplicate db. Then the assistant will be using this datalake instead for answering queries and be completely independent of the website.Is this approach feasible?

1pjp5q7,"I realized I do like programming, I just hate feeling dumb",Unknown__Redditor__,learnprogramming,"Programming is definitely one of the hardest subjects to MASTER in life. It's certainly the hardest thing for me to grasp. And when I say ""master"", I mean, getting to that point where you're confident in programming apps with little to no lookups. Getting to that point where you can confidently pass live coding interviews.This is the point where I strive to get to, and the only way to do this is by actually learning the material. Hopefully some can relate when I say programming is very much enjoyable when you understand every bit of your code, but it gets frustrating if you have gaps in your knowledge and don't understand certain pieces of your code.When you understand every bit of it, you can literally lay on your bed and figure out the error in your head. If you take shortcuts it's much harder to do so, and you'll end up being at the point where you don't know if you can solve the error no matter how much time you have.I made this post to hopefully motivate you guys to actually learn the material, in which many of you are if you're in this sub.TLDR: If you actually learn the material live coding interviews will be a much smoother process(obviously), and coding will be much more enjoyable since you'll actually feel capable of debugging your app. The only way to get rid of imposter syndrome is by actually proving to yourself that you can do the work, don't take shortcuts.Edit: I also came to the realization that it is highly unlikely to ""master"" programming in the way I depicted it out to be. You won't be able to program everything without looking something up but there's nothing wrong with that.

Lately, I’ve been feeling stuck: my current company no longer offers growth opportunities, either financially or professionally. Overall, it feels like a stagnant situation.This has been weighing on me for a while and I feel like 2026 might be the right year to make a change, starting with improving my English, but also taking a serious step forward in my career.A bit of context about the situation here in Italy:* Being specialized only in frontend isn’t a highly in-demand skill.* On top of that, I keep receiving job offers with salaries that are honestly discouraging and make me feel undervalued.That said, I want to invest both in my English and in my technical skills, but I’m not sure which direction to take. Here are some of the ideas I'm considering:* Buying several courses on Udemy and studying deeply to strengthen my knowledge, improve my CV and hopefully find better opportunities.* Looking into more structured, higher-quality courses (I’m willing to spend a few thousand euros if it’s truly worth it) that might offer stronger guarantees or even connections with companies. I know that in some fields these programs help people land jobs quickly, but I’m not sure if this model works in IT.* Broadening or diversifying my skill set: learning Three.js to specialize in a niche area, moving toward a full-stack role or even switching to game development, which has always interested me. I’m also open to exploring other promising or highly-requested fields.For context, I don’t have a university degree. I’m also seriously considering relocating abroad, actually, that’s one of my main dreams right now, because I’d really like to gain international experience.What do you think?**TL;DR:** 29-year-old frontend dev in Italy feeling stuck with no growth.

I am a current game development student in university, however for some reason my uni's game development department and CS department aren't super cooperative. I have just completed algorithms & data structures class (generally the 3rd CS class you take here) and so far everything we've done has been in java with a bit of python. Our games department does not have any specific programming classes because the assumption is that most of that will be handled by the CS department, however the main engine we use for the game dev classes is UE5 which runs in C++. There is a games scripting class that I've just completed but that's all using blueprints.

Advice I'm seeing tends to be either to read a specific book/forum (which tends to be a \*very\* slow method for me, safe to say I'm generally an audiobook person) or to just ""go and start"", which I can grab a compiler and start googling how something formatted in java is formatted in c++, but that doesn't give me as good of an understanding.

Please do let me know if this happens to be just a Java thing so I can instead ask on that sub.Something I've noticed particularly recently is that, when trying to make something too far past the kind of things we learn about in class, I end up encountering a problem that challenges how I understand the way Java works.A good example of this is when I found some fairly basic code somewhere (the context & specifics of which I've forgotten) that created a ""new Main"" object. This threw me for a loop, as I've really just seen ""Main"" as a container for code that runs when starting a program, and never considered it as an object. I also then realized I have no clue what the ""(String[] args)"" bit means in the main method.So, why are the ""basics"" of programming languages (or again, maybe just Java) things like printing ""hello world"" before you deeply understand what a class is and why the print command is in one?Post-script: A few other examples of being taught a specific use for something without knowing what it does exactly(Side note: ""for some reason"" here just means I didn't know the reason, not that it's unreasonable)- Printing text, which for some reason requires me to add ""System.out."" beforehand- Creating a Scanner object to read user text input, which for some reason requires me to specify ""(System.in)""- Catching all errors, which for some reason requires me to specify ""(Exception e)""- Fixing a Scanner after inputting a number so it correctly takes text input, which for some reason is as simple as executing the command "".nextLine()""EDIT: The (quite helpful!) responses to this were a lot longer than I expected lol, I believe my questions have been answered.

I am in a situation where I am about to take 100% backend job but I am feeling like I might not be cut for it. They seem to have better structure and appreciate code quality and do tests. I currently work as fullstack and been working with c# .net at my current employer for a year. Frontend is my comfort zone with react typescript but I have always been interested in doing proper fullstack work and dig deeper in backend.Thing is at work our code base is just bad, we do not have quality code and unit tests are like ""write them only if you want"" and the ones that are there are unfinished and no one really takes the time to document/explain. When I try to do a backend task I get anxious and I normally rely on copilot for (i know i should not). But also I feel like even if i put the effort the code will not be appreciated. It is the typical ""do now, we fix later"" and later never comes.I know this is a personal preference to be good at something as most work places do not care about code quality.

This is however, a question to those curious minds wanting to understand and learn OpenGL. Or even just want to know how computer graphics works in general. First, some context.A while ago I undertook the arduous task of learning OpenGL. From all the basics of drawing primitives and up to advanced concepts such as compute shaders and volumetric cloud rendering. The entire process was an immense learning curve and honestly felt like I was relearning how to program. The result is a procedurally generated universe where you can explore endless galaxies and solar systems. However, it is still unfinished and I will continue working on it.I found that while learning OpenGL you are bombarded with terminology, and it can be quite difficult to take these concepts and develop your own ideas. So, I was thinking of making a series that introduces you into the concepts needed, and develop an intuitive understanding of graphics programming. Then each concept we learn we can apply that to our custom program.So my question is, would any of you be interested in this? Would you have any recommendations? Or should I scrap this idea? I already have a 'thumbnail' (not a very well thought out one) that I put together if anyone would like to see it. I will provide a link to a google docs if that is allowed. Once again, it is an unfinished project but I will continue to develop it and add new features as the series continues.Once again, sorry if this is not the right subreddit to be posting to.Thank you! :)",8,0.85,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pg9rcg/a_guide_to_opengl/,2025-12-07 04:52:57,2025-12-14 01:53:06

1plaqc8,[Python] TypeError with floats using gmpy2 library,cton999,learnprogramming,"Hello, I am new to and testing out the gmpy2 library to eventually use in other python code, but I have ran into some type of TypeError problem.>**1. What is the problem?**gmpy2.is\_integer() is saying that floats that are equivalent to a whole number (i.e. 2.0) are integers, but when using gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) with ""whole number"" floats, it raises a TypeError where only integers or rational arguments are allowed.>**1. What is your code supposed to do?**Currently, I'm just testing simple mathematics operations and learning the gmpy2 library. My code is supposed to check what the type of input is for 2 numbers you select (through gmpy2.is\_integer() ), and do either gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) for integers, or do gmpy2.div(x, y) for floats.>**2. What is your code doing instead?**See: ""1. What is the problem?"">**3. What inputs, if any, cause the problem?**Floats and gmpy2.mpfr() created floats that are equivalent to whole numbers, like 2.0.>**4. Is there an error message of some kind? If so, include it.**Yes: TypeError: qdiv() requires 1 or 2 integer or rational arguments>**2. What have you tried?**I can easily use the normal python isinstance(x, float), convert ""whole number"" floats to integers, or just use gmpy2.div(x, y) or some other division, but that is not the problem. The problem is with gmpy2.is\_integer() and/or gmpy2.qdiv(x, y).For the code, I have tried using the first number as a float, the second number for a float, both numbers as floats, and those three combinations as gmpy2.mpfr() floats as well.>**1. What have you already tried to debug your own problem? Where do you suspect the problem is? What uncertainties do you have?**Printing gmpy2.is\_integer(x) and gmpy2.is\_integer(y) both return True when both x and y are ""whole number"" floats, and then gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) raises the TypeError, so I'd say the problem would be when I use gmpy2.is\_integer() or gmpy2.qdiv(x, y).>**2. What precisely are you confused by?**I am confused that gmpy2.is\_integer() is saying that ""whole number"" floats are integers, but then gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) says I'm not using integers.>**3. Have you tried googling for answers? If so, what search queries have you tried? What pages have you read? What do you find confusing about them?**I have like 20 tabs open that are gmpy2 docs, and various searches with different ways to ask about my problem. For example: ""gmpy2 is\_integer"", ""gmpy2 qdiv"", ""gmpy2 qdiv with whole number floats"", and ""Why does gmpy2.is\_integer() returns True for ""whole number"" mpfr floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them?"". For the last search, I got exactly 2 results, both of which are just gmpy2 documentation.On the gmpy2 docs, is\_integer() → bool. Return True if x is an integer; False otherwise, and gmpy2.qdiv(*x*, *y=1*, */*) → mpz| mpq. Return x/y as mpz if possible, or as mpq if x is not exactly divisible by y.I am aware that gmpy2.is\_integer() returns True is a float checked is equivalent to a whole number. I am also aware that gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) only works on integer and rational arguments.So what I'm confused about is why gmpy2.is\_integer() returns True for ""whole number"" floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them.>**DO** be sure to actually ask a question.Why does gmpy2.is\_integer() returns True for ""whole number"" floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them?>Anyways, here's the actual code import gmpy2 def test(x, y):     rlist = []     z = gmpy2.mul(x, y)     rlist.append(z)     h = gmpy2.add(x, y)     rlist.append(h)     if gmpy2.is_integer(x) and gmpy2.is_integer(y) is True:         print (gmpy2.is_integer(x))         print (gmpy2.is_integer(y))         j = gmpy2.qdiv(x, y)         rlist.append(j)     else:         i = gmpy2.div(x, y)         rlist.append(i)     return rlist print (test(4, 2.0))",5,0.86,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1plaqc8/python_typeerror_with_floats_using_gmpy2_library/,2025-12-13 02:51:55,2025-12-14 01:53:06

Each piece of domino can rotate freely. All grids must be filled, and must fit the constraints (e.g. 3 cells need to be different, 4 cells add up to 17, etc...) At first the game is interesting, then I tried to dig into the coding details behind it (where I cannot think at all). I have two main questions:1. How is the board generated? (Note: the holes can sometimes be in a loop (like today), or be jammed all together into a irregular piece, or a regular piece, so it can't be simply like a grid) 2. How do you verify that there is only one placement on the board? (i.e. how do you build a constraint solver such that you can verify there is only this solution?)2b. How to quantify the difficulty of a puzzle? (steps needed to solve? How many possible combinations?)\--my thoughts--For my first question, I thought of generating e.g. a 8x8 grid, then deleting all the empty spaces, but how do I ensure that sufficient amount of dominoes stick together and form a clump, instead of discrete dominoes floating inside the grid?For my second question, of course I can write a program to test all the combinations, but factoring in the orientation of the dominoes, there are at least 12! \* 4 (1.9 billion) placements, and it can be displaced (AB , CD) vs (XA, BC, DX), so its much more than that.",3,0.81,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1phcinf/i_want_to_learn_how_to_build_an_irregular_grid/,2025-12-08 13:34:28,2025-12-14 01:53:06
1phbony,Can’t decide between C# and Java for backend — need advice,Only-Stress7546,learnprogramming,"I can’t decide which programming language to choose. My dilemma: C# or Java? I want to become a backend developer. I know the differences between these languages, and I’m familiar with the syntax of both. But I need to pick one so I can move forward: learn the frameworks, build pet projects, and eventually find a job. Some people might say: “Just pick one, and you can switch later. It won’t take much time.” But for me, as someone who is still learning, switching would cost a lot of time — learning a new framework, building a new project, and preparing again for interviews. I like C# and its ecosystem. But I’ve heard online and from a developer I know (he works with Kotlin) that C# is used in a narrow range of tasks — more like a “plug” inside big projects. So I’m afraid I’ll end up working on small or insignificant parts instead of medium or large projects. I’m from Ukraine, and here the number of C# and Java vacancies is roughly the same. But I want to work abroad. For example, in Canada I see around 200–300 .NET vacancies, and around 900 Java ones. In the US, depending on the region, .NET has about 200–300 openings, while Java has 1,000–2,000. Maybe I’m filtering incorrectly, but maybe that’s the real picture. It looks like C# roles are two or three times less common, which probably means fewer interesting projects. But the internet is full of conflicting opinions: some recommend C# for the backend, while others trash it. It seemed like the obvious choice: Java. Just pick Java and be done with it. But the choice isn't so simple for me. Perhaps I seem strange with my dilemma.

For context, I am currently working on a little Latain learning side project and I am trying to setup a specific subclass for that. The background is that latin has a lot of suffixes that occur under a combination of properties that the given word has. The two properties that are currently of interest for me are the Numerus (an Enum) and the Casus (another Enum).My first instinct was to create a two dimensional array for that, but I quickly realised that this will lead to confusion problems if I don't know at any given point in time in which order the suffixes are actually placed into the array, because they aren't linked to the values of the Enum directly.To circumvent this, I quickly figured out that I actually wanted to use the values of the Enum directly and map specific values in a table like fashion to them, basically like:(Singular, Nominative, ""us"")(Singular, Accusative, ""um"")Etc.So I wrote this class here:https://github.com/Hellinfernel/Latin-Learing-Program/blob/main/latin%2FBiEnumMap.java#L19Now the thing is I still don't have any idea if my approach here is even technically doable because I don't know how to get an collection of all the values of an given Enum class.I tried EnumSet and Enum directly, but none of that seemed to really function and I couldn't find a function in the docs that fulfilled my requirements, and I feel like I am either completely and utterly blind or am just not searching in the right place.I am pretty sure my code has other problems as well, but for now I just would like to know the following:How do I get a list of all values of a given Enum class to use them as an index for a map?",2,0.67,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1plrpk3/creating_a_two_dimensional_collection_that_takes/,2025-12-13 18:02:53,2025-12-14 01:53:06

1pj9hj2,Joined Microsoft as a new grad and I’m miserable,aBadassCutiePie,cscareerquestions,"Graduated in June and joined Microsoft as a new grad software engineer in Prague. Before that, I spent over two years working at a startup, and honestly those were the best years of my degree. I had close on-site friends, we built creative features, brainstormed ideas, and it genuinely felt fun going into the office every day.Now I’m ~6 months into MSFT and I seriously don’t know if this is normal. On paper everything is great, my winter review says I’m exceeding expectations, my manager and team are super happy with me, and objectively nothing is “wrong.”But emotionally? It’s been rough. Most days I’m anxious, constantly scared I’m not performing enough. Half the week ends with me feeling overwhelmed, and at least once a week I break down crying at night. I look forward to weekends. No matter how much I sleep, exercise, meditate, or whatever, it keeps happening.The work itself isn’t helping. It’s mostly infra, bugs,security standards - barely any coding and zero creativity. My team is nice but almost everyone is remote, and the office is full of people from unrelated teams. Plus people barely talk to each other. I haven’t formed any real friendships here; everything feels formal or “networking-like.” Nothing like the tight on-site friendships I had before.My therapist says there’s probably something else causing this anxiety (also generally I’m someone with big self-imposed expectations of myself). But I can’t shake the feeling that I should be happy - isn’t working at such a company every CS student’s dream?I’m confused and honestly worried. Is this just normal for big tech grads in Europe?

Unsure where to go.,shamanshaman123,cscareerquestions,"I was a software eng at a somewhat big company for 9 years and 8 months until about 2 hours ago. For the last 2 years, I've honestly been kind of circling the drain and struggling to keep up with the other devs. I managed a senior promotion about 5 years into the job, but was promoted based on my fullstack work, which involved a lot of frontend; almost immediately after getting promoted, I was shunted into mostly backend, which I was able to maintain for about 2 years (although just barely, IMO) since we worked in Node.js.2 years ago, my team switched to Java, which I had very little experience in. I deeply struggled to keep up with the team, which at this point were experienced Java developers. The struggle overtook me, and I made dozens of mistakes, some small, some big. Admittedly, I didn't do anything outside of work; I tried to maintain WLB and stick to working during working-hours only, and didn't do any other prep or studying or projects outside of work hours. After many conversations about performance with my manager, they decided to let me go without a PIP or anything; just fired.Despite working in backend for 4 years now I feel like my backend skills are garbage. But since I had no opportunities during work to do any frontend work, my frontend skills have also decayed significantly to the point that I'm fairly sure I can't pass an interview based on it. On top of all that, the job I had was my first software job out of college, so I don't have experience with other companies to work with. I feel at least a little screwed (this is about as optimistic a take I can give), and extremely directionless; backend clearly isn't a good fit for me, and my frontend skills are junior-level at best. I have no idea how to present myself for interviews, or what to prepare for; I'm considering taking a frontend bootcamp to try and modernize my skills to _hopefully_ be able to get a frontend role, but I'm terrified that I can't maintain a senior skill level. It's frustrating because I know I have at least some experience to draw on; I couldn't have kept this job for so long without at least doing something right at some point. But it all feels so murky.If anyone has been in a similar position or has any advice, I would gladly take it. I don't mind if it's harsh; I'm not in a position to complain.

1ph4ux0,Array Reversal as a Filtering Question,Inner_Butterfly1991,cscareerquestions,"I'm a Tech Lead at a company you've heard of and I have 11 yoe. I'm typically anti-LC in interviews, my style is typically I pick the project they've listed on their resume that seems the most interesting both in terms of level of difficulty and just of interest to me, and drill super deep on it to really tease out if they did what they said they did. And 9/10 times that works. But until you've interviewed lots of people, you don't realize how good some people are at bullshitting. This is why LC exists, and it's why we implemented at least a super basic tech screen. We're a data team so we give them a sample dataset from data we actually work with, and ask them to do some super basic transformations and aggregations. We'll also work with them and are very forgiving, we're not looking for you to get the answer even, but we're looking for the signs that you actually understand the super basics and when given feedback can adjust your approach and at least have the right mindset.So back to the title, it astounded me when there was a post in this sub where someone was super upset that reversing an array without using the reverse function would be a question, as that was too much of memorizing algorithms. If we were talking an LC hard then sure I agree. But to anyone who knows the basics about programming this should be super easy. But given all the pushback I reconsidered, and I tested myself to ensure I could do it. And within 5 minutes I had 3 different solutions. Again I don't do LCs regularly, I've done some in job prep but we're talking about \~10 hours in my life and I'm on my 4th job. I don't think I've ever successfully done a hard, and although I can easily do most easy ones and am around 50/50 at mediums, there was one easy I failed on. I'm definitely not the LC, memorize algorithms type. But again this isn't an algorithm question it's one of the most basic things you can do. I used python but the fundamentals are the same in all languages:1. for i in range(len(array)): array2[len(array) - 1 - i] = array[i] array = array22. j = 0 for i in range(len(array)-1,-1,-1): array2[j] = array[i] j += 1 array = array2And probably the most algorithm answer: i = 0 j = len(array) - 1 while j > i: a = array[i] array[i] = array[j] array[j] = a i += 1 j -= 1And I'd assume in an interview setting it's fine to be running code and refining it, I certainly did when doing especially the last one (I had the while condition j > 0 initially so it was actually re-reversing so ending with the original array). And I get it I have 11 yoe this was talking about a junior level interview. But if there's even an intern on the team, I'm expecting them to be able to figure things out much more complicated than reversing an array, and I don't think that's all that crazy to expect them to be able to do. My analogy I used was saying ""you'll never have to reverse an array at your job"" is similar to if a French to English translator was asked to count to 10 in French, couldn't, and angrily replied ""when am I ever going to be counting to 10 in my job?"" And the answer is you'll be asked to do things so much more difficult, and if you can't count to 10 in the language you're translating from obviously you're not going to be able to perform the job duties.As I mentioned, I've never asked this question in an interview, but I'm asking much harder questions. I'm asking our junior level folks to calculate weighted averages excluding outliers and creating summary statistics by year. I'm then changing the requirements and seeing how they can update their code with the shifting requirements. And I don't think those are even all that hard, they're the bare minimum I'd expect interns to be able to do. We care a lot more about soft skills and perceived willingness to learn, but we need you to be able to do the bare minimum from a technical perspective. Do people really think asking a potential employee whether they can reverse an array is that crazy and means we expect them to memorize algorithms that have nothing to do with the job? This isn't an LC hard, I don't think any of my solutions above are all that crazy or tough to come up with if you understand the basics of arrays and loops. And given how business logic works, it's not even that crazy to be a real world example. What if there are certain values in the array that can't be moved due to government regulation or enterprise requirements so you can only reverse all the other elements while keeping certain values in their place? You can't use a reverse function for that. And that's a hell of a lot tougher of a problem than simple reversal.I don't know I guess it just astounds me that this sub is all about how tough this market is especially for juniors, yet at the same time it's crazy to expect a junior can do something that in my mind is super basic and contrary to the arguments against it does not actually require memorizing any algorithms, just using a little bit of critical thinking about what reversing an array actually is doing (first is last, second is second to last, etc).",199,0.92,188,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ph4ux0/array_reversal_as_a_filtering_question/,2025-12-08 05:57:52,2025-12-14 01:53:07
1phivgo,"I was laid off back in march, started a business. Now the business makes more than my current compsci employment",jablokojuyagroko,cscareerquestions,"**PSA: Rewritten with AI because im not a native speaker.**I Hit 5 years of frontend experience back in March. I was extremely stressed at my last job — hated every single day of it after getting placed on a new project that was basically a legacy nightmare.After about 3 years there, I started noticing the headcount slowly shrinking. I didn’t worry too much because I thought my role was “safe.” because I was replacing the ones that were fired before me. So I went ahead and got preapproved for a mortgage after saving for 7 years rent was draining me.The *next day* after getting preapproved, i kid you not, I got fired with no notice (along with half my department). Had to cancel the mortgage and lost a big chunk of money in the process. That one hurt.I was so burnt out that I just gave up for a bit. Moved back with my parents (super grateful for them) and did absolutely nothing for a month — just walked around, saw old friends, and tried to enjoy life again (best months of my recent life btw).During that time, I realized my parents’ business basically had no online presence. So I decided to build everything: marketing campaigns, data tracking, an ecommerce extension — the whole deal. Spent about 4 months grinding on that while also doing \~10 interviews (all rejections) as you can see I was not super focused on interviewing, and I was very picky. The business slowly started gaining traction online.Then in month 5, I finally got a job through LinkedIn.Fast forward almost a year: This new job pays 30% more than my old one… but I still hate it because it’s legacy stuff again, and I’m scared to leave because the market is rough. I get *zero* LinkedIn messages and feel like I’m getting rusty since no one uses this old tech anymore. I did an interview once during this period, and I was brutally destroyed since I forgot all the ""modern"" tech.BUT at the same time, the online business I built for my parents is on track this December to make *more* than my “new” job. And now people are hearing about it — I’m currently in talks with my first official non-family client to build a platform for them.What I’m trying to say is: if things aren’t working out, and you know tech, just try stuff. Throw things at the wall until something sticks, then grab that opportunity and build it out. You’ll learn a ton, and you might get lucky. Honestly, at this point I feel like that’s more promising than job hunting. I only landed my current job because of a friend — without that, I’m not sure I’d have gotten hired again.Try everything, especially if you’re in your 20s. Something will eventually stick. I think that being a dev, knowing online Ads and marketing is a superpower, you can market anything.Worst part is: I still have zero stability. I can’t rent or get a mortgage right now, so I’m stuck living with my parents… but at least things are moving somewhere.And at the same time, this month december im on track to make more via this online business that my ""new"" job where im paid 30% more than my old job. And people have started to hear, and im on talks to onboard my first official non family client to build a platform for them.With this I just want to say that if shit aint working for you, you know tech, try stuff, throw shit into the wall until something sticks and grab that shit by the horns and improve it, you will learn a lot, and might get lucky. At this point I think its better than lookign for a job, I got extremely lucky with the search specifically thanks to af riend, otherwise I think i would have never gotten a job againTry evertyhing, specially if you are young (20s) , something will stick, get some bartender job or whatever shit, and try to see what is a pain point they have and solve it with your coding skills. On the worse said, I have 0 stability now, and I cant rent anything, nor get a mortgage because of it so im stuck at my parents.

1pgxj2s,Did I waste 4 years on a CS degree if I just want to do Web Dev?,Affectionate-Lie2563,cscareerquestions,"I’m having a weird crisis lately. I spent four years getting a CS degree at UM thinking it was the real path into software. Algorithms, OS theory, compilers, data structures, all of it. I pushed through because everyone kept saying it would prepare me for anything and make me a better engineer long term. But the deeper I get into web development, the more it feels like I trained for the wrong thing. Most of the actual work I want to do is building interfaces, working with APIs, handling state, understanding UX, and shipping features. Meanwhile I’m watching people who spent a few months in focused online schools get hired into the exact same frontend roles I’ve been aiming for. Meanwhile I keep seeing people who took a focused bootcamp and they’re getting hired into the exact same frontend roles I’m aiming for. It almost feels unfair they learned precisely what the job requires while I spent years grinding through concepts that rarely show up in web dev interviews. CS feels geared toward systems engineering, embedded work, data infra, and theory heavy roles not the stuff that shows up in most frontend job postings. So now I’m stuck wondering if I took this long academic route for something I could’ve learned way faster. Or maybe the CS background does matter long term and I’m just not seeing the payoff yet. If you did a traditional CS degree but ended up in frontend, how did you make sense of this?",113,0.9,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pgxj2s/did_i_waste_4_years_on_a_cs_degree_if_i_just_want/,2025-12-07 23:53:46,2025-12-14 01:53:07

I realized this around Junior year of college, but had already sunk enough money to where it wasn't plausible to switch, but I really dislike working in development. At my uni there was a heavy emphasis on theory and more academically oriented programming early on, as opposed to the type and pace of development that devs out in the world. By the time I started building real applications and doing internships, I found every aspect of the job, from planning/design to coding/testing, even the more dev ops/sysadmin parts to be quite draining and I can't imagine myself making a career out of this long term. Most of the advice for developers looking for a career change online is to move into project management, cyber, data analytics or something like that. But all of those are still centered around working with and implementing technical solutions, which is just something that I have no passion for. I'm wondering if anyone else had a similar experience and transitioned to something else? Or if a change like this is even plausible coming from such a technically oriented degree (the irony that I was a computer science major that doesn't like working with computers is not lost on me.)

I get emails with vague subject lines, so I have to open each one to understand what they’re about. Indeed often doesn’t show the posting dates of jobs. LinkedIn is bloated with random buttons, Facebook posts I don’t care about, and spam bots constantly message me.When I look at supposedly ""entry-level"" or ""intern"" job descriptions, I often find stuff that’s obviously AI-generated:Seeking a Junior .NET Developer with 5+ years in development and production support, specializing in .NET Core 8/C# and Visual Studio. Mandatory skills include expert troubleshooting, deep proficiency with New Relic (NRQL) and CloudWatch Logs Insights for advanced observability. Experience with Postman is required, while familiarity with AWS services (Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, etc.) and networking fundamentals is a strong asset.Often these descriptions contain grammar mistakes. Then, when I go to the company’s website I’m greeted with pure horror: basic HTML/CSS, looking like it was scraped in 2006. I go to the ""Careers"" tab on their website and it throws me 404. I open another website and I see the main page with some cringe quotes and random images.Why are they so bad?

1pjlsx3,Can I please get feedback on my Patreon Senior SRE experience?,Icy-Dog-4079,cscareerquestions,"I was rejected but I’d love to see if I can get some honest feedback. I know it’s a lot but I need help because I’m not getting offers!Please take a look.It’s a Senior SRE role.# Patreon SRE – Live Debugging Round (Kubernetes)## Context* Goal of the round:Get a simple web app working end-to-end in Kubernetes and then discuss how to detect and prevent similar production issues.* Environment:Pre-created k8s cluster, multiple YAMLs (base / simple-webapp, test-connection client), some helper scripts.Interviewer explicitly said I could use kubectl and Google; she would also give commands when needed.* There were two main components: 1. Simple web app (server) 2. test-connection pod (client that calls the web app)---## Step 1 – Getting Oriented* At first I wasn’t in the correct namespace; the interviewer told me that and then switched me into the right namespace.* I said I wanted to understand the layout:* Look at the YAMLs and scripts to see what’s deployed.* I used kubectl get pods and kubectl describe to see which pods existed and what their statuses were.---## Step 2 – First Failure: ImagePullBackOff on the Web App* One of the simple-webapp pods was in ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull.* I described my reasoning:* This usually means the image name, registry, or tag is wrong or doesn’t exist.* I used kubectl describe pod to see the exact error; the message complained about pulling the image.* We inspected the deployment YAML and I noticed the image had a tag that clearly looked wrong (something like ...:bad-tag).* I said my hypothesis: the tag is invalid or not present in the registry.* The interviewer said for this exercise I could just use the latest tag, and explicitly told me to change it to :latest.* I asked if she was definitively telling me to use latest or just nudging me to research; she confirmed “use latest.”* I edited the YAML to use the latest tag and then, with her reminder, ran something like:* kubectl apply -f base.yaml (or equivalent)* After reapplying, the web app pod came up successfully with no more ImagePullBackOff.---## Step 3 – Second Failure: test-connection Pod Timeouts* Next, we focused on the test-connection pod that was meant to send HTTP requests to the web app.* I ran kubectl get pods and saw it was going into CrashLoopBackOff.* I used kubectl logs :* The logs showed repeated connection failures / HTTP timeouts when trying to reach the simple web app.* I wasn’t sure if the bug was on the client or server side, so I checked both:* Looked at simple-webapp logs: it wasn’t receiving requests.* Looked again at test-connection logs: client couldn’t establish a connection at all (not even 4xx/5xx — just timeouts).---## Step 4 – Finding the Port Mismatch (Service Bug)* The interviewer suggested, “Maybe something is off with the Service,” and told me to check that YAML.* I opened the simple-webapp Service definition in the base YAML.* I noticed the Service port was set to 81.* The interviewer asked, “What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.* I reasoned:* If the app container is listening on 8080 but the Service exposes 81, the test client will send traffic to 81 and never reach the app.* That matches the timeouts we saw in logs.* I changed the Service port 81 → 8080 and re-applied the YAML with kubectl apply.* The interviewer mentioned that status/health might lag a bit, and suggested I re-check the test-connection logs as the quickest validation.* I ran kubectl logs on the test-connection pod again:* This time, I saw valid HTML in the output, meaning the client successfully connected to the web app and got a response.* At that point, both pods were healthy and the end-to-end path (client → Service → web app) was working. Debugging portion complete.---## Step 5 – Postmortem & Observability DiscussionAfter the hands-on debugging, we shifted into more conceptual SRE discussion.1) How to detect this kind of issue without manually digging?I suggested:* Alerts on:* High CrashLoopBackOff / restart counts for pods.* Elevated timeouts / error rate for the client (e.g., synthetic test job).* Latency SLO violations if a probe endpoint starts timing out.* Use a synthetic “test-connection” job (like the one we just fixed) in production and alert if it fails consistently.2) How to prevent such misconfigurations from shipping?I proposed:* CI / linting for Kubernetes YAML:* If someone changes a Service port, require:* A justification in the PR, and/or* Matching updates to client configs, probes, etc.* If related configs not updated, fail CI or block the merge.* Staged / canary rollouts:* Roll new config to a small subset first.* Watch metrics (timeouts, restarts, error rate).* If they degrade, roll back quickly.* Config-level integration tests:* E.g., a test that deploys the Service and then curls it in-cluster, expecting HTTP 200.* If that fails in CI, don’t promote that config.3) General observability practicesI talked about:* Collecting metrics on:* Pod restarts, readiness/liveness probe failures.* HTTP success/error rates and latency from clients.* Shipping these to a monitoring stack (Datadog/Prometheus/Monarch-style).* Defining SLOs and alerting on error budget burn instead of only raw thresholds, to avoid noisy paging.# Patreon SRE System Design## Context* Format: 1:1 system design / infrastructure interview on a shared whiteboard / CodeSignal canvas.* Interviewer focus: “Design a simple web app, mainly from the infrastructure side.” Less about product features, more about backend/infra, scaling, reliability, etc.---## 1) Opening and Problem Framing* The interviewer started with something like: “Let’s design a simple web app. We’ll focus more on the infrastructure side than full product features.”* The prompt felt very underspecified to me. No concrete business case (not “design a rate limiter” or “notification system”) — just “a web app” plus some load numbers later.* I interpreted it as: “Design the infra and backend for a generic CRUD-style web app.”---## 2) My Initial High-Level ArchitectureWhat I said, roughly in order:* I described a basic setup:* A client (browser/mobile) sending HTTP requests.* A backend service layer running in Kubernetes.* An API gateway in front of the services.* Because he emphasized “infra side” and this was an SRE team, I leaned hard into Kubernetes immediately:* Talked about pods as replicas of the application services.* Mentioned nodes and the K8s control plane scheduling pods onto nodes.* Said the scheduler could use resource utilization to decide where to place pods and how many replicas to run.* When he kept asking “what kind of API gateway?”, I said:* Externally we’d expose a REST API gateway (HTTP/JSON).* Internally, we’d route to services over REST/gRPC.* Mentioned Cloudflare as an example of an external load balancer / edge layer.* Also said Kubernetes already gives us routing & LB (Service/Ingress), and we could have a gateway inside the cluster as well.---## 3) Traffic Numbers & Availability vs Consistency* He then gave rough load numbers:* About 3M users, about 1500 requests/min initially.* Later he scaled the hypothetical to 1500 requests/sec.* I said that at that scale I’d still design with availability in mind:* I repeated my general philosophy: I’d rather slightly over-engineer infra than under-engineer and get availability issues.* I stated explicitly that availability sounded more important than strict consistency:* No requirement about transactions, reservations, or financial double-spend.* I said something like: “Since we’re not talking about hard transactions, I’d bias toward availability over strict consistency.”* That was my implicit CAP-theorem call: default to AP unless clearly forced into CP.---## 4) Rate Limiting & Traffic Surges* When he bumped load to 1500 rps, I proposed:* Add a global rate limiter at the API gateway:* Use a sliding window per user + system-wide.* Look back over the last N seconds; if the count exceeds the threshold, we start dropping or deprioritizing those requests.* Optionally, send dropped/overflow events to a Kafka topic for auditing or offline processing.* I described the sliding-window idea in words:* Maintain timestamps of recent requests.* When a new request arrives, prune old timestamps and check if we’re still under the limit.* I framed the limiter as being attached to or just behind the gateway, based on my Google/Monarch mental model: Gateway → Rate Limiter → Services.* The interviewer hinted that rate limiting can happen even further left:* For example, Cloudflare or other edge/WAF/LB can do coarse-grained rate limiting before we even touch our own gateway.* I acknowledged that and said I hadn’t personally configured that pattern but it made sense.* In hindsight:* I was overly locked into “gateway-level” rate limiting.* I didn’t volunteer the “edge rate limiter” pattern until he nudged me.---## 5) Storage Choices & Scaling Writes* He asked where I’d store the app’s data.* I answered in two stages:1. Baseline: start with PostgreSQL (or similar):* Good relational modeling.* Strong indexing & query capabilities.2. Write-heavy scaling:* If writes become too heavy or sharding gets painful, move to a NoSQL store (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB, MongoDB).* I said NoSQL can be easier to horizontally shard and often handles very high write throughput better.* He seemed satisfied with this tradeoff explanation: Postgres first, NoSQL for heavier writes / easier sharding.---## 6) Scaling Reads & Caching* For read scaling, I suggested:* Add a cache in front of the DB, such as Redis or Memcached.* When he asked if this was “a single Redis instance or…?” I said:* Many teams use Redis as a single instance or small cluster.* At larger scale, I’d want a more robust leader / replica cache tier:* A leader handling writes/invalidations.* Replicas serving reads.* Health checks and a failover mechanism if the leader goes down.* I tied this back to availability:* Multiple cache nodes + leader election so the app doesn’t fall over when one node dies.* I also introduced CDC (Change Data Capture) for cache pre-warming:* Listen to the DB’s change stream / binlog.* When hot rows or tables change, proactively refresh those keys in Redis.* This reduces cache misses and makes read performance more stable.* The interviewer hadn’t heard CDC framed that way and said he learned something from it, which felt positive.---## 7) DDoS / Abuse Protection* He asked how I’d handle a DDoS or malicious traffic.* My answer:* Lean on rate limiting and edge protection:* Use Cloudflare/WAF rules to drop/slow bad IPs or UA patterns.* Use the gateway rate limiter as a second line of defense.* The principle: drop bad traffic as far left as possible so it never reaches core services.* This was consistent with the earlier sliding-window limiter description, but I could have been more explicit about multi-layered protection.---## 8) Deployment Safety, CI/CD & Rollouts* He then moved to deployment safety: how to ship 30–40 times per day without breaking things.* I talked about:a) CI + Linters for Config Changes* Have linters / static checks that:* Flag risky changes in infra/config files (ports, service names, critical flags).* If you touch a sensitive config (like a service port), the pipeline forces you to either:* Update all dependent configs, or* Provide an explicit justification in the PR.* If you don’t, CI fails.* The goal is to prevent subtle config mismatches from even reaching staging.b) Canary / Phased Rollouts* Start with a small slice of traffic (e.g., 3%).* If metrics look good, step up: 10% → 20% → 50% → 100%.* At each stage, monitor:* Error rate.* Latency.* Availability.c) Rollback Strategy* Maintain old and new versions side by side (blue/green or canary).* Use dashboards with old-version vs new-version metrics colored differently.* If new-version metrics spike in errors or latency while old-version remains flat, that’s a strong indicator to rollback.* He seemed to like this part; this matches what many SRE orgs do.---## 9) Security (e.g., SQL Injection)* He asked about protecting against SQL injection and bad input.* My answer, in hindsight, was weaker here:* I mentioned:* Use a service / library to validate inputs.* Potentially regex-based sanitization.* I didn’t clearly say:* Prepared statements / parameterized queries everywhere.* Never string-concatenate SQL.* Use least-privilege DB roles.* So while directionally OK, this answer wasn’t as crisp or concrete as it could have been.",29,0.84,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pjlsx3/can_i_please_get_feedback_on_my_patreon_senior/,2025-12-11 02:18:08,2025-12-14 01:53:07

1pkntlv,Looking to make a list of non-toxic tech companies,parleG_OP,cscareerquestions,"With all the doom and gloom in the tech industry right now, I wanted to hear from this community. What companies do you think are actually good places to work? I’m not talking about top-tier compensation or perks like free food or rides. I mean places where the work feels meaningful, you’re treated with basic respect, you can spend time with your family, and you’re not at risk of getting laid off at the snap of a finger.It feels like in the last 15 years, getting a high paying tech job has become part of people’s identities. The tradeoff is that a lot of us have lost touch with what it means to live a full life, where work is part of life instead of the whole thing. Hobbies, friends, family time, just being a human being. All of that gets pushed aside for the grind.I made the mistake of opening TeamBlind today and that place is a mess. Everything is about who has it worse, who has it better, or people endlessly hyping trillion-dollar companies like it’s their entire reason for being.I don’t expect big tech to magically grow a heart. At the end of the day, these are businesses. So in the spirit of keeping it real, I’d love for people to share workplaces where the culture is actually decent. I’m tired of seeing the 200th post about how terrible Amazon’s culture is. If someone wants a better life, they probably won’t find it in the belly of the beast.To be clear, this isn’t about discouraging anyone from aiming for MAANG if that’s what they want. Go for it. I just want to build a thread where people can say, here are the companies where you can have a career without sacrificing your entire life chasing something you never quite catch.

1pk5eov,Are there actual passionate people who take the time to learn anymore ? Social media around CS suggests a very different Outlook,EstablishmentProof54,cscareerquestions,"Hey, Quick BG—> 3rd year engineering major (focused around software and embedded systems) I work in software primarily (co-ops) 2x Analyst / SDE Co-ops at mid to large size companies in Canada. I feel like traditional coding//problem solving is almost lost. I remember actually liking computers back in school (mid 2010s) and I’m not sitting on a high horse saying I’m better than anyone who prolly went into the field for money or any other reason because that’s not the viewpoint I’m judging this situation from.I’m seeing the market is almost trashed with students who mostly vibe code or really “cracked” students who are building up companies // are also TAs at the same time // also 2x at Amazon. For one end of the spectrum, every other persons got Claude, cursor, Copilot and putting up something in their Bio like “Building (insert words)ly”. You know I felt like in this field there’s a learning part as well where you take the time to get hands on with code , not quickly build something or use AI straight away. AI is great for learning and speed but the way its used to build projects which the “builders” themselves can’t explain most of the code for is pretty shocking. I feel like a lot of GitHub is just trashed with students uploading vibe coded react and next js projects. The other end is filled with really good students who somehow intern in their first year , have 5x internships by 3rd year and go on to be content creators and founders or whatever. Can’t complain about them as such because they probably do good but the question comes here, Where are the people who actually take the time to learn things , maybe not go so fast (I’m aware people have differences in learning speeds but it’s very absurd with the way it’s going). What I mean is the emphasis on theory and understanding stuff little by little , building up on it and then going onto be a very Good software engineer/ programmer / problem solver. As I said people probably can learn quickly but it almost feels like there’s no time on the software side of things to actually learn things properly (Web dev/ App dev the fields I’ve worked in). However on the other side of my degree which has circuits and embedded systems , it’s not so easy to get in and you can’t fake your way into it either. The barrier to entry is very high but at the same time if you’re good at your job you’re not easy to replace either. It still has the essence of the old comp sci when it was a subject to me in middle school. Everyone at the time I feel (mid 2010s) took the time to learn stuff and didn’t go so fast but the good part of the trade was they were genuinely very good at what they did. I don’t think that’s the case anymore today , and I’m only speaking about this from the entry level viewpoint. Would love an opinion from the more experienced and traditional devs about what they think of this.",20,0.73,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pk5eov/are_there_actual_passionate_people_who_take_the/,2025-12-11 18:44:53,2025-12-14 01:53:07

It inevitably always leads to them talking about AI, how it's the future, and half of the time, their genius idea to build a chatbot/ AI wrapper for .My response is always the same. AI in its current state is cool and useful, but has limitations. We shouldn't expect massive improvements (like AGI) in a short time period, and we shouldn't use AI for every use-case. In most cases, it's better to create a deterministic system instead.Almost every time, I get a mixture of the following:1. But all of these people are saying that AI is the future! (Most of ""those people"" being tech CEOs with a vested interest in selling shovels in the gold rush, and the bandwagoners who follow them).2. But AI is improving so rapidly! (Ignoring the exponential costs of improvement and that improvement is not a foregone conclusion).3. But AI can create a website/ pitch deck/ ! (Missing the fact that these things were always easy, and the value is in creating/ executing the hard things that haven't been built yet).

I made a post about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nwef8o/anyone\_lose\_their\_drive\_after\_reaching\_mid\_level/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nwef8o/anyone_lose_their_drive_after_reaching_mid_level/) Recently I changed teams (literally a week after that post) since an interesting initiative came out and they wanted internal transfers since ramp up time would be faster. It's only been 2+ months or so since then but wow I am seeing a path to senior again and even possibly beyond. My skills have grown tremendously especially as I had to learn a lot of new things, there is immense pressure as the higher ups are taking a much closer look at our team's projects initiatives and I'm communicating with directors in some circumstances despite being just a mid level dev. There's a few cons like tighter deadlines and definitely feeling resource constrained headcount wise and doing much more of some things that I didn't like or were uncomfortable for me in my last role but it's been... fun again. I can see much greater impact (that affects multiple orgs and business units) compared to my last role too. Financial impact of my last role was maybe 50M max and direct impact was much less. Current role had that much in just a single project. The role's importance also makes me feel a lot more secure in it and I'm less scared of being laid off which has been great for my mental health especially as I see other companies laying off people.For my resume, I had maybe 2-3 nice bullet points/stories I could get from my last role. I've gotten that in the last month and I'm pretty sure they sound better and are better stories to tell on interviews.This make me think of how much growth I would have had if I had been in a similar team/role 1-2 years earlier and this isn't even considering how much more visibility I have now. I think I can get promoted in 6 months if I really go for it or a year if I take a bit more time to take things chiller just because of being ""forged"" in this fire that I'll develop senior skills without even really trying... That said I'm seeing much more of what principal/staff engineers do because of higher proximity to them and ngl, I'm not sure I want to be in their shoes lol",19,0.91,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pgyt9t/the_team_you_haveproject_you_are_in_is_so/,2025-12-08 00:53:21,2025-12-14 01:53:07
1pi9jek,"Feeling Stagnant at Job, Feeling Anxious",HiiiiiiPower,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I’m a software developer with coming up on 4 YoE at an enterprise company.My list of accomplishments at this company is pretty lacklustre:1. I built an internal tool that helps devs on my team.2. I performed some bug fixes, some that were quite tricky and difficult, some that were pretty straightforward.3. I migrated one of our back-end services from the cloud to an on-prem instance.And that’s pretty much it. Fairly basic React work + Spring Boot work and some AWS as well.I guess I feel really bad because the vast majority of this work I accomplished in maybe a year at most and after that I stagnated hard because I was battling stage 3 cancer for some time and dealt with the aftermath of that (poor mental health) for quite some time. Like little to no code reviews, just maintaining what I’ve built, etc.Overall, I feel like I only have maybe 1 YoE even though I’ve been working for 4 years.These past few months, I’ve been doing a lot better mentally and I’ve done a bunch of LeetCode, a Spring Boot course, and a ton of system design since those are areas where I’m quite weak.I’m confident I can improve my skills in the next 2-3 months, but the question always remains “am I cooked?” Like, am I screwed for doing next to nothing for quite some time? Is there any chance of salvaging what I have left of my career? This question really keeps me up at night. Will recruiters and hiring managers be completely turned off by my lacklustre work experience?I realize my career is in my hands and no one else’s, but I’m just so bummed out that I lost so much opportunity due to battling cancer + mental health, and I’m praying that there’s still a chance for me to do SWE now that I’m doing a lot better these months.Am I completely and utterly cooked?

1pihedo,Unable to move to Senior after a bootcamp-level education and 6 years experience - need studying advice,pyromaniac_etal,cscareerquestions,"TLDR: Career changer hitting a knowledge ceiling, need tips for growth.I am a career changer with a BA in Classical Music Performance who completed a bootcamp back in 2020. Since then I have been continuously employed working first for a small company doing mostly front end, then for a large company doing full stack. In the small company (3 people) I had no guidance or mentoring and was entirely self taught. In the large company, everyone has 15-20 years of experience and we are working on maintaining an old code base rather than building new things. It's a very corporate model and pays far below market rate, but it had great benefits and stability. My arm of the big company was just sold to a startup. The great benefits and stability are gone, the work is depressing and pointless, we have lost three direct managers in eight months, team morale is at an all time low, and there is no chance for advancement because anyone who could advocate for us gets fired. I just had a great written performance review, but the meeting was awful. During the review meeting, after all the positive comments, I was told by the higher up standing in for our manager that I was not eligible to be put up for senior because I am not showing the same code base knowledge as colleagues with 15-20 years experience (who were promoted to senior while at my level.) In my opinion and despite the positive comments, I think I am performing poorly. Even if my performance improves, I have no chance of promotion at this new company. In short, I need a new job. Unfortunately, I think my lack of education and experience building vs maintaining software is harming my ability to study for and perform in interviews. The terminology used by my colleagues seems totally foreign even when I should have heard it before, and I can't seem to remember or apply it to our work when trying to discuss it with others. In general, I feel stupidly inarticulate. I think my memory is terrible. I feel like my brain will sometimes short circuit during team meetings and I suddenly cannot find words or even concepts to describe what I was working on just the day before. I don't think it is anxiety related... I just don't remember. I also feel very slow at my work - in between childcare responsibilities, my own brain wandering, hating every second of the tasks, and getting distracted around the house, I probably put in two focused hours in an eight hour day. This makes me worry and beat myself up because obviously I could do so much better if I could focus. This inability to focus, along with some migraine stuff, bleeds into my ability to study. And studying algorithms doesn't seem to help me explain them better or talk about them in an intelligent way. With all of this, I'm not sure how I am going to get a new job at a senior level position.I need some tips to 1) learn how to learn what I ACTUALLY don't know 2) memory tips for vocabulary, tech trends, algorithms, etc. (flashcards? something else?) 3) learn how to talk about what I do know in a way that demonstrates my intelligence 4) a clear study plan that incorporates all of this so I don't have decision fatigue day after day. I have about one hour per day to spend on this 5) some encouragement. I am the sole provider for a neurodivergent kid and a spouse in school, I worked hard to make this career change as a previous professional musician and was good enough to be immediately hired as a TA and then get a job in the middle of the early covid recession. I cannot quit. I like solving problems.

1plvgdj,Capital One TDP vs AT&T TDP - New Grad Software Engineer Offer Guidance,mrgenius17,cscareerquestions,"Hello Community,Fortunate enough to have received two Entry Level Software Engineer offers from these companies. Looking for your guidance on which will be better to start my career with.Long Term Goals (at least as of now):Work at a bigger, more respectable Company. Either Big Tech or Fin-Tech (like Bloomberg).Get an MBA from a respectable institution (like Top 20), since my undergrad is a no-name school. Intuition behind getting an MBA is I like software, but I also like the business side of things. MBA obviously also helps with getting a promotion to the business side of things. I will probably pursue the MBA part-time while working full-time.Capital One TDP, McLean, VA (DC Metro Area):Base: 130k, One Time Bonuses (Sign-on + Relocation): 30k, Target Bonus (3600)Pros and Cons will of course be a bit team-dependent, I know a Senior Engineer there who 'might' be able to help with team-matching when the time comes. Team has not been assigned yet; they will match us later.TDP Rotations are 1 year and then 6 months, for a total of 18 months. I do not know about the conversion rate from TDP to full-time.Pros:Bigger Name and a more tech-focused company.TCDC Metro Area(?): Plenty of companies in the DC Metro Area to switch to in case things goes sideways. Amazon, Google, Gov Contracting, Consulting.Hybrid Schedule: 3 days in office, 2 days remoteCons:Stack Ranking and PIP Culture: Around 10% of the staff is laid off every 6 months.Performance Review Method: Performance is evaluated every 6 months, and historical performance does not matter in the next cycle.Worth mentioning: Everyone is judged on a scale of 1-5, and as long as you can stay at 3 or above, you are fine.DC Cost of Living is very high, so not sure how far the higher TC will go.I will have to switch sooner or later (unless there's a miracle and I find a great team environment there).AT&T TDP, Atlanta, GA:Base: 90k, One-Time Bonus (Sign-on): 5k, Target Bonus: 10k.TDP rotations are 1 years each for 2 years. Getting placed full-time in a team after TDP is pretty much guaranteed.This is an intern return offer, so I have pretty good rapport with the managers there. I believe I will have a say in the team matching so I end up with a team whose work seems interesting to me.Pros:Chill work environment, very low chances of PIP/layoff.When I interned there, everyone including the managers were really nice.Good rapport with TDP management means getting placed on a good (or at least interesting) team.Chill work environment means I can coast there while getting a Masters in CS from Georgia Tech (part-time) that might help with employability in the future. Georgia Tech name is pretty strong in tech so that would work in my favor.Atlanta also has a lot of companies there to switch to like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, Blackrock.Cons:5 days in-office (haven't worked remote in my life so I don't really mind this)Lower TC (?): Atlanta's cost of living is much lesser.Legacy Organization (?): This might play a part when trying to switch.Please help me navigate this. Are there any factors I am not considering or giving enough importance to?My primary thoughts were the TC difference is pretty huge to not be considering Capital One, although in a high CoL area. More tech-focused company. But that comes at the cost of being on your toes all the time, in an unstable market.Would you rather be in the DC Metro Area or in Atlanta? I do prefer the hot weather though haha.Edit: Removed some MBA-related stuff, as someone pointed out, is not relevant for now.",15,0.86,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1plvgdj/capital_one_tdp_vs_att_tdp_new_grad_software/,2025-12-13 20:40:56,2025-12-14 01:53:07

My team is a very siloed. We support 1 main business function but we literally have dozens of applications that do completely different things and have entirely different frame works. There is a dedicated SME for each main application and we have 1 tech lead. I’m not sure what the point of a tech lead is because there is no way one person could understand ALL of my team’s applications.This is why I don’t think agile works for my team.

Our scrum master and project managers have no idea what our work is even on a business/non technical level. They have no idea what our stories mean.

I believe that a Solutions/Sales Engineering (SE) role would be a much stronger fit for my personality.

Throughout my job search, I was lucky enough to land two offers: 1.) Junior C#/.NET developer for a national bank working on internal software for the company. 2.) Junior Android developer working on an in-vehicle infotainment system. The second offer is coming from a company not based in the U.S but who has a small (<50 people) North American branch they are trying to build up.The pay for the .NET role was higher at first but the Android position has offered to match the rate.Both would be on a contract-to-hire of 6 months and 9 months respectively. The .NET role is 4 days in-person and 1 day remote. The Android role is fully in person.My only consideration is which will bring me closer to my ultimate goal of working as low-level developer working with C++ or adjacent languages. Operating Systems, Game Engines, and Computer Graphics being three areas I am super interested in.The android position might have some embedded programming but it would be for debugging purposes only. It's also not guaranteed.

This recruiting agency has their own tech screening... so then their screener asked me hibernate questions and I was shook. At work we add objects more manually using RowMappers.I'm not one to lie on my resume, this would be a first for me. It flavored the rest of the screening as I seemed low energy and low confidence in the rest of the questions afterwards. I was also screened after a long workday and commute at 6pm... The recruiter also appears to have assumed I have been working with Spring Boot at my workplace when we just use Spring Framework. While I originally coded in college using SpringBoot, it's been awhile since I coded using that specifically. Some of the screening questions were also geared towards that.Just feeling super dumb and like an imposter as a mid level Java software engineer. At least 20-30% of the questions at some point I said ""I don't know"".In the end the screener said I answered all the questions but appeared to lack confidence. I then gave some truth and said that I'm not always good at talking tech (some of the vocabulary I'm supposed to know goes right past me) but I am better when I can just sit down at the computer and write code. In the end the recruiter said if they like my personality they will find a reason to hire me, which was nice to hear but also felt like it confirmed I didn't do very well in the screening?

1pi4exh,Senior DS with old-school NLP background. How do I break into modern LLM work?,thrwy_86543210,cscareerquestions,"I’m looking for candid guidance on how to make a realistic pivot into modern AI and LLM roles. I’m a senior IC data scientist with over 10 years of experience at large, well-known tech companies. I have a PhD in NLP that predates AlexNet and word2vec, and a CS/SWE background, and I have always worked as a generalist with broad experience across the classical ML and data science stack: ETLs, data pipelines, experimentation, statistics, and lightweight models for product teams.After a year out of industry, I'm job hunting again, but my recruiter callback rate is under 5 percent. I seem overqualified for junior roles and underqualified for senior AI roles, and I honestly no longer know where I fit. I’ve seen plenty of DS-to-RE transition advice, but very little that speaks to someone senior like me. I’d be happy in research engineering, applied LLM work, AI-oriented data science, or agentic / safety / alignment roles, but I’m not sure which of these are actually realistic anymore.Most of my experience is in classical ML, not deep learning or modern LLM tooling. I understand Transformers conceptually and followed Karpathy’s GPT-from-scratch tutorial, but I don’t have professional experience with PyTorch, LLM finetuning, or production LLM systems. These gaps come out in interviews. For example, I was asked to use a tokenizer and realized I didn’t even know which ones are standard today. I could explain BPE, but I had to ask the interviewer to name one, and when they said TikToken I had to ask them to spell it because I had never heard of it. Not my best moment. My side projects also feel too toy-like to signal real capability.What I want to figure out is what skills and projects actually matter for breaking into modern AI and LLM roles and how someone with my background can reposition effectively. My concrete questions are:1. What is the most efficient way for someone with my background to build practical and credible skills for modern AI and LLM roles?2. How should I balance interview preparation with building real projects?3. Which roles are realistic targets for me given my experience and gaps?4. Am I fooling myself by thinking I could do the work if I could get past interviews, or is signaling the real barrier here?",9,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pi4exh/senior_ds_with_oldschool_nlp_background_how_do_i/,2025-12-09 10:47:47,2025-12-14 01:53:07

1pk8n5r,deciding between interning at a big-tech company in SF vs a medium-scale startup in NYC next summer,urinehugetrouble,cscareerquestions,"Context:I'm entering my final year of undergrad, and going into my final internship next summer. Throughout university, I've always dreamt of working in NYC full-time, and I was hoping my final internship will lead to a FT RO there. And luckily, I was fortunate enough to get an offer from a mid-size startup (that I believe doesn't have much room for growth) in NYC. By surprise, I also got an offer to intern at a FAANG+ company I believe in, located in SF.Now, I'm really torn as to what to do moving forward.On one hand, I really resonate with the saying ""you're only in your 20s once."" I've always wanted to experience NYC in my 20s and now I have the opportunity to do so, albeit for a short period of time. People say that summers in NYC have a certain charm to them, and I definitely want to experience this first-hand. Since I'm bearish on the company's future, I would probably still have to recruit full-time for new grad even if I do get an RO, but at least the RO would be in a location I really cherish.On the other hand, the FAANG+ company definitely seems like the safer bet - I get more resume value, more long-term career growth, and their full-time TC is a little higher simply due to publicly traded stock. The people around me say it'll give me more leverage to recruit full-time in NYC, but full-time recruiting is definitely difficult, the market is not looking too hot, and NYC is a very competitive location to break into. I also do have Amazon on my resume, so I don't know if this is diminishing returns.Not really sure if I'm thinking straight. Am I sacrificing the potential of long-term growth for the short-term pleasure of living in the city I want? I'm a firm believer in ""the city shapes you,"" and I definitely think NYC lines much more closer with my beliefs in that sense than SF. However, this is an internship, and maybe choosing what's better for my career is more sensible.What are your thoughts? Any advice? Would appreciate any insight into this Some more context:When I received the offer for the FAANG+ company, I lightly requested to move it to Fall since they have Fall cohorts, but they declined (I also didn't have leverage so I did say I would be happy to work in the summer if it's not possible). However this was before the NYC offer came through. Now, I definitely have more leeway to give an ultimatum since I have another offer, but I'm not sure if potentially burning this bridge is worth the upside.",5,0.78,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pk8n5r/deciding_between_interning_at_a_bigtech_company/,2025-12-11 20:52:15,2025-12-14 01:53:07

1pih5zb,Took a 1-year work sabbatical and am about to begin applying after the new year. How can I demonstrate that I am still a competitive candidate?,crustymilk15,cscareerquestions,"**Context**I'm a US-based Product Designer with 5 years of experience (4 of which were in the Telehealth industry), with my last 3 years of employment leading multiple high-impact and well-documented projects. Between all the conversations around AI taking over roles, the government impacting the job market, frequent layoffs, and more—I was feeling burnt out. When the medium-sized company I worked for filed for bankruptcy, I used this as an opportunity to redeem my mental health. For the first 3 months I rested, and for the following 9 months I focused on art. I pursued any hobby I was interested in, joined clubs, and even felt my identity change. While I am proud of my decision, and I feel significantly better, I am now grappling with self-esteem issues when I consider my career journey ahead. Before this could snowball into an issue of its own, I immediately started going to therapy. **Preparation**During this year-long break, I worked daily on my portfolio—writing case studies, networking, staying connected with previous colleagues, and developing my site from scratch. I completed and launched my portfolio with 4 in-depth case studies full of metrics and impact. All of my colleagues who were laid off were re-hired, and have offered me referrals. My resume is up-to-date, and I've developed my portfolio in a way that I can easily release personalized variations for each company I apply for. So not only will my resume be catered to each job application, but so will my website. **Action**I applied to one job that I felt I was 100% qualified for, and also recieved a referral from a close colleague. I catered my resume and also my portfolio, but it was a bit rushed—I launched my portfolio that same week and had to fix a lot of errors. I am still proud that I've applied, but I didn't expect the application to go through given that it was my first application. Today I've been informed that the role has been filled. I haven't applied to any other jobs yet because of holiday planning, but intend to apply to 5 - 10 jobs per week (depending on available jobs) after the New Year. Now that I've finished my portfolio, I am starting work on two career-related side projects to demonstrate my skills further. My goal is to apply for remote full-time roles with a compensation range of $130k - $175k, prioritizing roles in the Telehealth industry. **Questions*** When asked about my career gap, what is the most elegant way I can talk about it?* Am I likely to face descrimination for my 1 year career gap? What can I do to navigate it?* How can I best get into contact with recruiters? Are they still open to communication through LinkedIn, or are they swamped with messages?* Does the job market feel better in FY2025 Q4 than it did in FY2024 or FY2023?* Is a 6-month timeline realistic for job hunting? * Are freelance and contract roles as competitive as full time? * What else can I do to be a more competitive design candidate? Any advice is appreciated, though it would be helpful if you could share your industry/role to show relevance.

1phxeoh,Need some advice as an old grad who didn't get the grades,RajjSinghh,cscareerquestions,"I graduated from a top university in the UK in 2023. That year I had a really serious accident where I broke my skull. Because of some university policies around final year students, I was given a 2 week extension on some assignments and no concessions around exams. I graduated without honours, which isn't good but considering I got out of a coma and had to get straight back to uni with some brain damage, I probably can't ask for more. Since then I've had a few odd contracting jobs but nothing permemant. I'm really struggling to know what I'm actually supposed to do at this point. I'm not getting real world experience and the gap on my CV is just getting bigger, and I'm already finding it hard to stand out against every other candidate. It's so frustrating because I know if I hadn't had that accident I'd have graduated well but employers really don't care about any grades other than what it says on the degree. Does anyone have advice on what to do here? I thought about going back to university but I didn't get the grades to go for a Masters and a second bachelors is going to be so expensive. I figured freelancing and trying to land work that way but from experience I know there's going to be points where I'm just out of my depth and when I'm on my own I don't have anyone to go to for help. Obviously the whole application thing is going to be hard anyway, and I'm already not hearing back from recruitment companies that used to land me interviews. I'm just at a total loss here.",3,0.72,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1phxeoh/need_some_advice_as_an_old_grad_who_didnt_get_the/,2025-12-09 03:39:58,2025-12-14 01:53:07
1phn4kz,Junior Sysadmin Offer,Fruit_dog04,cscareerquestions,"I graduate in about a week with a bachelor’s in CS. I’ve interned for the past ~1.5 years with the government. I also have an active security clearance, and I’ve landed two interviews so far. I’m located in the Southeast US.I just received an offer for a junior sysadmin role. It starts at $59k and has pretty solid benefits — low insurance cost, generous PTO, retirement contributions, etc. They also pay for certifications and will fully cover further schooling if I decide to pursue a master’s degree.I feel like the starting salary is a bit low considering I have a clearance and relevant work experience. But the benefits and the ability to get certs + a master’s for free are hard to ignore.I’m not fully sure what I want to do long-term. I’ve been researching different paths that branch off from sysadmin — things like Cloud Engineering, DevOps, and SRE — and I find those somewhat interesting. I’m also wondering about software engineering. So I’m trying to figure out how flexible this starting point is if I end up wanting something different down the road.Here are some concerns of mine:1. Will starting as a sysadmin limit my career ceiling?2. Is sysadmin a good route into DevOps/Cloud/SRE roles later on?3. With a clearance and CS degree, should I be aiming for something higher?4. Would it be tough to transition into SWE roles later if I start in sysadmin and don’t like it?Any advice from people in the industry would be greatly appreciated.",6,0.87,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1phn4kz/junior_sysadmin_offer/,2025-12-08 20:20:55,2025-12-14 01:53:07
