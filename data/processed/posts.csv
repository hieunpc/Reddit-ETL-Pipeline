1qy6ca4,AI engineering is data engineering and it's easier than you may think,ivanovyordan,dataengineering,"Hi all,I wasn't planning to share my article here. But Only this week, I had 3 conversations this week wit fairly senior data engineers who see AI as a thread. Here's what I usually see:* Annoyed because they have to support AI enigneers (yet feel unseen)* Affraid because don't know if they may lose their job in a restructure* Want to navigate in ""the new world"" and have no idea where to startHere's the essence, so you don't need to read the whole thingAI engineering is largely data engineering with new buzzwords and probabalistic transformations. Here's a quick map:* **LLM = The Logic Engine.** This is the component that processes the data.* **Prompt = The Input.** This is literally the query or the parameter you are feeding into the engine.* **Embeddings = The Feature.** This is classic feature engineering. You are taking unstructured text and turning it into a vector (a list of numbers) so the system can perform math on it.* **Vector Database = The Storage.** That's the indexing and storage layer for those feature vectors.* **RAG = The Context.** Retrieval step. You’re pulling relevant data to give the logic engine the context it needs to answer correctly.* **Agent = The System.** This is the orchestration layer. It’s what wraps the engine, the storage, and the inputs into a functional workflow.2Don't let the ""AI"" label intimidate you. The infrastructure challenges, are the same ones we’ve been dealing with for years. The names have just changed to make it sound more revolutionary than it actually is.I hope this will help so of you.",180,0.85,31,https://www.datagibberish.com/p/ai-powered-apps-dictionary-for-data-engineers,2026-02-07 06:20:37,2026-02-11 02:30:38
1qxifq4,"Is classic data modeling (SCDs, stable business meaning, dimensional rigor) becoming less and less relevant?",Likewise231,dataengineering,"I’ve been in FAANG for about 5 years now, across multiple teams and orgs (new data teams, SDE-heavy teams, BI-heavy teams, large and small setups), and one thing that’s consistently surprised me is how little classic data modeling I’ve actually seen applied in practice.When I joined as a junior/intern, I expected things like proper dimensional modeling, careful handling of changing business meaning, SCD Type 2 being a common pattern, and shared dimensions that teams actually align on — but in reality most teams seem extremely execution-focused, with the job dominated by pipelines, orchestration, data quality, alerts, lineage, governance, security, and infra, while modeling and design feel like maybe 5–10% of the work at most.Even at senior levels, I’ve often found that concepts like “ensuring the business meaning of a column doesn’t silently change” or why SCD2 exists aren’t universally understood or consistently applied. In tech-driven organizations it is more structured, but in business-driven organizations it's less structued (Organization I mean ±100-300 people organization).My logic is because compute and storage got so much cheapier over the years, the effort/benefit ratio is not there in as many situations.

1qvoj0i,Financial engineering at its finest,SignalMine594,dataengineering,"I’ve been spending time lately looking into how big tech companies use specific phrasing to mask (or highlight) their updates, especially with all the chip investment deals going on. Earlier this week, I was going through the Microsoft earnings call transcript and (based on what seems like shared sentiment in the market), I was curious how Fabric was represented. From my armchair analyst position, its adoption just doesn’t seem to line up with what I assumed would exist by now...On the recent FY26 Q2 call, Satya said:>Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric's annual revenue run rate is now over $2 billion with over 31,000 customers... revenue up 60% year over year.The first thing that made me skeptical is the type of metrics used for Fabric. “Annual revenue run rate” is NOT the same as “we actually generated $2B over the last 12 months.” This is super normal when startups report earnings, since if a product is growing, run rate can look great even when realized trailing revenue is still catching up. Microsoft chose run rate wording here.Then I looked at the previous earnings where Fabric was discussed. In FY25 Q3, they said Fabric had 21k paid customers and “40% using Real-Time Intelligence” five months after GA, but “using” isn’t defined in a way that’s tangible, which usually is telling. In last week’s earnings, Satya immediately discusses specific metrics, customer references, etc. for other products.A huge part of why I’m also not convinced on adoption is because of the forced Power BI capacity migration. I know the world is all about financial engineering, and since Microsoft forced us all to migrate off of P-SKUs, it’s not hard to advertise those numbers as great. The conspiracist in me says the numbers line up a little too neatly with the SKU migration:* $2B in revenue run rate / 31,000 customers ≈ $64.5k per customer per year. * That’s conveniently right around the published price of an F64 reservationObviously an average is oversimplifying it, and I don’t think Microsoft is lying about the metrics whatsoever, but I do think the phrasing doesn’t line up with the marketing and what my account team says…The other thing I saw was how Microsoft talks when they have deeper adoption. They normally use harder metrics like customers >$1M, big deployments, customer references, etc. In the same FY26 Q2 transcript, Fabric gets the run-rate/customer count and then the conversation moves on. And that’s it. After that, I was surprised that Fabric was never mentioned on its own again, nor expanded upon, and outside of that sentence, Fabric was always mentioned with Foundry.Earnings reports aren't everything, and 31,000 customers is a lot, so I went looking for proof in customer stories, and the majority of the stories are just implementation partners and consultancies whose practices depend on selling Fabric (Boutiques/Avanade types), not a flood of end-customer production migrations with scale numbers. (There are are a couple of enterprise stories like LSEG and Microsoft’s internal team, but it doesn’t feel like “no shortage.”)Please check me. Am I off base here? Or is the growth just because of the forced migration from Power BI?",44,0.94,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qvoj0i/financial_engineering_at_its_finest/,2026-02-04 13:27:12,2026-02-11 02:30:38

What about putting some efforts on your own to study for the certification? You are 22 for god's sake and you still want to be spoon fed every god damn thing? What Is the attitude of everything that requires even a pinch of effort is really shitty and should not do it. If you are doing it then you are a fool and you are not cool.It's has become so easy to stand out from the rest. But at the same time if you choose the harder part your environment is so awful the people around you are awful that the one picking the easier path is wining.Hey if 40 out of 50 students can study for the certification in 5 days and score 850+ it's more than enough.

1qw09c0,How do you handle *individual* performance KPIs for data engineers?,Honeychild06,dataengineering,"Hello, First off, I am not a data engineer, but more of like a PO/Technical PM for the data engineering team. I'm looking for some perspective from other DE teams...My leadership is asking my boss and I to define \*individual performance\* KPIs for data engineers. It is important to say they aren't looking for team level metrics. There is pressure to have something measurable and consistent across the team.I know this is tough...I don't like it at all. I keep trying to steer it back to the TEAM's performance/delivery/whatever, but here we are. :(One initial idea I had was tracking story points committed vs completed per sprint, but I'm concerned this doesn't map well to reality. Especially because points are team relative, work varies in complexity, and of course there are always interruptions/support work that can get unevenly distributed.I've also suggested tracking cycle time trends per individual (but NOT comparisons...), and defining role specific KPIs, since not every single engineer does the same type of work.Unfortunately leadership wants something more uniform and explicitly individual.So I'm curious to know from DE or even leaders that browse this subreddit:* if your org tracks individual performance KPIs for data engineers and data scientists, what does that actually look like? * what worked well? what backfired?Any real world examples would be appreciated.",23,0.82,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qw09c0/how_do_you_handle_individual_performance_kpis_for/,2026-02-04 20:40:38,2026-02-11 02:30:38

1qxle32,What would you put on your Data Tech Mount Rushmore?,empty_cities,dataengineering,"Mine has evolved a bit over the last year. Today it’s a mix of newer faces alongside a couple of absolute bedrocks in data and analytics. Apache Arrow It's the technology you didn’t even know you loved. It’s how Streamlit improved load speed, how DataFusion moves DataFrames around, and the memory model behind Polars. Now it has its own SQL protocol with Flight SQL and database drivers via ADBC. The idea of Arrow as the standard for data interoperability feels inevitable. DuckDB I was so late to DuckDB that it’s a little embarrassing. At first, I thought it was mostly useful for data apps and lambda functions. Boy was I was wrong. The SQL syntax, the extensions, the ease of use, the seamless switch between in-memory and local persistence…and DuckLake. Like many before me, I fell for what DuckDB can do. It feels like magic. Postgres I used to roll my eyes every time I read “Just use Postgres.” in the comments section. I had it pegged as a transactional database for software apps. After working with DuckLake, Supabase, and most recently ADBC, I get it now. Postgres can do almost anything, including serious analytics. As Mimoune Djouallah put it recently, “PostgreSQL is not an OLTP database, it’s a freaking data platform.” Python Where would analytics, data science, machine learning, deep learning, data platforms and AI engineering be without Python? Can you honestly imagine a data world where it doesn’t exist? I can’t. For that reason alone it will always have a spot on my Mount Rushmore. 4 EVA. I would be remiss if I didn't list these honorable mentions: \* Apache Parquet \* Rust \* S3 / GCS This was actually a fun exercise and a lot harder than it looks :zany_face:",17,0.66,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qxle32/what_would_you_put_on_your_data_tech_mount/,2026-02-06 15:55:51,2026-02-11 02:30:38

1qxw5oo,Struggling with Partition Skew: Spark repartition not balancing load across nodes,wtfzambo,dataengineering,"# SOLVED: See solution a the bottomHello, I have been searching far and wide for a solution to my predicaments but I can't seem to figure it out, even with extensive help of AI.# TL;DR:I have a skewed dataset representing 9 clients. One client is roughly 10x larger than the others. I’m trying to use `repartition` to shuffle data across nodes and balance the workload, but the execution remains bottlenecked on a single task.# Details:I'm running a simple extraction + load pipeline:`Read from DB -> add columns -> write to data lake.`The data source is a bit peculiar: each client has its own independent database.The large client's data consistently lands on a single node during all phases of the job. While other nodes finish their tasks very quickly, this one ""straggler"" task bottlenecks the entire job.I attempted to redistribute the data to spread the load, but nothing seems to trigger an even shuffle. I’ve tried:* Salting the keys.* Enabling Adaptive Query Execution (AQE).* `repartition(n, ""salt_column"")` , `repartition(n, ""client_id"", ""salt"")`.* `repartition(n)`See picture:https://preview.redd.it/yo94vesrk2ig1.png?width=5030&format=png&auto=webp&s=399be044a1f8a3e9557553b97056141ed342b0b3In very short pseudocode, here is what I'm doing: data = [] for db in db_list: # Reading from 9 independent source DBs data.append( spark.read.format(""jdbc"").option(""db"", ""table"").load() ) df_unioned = union_all(data) df_unioned = df_unioned.sortWithinPartition(client_id) # This is where I'm stuck: df_unioned = df_unioned.repartition(100, ""salt_column"") df_unioned.write.parquet(""path/to/lake"")Looking at the Physical Plan, I've noticed there is no `Exchange` (Shuffle) happening before the write. Despite calling `repartition`, Spark is keeping the `numPartitions=1` from the JDBC scans all the way through the `Union`, resulting in a 'one-partition-per-client' bottleneck during the write phase.Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope :(PS:A couple of extra points, maybe they're useful:\- This data in specific is quite small, just a few gigabytes (i'm testing on a subset of the full data)\- For the record, the repartition DOES happen: if I do \`repartition(100)\`, I will have 100 tiny files in the data lake. What doesn't happen is the shuffle between nodes or even cores.# SolutionIt was AQE + a later query in the job causing this. This later query, which comes after writing out to data lake, does an aggregation on the \`client\_id\`. Apparently, AQE understands this and goes ""instead of doing two shuffles (1 for repartitioning and another one to aggregate) I'm just gonna do zero since the data is already partitioned by \`client\_id\`"".",5,0.74,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qxw5oo/struggling_with_partition_skew_spark_repartition/,2026-02-06 22:33:20,2026-02-11 02:30:38

No transformation is being done.

This one, however, just won’t load the 1 million row table. Given our capacity, this should be an easy task.Has anyone encountered a similar scenario?What do you think could be the issue here?

1qwjl09,Data Lakehouse - Silver Layer Pattern,dbjan,dataengineering,"Hi! I've been to several data warehousing projects lately, built with the ""medallion"" architecture and there are a few things which make me quite disturbed.First - on all of these projects we were pushed by the ""data architect"" to use the Silver layer as a copy of the Bronze, only with SCD 2 logic on each table, leaving the original normalised table structure. No joining of tables, or other preparation of data allowed (the messy data preparation tables go to the Gold next to the star schema).Second - it was decided, that all the tables and their columns are renamed to english (from Polish), which means that now we have three databases (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different names for the same columns and tables. Now when I get a SQL script with business logic from the analyst, I need to transcribe all the table and column names to the english (Silver layer) and then implement the transformation towards Gold. Whenever there is a discussion about the data logic, or I need to go back to the analyst with a question, I need to transpose all the english table&column names back to the Polish (Bronze) again. It's time consuming. Then Gold has still different column names, as the star schema is adjusted to the reporting needs of the users.Are you also experiencing this, is this some kind of a new trend? Would't it be so much easier to leave it with the original Polish names in the Silver, since there is no change to the data anyway and the lineage would be so much cleaner?I understand the architects don't care what it takes to work with this as it's not their pain, but I don't understand that no one cares about the cost of this.. : DAlso I can see that people tend to think about the system as something developed once, not touching it afterwards. That goes completely against my experience. If the system is alive, then changes are required all the time, as the business evolves, which means the costs are heavily projecting to the future..What are your views on this?

1qvd8zc,Need Advice. Tech Stack for Organization that lack of human resource.,GriffithLikeYouGF,dataengineering,"Hello. I’d like to start by saying that this is my first time asking a question in this kind of format. If there are any mistakes, I apologize in advance. I should also mention that I have very little experience in the Data Engineering field, and I haven’t worked in an organization that has a standard or mature Data Engineering team. My knowledge mostly comes from what I studied, and for some topics it’s only at a surface level, with little real hands-on experience.I currently work in an organization that does not have sufficient resources to recruit highly skilled Data Engineering personnel, and most of the work is driven by the data analytics team. The current systems were mostly built to solve immediate, short-term problems. Because of this, I have several questions and would like to seek advice from experienced members of this community.My questions are divided into several parts, as follows:* What kind of Data Tech Stack would be most appropriate (Open Source, Cloud Services, or Hybrid)?* For a Data Orchestrator, is a code-based approach (such as Dagster or Airflow) or a GUI-based approach (such as SSIS) better in the long run, especially if the Data Engineering team needs to scale?* What roles should exist within a Data Engineering team (e.g., Lead, Infrastructure, Operational Service), or is it actually unnecessary to divide the team into sub-roles?* How should we choose Data Storage to suit each layer? Is it necessary to use newer technologies (such as Data Warehouse or Data Lakehouse), or should we choose based on the expertise of the organization’s IT department, which is likely more familiar with OLTP databases?* For a Data Dictionary, should it be embedded directly into table names for convenience, documented separately, or handled through a dedicated platform (such as DataHub)?* To comply with PDPA / security audits, should data be masked or encrypted before it reaches the data storage that the Data Engineering team has access to? And which department in the organization is typically responsible for this?* As someone who can be considered a new Data Engineer, could you please recommend skills that I should learn or further develop?Lastly, if there are any parts of my questions where I used incorrect terminology or misunderstood certain concepts, please feel free to point them out and explain. I’m still not fully confident in my understanding of this field.Thank you in advance to everyone who takes the time to share their opinions and advice. PS.

For our own SQL engine (Floe), we needed stable, reusable statistics and relational metadata to support predictable planning over Iceberg and Delta. Floe will be available later this year, but Floecat is designed to be engine-agnostic.If this sounds interesting, I wrote more about the motivation and design here: https://floedb.ai/blog/introducing-floecat-a-catalog-of-catalogs-for-the-modern-lakehouseFeedback is very welcome, especially from folks who’ve struggled with planning, stats, or metadata across multiple lakehouse catalogs.Full disclosure, I'm the CTO at Floe.",4,0.84,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r0pico/intro_to_floecat_a_catalog_for_query_engines_that/,2026-02-10 03:14:06,2026-02-11 02:30:38

1r06p4k,Easily work with Lance datasets using LanceDB on Hugging Face Hub,laminarflow027,dataengineering,"> Disclaimer: I currently work at LanceDB and have been a member of Lance's and Hugging Face's open source communities for several years.Recently, Lance became an [officially supported format](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-x-huggingface-a-new-era-of-sharing-multimodal-data/) on the Hugging Face Hub. Lance is an open source, modern, columnar lakehouse format for AI/ML datasets that include multimodal data, embeddings, nested fields, and more. LanceDB is an open source, embedded library that exposes convenient APIs on top of the Lance format to manage embeddings and indices.Check out the latest Lance datasets uploaded by the awesome OSS community here:https://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3AlanceWhat the Hugging Face integration means in practice for Lance format and LanceDB users on the Hub:- Binary assets (images, audio, videos) stored inline as blobs: No external files and pointers to manage- Efficient columnar access: Directly stream metadata from the Hub without touching heavier data (like videos) for fast exploration- Prebuilt indices can be shared alongside the data: Vector/FTS/scalar indices are packaged with the dataset, so no need to redo the work already done by others- Fast random access and scans: Lance format specializes in blazing fast random access (helps with vector search and data shuffles for training). It does so without compromising scan performance, so your large analytical queries can be run on traditional tabular data using engines like DuckDB, Spark, Ray, Trino, etc.Earlier, to share large multimodal datasets, you had to store multiple directories with binary assets + pointer URLs to the large blobs in your Parquet tables on the Hub. Once downloaded, as a user, you'd have had to recreate any vector/FTS indices on your local machine, which can be an expensive process.Now, with Lance officially supported as a format on the Hub, you can package all your datasets along with their indices as a single, shareable artifact, with familiar table semantics that work with your favourite query engine. Reuse others' work, and prepare your models for training, search and analytics/RAG with ease!It's very exciting to see the variety of Lance datasets that people [have uploaded](https://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3Alance) already on the HF Hub, feel free to share your own, and spread the word!",7,0.89,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r06p4k/easily_work_with_lance_datasets_using_lancedb_on/,2026-02-09 15:10:52,2026-02-11 02:30:38

I have some pretty senior responsibilities for my YOE, just because I was the 2nd person on the data team, my boss had 30+ years experience, and just by nature of needing to figure out how to build a reporting platform that can support multiple SaaS applications for lots of clients along with actually building the reports, I had to learn fast and think through a lot of architecture stuff. I work with dbt, Snowflake, Fivetran, Power BI and Python.Now I’m looking for new jobs because I’m very underpaid, and while I’m getting some interviews I can’t help but feel like I might be getting more if I could check the box of having a degree.I was talking to my boss the other day and he said me I should consider getting a business degree from WGU just so I could check the box, since I already have proof of having the technical skills.After looking at the classes of the IT management degree, it looks like something that I could get done faster than a CS degree by a lot, but at the same time I’m not sure if it would end up being a negative for my career because it would look like I want to do a career change, or if that time would just generally be better invested in developing my skills sans degree, or just going for the CS degree.Would it be a waste of time and money?",5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qzjejj/would_an_it_management_degree_be_stupid/,2026-02-08 20:11:24,2026-02-11 02:30:38
1qzhccu,Clueless DE intern,Q9b4xct8,dataengineering,"Hello all,I'm an IT undergrad who's in the middle of a data engineering internship program at a service company and I'm completely unprepared for it. For lack of a kinder way to put it, I recognize my current training + location is focused on outsourcing jobs for low pay and high turnover, typical cert mill stuff for cheap third world work, and they're not really focused on quality. Frankly, I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm having certifications and courses for cloud providers, Databricks, dbt, etc. thrown at me without guidance or feedback and I'm not really learning a thing and feel paralyzed when it comes to trying to approach any actual problems. Like, I can follow along on coursework projects, finish cert exams, and follow Databricks notebook labs, etc. but I couldn't really tell you what I'm doing or do anything without my hand held and pulling up documentation and code examples on the side for things as basic as a CSV loader. I'm not really sure how all these parts come together in a real environment either, like when one would use dbt vs spark for transformations. I don't use LLMs because I want to be able to do it myself first, but I see my peers get so far ahead with them while I haven't completed anything of note *and* I still can't say I understand any more than them.I've seen some beginner project ideas, or advice to build something relevant to my interests, but I'm honestly lost for where to start even there. I'm sorry if this is quite silly. I know there's no perfect solution, but I was wondering if there are any semi-guided project outlines or study resources anyone can recommend. Alternatively, do you think it's worth it to put a hold on the data engineering track and focus on BI analyst-focused concepts?

1qyibuf,Are we going down the wrong path for integrations?,Good_Skirt2459,dataengineering,"Hello everyone. This post may be long because I am asking a more open-ended question. I am a recent computer science graduate who started working for a large non-profit organization which is reliant upon an old, very complex, ERP system (say... a few hundred tables, hundreds of millions of records). They don't provide an API, integrations are done by directly touching the database. Each one was developed ad-hoc, as the need arose over the last 2 decades. There is some code sharing but not always. 2 integrations which ostensibly provide the same information may have small divergences in exactly how they touch the database. They are written in a mix of C# and SQL stored procedures/functions. Many of these are very complex. Stored procedures call stored procedures and inserting an entity may wind up touching 30+ tables.

1qxso5n,Does partitioning your data by a certain column make aggregations on that column faster in Spark?,Lastrevio,dataengineering,"If I run a query like ``df2 = df.groupBy(""Country"").count()``, does running ``.repartition(""Country"")`` before the groupBy make the query faster? AI is giving contradictory answers on this so I decided to ask Reddit.The book written by the creators of Spark (""Spark: The Definitive Guide"") say that there are not too many ways to optimize an aggregation:>For the most part, there are not too many ways that you can optimize specific aggregationsbeyond filtering data before the aggregation having a sufficiently high numberof partitions. However, if you’re using RDDs, controlling exactly how these aggregationsare performed (e.g., using reduceByKey when possible over groupByKey) can bevery helpful and improve the speed and stability of your code.The way this was worded leads me to believe that a repartition (or bucketBy, or partitionBy on the physical storage) will not speed up a groupBy.This, I don't understand however. If I have a country column in a table that can take one of five values, and each country is in a seperate partition, then Spark will simply count the number of records in each partition without having to do a shuffle. This leads me to believe that repartition (or partitionBy, if you want to do it on the hard disk) will almost always speed up a groupby. So why do the authors say that there aren't many ways to optimize an aggregation? Is there something I'm missing?EDIT: To be clear, I'm of course implying that in an actual production environment you would run the .groupBy after the .repartition more than once. Otherwise, if you run a single .groupBy query, you're just moving the shuffle one step above.",6,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qxso5n/does_partitioning_your_data_by_a_certain_column/,2026-02-06 20:18:46,2026-02-11 02:30:38

Each node is shipped as a binary and should be installable on new servers with minimal config. Nodes need shared state like sessions, user creds, quotas, and proxy pool data.a. My current proposal is: each node talks only to a central internal API using a node key. That API handles all reads/writes to Redis/DB. This gives me tighter control over node onboarding, revocation, and limits blast radius if a node is ever compromised. It also avoids putting datastore credentials on every node.b. An alternative design (suggested by an LLM during architecture exploration) is letting every node connect directly to Redis for hot-path data (sessions, quotas, counters) and use it as the shared state layer, skipping the API hop. -- i didn't like the idea too much but the LLM kept defending it every time so maybe i am missin something!?!

The approach I’ve found in Snowflake’s documentation involves storing these templates in a GitHub repository and referencing that repo in dbt deps so new projects can pull them in as dependencies.That said, we’ve run into an issue where the GitHub integration appears to require a username to be associated with the repository URL. It’s not yet clear whether we can supply a personal access token instead, which is something we’re currently investigating.Given that limitation, I’m wondering if there’s a better or more standard way to achieve this pattern—centrally managed, reusable dbt tests and macros that can be easily consumed by all new dbt projects.",2,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qwztq8/snowflake_native_dbt_question/,2026-02-05 22:28:55,2026-02-11 02:30:38

Specifically something like this: https://ecatalog.nccu.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=34&poid=6710My goal is to learn everything data related (DA, DS & DE).

I'm learning a lot of the DS tools myself and I have the Statistics knowledge to back me but there's no entry-level DS anymore.

1r0ljxk,Production Access,fordatechy,dataengineering,"Hi. Question about production access. Does your organization allow users/developers who are not admins or in IT access to run their pipelines in production? Meaning they developed it but maybe IT provided the platform such as Airflow, nifi, etc. To run it. If they can’t run it do they have production access but just more restricted? Like read access so that they can debug why a pipeline failed and push changes without have to ask someone to send them the logs for them to see what happened.I’m asking this since right now I’m in an org where there are a few platforms but the two biggest don’t allow anyone outside their 2-5 person teams access to it. Essentially developers are expected to build pipelines and hand them off and that’s it. No view into prod anything. The reasoning by those admins is that developers don’t need to see prod and it’s keeps their environment secure. They will monitor and notify us if something goes wrong. I think this is dumb honestly as in my opinion that if you can’t grant people production access and keep it secure at the same time your environment is not as good as you think. I also think that developers need prod access if they are an engineer. At minimum I think they should have read access so that they can easy see how their pipelines are performing and debug if needed. The environments and nifi and ssis for the record and this isn’t a post to bash them so I’m only saying that for context. I don’t care what the platform is per se but just the workflow in general.How does your organization work? Am I missing a reason why developers should not have prod access to if they are required to build and debug pipelines?",0,0.5,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r0ljxk/production_access/,2026-02-10 00:19:52,2026-02-11 02:30:38
1r07bq2,I hate AI with a burning passion,Then-Hurry-5197,learnprogramming,"I'm a CS sophomore and I absolutely love programming. It's actually become my favorite thing ever.

I love researching new Programming languages and even creating my own toy languages.My dream is to simply just work as a software engineer and write scalable maintainable code with my fellow smart programmers.But the industry is absolutely obsessed with getting LLMs to write code instead of humans. It angers me so much.Writing code is an art, it is a delicate craft that requires deep thought and knowledge. The fact that people are saying that ""Programming is dead"" infruits me so much.And AI can't even code to save it's life. It spits out nonsense inefficient code that doesn't even work half the time.Most students in my university do not have any programming skills. They just rely on LLMs to write code for them. They think that makes them programmers but these people don't know anything about Big O notation or OOP or functional programming or have any debugging skills.My university is literally hosting workshops titled ""Vibe Coding"" and it pisses me off on so many levels that they could have possibly approved of this.Many Companies in my country are just hiring people that just vibe code and double check the output codeIt genuinely scares me that I might not be able to work as a real software engineer who writes elegant and scalable systems.

Is this actually a thing?",ResolveKooky17,learnprogramming,"So my boss recently told me that try-catch statements are ""garbage"" and that I should avoid using them when developing. This wasn't specific to any particular language - they seemed to mean it as a general programming principle. I'm pretty confused because I thought error handling with try-catch was fundamental to most modern programming languages. I know it can be misused (like catching exceptions and doing nothing, or using exceptions for control flow), but completely avoiding it seems extreme. Is there some programming philosophy or best practice I'm missing here? Are there alternatives to try-catch that are considered better? Or is my boss maybe referring to specific anti-patterns that I should be aware of? Has anyone else encountered this ""no try-catch"" philosophy? What are the actual best practices around exception handling across different languages? Any insight would be really helpful - I want to understand if there's something legitimate here or if I should push back on this guidance. ‐-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When people say vague things like ""That's not good programming,"" I always ask, ""Why?""Why is it garbage?

The blank editor felt paralyzing.What I realized is I wasn't scared of not knowing enough. I was scared of writing bad code. Like somewhere I'd absorbed this idea that real programmers write clean elegant code on the first try, and if I couldn't do that, I wasn't ready to build yet.So I'd go do another tutorial. Where the code was already clean. Where I could follow along and feel competent without risking being bad at something.The thing that broke it was just... accepting I was going to write garbage. Not as a temporary state until I got good. As the permanent reality of programming. Everyone writes garbage first and then improves it.My first real project was mass truly mass mass terrible. Nested if statements everywhere, variables named ""thing2"", logic that made no sense. But it worked.

That led me to rethink everything and start thinking more about working independently or as a freelancer.Currently, I'm studying programming, and I started with the basics: HTML, CSS, and some web design.

Lately, the world of automation has caught my attention, but I have many doubts because there's a lot of talk about it on YouTube, and it doesn't always feel realistic.I understand that many people recommend ""starting a local business"" or ""taking any job,"" but in my case, I don't have capital to invest, I live in a small city, and I'm not hired because of my age. Even so, I'm a persistent person who learns quickly and doesn't give up when something doesn't work out.My goal today isn't to ""make easy money,"" but to learn a real, in-demand skill that makes sense in the long run—ideally something I can do remotely and independently.I'd appreciate constructive feedback on:whether my thinking is flawedwhat skills you see as most valuable for a young person (programming, data, automation, something else)what you would avoid if you were starting overI know I'm not the only one who's tried something like this at my age, so I really value any realistic advice.

1qzlroe,"Self taught programmer exhausted and lost, hoping for guidance",UsefulExplanation131,learnprogramming,"Hey, everyone. Im really hoping to get outside perspectives on some difficulties ive been experiencing while learning to program. I keep experiencing burn out and exhaustion over and over again and I can’t figure out why it keeps happening. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong anymore and just can’t think clearly about my situation anymore. Here is some background: Rough timeline of my programming journey: August 2022- I begin working through TOP curriculum with the goal of seeing if i enjoy programming. I decide that i do enjoy it -> Feb 2024 - I physically and mentally burn out from my job as a delivery driver. Managing my job, programming, and therapy was too much and I quit after i got injured while working.  March 2024- after spending a year going from 45 mins of studying/week to 10 hours/week, a mental health crisis, and 1 month after quitting my job, i complete the foundations module of TOP -> Nov or Dec 2024 - I take advantage of being unemployed and living off savings to focus hard on programming. I build up to studying 25-30 hours/week consistently. I realize I don’t like front end stuff. I choose the js path on TOP, skip the “advanced html/css” and “react section,” but complete everything else up to the file uploader project of the “NodeJS” section. Around December i take a small break to focus on an art project, and that snowballed to a few months of no programming (though i think that would’ve happened regardless if i took a break or not). -> Feb 2026 - the past year and few months were a blur of trying so hard to build back the habit of programming as well as i did the first time. I spend some months completely dreading programming and unable to start and some months of still struggling, but able to at least show up mostly consistently. I follow a pattern of on for 2-3 months to off for 2-3 months. After i learn I don’t like front end stuff and realize that endlessly building endpoints was equally dreadful, i decide to focus on other backend topics and keep finding myself bouncing around. I spend a few months on [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) then burn out. I go to nand2tetris to switch things up, last a month, then burn out. I decide to learn C from “C programming: a modern approach,” to switch things up again, and actually have some fun, but things fizzle out again. Every attempt leaves me broken and exhausted. At this point, I don’t know what to do. It’s getting harder and harder to restart. The feelings that kept me going during my most consistent periods of study, feeling like im improving and growing as a person and programmer, the satisfaction and euphoria of solving some problem that I genuinely believed i could not solve, just have been completely absent for so long. During all of this, ive been working hard in therapy to resolve a lot of things including social anxiety. I bring this up because i have bad social anxiety that prevents me from going to local programming meetups, participating in online programming communities, and applying for jobs. Going at this mostly alone just adds another layer of complexity to it all. Ive made a lot of progress on that front but still have a ways to go. I haven’t programmed in a couple months now and its like no amount of time away makes me dread programming any less. I feel spiritually broken. Im too close to my situation to think objectively anymore. What do y’all think i could do differently? Why does programming keep becoming this thing that i dread? Am i focusing on studying too much and not spending enough time making projects? For me, the hardest part about this whole journey (and ive realized this applies to many, maybe most, endeavors) hasn’t even been the intellectual side of things. That’s hard, sure, but by far the hardest part has been the emotional side of things. Specifically, having to find a way to program consistently over time. That’s the aspect of all of this that is the most soul crushing. It was hard to get yourself to program today, and guess what? You have to do it all over again tomorrow. And the day after. Maybe not every single day, but most weeks, most months. How do y’all not get overwhelmed with this? I think i do a decent job of focusing only on the short term but the big picture and the stakes are always on the back of my mind. I do find enjoyment in solving some programming problems, but I can’t deny that I wouldn’t be pursuing this if it wasn’t a well paying career that doesn’t require a degree. Which is the reason why i even decided to see if i enjoy programming and why i still pursue it after all this struggle. Every job ive had up to this point has been low skilled work. Server, cook, cashier, delivery driver, etc. I’m almost 25 and i want and need to get a career going. I can’t keep living the life that ive been living and programming seems to be a good enough fit. It’s intellectually challenging, doesn’t require a degree, well paying, and i find a lot of it enjoyable (even if there are a lot of things i find tedious and annoyingly boring).That being said, i do have ideas that get me excited and could be solved using code. Some of my programming project ideas include:* Something similar to GitHub but for digital artists to save snapshots of their artwork. * Data management system for iot devices. Inspiration came from thinking about how massive amounts of data from telescopes are efficiently stored and organized* A tool that takes a 3D model and allows you to see the cross section along the axial planes* A massive library of artworks that pulls artwork from the online catalogs of museums and other collection websitesI can’t help but feel like i am not ready for any of these projects and that I need to keep studying and learning before i can attempt any of them. That was part of the inspiration to learn c, to better learn how databases work by making a simple database since these are all data intensive projects. Anyway, if anyone has anything to share about what I could do better, that would be greatly appreciated.

The first thing I noticed is that most softwares we see are built on top of open source tools that have been made by thousands of developers world wide example: Linux, Database Management Systems, Frameworks so most devs work on business logic on top of this software.What is important for any programmer are fundamentals when you understand some commonly used fundamentals like: data types, variables, conditions statements, loops, collections, functions, data structure and OOP are enough for expressing logic. Before writing and following syntax I basically think a good programmer understands something in a very high level way instructions, also how the full flow works without touching the syntax. Then, the last part is translating high level written instructions into syntax based on a certain language.This is based on my opinion and how I have been coding also being language agonistic by ensuring that logic comes first before anything else.

There is also an ""harder"" version of it where you need to print 2 pyramids. you know, the beginner level stuffs..since i dont have prior syntax knowledge i asked AI to generate me a code in order to check it, study it and understand it. and after i did it, i felt everything was clear, i knew what every line did and why. NICE RIGHT?\#\##\###\####when it came part 2 i decided to imperatively not use AI and only using my knowledge acquired from the first exercise to complete it.this time the first of the two pyramid had to be reversed, so with blank spaces before the ""#"" symbols. Like this:\#\## \###\####So how do you reverse a pyramid? by starting printing spaces instead of ashes right ? perfect. This concept was pretty obvious and clear in my mind, as it should be, but the application? impossible. I could't ""invent"" a way to do it. I just lacked the creativity, even if i had all the starting points in front of me.The formula to print the ashes was the same exact formula for basically all the other operations in the program:for (int s = 0; s < height - i; s++) { printf("" "") }the only difference here is that im subtracting the variable (i) from the (height), because as the height increases i should also decrease the number of spaces. Perfect, logic and it works...BUT I COULDNT INVENT IT MYSELF!!! i totally lacked the creativity to think about subtracting (i) from (height) in order to solve my problem...i knew about the base formula and what it did, but i couldn't modify myself and understand what to doI HAD TO LOOK AT THE SOLUTION IN ORDER TO UNDERSTED WHAT TO DO.this is the very first set of exercises, this is the base.

The base system is promising and could be excellent, if the QA was more thorough.***So, why do I say coddy is utter garbage?** \- The website is riddled with bugs, from non-loading lessons to timeouts and very... very slow validation.\- A lot of the lessons have errors: They aren't properly formated, do not explain all the methods and systems needed to actually solve a lesson.\- The ""daily challenge"" system is a joke. Its some poorly made AI system that gives you a basic ass task like ""Print hello world 10 times"" despite being at chapters like HashMaps etc.\- There are numerous lessons where they do not actually explain to you what the desired output needs to be (given, you can see that by clicking the ""expected output"" toggle - but you should be able to see exactly what you need to do from the challenge description. \- This last point goes hand in hand with the issue that the output needs to be exact. They had one extra space at the end of their output, despite not showing that because you're tasked with printing the result of each itteration on a new line anyway? Instantly lose the ""first try"" challenge.\- Courses aren't even finished. I started the Python and Java course at the same time, hoping to refresh my python knowledge and picking up Java at the same time. Java's whole point is to be an OOP-language. Guess what: Section 3 ""Object oriented Programming"" is ""Coming Soon"":trade_mark:. What the actual fu\*\*?\- The website is clearly built around just monetizing everything as agressively as possible. I got lucky and was able to use a discount code during November to get 30% off monthly subscriptions so it was ""only"" 14.95 a month. Still: I do not feel like that value is really justified. The website has a lot of AI-Slop and wannabe intelligent assistance systems that either fail, timeout (I now know this is a firebase website because the website is printing firebase errors everywhere on every fuc\*\*\* interaction) and lots of lessons are very, very poorly worded.This could've been a 8.5/10 rating but as it stands, I'd say coddy is at best a 4/10 and you should probably look elsewhere.To their credit: They recently updated their Quizz section which made it less buggy and a lot more interactive.",18,0.95,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qxl2ai/coddytech_is_utter_garbage/,2026-02-06 15:43:48,2026-02-11 02:30:39
1r02yay,Coupling data with behaviour considered harmful,Achereto,learnprogramming,"I've seen a couple of posts by people new to programming struggling with understanding OOP and people in the responses making claims about the benefits of OOP. I want to give a bit of a different perspective on it, having written OO code for over 15 years and moving away from it over the last 2-3 years.The core idea of OO is to model things analogue to the real world. So for example a `Datetime` object would represent a specific date and time, and everything related to that (like adding a second or minute) would be implemented by the object. It would also allow you to compare dates in an expressive way. Some languages allow you to have something like `if (today < tomorrow)`, or calculate the difference using `one_day := tomorrow - today` which is neat. **This approach couples data with behaviour.** If you need to add behaviour to a class and you don't own the class, you can't just add the behaviour to the class, and if the fields of the class are private you also can't easily access them from the subclass. So you're already facing a design problem. Yes, people have thought about it and found solutions but the key is that the coupling of data and behaviour *created* the design problem that had to be solved. With structs and functions you could just write a new function and would be done. No design problem in the first place.But the problem becomes worse: With objects acting on their own behalf you lose the efficiency of [iterating over data and modifying it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAVbI1HIzCE). For every update on an object, you have to call a method and create significant computation overhead (and no, the compiler usually can't optimize this away).In fact, the problems created by coupling data to behaviour (like classes do) has become such a pain for developers that we started teaching ""Composition over Inheritance"". In simple terms this means that an object (containing data) shouldn't implement its own behaviour any more, but instead provide placeholders for other objects that implement specific behavior can be used by the original object, effectively decoupling data from behaviour again (undoing OO). One of the better talks explaining this principle is [Nothing is Something by Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE) from ~10 years ago. In her example in the second half of her talk you can see that the `House` class is stripped down to data and placeholders for behaviour, giving her the maximum flexibility for new features.To reiterate: **OOP couples data with behaviour. The design problems arising from this are best solved by decoupling data from behaviour again**If you need more convincing data, then you can look at all the [OOP Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns). 13 of those 22 patterns (including the most useful ones) are actually separating data from behaviour, 3 are debatable if they do (Composite, Facade, Proxy) and only 6 (Abstract Factory, Prototype, Singleton, Flyweight, Memento, Observer) aren't about separating data from behaviour.If coupling data with behaviour is the root problem for many design problems in programming and the solutions people come up with are different ways to decouple data from behaviour again, then you should clearly avoid coupling them in the first place to avoid all of these problems.So what should you learn instead of OO? I would say that Entity Component Systems (ECS) are a good start as they seems to continue emerging as a solution to most design problems. Even ""Composition over Inheritance"" is already a step towards ECS. ECS have become more popular of the last years with both Unity, Godot, and Unreal Engine switching to it. There is a fantastic video about the [ECS in Hytale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglU107_DA4) as well, explaining how this makes modding extremely easy. More upcoming companies will do ECS in the next years and learning it now will put you in an advantage in the hiring processes. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. :)(ps: not sure if ""Tutorial"" is the right Flair because I don't actually show code, but it may be the best fit for explaining a concept and its downsides)",18,0.8,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r02yay/coupling_data_with_behaviour_considered_harmful/,2026-02-09 12:30:41,2026-02-11 02:30:39

Please help me. I am here because I don't want to use AI chatbots to write codes for me. I want this project to be extremely intentional. I need your help!My questions for now-1. What application should I use to code this?2. What are your opinions on the feasibility of this project? Do you think I can do it considering my experience with coding?

I'm a bachelor of music student and my main focus has been in emerging music technology for a long time, but it was only recently when I took an elective course in Pure Data that my mind was opened to the possibilities of creating my own VSTs, and it wasn't until even more recently that my roommate/bandmate suggested that he use his electrical engineering course to good use and we make music hardware together. Naturally, I love this idea, and we've been conceptualising a few admittedly ambitious ideas for boutique guitar pedals, synthesizers and other music hardware that we'd love to use ourselves, but now that he's started his EE course, I'm at a position where I really do have to start locking in and learning the relevant programming. I'm aware it'll take years before we're both skilled enough to create anything close to the ideas that we have now, but I figure it's never too early to start learning now. For VSTs in particular, I know the JUCE framework for C++ is the standard, and I've found a decent amount of resources on that, so I'm not too worried about it. My bigger question regards the hardware side of things. Which microcontrollers are standard for pedals, eurorack modules, synthesizers, etc, or does it depend more on processing power and other factors i'm not yet aware of? Is C++ a good language to know or should I also think about branching out and learning other languages instead? How does one even write code for microcontrollers and make it interact with the electronic components on the PCB? Are these stupid questions? As you can tell, I am truly lost in the dark here as I haven't an ounce of programming experience (outside of pure data and briefly learning GML when I was younger) but I know I can learn it, I just desperately need to know where to start, where to find resources, who to talk to, and what I should focus on learning now.

1qz5qrj,How to create a random video player executable,Special-Afternoon-25,learnprogramming,"The situation is the following: both my parents are retired, and because they have neither hobbies nor social life, they spend most of their time at home watching the news. Due to this I noticed a deterioration lately in their mental health and mood. I thought I could download some of the series they used to watch time ago, store them in a USB and connect it to the TV so they can watch that instead of the news all the time. My parents are old and they would not know how to navigate through Netflix or other platforms, so I‘d have to do it this way.What I would like, and here is my question for you, is a file in the USB that randomly plays any video file in the USB. My parents basically use the TV as background noise so they wouldn’t care about what’s playing or follow the episodes in a given order. I want a file that they click on it and it plays whatever in the USB stick, and I need it to be random so it doesn’t always play the same episode first. I also need it to play episodes non-stop, so that they don’t need to click on the file after every episode.I have some knowledge in Python and bash, so if you give me a hint on what kind of file could do such a thing maybe I can write it on my own. The approach I can think of is the following; when I click on this file it will:- Collect all the file names in the USB (or the ones with a video format).- Sort them on a random order.- Grab the first 20 files on the list.- Play this 20 episodes as a playlist.On a computer I could write it so that VLC plays this list of files, but on a TV I don’t know how it could be done.

1qz1j3i,AI coding - Are we killing the golden goose ?,Ravenclaw_Guy,learnprogramming,"Before I start my rant, I want to say I use AI everyday. I use it for:1. Understanding a concept/service. Why is it designed in a particular way and verifying the sources (not all the time, only when I am skeptical of the answers).2. Understanding a piece of code from a language I am not familiar with. Asking the LLM to explain each line.3. Asking the agent to edit a specific function in an unfamiliar language to do a certain thing and asking the agent to explain line by line.4. Writing unit tests.5. Pros/Cons of a system design approach. 6. Fixing the grammatical mistakes that I make while writing something or asking it to rewrite certain sentences which are harder for audiences to grasp.The ability of an LLM to do all of the above is big win and a big productivity boost for me. I am still amazed by the capabilities of an LLM to do all the above. However, I am somewhat disappointed and puzzled by the upper management push to not write code at all and delegate the writing part to AI agents. When we wrote code line by line, it gave us the ability to understand the software that we are building in a fundamental level. The friction we had when writing code, helped us to develop critical thinking and helped develop the debugging skills (the golden egg the management got over time). If we delegate this work to AI, are we not going to lose this skill eventually ? When things go wrong, the senior management is going to ask the engineers to fix the issue not an LLM. The engineer has to have atleast some mental model of how the code works. Isn't it too late and expensive to rewrite things when a production issue happens ?Finally, how are software engineers going to create novel libraries/services if they don’t write code and understand the underlying behavior. Are we sure that the engineers can create a library like React if they have not written HTML/JS by hand in years. I want to know your thoughts and hear opposing view points.

Belfort dropped out.A lot of you all here need to take some inspiration from that. Gatekeepers are annoying I know but the doom and gloom in this field has reached a point where I, as a senior engineer in this field, feel a call to gatekeep a little bit.The COVID era job market is never coming back - at least not any time soon which may as well mean never for those of you trying to break into this field with no passion. And that word is the heart of what I want to get at here; passion.Obviously there are still dentists today. Most of whom became dentists well after Belfort was a student and discouraged from his dreams. Just as there will be software engineers well into the future.But the people that became dentists despite the market drying up did so because they had a true passion for the field. It still pays well sure but there was a golden age that has now passed and this is where CS is now.This post isn't to straight up tell you to give up on a CS career. But, if you have been struggling to find a job for awhile now, you should take a step back and a bit of time to reflect on why you are here.

The analogy is not to say they don't do well if they land jobs its to say they do well IF THEY DO land jobs. And thats the challenge of the current CS market. Its great money IF YOU CAN LAND A JOB.

1qxt8b6,AI Doom and layoffs,iwuvpuppies,cscareerquestions,"I made this post to help explain the current state of software development jobs, especially for new and junior developers. I hope this eases some of your worries. It is long, bear with me.Software Engineering, like any other careers is cyclical. Jobs are at the mercy of demand, trends, and capital. We saw an influx during 2010's and especially during and after Covid (early 2020's) when companies started hiring to hoard talent.Lets get to the layoffs. For those who think layoffs are the direct result of AI, you are not completely wrong. But there are more factors at play. The hard reality is the American economy may be in the midst of economic hardship (recession). This takes us to my first point.1. Companies using AI as an excuse to downsize and make the books look good.First reason: Executive Bonuses. Public companies are at the mercy of quarterly reports. One bad quarter could cost some asshole millionaire his/her job. This sadly incentivizes short term gains and hurts the company long term. But who cares as long as they get their bonus right? AI is a goldmine for execs. They buy a Claude or Copilot subscription and start firing devs. They then take the money they were paying those devs back to the board or shareholders and get rewarded with a bonus.Second reason: Optics. Instead of telling shareholders they need to cut costs (signs of weakness), companies can now conveniently say ""AI Efficiency"". “We don’t need as many people” sounds better than “we can’t afford them”. To top that off, the market rewards any mention of AI with a stock bump. Again the millionaire assholes gets their bonus.2. Management is not immune to industry trends. Leadership is not perfect, they will make mistakes. Unfortunately we are often the victims of those mistakes. Executives talk to peers, copy what other companies are doing, then push it internally. Often times, this comes in the form of asking devs to vibe code/prompts/use agents.3. Take a close look at motivations. The same people dooming and glooming software development are often the ones collecting million dollar bonuses for selling the hype and tools.Below is how things will play out:After management finishes downsizing and the quality of the product goes to shit (either from the vibe coding or short staffing), we will see the following:* Companies admiting AI didn’t deliver the expected benefits* Anyone tied to the AI initiative gets fired (after they get their million dollar bonuses of course)* Start hiring engineers again* AI repositioned as “assistive"" rather than substitutiveTime and time again we have seen this with offshoring, outsourcing and any form of automation.My recommendation, if you enjoy coding, keep doing it. After the hype and fad dies down, this job will continue to be in demand.“In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death, taxes, and executive bonuses”",286,0.91,138,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qxt8b6/ai_doom_and_layoffs/,2026-02-06 20:39:42,2026-02-11 02:30:41

1qy2hu5,Mid Level SDE - Has the Job Market ever been this bad? Are jobs in Big Tech all that's left?,tran981,cscareerquestions,"I've been a SDE in FAANG for almost 5 years, mostly rated Top Tier each year, worked on lots of scope, and left last year due to moral reasons and burning out from ever increasing workloads from Big Tech. I took a large break to heal and moved back in with my parents to reconnect since I moved far away to pursue this role and I figured it would be easy to land a Job near my hometown which is near a big city.BUT its been about 6 months after I started seriously searching and it feels like all of the jobs openings are in Big Tech and I can barely find roles that would I felt would be regular jobs a few years ago. Every small-mid size company has only 1-2 roles open at a time, if at all, and the competition is intense. Every application has hundreds of people applying based on LinkedIn and Indeed.I don't think I qualify or want to push myself to take Senior roles, which have much more openings by far, but for Mid Level roles, I feel like I'm looking a unicorn. Friends who work in non Big Tech jobs tell me how wonderful it is to work in a low stress environment and have coworkers who have been there for decades, while I feel like I'm going crazy just looking for a job.I knew the job search would be bad, but its genuinely horrible and I can't imagine what someone without experience or less experience than what you'd get at FAANG would be going through right now. I'm leveraging use of all resources of networks, cold calling, and the like, but with how dry the market is, every rejection and non offer after long interview sessions hits like a truck.I love this work, am staunchly anti-AI, and don't expect a large paycheck for my next job, but is it so hard of an ask for fulfilling work that I don't have to think about all day and on weekends??

During our 1:1 he asked if I was using AI, how I was finding it. I said blatantly that it is good for boilerplate and understanding the repo and changes done, and great for tests, albeit still needs significant edits. For actual development work, it has proved lackluster.He was pushing that coding was dead and AI should be able to do all of it now, so we should all be much faster. He also mentioned software quality in the same discussion, advocating AI should make it easier. He then gave an example of someone he knew in a well known company who was very experienced, IC6 level, and he was bring told that he needs to use AI or go away. Whilst using AI has been useful, I do think the extent of it's usage is being stretched significantly by people who are even developers or were themselves. How does everyone find using AI for their companies so far? When i make a new side project and do simple client side work, it's great and I rarely need to read any code. But for my corporate job, it still hallucinated a lot even with very specific prompting.

1qyhsyp,"Stuck in a ""Senior Loop""",ShoddyWorkmanshipTed,cscareerquestions,"I was promoted to Senior Engineer originally about 11/12 years ago. After a few years I left the company as I felt like promotion above that was impossible. I was essentially doing the work of other tech leads in the company, but there was always a vague reason promotion to get the title I was already doing wasnt coming. It was always ""next cycle"". I left and went to another company. Hired as a Senior, within about a year or two I'm basically acting tech lead again in terms of responsibilities. But again, every cycle I was told I'd be promoted in the *next* cycle and it never happened. After frustration, I left and started the cycle again at my current company. I'm now approaching my 4th anniversary and the same cycle has played out again, and I'm sensing the same excuses coming as to why no promotion will happen again this year.I'm very frustrated. I'm working at a higher level than my title suggests and have been for a long while now. No offense to the people around me but I now report up through people with much less experience.If I leave, I can't get past a screening for a ""lead"", ""staff"", ""principal"" roles because they want a few years at that title already. If I accept another Senior position, I'm basically back to ""Day 1"" and have to grind to reach the ever elusive carrot or promotion in a few years and I'm worn out of trying hard, having responsibility pushed on me, but never actually getting the reward. What do people at this level do. I'm good at my job from a technical perspective and I seem to be well trusted in terms of people skills, managing a team, but the political side of forcing promotions seems to not be something I'm good at. Edit: Thank you for the helpful and respectful comments, it has given me a few things I need to think about and improve my approach towards.

I gave my reports honest end of year ratings and submitted them last week. Yesterday all of my ratings were sent back to me to redo. I thought that I had made some sort of mistake or forgot to do something.Last night, HR messaged me and said that my manager has asked that I lower the ratings that I gave to all of my reports.I'm upset by this for many reasons and don't know how to respond.I work in the same office as my manager and feel like we have a decent relationship. Why is he going through HR instead of coming to me?I gave my reports ratings that I sincerely believe they deserve. My boss is completely non technical and has no idea what makes a good software engineering employee. He's not qualified to rate them. If my employees don't deserve the rating that I gave them, then what do they need to do in order to get the higher rating, since they're already doing those things? I don't know how to respond, because every way forward involves something that has the potential to hurt my career, my employment status, or my integrity.I could lie to my employees and make something up as to why they didn't deserve better. That's likely the best thing for my employment status and career, at least at this company. But it makes me absolutely sick.I could tell my employees that I rated them higher but that my boss, who they have daily contact with, didn't think they deserved it. That doesn't feel like a good idea.I could refuse to change the rating. That's also not going to go well for me.My decision as of right now is that I'm going to set up a . meeting with HR and tell them that I'm not going to change their ratings without some convincing justification.I feel like if my boss wants the ratings changed, then my reports should be moved under him, and he needs to own their ratings. I'm unhappy about it in any case, but I'm more comfortable if he owns what he's done and the software engineers know it was him. I left my last company for similar reasons, and I'm now considering switching again.Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed?Update: After reading the advice here, I've messaged HR to set up a meeting with them to try and understand:1.

1qweuys,I don't enjoy CS anymore,ShakesR12,cscareerquestions,"I am currently in my last year of a Computer Science degree at a T10 public university and will be graduating this June after finishing the degree in three years. I am also minoring in Statistics and Management and have applied for a Master's program as a backup.Academically, I have done well with a 3.7 GPA and I have never really struggled to understand CS concepts. With a few hours of focused studying, I can usually grasp everything and do well on exams. The issue has not been that the material is too hard. It is more about motivation and how I feel about the path I am on.After freshman year, where I honestly did not do much career wise, reality hit me in my second year. I felt like I had to catch up. I took on multiple research projects to make up for my lack of industry experience, built personal projects, constantly took 20 units a quarter along with some community college classes, and spent a lot of time grinding LeetCode. I really pushed myself because I thought that if I did everything right, the results would come.But even after all that effort, I did not see the outcomes I expected in terms of internships or job offers. That gap between effort and results has been mentally exhausting. Over time, the constant grind with no clear payoff has worn me down, and I have lost the excitement I used to have for CS.I have realized that I do not hate problem solving. I still like thinking through ideas and solutions. I especially enjoy working with numbers and seeing patterns, which is why my Statistics and Management minor has felt more interesting recently. What I do not enjoy is the actual process of coding. Sitting and building things line by line feels draining, even though thinking about the solution at a higher level feels engaging.Right now I am not excited about more studying, more interview prep, or more side projects.

1qvqdy6,Is it worth it to leave my current job for Capital One?,thelilbel,cscareerquestions,"I have worked at a small startup (\~150-200 employees) for the past 2 years as a full-stack engineer. When I started, I was making 100k base, but I was promoted a year ago and now make 125k. I love that my job is remote, I like the work I do, and I get along well with my team. I am 26F and currently have 5 YoE and an engineering degree from an Ivy. In December, a recruiter from Capital One reached out to me. I guess at one point I had applied in the past and was rejected but my name was in their system and they wanted to consider me for a Senior Software Engineer (Principal Associate) role. I kinda thought eh, what the hell why not, but after a little brushing up on Leetcode I managed to pass the online assessment and the Power Day and am now at the team match phase. The recruiter called me yesterday to let me know that while I still passed, they ultimately are going to offer me a Software Engineer (Senior Associate) role, which is the level below what I interviewed for. I'm honestly shocked I even passed so this is still good news, and according to Levels.fyi I would be making \~160k base in NYC which is significantly more than what I make now.Now that I've passed and I'm waiting to hear back about team match, I was looking on Blind and Reddit about working at Capital One and I worry that the culture is really cutthroat. Apparently every 6 months they PIP 15% of employees per team and it's common for new hires to get cut. This is really concerning to me. My entire career I've been more used to a startup environment where there is obviously a chance of layoffs (and have been through one) but they weren't cutting teams every 6 months. Going from having mostly startups on my resume to having somewhere with more name recognition like Capital One might be more beneficial for my career in the long run, plus the compensation is significantly more than what I make currently. However, I worry that I'll be out of a job in 6 months and with this current job market I don't think most people are in a place to take risks. I'm weighing the pros and cons and I'm not sure how to proceed once I hear back about team match and get an offer. Should I stay at my current job, or take the leap?",75,0.89,119,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qvqdy6/is_it_worth_it_to_leave_my_current_job_for/,2026-02-04 14:44:01,2026-02-11 02:30:41

For the longest time I was quite against using AI to develop code because I wanted to enjoy the challenges, solve problems etc. I simply enjoy my job too much to want to delegate it away.And recently, I've been experimenting with some AIs (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude) because as much as I enjoy my job, I don't want to fall behind. But my real, hands on experience was that AI was only really useful as a glorified autocomplete, generating boilerplate code, and maybe stuff like terraform skeleton code. It's good for things that are not a problem at all and that I can do quite fast myself anyway, but whenever I try to use AI to solve an actual problem/something I'm stuck on/something that requires logic, it always fails miserably. Trying to talk it into actually doing the work, and even pointing out the mistakes (and entering the, 'you're right, I'll fix that!' loop for ever), it makes me feel like a Sisyphus, and it never goes anywhere. Pretty much every single time I've attempted it, I was better off writing the code myself anyway. But everywhere I look, I see people about agentic ai, using ai in development and increasing the productivity 10x, etc. but in reality, these are never followed up with real life actual examples, it just feels like a cloud of buzzwords and people parroting what's currently popular.",56,0.78,164,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r0clp4/do_you_actually_use_ai_to_develop_code_beyond_it/,2026-02-09 18:43:54,2026-02-11 02:30:41

Luckily, I got an offer from a company that was willing to teach me a low-code platform to be a developer in (Pega). Things were pretty ok but I eventually changed roles to do manual QA and I'd been doing that for about 3 or 4 years. Due to government lockdowns and budget cuts, I got laid off and now I'm not really sure what I can do.

Should I try and relearn my pega skills even though there are less jobs up for that? Relearn java/c++ thru bootcamp or otherwise? Try and learn javascript or python for automated testing roles? New language entirely like Cobol or Rust? I'm just feeling very lost and not sure where the best use of my time would be.

HR and people involved feel good drafting a super demanding job posting requirement and process. I internally cringe when I compare it to what actually is the job.The truth is no one wants to challenge it, my theory is it’s because in terms of optics. When leaders and execs say they hire senior only, it gives the impression that they are raising the bar, that they work on super hard problems, that the org super mature, etc... No one wants to say the truth that sometimes ""well actually what we work on here is not too hard, let's get a coachable hire we can invest in"". Last we tried we got shut down hard.What happens then, we eventually find someone senior enough that can pass the process, then they are underutilized, get frustrated and leave. Or they stay but invent problems and over engineer (and some important basic work does not get done).In the recent job posting I worked on, we had to remove a line about how ""you will get to coach juniors"" because we literally don't have any now.

1r0zfc2,Were recent tech layoffs disproportionately affecting former bootcamp hires?,se898,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I’m asking mostly out of curiosity and to get a sense of how things look from inside the industry today.I used to be a software developer in Seattle about ten years ago. I worked in the field for roughly two years before deciding to switch careers and move on to something else. I’ve been out of tech for a long time now, but I still loosely follow what’s going on. Watching the wave of layoffs since 2022, one thing I’ve been wondering about is whether they disproportionately affected people who entered tech through coding bootcamps during the 2015 to 2021 boom. Back when I was around, bootcamps were just starting to become a thing, and later they seemed to turn into a very common path into junior roles. From the outside, it feels like when hiring tightened, companies cut a lot of junior or surface level roles first. That made me wonder whether former bootcamp hires, especially career switchers with fewer years of deep experience, were more exposed compared to traditional CS grads or more senior engineers.I’m not trying to bash bootcamps or the people who went through them. I’m genuinely curious whether people inside companies noticed any real pattern during layoffs, or whether this is mostly selection bias and anecdotal noise.For those who stayed in tech through the last few years, did layoffs feel credential blind, or were certain backgrounds more vulnerable? Did former bootcamp grads fare worse, better, or about the same as everyone else once the market contracted? Would really appreciate perspectives from engineers, hiring managers, or anyone who went through layoffs themselves.TL;DR:Former software dev from Seattle, out of the industry for about 10 years. Curious whether the post-2022 layoffs hit former bootcamp hires harder than others, or if that’s just anecdotal.",14,0.62,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r0zfc2/were_recent_tech_layoffs_disproportionately/,2026-02-10 12:29:26,2026-02-11 02:30:41

The 2nd human can think in a truly independent way regardless of what the first human has tried. Hallucinations can still happen between humans but they are much rarer and even when they do happen are usually understandable and predictable.In short, I've observed that human collaboration is scalable in a way that AI agent collaboration is not.It's almost as if due to the simple fact that each human has a unique neural net wiring, human collaboration is able to make discoveries and break throughs that a single neural net whether synthetic or biological, cannot compete against.It's as if the current state of the art for AI is still only at the level where it's a tool.

After the pandemic... it fluctuated between 100% remote and hybrid. Every time I went fully remote, I eventually hated it. I felt purposeless, like I had a ""fake job,"" and struggled with the lack of structure (I’ve discussed this extensively in therapy).- Last Year: Worked a 1-year stint for a government contractor (hybrid). This worked fairly well for me mentally. I actually did a lot of work on remote days, but from a closer office just to focus. But the contract folded over the summer due to budget cuts (DOGE), forcing me to find a new job quickly. Some other parts of the job didn't quite work...it was a far commute in particular.- Current Role (6 months): I joined a smaller ""boutique"" government contracting firm. It’s 100% remote, and the same bad feelings have returned. On top of the isolation, the environment is toxic, disorganized, and the codebase is chaotic. But after the shakeup last summer with contracting work, I felt desperate. I’m looking again and have landed 5 interviews, mostly focusing on in-person or hybrid roles. Mostly SCIF work in the government contracting world...but the front-runner is a role 20 minutes from my house with core hours of 10am–2pm. They seem really modern, use Svelte and more prototyping stuff, but just the nature of it can't be remote. Where I'm at rn, I mean...it's really not working out, and I have the experience to know and see these are some bad managers and work environment...even outside of it being remote. I feel at odds. My mental health and history tell me I need to be in the office (or at least hybrid) to feel purposeful and get out of the house. But now that it's becoming real, I’m worried I’m going to miss the freedom of remote work once it's gone.Also planning to push for more money. I currently make around $170k TC. I'm gonna push more for $200k-$220k. Security clearance work and being only on-site, I think could justify it.

1qz768l,"Is starting as a Support / Escalation Engineer at a US SaaS company a smart move, or a career step back?",kyngslyr,cscareerquestions,"I’m a backend software engineer with about 2.5 years of experience, mostly working with .NET/C# and SQL. I’m currently at a service-based company and was promoted fairly early into a senior/lead-type role, which means I’ve had exposure to architecture decisions, client calls, and owning delivery end to end.Lately though, I don’t feel great about where I am. The work is very project-driven, there isn’t much real product thinking, and there’s no meaningful senior mentorship above me. I’ve learned a lot by being pushed into responsibility early, but it also feels like I’m starting to plateau, and I’m not convinced staying longer actually improves my long-term trajectory.I recently went through interviews with a US-led SaaS company, and they’ve communicated intent to extend an offer. The role is titled “Support Engineer,” which is what’s making me hesitate. On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role.From conversations with their engineering leadership, though, this doesn’t sound like a traditional ticket-only support job. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes. They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path.What I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment.There’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.If you’ve worked in product SaaS companies or made a similar move, how would you look at this? What would you watch for early on to tell whether it’s actually a stepping stone versus a dead end? Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?EDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.",11,0.83,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qz768l/is_starting_as_a_support_escalation_engineer_at_a/,2026-02-08 12:01:09,2026-02-11 02:30:41

However, it just seems like a long winded and challenging path that I do not want to do.So, I am in a predicament.

1qyx6p5,Should I be focusing on side projects and/or my own company?,Skullruss,cscareerquestions,"So I'm a fresh graduate with my B.S. in C.S., I started in 2019 and I just graduated in December, 2025. I have 4.5 years of full-stack experience from an internship I had basically up until I graduated, but I was laid off in October along with 60% of the devs when we finished our job and focus shifted from building the app to maintenance. I'm glad to have gotten the experience, but it meant that I took 6 years to graduate in the first place.Applying to jobs feels worthless. It feels like I might as well have no degree and no experience. I can't tell if it's because of the sites I'm using to look for jobs, or because AI, or recession, or because my resume isn't good enough (which means grads with actually no experience are completely fucked). Currently I'm unemployed and applying to jobs here and there that look like I match their requirements and pay decently well, in the 70-85k range makes sense to me for SE MI with experience and a degree.I've been slowly building a website that I think provides a niche unique utility to a gaming community I've been in for over a decade as a side project, nothing super serious. Though I think I can monetize it through ads or a freemium model and maybe just pour my efforts into that as somehow a better alternative. Is it crazy to think that investing my time into my own site that could just flop and make no money is the way to go? I figure it's either gonna support me or be a good portfolio addition, but I don't know if it's short-sighted to consider self-employment the way to go or if the dev doomerism has simply taken control of my brain.What do you guys with experience think?

I don't know any of you personally and we have tons of applicants so sorry.Anyway I work for a smallish size it contracting company. Less than 500 people. Not close to faang they do mostly work for companies who do other stuff but need software. Think medical companies, insurance companies, etc. Everyone wants AI applications lately. I am involved in the hiring process. I sit in on interviews. I conduct them a lot of times, or if someone higher up than me decides to join I will just listen and throw in a question here and there.We are currently interviewing recent grads or seniors in American colleges. The job is onsight, not on the west coast. Most of the candidates we get are from colleges within an hour or two drive to the office.We have interviewed about 20 people. The questions vary a little but we always ask a few ""control"" questions and a coding question. An example of one of the control questions is ""explain the difference between post and put"" and the coding question is the same difficulty level of ""given a list of numbers, find the duplicate"". So easier than leet code easy, imo. No challenging test cases, the hardest thing is one of the test cases is unsorted. We give people 20-25 minutes to attack the coding problem.Out of 20 people, only 3 have gotten the put vs post question fully correct and gotten the coding question fully correct. Another candidate got the coding question 90% correct but then he stopped and said ""can I explain a better solution to you?"" In the last 5 minutes and it was better so we gave him credit. Probably 4 people got the put vs post question correct but didn't complete the coding portion. 4-5 candidates could not write enough code to even try one test case. The other ones got some of the test cases right but had incomplete solutions.Only one candidate out of 20 seemed like this interview was easy. He ended up finishing the coding question in 10 minutes and I started asking him about some ML work he did in school.I make no conclusions from this it's just my experience. Take it how you will if you are applying for entry level jobs. My only advice is, you should be studying and you should be able to answer at least 15-20 entry level type of questions with ease. And you should be able to easily do coding questions that are easier than leet code easy.Also, if you are trying to get a remote job you will obviously be competing with more people. I think part of the reason our candidates feel weak to me is we're on site and we're not exactly in a tech hub.",7,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r1kccm/some_perspective_on_hiring/,2026-02-11 01:57:34,2026-02-11 02:30:41

The problem started recently, where my manager decided that I have to learn Business Intelligence, in particular how to make dashboard (a task that I hate and I'm really bad at since I have basically zero aesthetic sense), in order not to present my job to internal stakeholders, but to sell them outside the company (and this worries me A LOT, I spoke about this with my internal stakeholder and he seemed worried too).My perception about why this did happen was that the head of data made some terrible choices that burned out the budget and now they have to find a way to save money (about 60% of the BI team left not being replaced recently). They'll probably to sell this transition as a new way to intend the Data Engineering job, compliant with our target company model.Now I'll soon have to speak with my manager about this, I'll for sure tell him that I'm not ok with this, and that I expected to proceed in a more managerial path, rather than taking on more technical work, that I cannot do and I'm not brilliant with. But I fear that this won't make any changes. So what would you do in my place?I thought about:1. Leaving the company (the market isn't as bad as in the US, so it's not out of questions, but i still would like to have an offer first)2. Take a step back and ask for part-time trying to use the free time to land some other job (perhaps freelance or something different)3.
