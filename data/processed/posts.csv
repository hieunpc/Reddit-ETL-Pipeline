1ppuky6,My “small data” pipeline checklist that saved me from building a fake-big-data mess,Jhaspelia,dataengineering,"I work with datasets that are not huge (GBs to low TBs), but the pipeline still needs to be reliable. I used to overbuild: Kafka, Spark, 12 moving parts, and then spend my life debugging glue. Now I follow a boring checklist to decide what to use and what to skip.If you’re building a pipeline and you’re not sure if you need all the distributed toys, here’s the decision framework I wish I had earlier.1. Start with the SLA, not the techAsk:* How fresh does the data need to be (minutes, hours, daily)?* What’s the cost of being late/wrong?* Who is the consumer (dashboards, ML training, finance reporting)?If it’s daily reporting, you probably don’t need streaming anything.2. Prefer one “source of truth” storage layerPick one place where curated data lives and is readable by everything:* warehouse/lakehouse/object storage, whatever you have Then make everything downstream read from that, not from each other.3. Batch first, streaming only when it pays rentStreaming has a permanent complexity tax:* ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills. If your business doesn’t care about real-time, don’t buy that tax.4. Idempotency is the difference between reliable and hauntedEvery job should be safe to rerun.* partitioned outputs* overwrite-by-partition or merge strategy* deterministic keys If you can’t rerun without fear, you don’t have a pipeline, you have a ritual.5. Backfills are the real workloadDesign the pipeline so backfilling a week/month is normal:* parameterized date ranges* clear versioning of transforms* separate “raw” vs “modeled” layers6. Observability: do the minimum that prevents silent failureAt least:* row counts or volume checks* freshness checks* schema drift alerts* job duration tracking You don’t need perfect observability, you need “it broke and I noticed.”7. Don’t treat orchestration as optionalEven for small pipelines, a scheduler/orchestrator avoids “cron spaghetti.” Airflow/Dagster/Prefect/etc. is fine, but the point is:* retries* dependencies* visibility* parameterized runs8. Optimize lastMost pipelines are slow because of bad joins, bad file layout, or moving too much data, not because you didn’t use Spark. Fix the basics first:* partitioning* columnar formats* pushing filters down* avoiding accidental cartesian joinsMy rule of thumbIf you can meet your SLA with:* a scheduler* Python/SQL transforms* object storage/warehouse and a couple checksthen adding a distributed stack is usually just extra failure modes.Curious what other people use as their “don’t overbuild” guardrails. What’s your personal line where you say “ok, now we actually need streaming/Spark/Kafka”?",481,0.98,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ppuky6/my_small_data_pipeline_checklist_that_saved_me/,2025-12-18 16:06:50,2025-12-24 01:46:12

1pqqnmp,Realization that I may be a mid-level engineer at best,I_Blame_DevOps,dataengineering,"Hey r/dataengineering, Feeling a bit demoralized today and wondering if anyone else has come to a similar realization and how they dealt with it. Approximately 6 months ago I left a Sr. DE job on a team of 5 to join a startup as their sole data engineer. The last job I was at for 4.5 years and helped them create reliable pipelines for \~15 sources and build out a full QC process that all DEs followed, created code standards + CI/CD that linted our code and also handled most of the infrastructure for our pipelines. During this time I was promoted multiple times and always had positive feedback. Cut to my current job where I have been told that I am not providing enough detail in my updates and that I am not specific enough about what went wrong when fixing bugs or encountering technical challenges. And - the real crux of the issue - I failed to deliver on a project after 6 months and they have of course wanted to discuss why the project failed. For context the project was to create a real time analytics pipeline that would update client reporting tables. I spent a lot of time on the infrastructure to capture the changes and started running into major challenges when trying to reliably consume the data and backfill data.We talked through all of the challenges that I encountered and they said that the main theme of the project they picked up on was that I wasn't really ""engineering"" in that they felt I was just picking an approach and then discovering the challenges later. Circling back to why I feel like maybe I'm just a mid-level engineer, in every other role I've been in I've always had someone more senior than me that understood the role. I'm wondering if I'm not actually senior material and can't actually do this role solo.

Too early to call it perfect, but it feels less scary than handing out SQL editors.Curious what the rest of you are doing:* Do you let business users touch warehouse data at all, or is everything ticket-driven?* If you built a portal / upload tool / internal UI, did you go custom code or something like Retool / Appsmith / UI Bakery / similar?* Any “we thought this would be fine, then someone updated 50k rows by mistake” stories you are willing to share?Trying to find a balance between safety, governance and not spending my whole week building yet another admin panel.",81,0.96,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pqxp2n/how_are_you_exposing_safe_edit_access_to_business/,2025-12-19 22:02:58,2025-12-24 01:46:12

1pqdjh9,Left DE Before Even Getting a Job,HarvesterOfReveries,dataengineering,"Just sharing my story here, not a successful one. I was trying to switch from legacy backend dev at a government organization to a DE role. Did relevant projects, learned a lot, but no luck. I was comfortable working with python, docker, a few frameworks like Airflow, Spark, Dagster, DBT etc. and of course git and Java + a few tools that nobody uses in DE from the job that I was doing.Did about 100 applications, spending a fair bit of time tweaking applications to match every job that I applied to. Did not apply for stuff that I wasn't interested in. Got pretty much nothing.I did however also applied to a few software dev roles too. Ended up landing one and got incredibly lowballed but I was so tired of my previous job, I had to take it like an idiot.Well, started the new job and the work was pretty fun. But colour me surprised, the thing that pushed me out from the previous job wasn't the culture or the work just being boring, it was the cycle. I'm only 26 and honestly, I can't imagine working 9-5 until I turn 50 or 60. I'm drafting up some ideas, learning and researching what's required to create products on my own. Once I'm confident enough in an idea and the progress, I'll probably quit. Or get fired because I'm distracted. Staying for a few for months because of financial constraints.Anybody else have similar experiences? I find it so weird that I was so interested in DE just a year ago, still confident that I can perform well in it, but completely lost interest to put in the effort because in the end I know I'll just get paid peanuts for the actual amount of work I'll do (pay in my country is garbage). The only thing that might change this would be life changing compensation, but obviously that requires much more prep that I don't know if I have the time for (or the ability for that matter). Even that wouldn't be a sustainable way out of this dumb rotten week cycle we humans invented for ourselves. Work like a mchine for 5 days and be tired for the rest of the day after work? Recover from that shit for 2 days and then get back to it again? Fuck.

Engineers are arguing that they are already on AWS and Redshift natively integrates with VPC, IAM roles, etc. And with reserved instances, cost of ownership looks cheaper than showflake.Analysts are not cool with it however. They complain about distribution keys and the trouble with parsing of json logs. They are struggling with Redshift's SUPER data type. They claim it’s ""weak for aggregations"" and requires awkward casting hacks. They want snowflake because it works no frills (especially VARIANT and dot notation) and they can query semi structured data.The big argument is that savings on Redshift RIs will be eaten up by the salary cost of engineers having to constantly tune WLM queues and fix skew.What needs to be picked here?

1poyoks,How to data warehouse with Postgres ?,Defiant-Farm7910,dataengineering,"I am currently involved in a database migration discussion at my company. The proposal is to migrate our dbt models from PostgreSQL to BigQuery in order to take advantage of BigQuery’s OLAP capabilities for analytical workloads. However, since I am quite fond of PostgreSQL, and value having a stable, open-source database as our data warehouse, I am wondering whether there are extensions or architectural approaches that could extend PostgreSQL’s behavior from a primarily OLTP system to one better suited for OLAP workloads.So far, I have the impression that this might be achievable using DuckDB. One option would be to add the DuckDB extension to PostgreSQL; another would be to use DuckDB as an analytical engine interfacing with PostgreSQL, keeping PostgreSQL as the primary database while layering DuckDB on top for OLAP queries.

1pr9fxu,Snowflake Openflow a bittersweet experience soo far,Defiant_Month_497,dataengineering,"Just wanted to share my experience with Snowflake Openflow. The client i work for relies heavily on CDC replication for their data ingestion to snowflake. We mainly bring in data from SQL server and oracle database to our snowflake data lake.Our client is using many different ETL tools mainly Firvetran's HVR, IICS and AWS DMS and in some cases snowpipe when they want to ingest data from s3 to snowflake. When snowflake announced openflow which supports CDC replication we were excited. Out of the box it was supporting SQL Server CDC replication and Oracle connector was soon to be released. We were very excited as our client wanted to move away from IICS and HVR due to licensing costs. We immediately started working on a POC when the openflow was available in private preview.POC Area: - CDC based replication from SQL Server to snowflake. Its fairly very easy to setup the connectors and start using it. We were able to configure the connectors and start ingesting the data within couple of hours and mind you none of us had used apache nifi before. Pros: - 1. easy to setup and use.2. Replication latency is pretty low. Plus it can be configured as well to fit your use case. Cons: - 1. Cannot configure target snowflake schema : - biggest downside we have found out yet. We were using the default workflow for SQL server CDC and there is no option to ingest the data into desired snowflake schema. By default Openflow is creating a schema in snowflake database with the source SQL Server schema name. We were pulling the data from SQL server schema ""DBO"" and Openflow was creating the same schema inside our snowflake database.We updated almost all the processors inside the workflow to use the custom schema name, for most part it worked. we were able to create tables and journal tables etc inside our custom schema in snowflake. But there is one processor which merges journal tables to permanent table which was not supporting to use custom schema name. Somehow it was still using "".DBO"". DB name is configurable in this processor but not the schema name. We connected with the snowflake internal team regarding the same and the guy said they working on it after receiving complaints from lots of other clients. Later he suggested us to not configure/updated the workflow which comes with database connectors. If we do update it, it's gonna be considered as a custom workflow and it will be locked out of future updates.So, customizing the pipeline is out of the picture.2. Environment variables and JVM variables: - there is no one stop UI to manage all these variables inside the workflow. You need to navigate to each processor to manage these variables. 3. Error logs: - not a fan of how openflow manages error logs, its very janky to navigate and use. these were the stuff we found out in the last couple of weeks. We have stopped our POC midway due to con 1. And we and the client are totally dissappointed with how openflow is working as of now.",32,0.97,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pr9fxu/snowflake_openflow_a_bittersweet_experience_soo/,2025-12-20 08:20:56,2025-12-24 01:46:12

1ppgsdq,Unrealistic expectations or am I just slow?,thro0away12,dataengineering,"I’ve written about my job on this sub before but I really am at a loss at times and come here to vent frequently. I am fine with hearing it’s a me problem, I really am. But I don’t know how to work faster when everything feels so chaotic upstream of me. I am not eating well, working 8+ hours and finding myself really sleepy (taking 2 naps a day these days) that are signs of burnout I’ve been experiencing especially over the last few months. I’ve been given feedback about not being as fast as the team anticipates on projects. Currently, I’ve been focusing on migrating old projects to a new architecture we plan to use by early next year. I really started being 100% dedicated to this work as of October/November of this year, which gives me 2-3 months to migrate my old projects to this new architecture. In theory it sounds easy to my higher up: all I have to do is copy + paste and tweak my old code to new architecture and that’s it. Except it’s not that easy:1. In current architecture, I built several views that depend on each other. When deploying on this architecture, nobody made me aware (bc nobody seems to know) that changing things in upstream views causes deployment failures until I started working on this and my only workaround is to delete downstream views -> push -> confirm deployment successful -> make changes to upstream views-> push -> confirm deployment -> bring back deleted views -> push -> confirm deployment. This has caused a lot of delays and plenty failures that made me have to go to SWE team to fix that sometimes took the whole day to resolve 2. Naming conventions and the way the data is stored have changed in new architecture with no documentation about this, leaving me to figure out using “eyeball” technique to see where new data is stored and changing my code accordingly 3. Data in old architecture is not always coming through new architecture and I have to just figure this out by checking discrepancies and opening tickets for missing data that doesn’t get resolved no matter how much I ping people to look into it or fix it (I also don’t blame them because I feel other people are inundated too)4. Validation is a nightmare, I’ll have 30+ discrepancies and after checking code and data is there, I have to go through these records one by one to see why it’s not there by comparing tables. It turns out that some records are not meant to be in the new architecture, which I was not told until later when I did validation and had to compare what info from our schema tables was missing between the two. I have to look for specific clues between the old and new dataset for indication whether something is valid or not so I can document there is a reason for discrepancy 5. Documenting all of this and more is a task of its own 6. Ongoing enhancements are expected to be added to some projects I have one project that is comprised of 10 SQL views. The expectation was this would take 2 weeks but it took me a month: 1. creating the views and aligning them to new data model 2. dealing with random/unanticipated failures because of how these views are connected that I can only ask the SWE team to because they can tell me what things in my code that used to be compatible with this new architecture aren’t anymore 3. Validating data and having discrepancies no matter how many times I’ve fixed any errors because some things are “discrepancy by nature” of this new model which I either document and write an explanation of why it’s valid or a something I have to open a ticket for 4. The new way we’re modelling data sometimes doesn’t work for existing projects and I have to add more lines of code to work around that This is not new of the culture of my team. They give me several projects at a time thinking it will take 2 weeks. It takes longer for me and I have been told I have a consistent issue with slowness that makes me feel it’s a me issue. I explain to management my process, I started documenting all issues way more, but nobody gives me constructive advice on what I can do differently to work “faster” and it makes me feel like a failure. One of the advices I was given was “ask for help” but whenever I do, nobody is able to help. When there were holidays, I asked overseas employees to help me investigate a discrepancy an came back to see nobody was able to do it no matter how many people I pinged and explained the issue in detail. As a side note, some of the code I’m migrating now was a nightmare to develop in the first place - it was projects I inherited with no documentation, no idea what the project outcome should look like or what “acceptance criteria” deems the project complete or not. The code was 1000 lines and took several minutes to run with poor performance issues. Like a million full joins, sub queries within subqueries. I was once asked to add something to a where clause in this query and unknowingly broke something that I didn’t realize was a break bc I have no idea what the end result is supposed to look like. I was told to reverse it immediately and asked the SWE team who told me we can’t simply reverse our daily pipeline. The colleague who asked me to made the change became furious and this is where negative feedback about me started. I later worked hard to re-develop this whole project, breaking down the code into separate parts in order to join these separate views together at the end to make cleaner, optimized code. The team did like that work, but even then, issues would arise - upstream pipeline would fail, I have to interrupt my 10 projects to manually get a dataset, upload it through our transformation tool, export and manually put back into S3 that takes 30+ minutes. Later, it turns out that simple joins to create the end table aren’t enough per requirements because of unanticipated quirks with the data that requires a full join and 2 additional CTEs to get right. Basically, I’m just really tired. The business requirements are really ambiguous and a work in progress, our data is in different constantly changing formats and we have failures or changes of me upstream of I have to keep track of while working through other projects and stop everything to fix it. Of note, most of my team members are not strong technically but do have domain knowledge, yet I feel domain knowledge is not enough because the way we do things technically feels very poor as well.

1prl5t5,(Mildly) hot takes about modern data engineering,ukmurmuk,dataengineering,"Some principles I have been thinking about productive modern data engineering culture, sharing this here to see different perspectives about my outlook.First, I want to begin by making an assertion that in this AI age, code production is a very cheap commodity. The expensive part is in reviewing & testing the code. But, as long as the pipelines are batch, the processing is not in a regulated environment, and the output is not directly affecting the core business, cost of mistakes are REALLY low. In most cases you can simply rerun the pipeline and replace the bad data, and if you design the pipeline well, processing cost should be very low.So, here are my principles:•⁠Unit tests and component-specific tests are worthless. It slows down development, and it doesn’t really check the true output (product of complex interactions of functions and input data). It adds friction when expanding/optimizing the pipeline. It’s better to do WAP (Write-Audit-Publish) patterns to catch issues in production and block the pipeline if the output is not within expectations rather than trying to catch them locally with tests. (edit: write your e2e tests, DQ checks, and schema contracts. Unit test coverage shouldn’t give you any excuse to not have the other three, and if having the other three nullifies the value of unit tests, then the unit tests are worthless) •⁠Dependencies has to be explicit. If table A is dependent on table B, this dependency has to be explicitly defined in orchestration layer to ensure that issue in table A blocks the pipeline and doesn’t propagate to table B. It might be alluring to separate the DAGs to avoid alerts or other human conveniences, but it’s not a reliable design. •⁠With defensive pipelines (comprehensive data quality check suites, defensive DAGs, etc), teams can churn out codes faster and ship features faster rather than wasting time adjusting unit tests/waiting for human reviews. Really, nowadays you can build something in 1 hour and wait 2-3 days for review. •⁠the biggest bottleneck in data engineering is not the labor of producing code, but the frictions of design/convention disagreements, arguments in code reviews, bad data modeling, and inefficient use of tables/pipelines. This phenomenon is inevitable when you have a big team, hence I argue in most cases, it’s more sensible to have a very lean data engineering team. I would even go further to the point that it makes more sense to have a single REALLY GOOD data engineer (that can communicate well with business, solid data modeling skills, deep technical expertise to design efficient storage/compute, etc) rather than hiring 5 “okay” data engineers. Even if this really good one costs 5x than the average one, it’s more worth the money: allowing faster shipping volume and better ROI.So, what do you think? Are these principles BS?",23,0.58,140,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1prl5t5/mildly_hot_takes_about_modern_data_engineering/,2025-12-20 18:29:24,2025-12-24 01:46:12

I need to calculate sliding windows as fast as possible in real time with historical data (from SQL tables) and new streaming data. How can this be achieved in less than 15 ms latency ideally? I tested Rising Wave's Continuous Query with Materialized Views but the fastest I could get it to run was like 50 ms latency. That latency includes from the moment the Kafka message was published to the moment when my business logic could consume the sliding window result made by Rising Wave. My application requires the results before proceeding.I tested Apache Flink a little and it seems like in order to get it to return the latest sliding window results in real time I need to build on top of standard Flink and I fear that if I implement that, it might just end up being even slower than Rising Wave.So I would like to ask you if you know what other tools I could try.

1pqr4n9,Should I be using DBT for this?,john-dev,dataengineering,"I've been tasked with modernizing our ETL. We handle healthcare data so first of all, we want to keep everything on prem, so it limits some of our options right off the bat.Currently, we are using a Makefile to call a massive list of SQL files and run them with psql. Dependencies are maintained by hand.I've just started seeing what it might take to move to DBT to handle the build, and while it looks very promising, the initial tests are still creating some hassles. We have a LOT large datasets. So DBT has been struggling to run some of the seeds because it seems to get memory intensive and it looks like maybe psql was the better option for atleast those portions. I am also still struggling a bit with the naming conventions for selectors vs schema/table names vs folder/file names. We have a number of schemas that handle data identically across different applications, so table names that match seem to be an issue, even if they're in different schemas. I am also having a hard time with the premise that seeds are 1 to 1 for the csv to table. We have for example a LOT of historical data that has changed systems over time, but we don't want to lose that historic data, so we've used psql copy in the past to solve this issue very easily. This looks against the dbt rules.So this has me wanting to ask, are there better tools out there that I should be looking at? My goal is to consolidate services so that managing our containers doesn't become a full time gig in and of itself. Part of the goal of modernization is to attach a semantic layer, which psql alone doesn't facilitate. Unit testing across the data in an easier to run and monitor environment, field level lineage, and even eventually pointing things like langchain are some of our goals. The fact is, our process is extremely old and dated, and modernizing will simply give us better options. What is your advice? I fully recognize I may not know DBT enough yet and all my problems are very solveable.

1psmc5j,"Processing large Teams meeting transcripts as a local, deterministic batch job",AuditMind,dataengineering,"Teams meetings with transcription enabled. One hour of discussion quickly turns into 10k+ words of unstructured text.Extracting decisions, action items, and open questions manually doesn’t scale. The common approach is to push the full transcript into a large cloud model and hope for a usable summary.That approach breaks down for a few reasons.Large transcripts often exceed context windows. Even when they fit, you’re dependent on external infrastructure, which can be problematic for sensitive meetings. Most importantly, you lose determinism: the same input can produce different outputs.I ended up treating the transcript like any other batch-processing problem.Instead of processing the full text in one go, the transcript is handled incrementally:- split into manageable chunks- each chunk summarized independently using a stable structure- clean intermediate results written out- a final aggregation pass over those intermediates to produce the high-level summaryIn practical terms:- the model never sees the full transcript at once- context is controlled explicitly by the pipeline, not by a prompt window- intermediate structure is preserved instead of flattened- the final output is based on accumulated, cleaned data rather than raw textThis reframing changes the requirements completely.One interesting side effect of this approach was realizing that model size stopped being a deciding factor altogether. Once the task is constrained and the workflow is explicit, even relatively small models perform reliably enough for this kind of summarization.Once handled this way, transcript size stops being a concern. A small local model is sufficient, because it’s just one interchangeable component in a controlled pipeline. The value comes from explicit inputs, deterministic steps, and reproducible outputs, not from model size.This runs entirely locally on a modest machine, no GPU, no cloud services.I’m curious how others here approach large meeting transcripts or similar unstructured text when the goal is a clean, deterministic result rather than maximal model capability.",8,0.7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1psmc5j/processing_large_teams_meeting_transcripts_as_a/,2025-12-22 01:04:53,2025-12-24 01:46:12

1pos8n2,Using sandboxed views instead of warehouse access for LLM agents?,Better-Department662,dataengineering,"Hey folks - looking for some architecture feedback from people doing this in production.We sit between structured data sources and AI agents, and we’re trying to be very deliberate about how agents touch internal data. Our data mainly lives in product DBs (Postgres), BigQuery, and our CRM (SFDC). We want agents for lightweight automation and reporting. Current approach: Instead of giving agents any kind of direct warehouse access, we’re planning to run them against an isolated sandboxed environment with pre-joined, pre-sanitized views pulled from our DW and other sources. Agents never see the warehouse directly.On top of those sandboxed views (not direct DW tables), we’d build and expose custom MCP tools. Each of these MCP tools will have a broader sql query- with required parameters and a real-time policy layer between views and these tools- enforcing row/column limits, query rules, and guardrails (rate limits, max scan size, etc.).The goal is to minimize blast radius if/when an LLM does something dumb: no lateral access, no schema exploration, no accidental PII leakage, and predictable cost.Does this approach feel sane? Are there obvious attack vectors or failure modes we’re underestimating with LLMs querying structured data?

1pt91nz,Best way to annotate large parquet LLM logs without full rewrites?,dbplatypii,dataengineering,"I asked this on the Apache mailing list but haven’t found a good solution yet. Wondering if anyone has some ideas for how to engineer this?Here’s my problem: I have gigabytes of LLM conversation logs in parquet in S3. I want to add per-row annotations (llm-as-a-judge scores), ideally without touching the original text data. So for a given dataset, I want to add a new column. This seemed like a perfect use case for Iceberg. Iceberg does let you evolve the table schema, including adding a column. BUT you can only add a column with a default value. If I want to fill in that column with annotations, ICEBERG MAKES ME REWRITE EVERY ROW. So despite being based on parquet, a column-oriented format, I need to re-write the entire source text data (gigabytes of data) just to add \~1mb of annotations. This feels wildly inefficient.I considered just storing the column in its own table and then joining them. This does work but the joins are annoying to work with, and I suspect query engines do not optimize well a ""join on row\_number"" operation.I've been exploring using little-known features of parquet like the file\_path field to store column data in external files. But literally zero parquet clients support this.I'm running out of ideas for how to work with this data efficiently.

I have some big table(having 200GB of data) and some very small tables in MB but I want to track every change happening in their columns.

Now I can do logical replication on PostgreSQL and GCP provides data stream and I can capture those changes on BigQuery. Challenge is I can't setup logical replication on read replicas, Datastream will replicate changes from Master Instance but that can be deal breaker as it is operational instance and can suffer some performance issue due to sharing it with analytical workload. Another challenge is number of replication slots and managing them. If I have many tables on one PostgreSql server then I am limited by setting up this replication to Analytical Store.

1prcg35,Overwriting day partitions in table when source and target timezones differ,Data-Panda,dataengineering,"Working on one of my first bigger data projects as a junior and I’m a bit stuck.The source system stores timestamps in CST (no DST); the target tables must be UTC.I extract data using a rolling 7–14 day window, filtered by a business date (midnight-to-midnight in CST) as these are essentially log tables. This is necessary because there’s no last-modified field in the source tables and yet records can be updated up to 7–14 days after creation.The target tables are partitioned by the business date, and I overwrite partitions on each run. This works in theory when extracting full days, but timezone conversion complicates things. When converting CST to UTC, some records shift into the next day, meaning a “full day” CST extract can become partial days in UTC, potentially overwriting partitions with incomplete data.I’m avoiding MERGE because there’s no reliable primary key and analysts want to keep duplicates (some are valid), so partition overwrites seem like the best option. Essentially I just want to clone the source tables into BigQuery.One idea is to extract data as UTC midnight-to-midnight, but the only apparent option in the source is extracting as GMT Monrovia (which I think maps to UTC). This is what I’m edging towards, but not sure if extracting data in a different timezone to what it’s natively stored as is a recommended approach?Can someone please sanity check my approach and let me know if it’s a bad idea, or if I’m missing anything?",3,0.72,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1prcg35/overwriting_day_partitions_in_table_when_source/,2025-12-20 11:40:52,2025-12-24 01:46:12

1pp4av7,Clickhouse Aggregation Definition,CoolExcuse8296,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,## Our current situationI am working at a small software company, and we have successfully switched to Clickhouse in order to store all of our customers' telemetry, which is at the heart of our activity.We are super satisfied with it and want to move on.So far everything was stored in PostgreSQL.Currently, we're relying on a legacy format to define our aggregations (which calculations we need to perform for which customer).These definitions are stored as JSON objects in the db, they are written by hand and are quite messy and very unclear.They define which calculations (avg, min, max, sum, etc, but also more complex ones wih CTES...) should be made on which input column, and which filters and pre/post treatments should be made on it.They define both what aggregations should be made daily, and what should be calculated on top of it when a user asks for a wider range. For instance we calculate durations daily and we sum these daily durations to get the weekly resultThe goal is ultimately to feed custom-made user dashboards and reports.A very spaghettish code of mine translates these aggregation definitions into templated Clickhouse SQL queries that we store in PGSQL.At night an Airflow DAG runs these queries and stores the results in the db.It is very painful to understand and to maintain.## What we want to achieveWe would like to simplify all this and to enable our project managers (non technical), and maybe even later our customers, to create/update them, ideally based on a GUI.I have tried doing some mockups with Redash, Metabase or Superset but none of them really fit, mostly because some of our aggregations use intricate CTEs, have post-treatments, or use data stored in Maps etc..I felt they were more suited for already-clean business data and not big telemetry tables with hundreds of columns, and also for simple BI cases.## Why am I humbly asking for your generous and wise advicesWhat would your approach be on this?I was thinking about maybe a simpler/sleeker yaml format that could be easily generated by our PHP backend for the definition.Then for the conversion into Clickhouse queries,I was wondering if you guys think that a tool like DBT could be of any use in order to template our functions and generate the SQL queries, and even maybe to trigger them.I am rather new in Data Engineering so I am really curious about the recommended approaches, or if there might even be some standard or frameworks for this.We're not the first ones to face this problematic for sure!I just want to precise we'll go fully opensource and are open to developing stuff ourselvesThank you very much for your feedbacks!",6,0.87,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pp4av7/clickhouse_aggregation_definition/,2025-12-17 18:37:20,2025-12-24 01:46:12

Whereas with S3 tables, you use a native AWS catalog, and maintenance is automatically handled. When would someone choose one over the other?

But linters, tests, and checks are all there.It also plays nice natively with PyArrow data. Right now, I'm prepping a test repo with examples using Dagster + ConnectorX + iceberg-loader. Should end up as a fast open-source data loader since everything runs on Arrow.Would love if any devs take a look with their experienced eye and suggest improvements or feedback.https://github.com/vndvtech/iceberg-loader",3,0.81,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pqzhsw/icebergloader/,2025-12-19 23:32:16,2025-12-24 01:46:12
1pqncik,Help with Deciding Data Architecture: MySQL vs Snowflake for OLTP and BI,khushal20,dataengineering,"Hi folks,I work at a product-based company, and we're currently using an RDS MySQL instance for all sorts of things like analysis, BI, data pipelines, and general data management. As a Data Engineer, I'm tasked with revamping this setup to create a more efficient and scalable architecture, following best practices.I'm considering moving to Snowflake for analysis and BI reporting. But I’m unsure about the OLTP (transactional) side of things. Should I stick with RDS MySQL for handling transactional workloads, like upserting data from APIs, while using Snowflake for BI and analysis? Currently, we're being billed around $550/month for RDS MySQL, and I want to know if switching to Snowflake will help reduce costs and overcome bottlenecks like slow queries and concurrency issues.Alternatively, I’ve been thinking about using Lambda functions to move data to S3 and then pull it into Snowflake for analysis and Power BI reports.

1pparqo,"Thoughts on proposed ADLS, Dagster, delta-rs, polars, DBX stack?",SoloArtist91,dataengineering,"Context:We have an old MSSQL Server on prem + Alteryx for orchestration/transformations + Tableau server for visualizations. Our data ""team"" is basically just me, plus my manager and coworker - both of whom are mostly comfortable just with data visualization in Tableau. Our data comes in from various vendors (20+) in the form of flat files in SFTPs or API endpoints. Nothing overly crazy, no streaming, no more than 1-2 GB over the course of a day.While Alteryx has been ""good enough"" the last 10 years, their rapidly rising costs has led us to research various options at how we can modernize our data stack and keep costs low. My manager has given me free reign to research various options and come up with a plan that we can execute over 2026, just with the understanding that our company has a footprint in Azure, so I shouldn't branch out to AWS or GCP for example.Proposal:+ Azure Blob Storage to ingest and store all our vendors' files and data on a daily/hourly basis+ Dagster+ (hybrid) for orchestration+ Deltalake tables created/updated in blob storage for staging, warehouse, and marts layers using delta-rs and polars for transformations+ For serving to BI tools, use external tables in a Databricks SQL warehouse pointed to delta tables+ Keep Tableau as is, reduce our need for Alteryx over time to just last mile transformations/adhoc analysis for my other team membersOther considerations:+ DBT: I did some of their courses and tried to recreate an existing pipeline using dbt-core orchestrated by Dagster and it seemed overkill for my purposes. Everything I liked in it was already covered by Dagster, such as data lineage, testing, and the features that might be nice require cloud. I'm also more comfortable writing transformations in Python rather than SQL.+ Table maintenance: I'm aware that external tables are not managed by DBX and it's on me to manage the tables manually (optimize/vacuum). I figure I can set up a script that runs once a month or something to automatically do it.+ Why delta-rs? Again, we don't have overly complex data needs or sizes that require Spark computing costs. Our machines are perfectly capable of handling the compute requirements that we need. If we get to ML models down the road, then I'd probably run those in DBX notebooks and rely on their computing power.Has anyone else ran a similar design before?

1pql697,Weird Snowflake future grant behavior when dbt/Dagster recreates tables,poopdood696969,dataengineering,"I’m running into a Snowflake permissions issue that I can’t quite reason through, and I’m hoping someone can tell me if this is expected or if I’m missing something obvious.Context: we’re on Snowflake, tables are built with dbt and orchestrated by Dagster. Tables are materialized using DBT (so the compiled dbt code is usingcreate-or-replace semantics). This has been the case for a long time and hasn’t changed recently.We effectively have two roles involved:* a read-only reporting role (SELECT access)* a write-capable role that exists mainly so Terraform can create/provision tables (INSERT / TRUNCATE, etc.)Important detail: Terraform is *not* managing grants yet. It’s only being explored. No Snowflake grants are being applied via Terraform at this point.Historically, the reporting role had database-level grants:* usage on the database* usage on all schemas and future schemas* select on all tables* select on future tables* select on all views* select on future viewsThis worked fine. The assumption was that when dbt recreates a table, Snowflake re-applies SELECT via future grants.The only change made recently was adding schema-level future grants for the write-capable role (insert/truncate on future tables in the schema). No pipeline code changed. No dbt config changed. No materialization logic changed.Immediately after that, we started seeing this behavior:* when dbt/Dagster recreates a table, the write role’s privileges come back* the reporting role’s SELECT does notThis was very obvious and repeatable.What’s strange is that the database-level future SELECT grants for the reporting role still exist. There are no revoke statements in query history. Ownership isn’t changing. Schemas are not managed access. Transient vs permanent tables doesn’t seem to matter.The only thing that fixes it is adding schema-level future SELECT for the reporting role. Once that’s in place, recreated tables keep SELECT access as expected.So now everything works, but I’m left scratching my head about why:* database-level future SELECT used to be sufficient* introducing schema-level future grants for another role caused this to surface* schema-level future SELECT is now required for reporting access to survive table recreationI’m fine standardizing on schema-level future grants everywhere, but I’d really like to understand what’s actually happening under the hood. Is Snowflake effectively applying future grants based on the most specific scope available? Are database-level future grants just not something people rely on in practice for dbt-heavy environments?Curious if anyone else has seen this or has a better mental model for how Snowflake applies future grants when tables are recreated.",2,0.76,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pql697/weird_snowflake_future_grant_behavior_when/,2025-12-19 13:31:45,2025-12-24 01:46:12

1por4wa,Data VCS,cmcclu5,dataengineering,"Folks, I’m working on a data VCS similar to Git but for databases and data lakes. At the moment, I have a headless API server and the code to handle PostgreSQL and S3 or MinIO data lakes with plans to support the other major databases and data lakes, but before I continue, I wanted community feedback on whether you’d find this useful.The project goal was to make a version of Git that could be used for data so that we data engineers wouldn’t have to learn a completely new terminology. It uses the same CLI for the most part, with init, add, commit, push, etc. The versioning control is operations-based instead of record- or table-based, so it simplifies a lot of the branch operations. I’ve included a dedicated ingestion branch so it can work with a live database where data is constantly ingested via some external process. I realize there are some products available that do something moderately similar, but they all either require learning a completely new syntax or are extremely limited in capability and speed. This allows you to directly branch on server from an existing database with approximately 10% overhead. The local client is written in Rust with PyO3 bindings to interact with the headless FastAPI server backend when deployed for an organization. Eventually, I want to distribute this to engineers and orgs, but this post is primarily to gauge interest and feasibility from my fellow engineers. Ask whatever questions come to mind, bash it as much as you want, tell me whatever comes to mind.

People who don't program won't know the difference, and experienced programmers genuinely won't give a shit (and might in fact think your code is inferior, since it's less readable now).But most importantly, memorizing lots of tricks won't make you a good programmer. You know what makes you a good programmer? Understanding fundamentals and learning creative problem solving, that's what you really need.Please, for the love of God, stop following pop-coding ""coaches"". Their advice is often useless, and can waste your time by making you focus on the wrong things.

I want to choose C or C++ over python. What I've found looking at a lot C++ vs Python first questions on this reddit is that, Python makes it easier to pick up programming in general, but if you're willing to take the harder start then it's way more beneficial to your long term understanding of coding to learn C/C++ first because your brain solidifies good traits that are really hard to relearn from python.If any one has any comments on this specific parity that'd be cool. The formatting of Python also seems to be a cheat that isn't as healthy as having your base reference in C/C++'s symbolic referencing over indentation.My real question because it does seem C style is better for long term than python first and I intend to learn both, is it best to learn C or C++? It appears C and Python are around the same learning time and C++ is way longer than learning C. Should I do C first then Python to get the benefits of understanding C style code with Python's greater utility and universal usage, or should I tough it out and do C++ , which I guess is extended C, then Python? So essentially my perspective is C is much shorter and faster to learn, but C++ has much more use case, despite the fact they both equally prime you for more ""close to the metal"" thought than high abstract languages like python, what's more worth it first?Thank youTLDR; I think the first impression and perspective solidifying advantages of C and C++ beats the ease of introduction with Python for first language, thoughts?

1pq1jtc,software engineering at 30 — bootcamp vs community college vs online university?,Aguadecoco-bacano07,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for honest advice and different perspectives on a possible career change (or career expansion).I have a degree in International Business, but after graduating I worked in roles unrelated to my degree, so I don’t have professional experience directly connected to it. At the same time, I’ve become genuinely interested in learning programming / software engineering — not only as a potential career switch, but also as a new skill I could combine with my business background in the future and as a strong plus on my resume.Here’s my situation and my doubts:• I can’t realistically commit to a full-time traditional university (time + cost).• A bootcamp appeals to me because of the structure, guidance, accountability, and also the opportunity to meet people and network.• English is not my first language, and although I use it daily, I want to keep improving. Being in an environment where I’m pushed to communicate more in English feels like a plus.So far, I’ve started learning on my own:•freeCodeCamp•Planning to try The Odin Project nextI’m realistic about expectations:•I know a bootcamp won’t guarantee a job•I know the market is competitive•I understand I may not get hired right awayMy goal is to build real skills, start with solid foundations, and keep studying long-term. Even if I initially apply for jobs related to my original careerOne important factor is that I currently have the option to stop working for about 6 months, since my husband can support me during that time. That’s why I’m seriously considering an intensive learning path like a bootcamp, so I can fully focus during that period.I looked into Hack Reactor, but my experience has been concerning:•I was told about a full scholarship. I applied and 3 weeks later they informed it wasn’t available for now. •I pass the CCAT test, contacted them to know about the next steps. Someone told me they will contact me but is been almost a month a haven’t heard for them. Because of that, I’m unsure whether Hack Reactor — or bootcamps in general — are still an option right now.So my main questions are:1.Bootcamp vs community college vs online university — what would you recommend in 2026 for someone in my position?2.Is a bootcamp still worth it mainly for structure, foundations, and momentum?3.Are online universities that people often recommend on Reddit actually a good option?4.If you were in my situation — limited time/money, strong motivation, and a non-tech degree — what path would you choose?Thanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences.

We are currently have modules regarding databases, advanced programming and api development with a client app. The problem is that the database lectures was so theoritical but for the assignments we had to create 2 DB systems with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, without learning any of these languages during lectures. I hardly managed to do the assignments since it was the first time I had to write postgre and mongo and they assessments required to apply advanced knowledge to code the systems. On the API module it was the same. The professor focused on teaching material regarding how to complete the weekly assignments but the final one was doable since the most of the part covered from the weekly tasks. On advanced programming we had to use c# that we used in the previous years but we had to create a cross platform app with blazor and we never saw examples during lectures on how to set up a blazor app and I felt overwhelmed from the amount of reseach I had to do myself. The following semester we have an IoT's module and the prof told us we will create an IoT device in a simulator with python for the final assessment. We never touched python before. The other module is about game development and they changed the curriculum to use unreal engine with c++ instead of unity, we never wrote c++ before. The last module is about penetration testing and the module guide says that we will have to write bash scripts and python to simulate some attacks on our Uni's servers.

Ive learned so much so far that im already contemplating restarting haha Written in C++, managed to get these features:Function definitions and calling Global and local variables definitions Integer mathematics that follow BEDMAS (Use shunting yard algorithm), can also nestle functions in the expressions Can link to external dll for more functionality The string types are = \[4bytes - length, 4bytes - capacity, 8 bytes - pointer\] and also null terminated, for working with C style string functions one can use the syntax $stringVariable.cHere is an example that I managed to sucesfully compile today: #inc: ""core.ni"" #def: $text : string = ""This strings length = %d, capacity = %d\n"" #def: $number : int32 = 95 #def: .main() int32 { .c_printf( $text.c, $text.length, $text.capacity ) $number = 50*11 .c_printf( ""Number (50*11) is: %d\n"", $number ) $number = .getNumber() .c_printf( ""Number after function is: %d\n"", $number ) .c_printf(""Enter a number: "") .c_scanf(""%d"", ?number ) .c_printf( ""Number entered is: %d\n"", $number ) .exit(0) } #def: .getNumber() int32 { .return(123456789) }And here is the ""core.ni"" #lnk: ""msvcrt.dll"" #ext: .c_printf : printf( $text : pntr , $arg1 : any , $arg2 : any , $arg3 : any ) void #ext: .c_scanf : scanf( $text : pntr , $arg1 : pntr ) void #ext: .c_malloc : malloc( $size : int32 ) pntr #ext: .c_free : free( $address : pntr ) void #ext: .c_realloc: realloc( $address : pntr, $size : int32 ) pntr #lnk: ""kernel32.dll"" #ext: .exit : ExitProcess($code : int32) voidWanted to make linking to external functions easy!

Been lurking around, haven't posted though.I've been wondering about my career and its direction for about a year at least and I felt that's it would be good to share and ask for advice and opinions.Some background.I'm a programmer with about ten years of experience. I come from a math background. Never completed my uni studies but I was fortunate enough to build somegood foundations that helped a ton in programming. Programming for me was also my only hobby for most of the last decade. Read many books, tried many tools and languages. Had tons of fun on many late nights home.Recent two years the excitement dropped off and I've been enjoying non programing stuff a lot. I've organically ended up doing team lead/tech lead stuff for the last five years and I've accustomed to that. My job is primarily reviewing, mentoring, planning and estimating effort.Due to the recent advancements in AI I've started feeling the heat. It seems to me that much of the toolset that used to make us competent as programmers is fading away. Now, as a team lead/tech lead I feel that I do a good job exactly because I've spent so many hours fiddling with stuff from many different angles. But in the age of AI I have much less consifidence in my ability to reasons about those genai system that I think we'll be dealing with in the upcoming years.I've tried to move to areas of game development and design, graphics programming but I gave up after a while. I did not feel the urge to pursue and do what it takes to jump to another field. Right now I'm asked to design systems based on AI which, I don't feel equipped to do.And even though I know that I'm through a burnout for about three years now, I appreciatey job. I appreciate how it has transformed my life and I've seen able to do and own things I never would have if I did not spend so much time studying cs and programming. This is why I decided to create a self made curriculum of data science, machine learning, deep learning and finally genai in order get myself familiarize with those concepts. This is something that's I evaluate to take at least a year. I think that if I am to continue managing development teams and since I seems to a place in our toolset, I think it makes sense. I feel it would boost my abilities and therefore my confidence in order to continue doing a good job.I don't feel like I'm going to definitely lose my job to AI. But I feel like that if I don't expand my knowledge in any way, I leave it to chance. I don't know if I'm maybe too pessimistic about this, but my gut call is saying that it's to re evaluate some things and it's time to be proactive again.Thought I'd share with you, I expect that many might have somewhat similar thoughts, with all this ai madness going around constantly.

The SQLite drivers don't support migrations, and my code returns a SQLite exception: no such table.Why? Is it because SQLite doesn't support alter table? And even if it doesn't, shouldn't the SQLite official packages have a method to support something so fundamental to work with ORMs?

For those unfamiliar, `this` refers to the current object of the class that you are in scope of.My question is: how do you properly test `unit_under_test`? I am not really that interested in testing `f()`, because there is a separate unit test for that. I also can't mock it without making changes to source code, because there is no way to link in a mock for `f()` that will end up getting called here instead of the actual member function.You could also imagine that `f()` could be fairly complex. It could itself call a bunch of other functions that do various things and which should themselves be unit tested. Digging into the implementation of those functions starts to feel like it's getting outside the scope of the test of just this function.So, it seems hard to know how best to test this kind of thing, and I wanted to know what others' thoughts are.",6,0.81,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pq72yr/approaches_to_testing_a_unit_of_code_that_makes/,2025-12-19 00:32:26,2025-12-24 01:46:13

No pthreads, no OS services.I have two build setups with very different behavior.Case 1 (non-cyclic build):I build FreeType without HarfBuzz, then build HarfBuzz with FreeType, and do NOT rebuild FreeType again with HarfBuzz enabled.Result: English text works and Indic gives me hard fault at GSUB.Case 2 (cyclic build, as described in FreeType docs):Build FreeType without HarfBuzz.Build HarfBuzz with FreeType enabled.Rebuild FreeType with HarfBuzz enabled.Result: English and Indic text breaks, hard fault or hb\_font\_destroy gives error.The fault consistently appears somewhere in the GSUB path. The backtrace usually goes through hb\_shape(), hb\_shape\_full(), hb\_shape\_plan\_execute(), hb\_ot\_shape(), and apply\_forward() in GSUB. In some runs the crash appears closer to hb\_font\_destroy(), in others during hb\_shape(), so I suspect memory corruption or an assumption violation rather than a single bad call.Important observation:When FreeType is NOT rebuilt with HarfBuzz, English works but Indic fails.When FreeType IS rebuilt with HarfBuzz, both English and Indic fail and I get a hard fault.Occasionally, I also get an access violation and I found this:[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation)My understanding (please correct me if wrong):HarfBuzz does all shaping (GSUB/GPOS, Indic, Arabic, etc.) and FreeType loads glyphs and rasterizes them. The FreeType :left-right_arrow: HarfBuzz cyclic dependency mainly exists for auto-hinting improvements, not for shaping correctness.Since my display is a very low-resolution 16x128 LED matrix, hinting quality is not very important, but correct glyph order is.So my questions are:1. Is HarfBuzz GSUB shaping expected to work on bare-metal targets with no OS and newlib-nano?2. Is rebuilding FreeType with HarfBuzz actually required if shaping is already done by HarfBuzz?3. Are there GSUB code paths that assume stack size, libc behavior, or memory features that may not exist on embedded targets?4. How much stack and heap would be required for proper Indic rendering?I have attached an image from the IDE incase anyone wants to check.If you happen to know someone who might be familiar with this issue, I’d really appreciate it if you could share this with them.

Things like what terminal you have, how you structure tabs in your browser, etc, things that are closest to your inner most process, are what is most important.It's sort of like if you watch someone doing any physical act producing something, like someone making pottery, or creating stained glass windows, like all of the things you're using right at the point of actual creation are the most important things.And like something like making pottery, or learning to play tennis, you can't really Youtube your way to it, or read it in a book, in my opinion the only way to learn to do the thing is to do the thing. Because when you're doing the thing, you aren't really thinking about it as much as you are just kind of zoning and getting into the flow of making it. It's very much about learning a skill through physical practice.That's my hot take, my personal opinion.",0,0.33,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1prxwr4/my_decades_of_experience_hot_take_programming_is/,2025-12-21 04:42:12,2025-12-24 01:46:13
1ppegr1,"AWS CEO says replacing junior devs with AI is ""one of the dumbest ideas""",masterderptato,cscareerquestions,"https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/aws-ceo-ai-cannot-replace-junior-developersIn the article, he mentions 3 main reasons why AI wouldn't replace junior devs:1. Junior Devs Often Know AI Tools Better>“Number one, my experience is that many of the most junior folks are actually the most experienced with the AI tools. So they're actually most able to get the most out of them.”2. Junior Developers Shouldn’t Be The Default Cost-Saving Move> “They're usually the least expensive because they're right out of college, and they generally make less. So if you're thinking about cost optimization, they're not the only people you would want to optimize around.”3. Removing Juniors Breaks the Talent Pipeline>""At some point, that whole thing explodes on itself. If you have no talent pipeline that you're building and no junior people that you're mentoring and bringing up through the company, we often find that that's where we get some of the best ideas.”What do you think of his arguments?",1902,0.98,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ppegr1/aws_ceo_says_replacing_junior_devs_with_ai_is_one/,2025-12-18 01:41:32,2025-12-24 01:46:14
1psc5zt,"After 10 years on H-1B, I’m moving my role out of the US",Blackened_Soul667,cscareerquestions,"I’m a tech lead at a mid-sized company in the US and the only person on H-1B on my team. I’ve been on this visa for almost ten years. During that time, I’ve delivered multiple successful products and made many of the core architecture and design decisions behind them.Like many companies, mine has been offshoring aggressively. Despite that, my role remained secure because of the technical depth, domain knowledge, and familiarity I have with the projects and their complexity. That context and continuity turned out to matter.With the increasing hostility and constant uncertainty around H-1B, I eventually stopped trying to plan a future here. I asked my employer whether transferring me to an international office was an option, either in the Netherlands or Canada.They agreed.So I’ll be moving to the Netherlands soon, keeping the same job, just no longer in the US. A close friend did the same thing a few months ago and moved her role to Canada.What’s frustrating is that this feels entirely avoidable. The US doesn’t just lose a worker in situations like this, it loses a highly skilled contributor and the taxes that come with that. The work doesn’t disappear. It simply moves elsewhere.After a decade of building, leading, and contributing here, it’s hard not to see this as a self-inflicted loss. I’m not leaving because I wanted to.

1ppv153,Got laid off last year for the first time in 12 years. Experienced the worst job search of my career. Here's the Sankey.,cscq_throw_away,cscareerquestions,"[2024 Job Search Sankey](https://i.redd.it/wwa5kzx1nz7g1.png)[Here’s my previous post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/rqpfir/the\_result\_of\_my\_passive\_job\_search\_over\_the\_past/) where I got the job I was laid off from. I was there for two and a half years and I hadn’t interviewed at all during that time. It took me four months to get an offer and I managed to get two of them in the same week. One was from an early seed stage startup and the other was Meta. I accepted Meta for more immediate TC and stability, but then I got laid off again just before hitting my year mark. I just finished interviewing again and this time the results are much better. Waiting for the last potential offer/rejection to come in before I post that Sankey. Overall the system design interviews were my biggest weakness again like in my previous search. Hellointerview helped a lot with that and I ended up paying for two mock interview sessions with them. Those are painful but worth it. Besides system design interviews, though, I got rejected a lot in the initial round for not having enough depth in particular tools. I’ve been working in developer tools and infrastructure for most of my career and a lot of places I was applying to wanted much deeper experience with Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS. I had worked with all of those at the previous two jobs I had in the 6 years prior to this search, but hadn’t really dug in deep on them and it showed in those early screens. I also got several rejections in the final rounds towards the end where the feedback was that I did very well but someone else just had a bit more relevant experience so they were getting the offer. I even had one recruiter say that the hiring manager tried to get headcount approved to extend offers to me and the other candidate but got denied and I was the second choice. Here’s the details of the two offers I did get: **Seed stage startup*** Salary: $190k* Target bonus: 10%* Equity: $88k in options* Remote**Meta*** IC5* Salary: $215k* Target bonus: 15%* RSUs: $710k over 4 years* TC: ~$425k* Hybrid 3x/week[Sankey source](https://sankeymatic.com/build/?i=IIBxBsEsFMBMAIDaA2AHAXXgOQPbwE7QDOIOAdkdAFCgQwKIDsArJgErQBW0AxgC5wqAeiHwAhkSIBXALaQyAc3Hhw8HADN4fABbRxPHtBACEYsFB5i%2BkckQLEp4E%2DHnxLKogBp4UkLCt6kJpkvMREYvgAnjTm9EgATBjwAMJiKvAA7qKEPPhSkAL4MXRwCZgA8mRQIeKSYTLQZHzFUKWIAIyYABJipuCEvZEuTdD4AG4wGaXqOPhaugQ44NS0rQzx7Lx5BaP2JOSwgqtxHZgAkmQFkGlavNqX7otSZLBUVD19A7BD8oUT0FMEDM5jo9PglnpTvAONx%2BIIqBxcvlCntSC82ht4ABxbQ4IgmN6I7YohqSMQKUoNJDtZAAFkwAHUCtpYIQMgitsjdqTwhSEFSUElUuksvYkTsikSuXMeeTKZDaUkcXiCVKJfBZXyNZD2vToVxeKrOerNfKkHrKtU9BJKJIGk0OeKSWE5fydedLtYbgIePdII9wc9XlRhapRTlibsoQAVMQAaz0uKpNsgCjI9uaocy2WNKI6AE5NrCCVnw7mo8xOvALldvXcHjdAy8Q2kwzmnVGAMyM5msgEtkXtyNzJgVKrya11O2NTOt7Ni4fU1jY3H4%2BGxhPwJOToip9MzsrwJk6PvsjeJnDJyR7jPUouGwTnreXnc3g%2BITEAMXkjZwQaoT7brUu5preULHiybLiOoKJiAYRjWIoajqOooyEtAcG6Agf58FoeAyEMIR8Bksxxne%2BrFoIHCYaUOF4RqhHQMRpHkbgqK2NQVA1l6qg%2Bn6AZ%2Di8CTIPecKvNx1y8fW%2Dq%2DkG1J6t%2BZCyc2El1r6DaqE2DDtAADJgypruJnqSbc6kyZpgkMMugEvsBb4OqpUlmQJcngb2bJccZan8cp2ljlawH1DObyWhOgXTk0SDdhRD6vKFNQ2kFkWIHqEGnlQ8U7kluEpR6tZOT5Fn%2Dpl4VEGB0WKb5byVUVQkdMuMKxVQNVPHVmJpVBYgwbscGGMY8hKBoqFFC1WnkeUKFoaNlnkdGGEyBqVi%2BgNbxzWIC0yEt2gDeNk1FBle3kcA8HGIIE3DeRAAivBWsGABcjVifAADEyTJDpH06VQd1sYQ%2BwUHoz2MLSwPA99pZDtKL0AEbMDwtLxIw30dQCL35vmqDqIwnbfcdfXOM9H2fp%2BH3feduyEzpPD5qTd2OaZhWtQglO0swtPTXJlOMLAtPXTwt0vR9CO0yjGTQbBJ2IYNh3PYcYg0%2DmuOxKUlOfV9D0Yb6tFSLhfD4YxzH4GRqufd9arOmSWpUibtMlYlEW4c9nbxNDnY6Ujd0GQTyDc8g0DqzZV4gfukVOy7btI7uABeehi%2B0%2BbxF9W7wLpqBfZt%2BAKK4qjtPEVAECnedaCnqD59D8CJ1Q0NKDwSyzC9KGN%2Bo%2Bd8PgYgUCAEQHlgVBkDghyZIX%2BfaPAbP5yQcE7SwZezIccxJ6Cyb57X4D189qAb5v%2Bc4J3PAFEM7RUOoq9izwUjjFY596DpAB0zD5%2DIuj4AU6jggtfARBSzRuHXczPejADFZqF3vveAt9WZUHAGISIdFZ49R1peKw%2Dp86cCkPiIIMDn5ZwoNgFBaDrDqEiI0WAdge72DGKMSgCg24gBHmQqwH9lpkFrjICATFiB63gCELu%2BJIFiGhtAcAdgV5rzVqTLckAB5kO2gobQUBZG4VvtPeAMwmjqDgnocIFAAC0lBn7N3gFaCee8kK3yLoQKB1gKHRz0O0XS%2BdNppgwSnUmUCBHgCUsmMAGF8B2AAJrj0gDHFOyB85TFTNoXCtJXH8MEWMNIUhrTeIiP4%2DO6hHDgBADkSAu5yDwACfAUgu5rB5PcTgdkmRoARKiTE9xRSrh5LEAgtIe4wHjy1smBBaTIC%2BNwgI4E1B4DQwGHGUgvwK5fXieARJKjZibVwgAck8DfBZ%2BcsnQHUJAAAHvABZqz4DSBQts3ZqzF7QCGpQXCYh4ChKGW0tw9yEDpyYtcjMNgKDtwTJEeZ%2Dp8n5ygOgmQ0M0jt0MKkmQOAKHwGOKUbRt8dK6R0swbwcKb66niCDKgEKoW%2DWIGiSgYCb5Ip0p2fMKLb66WYLSLFkK9Dm25C6K2ehtHtDvp2ZAyBvAUpBtS7FdLNZYTUDreiBEuFMRIkbQlH12ioGRfAVFnZUCJBxnylIc4ywdjmKitO8R8ztC5WihFOk86qrtlOMqB5UXMHzMwZAnZyU3zdgik1tLqxeQKhpJm8rb7WvZfEA18R44%2BxpVCr2pR4U2vzLSA17RGAIvvqq0W4seqSx2kNXYqK7HxFtTG5AGND6qo5kJBVMrs0Gp0nqzsvLXWB1fKBS14DaT5kVQGukjBQmqses4eF7Qq3lsVcwF1UKk3worS2qVaBEghr0OTLV8LkAVrlai41iRS6qrxghcNRKkXsodanZgCbXV8wFqOn2DqdKs3aIeqFHxlBfB%2BCMcYkxpj11BIsZY3qb60jzagaNn6PqJEVqqtaG0to7UzagTs1rz0XtQAW119K5h%2DTRIcBAqLkDxE7O2h1aBkDWqAA)EDIT: Explaining my terrible labels: * Withdrew after accepting offer: I used this for the companies I withdrew from once I accepted Meta's offer.* Rejected: means the company rejected me at some point* Ghosted: the recruiter stopped responding to me without an outright rejection* Call w/ recruiter: Only used this if it was the first step before anything else after either applying or getting their email or LinkedIn message.

1ps17xv,What do people even do?,SparklyCould,cscareerquestions,"Hey there, so I don't know what it is, but I just don't see the point of my job anymore other than that I get to pay my bills of course. Is it bore out, burn out, depression? I have no idea.Basically I got into the field 8 years ago and have worked at 3 different places and nothing that I've ever worked on, nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on, has ever had any real impact. And by impact, at the end of the day, one could say I mean money. Nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on has ever helped anyone and in turn made money. Simultaneously, every project, every product I have ever worked on was heavily overstaffed and with extreme food envy among developers.Is there anyone out there that actually works on something that people need? Is there any project out there that actually needs me?I've been interviewing for over a year now too and I ask the interviewers:\- ""What are you working on?""\- ""Why are you hiring for this role?""Nobody can answer these questions. It's always some hand wavy explanation. You know, the kind you usually get from people lying about their resume. ""Oh this and that bla bla...""At the same time, as we all know, life has gotten so expensive that, at least I, personally, cannot really say ""Oh I will just do this job and in 5-10 years I can buy a house or something."" Because I cannot. Where I live houses now go for about 20x - 30x the local average yearly income. I just don't know what I'm doing with my life here.Not that it ever really mattered to me anyhow. I don't really want to own a home. I got into this field, because I wanted to build something that helps people, that makes their lives easier or more enjoyable. Something that is valuable, that creates value. What I've seen instead is that we are our own stakeholders. We build for ourselves.

Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.Then I even heard that your cover letter doesn't get read, but the fact that you have one is acknowledged.

Overall the search went much better than last time. With it being only a year since I had gone through this whole thing I felt a lot more prepared and I think it shows in the numbers.A few clarifying points about my labels:* ""Reached out to my network"" was me reaching out to anybody I had interacted with previously including co-workers, recruiters I had worked with before, and actually the offer I turned down last year. The company that gave me the offer I turned down last year met with me but they didn't have anything open and it didn't go beyond that.* ""AI agent applied for me"": I used several AI services to find and apply for jobs on my behalf. These were Jobhire AI, Wobo AI, and Sonara. I didn't count all of the applications they sent out for me because the vast majority of them were ignored. I estimate that it was approximately 200 applications that got sent out by these. I could make another post on my thoughts on these, but to sum it up, Jobhire was absolute trash, Wobo wasn't much better, and Sonara was worth the price in my mind. Overall the AI agents got me interviews with 3 companies, 2 of which proceeded to the final round (1 rejected me and the other I withdrew after accepting another offer).* ""Withdrew after accepting other offer"": This means that I withdrew from interviews before getting an offer from the place I was interviewing with because I had already accepted a different offer. If a company made me an offer, that got counted with the ""Declined"" label after ""Offer"".I've got 13 years of experience with two FAANGs and a FAANG+ on my resume and my specialization for most of that has been in developer tools and infrastructure. System design questions are still my weakest point, and I'm hoping that this next role will help me with more practical hands-on experience that I can use in the future for those problems.My offers:Series A Startup | Series B Startup | Axon-------------------|--------------------|------accepted | declined | declined$205k base | $200k base | $188k baseno bonus | 15% bonus | 10% bonusOptions | Options | $160k RSUs over two years with 1 year cliff (+ refreshers)2-3 days hybrid | 2-3 days hybrid | 4 days mandatory in office Tue-FriSome quick stats from the Sankey:* Acceptance rate from manual applications: 11% (11/100)* Pass rate for initial rounds: 64% (9/14 - not counting ones I withdrew from)* Pass rate for final rounds: 60% (3/5 - not counting ones I withdrew from) - this is a personal best for me. I'm not sure if the 4 companies I withdrew from would have been a similar success rate, but I'm happy with it.* Nearly half the recruiters that messaged me first were for shitty contracting gigs even though I indicated on LinkedIn that I was not interested in those. Ironically at least 10 of those were third party recruiters that wanted to put me right back in at Meta doing almost exactly what I was doing before ... hmm ...* A huge percentage of companies I interviewed with (maybe 85%?) had ""AI"" in their name and almost every company I talked to emphasized how they were incorporating AI in their product or process. The startup I accepted an offer from is the type of company that is selling shovels during this AI gold rush.Overall this search only lasted two months. I hit the ground running as soon as I got laid off from Meta and I had accepted an offer before 60 days had passed. So much better than last year!",78,0.96,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pty6o7/my_latest_job_search_after_getting_laid_off_for/,2025-12-23 16:26:47,2025-12-24 01:46:14

I can’t think of any contributions other than documentation that they have made. Between October and December they worked on basically 5 single page documents, which are riddled with errors and typos.We have daily stand ups every day, but out of everyone this person misses it the most. With no explanation.They sometimes have 10 tickets assigned to them but in their update only update on 1 ticket. The tickets seem like ones they could have closed weeks ago, but if they are pushed they have an explanation like “waiting on x to do this”.It’s all smoke and mirrors with them.When they did have a task 10 months ago, I helped them so much with it, and it really bothered me bc it wasted so much time. Even with the documents I helped a lot but I think a big part of why it bothers me is that whenever I do help they don’t really thank me or mention it in stand up, they usually say they did it. They also debate with me about the information I’m giving them. Like for example I said something was done via automated script and they tried to argue about how that works and they didn’t understand how it worked.They are a drain on my energy and I would really just rather they weren’t on the team.

I have an education and basic proficiency in software engineering, but I’ve spent the last 10+ years working in transportation and diesel mechanic environments. In that space, a lot of workflows are still very manual, handling breakdowns over the phone, outdated desktop software, poor coordination between dispatch, mechanics, and drivers. From the outside, it feels like there are real opportunities for software to improve productivity in industries that aren’t “tech-native.”I have an app idea based on problems I’ve personally dealt with, but it’s too ambitious for me to realistically build alone. In theory, it seems like teaming up with a few other engineers (2–4 people) to build something useful could be a better use of time than waiting for interviews that may never come.What I’m trying to understand is why doesn’t this happen more often?

Our tech stack is Java/Kafka/RPC/S3/Logging tool to fetch S3 logs/UI to interact with APIs. Java I’m okay with, but dependency injection is a bit confusing to me bc I’ve never done a whole project using DI before. Even finding where to start to code is confusing when a change has things interacting with multiple repos (I try to use a global search tool we have to find starting point). Also I really struggle with manual testing. Like when I make a change in the back end that logically reflects in the front end, I need to be able to make the change in our front end service (which is also confusing as a product to some extent bc some parts/integrations of our product our team doesn’t own) and then read logging software to diagnose what’s happening behind the scenes whether it be a java stack trace or an API call or whatever.I want to stay at my company for as long as possible bc it’s good and remote so I need to learn company stack specifically. I just need guidance on how to get better FAST.Can someone give me a plan on how to approach this?I’m thinking I need to:1. Learn nuances to the product itself2.

1pto1gr,Other career options besides SWE with stem degree,Mishkle,cscareerquestions,"Hi, I transfered into a computer science degree during covid. Even before AI, I think I was better at taking computer science exams as opposed to coding. I was always better at debugging existing code and loved designing code on white board with people, but not writing it myself. On group projects it seemed like I was good at explaining things to people who could code better than me, and they would code it. I don’t know what it is, but I don’t really like coding itself. I think I was so tired from my theoretical/math-heavy my degree was, I didn’t have the energy for projects. I don’t code unless prompted to by others. I did technical product internships in quantum and I tried really hard to “look successful technically” by starting a club around it. I build a huge network and got 2 internships (one FAANG, one not) out of it, but I just…never seem to code. I think I did this club partly out of embarrassment and because it was more meaningful to me to create opportunities for students bc it had real outcome. I also made it my whole personality. I then tried to do a “PhD” to make myself “better” but I just get lost with starting a project from scratch or actually wanting to do it. Everything I tried took me literally all day. Mastered out. I am not necessarily depressed, but I think my brain adjusted to existing in perpetual uncertainty while needing to do hard math I don’t want to everyday. I always enjoyed things doing a dog walking business or uber in college because of the minimal success/interest I experienced in programming. I did an entrepreneurship minor, and I always loved those courses. Working at front-desk jobs and TPM felt like the same skill set to me kinda, so I think I minimized “TPM” roles because it’s a “non-technically” impressive degree. I did try really hard to like coding/hard topics for so many years but like… I feel like my brain only does it for exams/assignments or to teach others. I would rather do not this at all if other things paid well. I now have two technical degrees, a CS and electrical engineering masters, but I feel like I have no skills bc all I did was math or people-oriented things.I have noticed all other areas of my life social life, hobbies, etc. just wither away because I just sleep until I have to do something code related.I think right now, though my resume “looks impressive” the job market grind is a lot. I literally will just sleep in my car at a parking lot because I just don’t want to do leetcode or specific company prep. I think a lot of life goals like having friends, finding partner, climbing, having interest to do anything besides sleep have like withered in my mid-20s due to how much I forced this interest.There’s a part of me that does think if I do get a nice paying CS job, I can save so much money and retire early due to how much I have minimized my other life needsWhat careers can I consider with my degrees that are more people-oriented, or what can I do to look marketable for TPM roles now.",17,0.89,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pto1gr/other_career_options_besides_swe_with_stem_degree/,2025-12-23 07:37:44,2025-12-24 01:46:14

Where I work, software is a cost center.For most of my time at this company, we were a team of 4-5. Over the course of this year, the team has shrunk to just me with HR saying they have no intention of opening up or hiring for the lost positions. This means I am salary with 24/7 on-call (no payment for OT or call-outs).I recently became a team of 1 as of mid-september. Based on the concerns I brought up with my manager, I was recently presented with a raise and title change. I went from \~$80k -> \~$91k. This is in effect as of now. This raise also makes me ineligible for the normal end-of-year raise considerations. In addition to the raise, a retention offer was just made for $9k but I would have to remain with the company for 18months. Accepting or rejecting this offer does not effect the title change or raise that I already got.They have already stated that negotiating any of that 9k into base salary is not an option nor lessening the time frame. HR got quite aggressive when I inquired about that. The offer says I would get the net post-tax money, but would have to pay back the gross amount if broken.Like many of us, I have already been applying for other jobs. And honestly, if I had a choice, I would not be here in even 6 months. But with the current job market, especially in a LCOL city, Im not too sure if the option of another job in 18 months is realistic.I've read there is some tax form that could be filled out to essentially get the tax difference between the net and gross so I don't suffer a loss if I break the contract.But my question to you is - how have you handled retention offers like this and what is your opinion on it?Accepting it feels like it might turn into handcuffs of a sort... but rejecting it feels like it puts a mark on me as a flight-risk when I might be stuck there anyways due to the current market.",18,0.79,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pqrd3x/retention_offer_at_a_downsizing_company/,2025-12-19 17:43:44,2025-12-24 01:46:14

1pomo0k,My 2025 as a college senior has been quite sobering and I don't even know what to expect going forward,MarathonMarathon,cscareerquestions,"January to May 2025 was a bit bittersweet. Was a college junior at the time, and I had just molded my resume into something semi-satisfactory after sticking a bunch of school projects onto it. I had pretty much locked in with applying to tech-adjacent roles like data analysis at this point, and was prioritizing local companies. I kept applying through the spring, long after many might've given up or accepted offers. And while most of the internships I'd applied to were duds, a few did reach out to me. None of them were really technical, and yet I managed to fail many of those. For some I feel like I came painfully close to an acceptance, only for the door to be slammed in my face never to be opened again.Come May, I was at wits end, and dreading the possibility of having to work at my church friend's father's store and get paid in cash for the second summer in a row. But eventually, I found a company which onboarded me at the last second for the summer. Their office wasn't far from where I lived, so things did go smoothly. Unfortunately, though, they didn't give me a return offer even though they were satisfied with my performance.For this fall I've landed a tech job through my school's research department that pays like 16 an hour. And while I've received glowing reviews for this, it's just through the school. In the meantime I've applied to a few tech jobs, and have even secured a few interviews. My resume looks a lot better now than it might've 1 year ago, people have reviewed it and told me that I'm well qualified for new grad. And yet, I'm like the world's worst interviewer. One guy ended the interview 10 minutes in because he didn't like my responses. Another gave up on me despite me being a referral. I've failed an OA they were asking for a ""winter help desk intern"" even though it's literally help desk.The last month of class I didn't even apply to anything at all, it was just depressing. I just feel like an idiot. I haven't leetcoded in ages, and if you throw LC at me right now I'll probably fail at it miserably. You can do everything with AI nowadays so that's literally what I've been doing for some of my work, like come on even many companies are doing it. I don't even want to leetcode. I don't even want to work. Some days I literally just want to sleep forever, to tell the truth. Once I literally ranted to some of the people on campus so badly after bombing one of these interviews that they had the cops called on me and forced me to go to the hospital to make sure I wasn't planning on unaliving myself.Hopefully I can lock in well enough to land something by the time I graduate may 2026. But something tells me I'm probably not. And if I don't the battle will just grow more and more uphill. You literally cannot afford to live life unless you're at the top of the world. The sooner I leave my shitty parents the better, but the world is conspiring to hate me so badly that they're probably going to force me to live with them for the rest of my life and probably even die with them. It's like the curse of unbinding from minecraft.I absolutely hate all of this, and I'm going to absolutely hate next semester of college because it'll be my last, and I'll have to do and go through with all the routines and actions knowing it'll soon be over which'll just ruin the fun. To paraphrase Calvin and Hobbes, it's like trying to enjoy one's final meal before the execution. I'll have spent what's supposed to be the best time of my life to get a boy/girlfriend and exit it without one. Who the fuck is going to date me if I'm flipping burgers since it's the only job I'll be able to find even with a degree in CS, or if I'm stuck living with my parents in an unwalkable typical American suburb because it's the only home I can afford?Honestly, if the world is going to hate me, I might as well hate the world.",10,0.74,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pomo0k/my_2025_as_a_college_senior_has_been_quite/,2025-12-17 03:52:12,2025-12-24 01:46:14

Performance reviews are strong (“exceeds expectations”), but there’s essentially no room for advancement or technical growth.

I’ve leaned far too heavily on ChatGPT to do my coding, to the point where I’d describe myself as a “prompt engineer” rather than a strong engineer (and yes - I used ChatGPT to help me write this post, lol). There’s:* Zero technical mentorship* A disengaged manager (old-school DBA, 20+ years at the company)* No push toward system design, algorithms, or deeper CS conceptsI want out of this role in the near term (ideally back closer to my previous comp), but beyond that I want to **rebuild my foundation properly in a structured environment**.

I’m currently medicated and in therapy, and things are stable now. I’m trying to be realistic and intentional about my next steps instead of reacting out of panic.**My questions:*** Does it make sense to take CS fundamentals courses at a community college to demonstrate readiness and improve my chances for something like **Georgia Tech’s OMSCS**?* Is a formal CS master’s actually a good path for someone in my position aiming for high-end tech roles, or would I be better served focusing on: * LeetCode + system design * Targeted projects * Switching to a more technically rigorous job first?* For someone mid-career with weak formal CS fundamentals but real-world experience, what’s the *highest leverage* way to move forward?I’m not looking for shortcuts — I’m okay with a multi-year plan if it’s the right one.

1pok4iq,Sketchy employer sent technical assessment?,elementx1525,cscareerquestions,"I recently applied to a job on LinkedIn that I'm beginning to think is not legitimate somehow. The role is for a remote junior SWE position, and the listing seemed like any other one I've come across on the site. I hadn't heard of the company before, but I quickly scanned their website to check for legitimacy before applying. I heard back from the company about a week later asking if I was interested in completing a quick assessment via interview questions. I was so excited to finally hear back about a potential role so I emailed them back within an hour. Let's call the guy that I'm emailing with Ron.Ron's email wanted me to reply YES if I was interested in the assessment. I haven't seen this before, but I brushed it off as just a little odd. I responded with a YES, and a few hours later, I got another email from Ron with the interview questions attached in an .rtf file. He gave a little blurb about how there are no right answers and the test is to gauge if my skills and approach to the role are a good fit. He let me know that I could reach out with any questions if I had them and wished me luck on the assessment. This was on Friday.I browsed the \~20 questions of the assessment so I could be prepared and started brushing up on some of the topics. They seemed like very normal questions for a junior SWE role. Explain the difference between these two technologies, some DSA, some behavioral, etc. Nothing strange other than an address by their logo at the top that I looked up. It's for a big office building in a major US city that had no record of them having a space in.I completed the assessment over the course of the weekend and emailed Ron back first thing Monday morning. To my surprise, he got back to me within half an hour of my response. He told me that he received my message and that their team will review my answers, then forward them to the hiring board for their decision. He said I'd hear back from him when a decision is made and asked me to acknowledge I received his email. I sent him a message back thanking him for his acknowledgement, and said I looked forward to hearing back. This is where things go downhill.I went to the company's site again to find some more information. Unlike the first time I looked around, this time I was closely reading the information on the site and clicking around. The first thing that raised an alarm was how unprofessional their about us section is. It has a really long run-on sentence that doesn't make a lot of sense and ends with three exclamation marks. This prompted me to do a real deep dive on them.After more time on their site, things really started to unravel. Social media buttons that link to nothing. Those buttons you see on the bottom of most web pages about privacy policy, ad choices, etc? All lead to blank pages. Inconsistencies with spacing and grammar. An address that looks to be a residential home in Canada. A portfolio page that has a nice flashy intro, but nothing else. Nothing on the site is selectable text. All very strange for a company that supposedly provides tech solutions.Then I did some research on Google. They have only a few people affiliated with them on LinkedIn, only 2 of which are people have any sort of information about themselves. One is a guy who seems to be a real software developer, complete with a personal website and a lively GitHub. Another is a woman who allegedly started working there years ago as a PM, but only just a few weeks ago posted an update sharing that she started there. She lists herself as still working there, but also has another current job listed. The other people affiliated with the company have no profile picture or anything, but I did find out one of them is Ron because he has a very distinct tagline that came up when I looked up his name as well.Multiple websites that report company information list them as having fewer than 10 employees, most of which are located in Canada or Africa. The company is credited as the designer and developer on a few dozen sites that I can find, but most of them seem to be associated with one specific church in one way or another. They do have a few social media accounts with not much on them. Also, the page for the LinkedIn posting I applied to is gone. Not marked as filled, but entirely gone.I'm just so confused about this whole thing. It seems so sketchy. But why send over a technical assessment if it's a scam? Why put up so many fake sites? It seems like a lot of effort just to get some data. Unless they're going even further and will try to offer people employment to get their bank data and/or social security number. Is this really how far scammers are going now? I'm already exhausted enough looking for an entry-level SWE role in 2025, I don't need scams that look this believable at surface level to waste my time.What do you all think? Has anyone seen anything like this before?TL;DR- I applied to a company for a junior SWE role and they sent over a technical assessment. After doing more research on them, I'm not sure if they are legit due to some sketchiness and inconsistencies.EDIT: Yeah it turned out to be a fake check scam as everyone was saying. There is at least 1 other person I’ve seen post about it with the same story. Now I’m not worried to say the name of the company, it’s Velte Technology Solutions.

1psugln,Math PhD with No Internships for AI Industry Research: Bad Idea?,ThomasHawl,cscareerquestions,"I received a fully funded PhD scholarship in Mathematics. Originally, I applied for a PhD in Computer Science, but since the PI is affiliated with both departments, the scholarship was formally offered under Mathematics instead.My main motivation for pursuing a PhD has always been industry research, not academia. I’m particularly interested in roles at places like DeepMind, FAIR, or smaller, niche AI research labs. From what I can tell, these positions typically expect a PhD in CS / ML (or very closely related fields), and a PhD in Mathematics does not seem to be the standard, or even explicitly listed, in most cases.I am not interested in becoming a professor. I see the PhD primarily as a means to access research-oriented industry roles, not as an academic career path in itself.That said, there are several red flags that are making me hesitate:1. The PI is very new. I would be their second PhD student, and the first one is now a postdoc, still in academia.2. The PI has few publications, mostly in mathematics, and a very low h-index.3. The scholarship itself has some worrying conditions: * Internships are not allowed. * If I decide to leave the PhD early, they may require full reimbursement of the scholarship.The internship restriction is especially concerning, since I want to move into industry research and not stay in academia.At this point, the only reasons I still see for going forward are:1. Is it realistically possible to enter big tech / AI research labs without top-tier publications and without internships?2. Gaining research experience and living abroad.3. I genuinely find the research topic very interesting (I can share more details via DM; I’d prefer not to be too identifiable here).One more important piece of context: I am already working as a software engineer, although with a very old tech stack and in a sector I don’t enjoy (defense). Because of this, an alternative plan would be to decline this scholarship, keep working for now, and apply again next year, which realistically might be my last chance, since I’m already 28.Given all this: What would you do in my position? Any advice or perspectives are welcome.",6,0.72,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1psugln/math_phd_with_no_internships_for_ai_industry/,2025-12-22 08:27:00,2025-12-24 01:46:14

1pps10k,Is this my responsibility?,xxlibrarisingxx,cscareerquestions,"I am a junior, kind of involved in IT. IT recently rolled out a security feature that blocks me from running my development files. I told my boss (who is fully IT, no dev) and he gave me the contact to the person in charge of the security feature. And I've had to troubleshoot with him over the past 2 weeks. No support from my manager.It feels like my job has become troubleshooting this project that I had no idea was happening/how it works. Should my manager be helping more here or is this really on meEdit: as of 10 minutes ago, another update that logs me out of the environment after a short amount of inactivity",6,0.8,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pps10k/is_this_my_responsibility/,2025-12-18 14:22:11,2025-12-24 01:46:14
1pprf14,Unable to find a job as a software developer.,BonksMan,cscareerquestions,"I am a software developer with 2.5 years of experience or 3 years if my work placement is counted and I have recently finished my Master's degree in AI and Robotics with distinction. I'm an international student in UK and every job that I have applied to, I have gotten a rejection email within a week. I have applied to junior, mid, entry, graduate levels and even placements and internships but I'm unable to get even an interview.I will attach screenshots of my CV as well. My question is what could be the reason that I am not getting any interviews at all? Is it because my CV isn't good enough or is it because companies just do not want to hire international students?I am allowed full-time work without sponsorship till at least Feb 2028 and not even expecting companies to sponsor me but I feel like this might be a reason for the rejections.I have tried writing cover letters specifically tailored to each position and company as well as use a single one updated according to the job description and gotten the same response.I feel like my willingness to learn any framework or language or work in any domain as well as being lax on salary requirements and willingness to relocate will help me find a job, but it hasn't.Currently stuck doing odd jobs and not getting time to work on my skills, my second question is, what should I do to keep my skills sharp as I feel like I am forgetting what I have worked with, should I do interview practice by solving questions on hackerrank and leetcode or should I go through tutorials on the frameworks that I used to work with?Here is my CV: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hcVHvQTYzgEUL\_gvkmxxTHNKJF0L7Hce/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hcVHvQTYzgEUL_gvkmxxTHNKJF0L7Hce/view?usp=sharing)",5,0.6,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pprf14/unable_to_find_a_job_as_a_software_developer/,2025-12-18 13:56:19,2025-12-24 01:46:14
