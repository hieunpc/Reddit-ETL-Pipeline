How do people actually learn the “data side” of Go?,PixelBot_556,dataengineering,"Hi Everyone,I’m fairly new to data engineering (started \~3–4 months ago). Right now I’m:* Learning Python properly (doing daily problems)* Building small personal projects in PySpark using Databricks to get strongerI keep seeing postings and talks about modern data platforms where Go (and later Rust) is used a lot for pipelines, Kafka tools, fast ingestion services, etc. My questions as a complete beginner in this area:1. Is Go actually becoming a “must-have” or a strong “nice-to-have” for data engineers in the next few years, or can I get really far (and get good jobs) by just mastering Python + PySpark + SQL + Airflow/dbt?2. If it is worth learning, I can find hundreds of tutorials for Go basics, but almost nothing that teaches how to work with data in Go – reading/writing CSVs, Parquet, Avro, Kafka producers/consumers, streaming, back-pressure, etc. How did you learn the real “data engineering in Go” part?3. For someone still building their first PySpark projects, when is the realistic time to start Go without getting overwhelmed?I don’t want to distract myself too early, but I also don’t want to miss the train if Go is the next big thing for higher-paying / more interesting data platform roles.Any advice from people who started in Python/Spark and later added Go (or decided not to) would be super helpful.

I’ll admit I made some mistakes (jumping straight into Airflow/AWS, even made a post about Airflow here, LOL), but I kept going because I genuinely enjoy learning about the field.Two months ago I actually received two job opportunities. Both meetings went well: they asked about my projects, my skills, my approach to learning, etc. Both processes just vanished. I assume it’s because I have 0 experience. Still, I’ve been studying 4–6 hours a day since I started, and I’m fully committed to become a professional DE.# My current skill set:**Python:** PySpark, Polars, DuckDB, OOP **SQL:** MySQL, PostgreSQL **Databricks:** Delta Lake, Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines, Jobs, Roles, Unity Catalog, Secrets, External Locations, Connections, Clusters **BI:** Power BI, Looker **Cloud:** AWS (IAM, S3, Glue) / a bit of DynamoDB and RDS **Workflow Orchestration:** Airflow 3 (Astronomer certified) **Containers:** Docker basics (Images, Containers, Compose, Dockerfile) **Version Control:** Git & GitHub **Storage / Formats:** Parquet, Delta, Iceberg **Other:** Handling fairly large datasets (+100GB files), understanding when to use specific tools, etc **English:** C1/C2 (EF SET certified)# Projects I’ve built so far:– An end-to-end ETL built **entirely in SQL** using DuckDB, loading into PostgreSQL. – Another ETL pulling from multiple sources (MySQL, S3, CSV, Parquet), converting everything to Parquet, transforming it, and loading into PostgreSQL. Total volume was \~4M rows. I also handled IAM for boto3 access. – A small Spark → S3 pipeline (too simple to mention it though).I know these are beginner/intermediate projects, i’m planning more advanced ones for next year.Next year, I want to do things properly: structured learning, better projects, certifications, and ideally my first job, even if it’s low pay or long hours. I’m confident I can scale quickly once I get my first actual job.# My questions:– If you were in my position, what would you focus on next? – Do you think I’m in the right direction? – What kind of projects actually stand out in a junior DE portfolio? – Do certifications actually matter for someone with zero experience?

This helps with cases where you:* are data engineering in Rust within a highly connected, low latency ecosystem *(e.g., websocket feeds, Tokio etc.)*,* need typed arrays that remain Python/analytics ecosystem compatible* are working with real-time data use cases, and need minimal overhead Tabular data structures* are compiling lots, want < 2 second build times and basically value a solid data programming experience in Rust. Therefore, it is a great fit when you are DIY bare bones data engineering, and less so if you are relying on pre-existing tools *(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake).* For example, if you are data streaming in a more low-level manner.**Data Engineering examples:*** Stream data live off a Websocket and save it into ""**.arrow""** or ""**.parquet**"" files.* Capture data in Minarrow, flip to Polars on the fly and calculate metrics in real-time, then push them in chunks to a Datastore as a live persistent service* Run parallelised statistical calculations on 1 billion rows without much compile-time overhead so Rust becomes workable**You also get:*** Strong IDE typing (in Rust)* One hit *\`.to\_arrow()*\` and \`.*to\_polars()*\` in Rust* Enums instead of dynamic dispatch *(a Rust flavour that's used in the official Arrow Rust crates)** extensive SIMD-accelerated kernel functions available, including 60+ univariate distributions via the partner \`SIMD-Kernels\` crate (*fully reconciled to Scipy*). So, for many common cases you can stay in Rust for high performance compute.Essentially addressing a few areas that the main Arrow RS implementation makes different trade-offs. **Are you interested?**For those who work in high performance data and software engineering and value this type of work, please feel free to ask any questions, even if you predominantly work in Python or another language*.* As, Arrow is one of those frameworks that backs a lot of that ecosystem but is not always well understood, due its back-end nature.I'm also happy to explain how you can move data across language boundaries *(e.g., Python Rust)* using the Arrow format, or other tricks like this.Hope you found this interesting.Cheers,Pete",8,0.79,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1p4yogz/data_engineering_in_rust_with_minarrow/,2025-11-23 21:34:54,2025-11-29 01:39:14

I will say that I have brought this up to him privately before and he ignored me so my boss decided for us to meet with his boss.

So I built a real time streaming pipeline on it.It ingests live flight data from the OpenSky API (open source and free to use) and pushes it through this data stack: Kafka, Iceberg, DuckDB, Dagster, and Metabase, all running on Kubernetes via Minikube. Here is the GitHub repo: https://github.com/vijaychhatbar/flight-club-data/tree/mainI’ve tried to orchestrate the infrastructure through Taskfile - which uses helmfile approach to deploy all services on minikube. Technically, it should also work on any K8s flavour. All the charts are custom made which can be tailored as per our needs. I found this deployment process to be extremely elegant for managing any K8s apps. :) At a high level, a producer service calls the OpenSky REST API every ~30 seconds, publishes the raw JSON (converted to Avro) into Kafka, and a consumer writes that stream into Apache Iceberg tables which also has schema registry for evolution.I never used dagster before, so I tried to use it to make transformation tables. Also, it uses DuckDB for fast analytic queries. A better approach would be to use dbt on it - but that is something for later.I’ve then used a custom Dockerfile for Metabase to add DuckDB support as the official ones don’t have native DuckDB connection. Technically, you can query directly Iceberg realtime table - which I did to make realtime dashboard in Metabase.I hope this project might be helpful for people who want to learn or tinker with a realistic, end‑to‑end streaming + data lake setup on their own hardware, rather than just hello-world examples.

1p84rmp,"SCD2 in staging table, how to cope with batch loads from sourcesystem",Crazy-Sir5935,dataengineering,"Hi all, N00b alert! We are planning to do a proof of concept and one of the things we want to improve is that currently, we just ingest data directly from our source systems into our staging tables (without decoupling). For reference, we load data on a daily basis, operate in a heavily regulated sector and some of our source systems endpoint only provide batch/full loads (as they do tend to offer CDC on their end points but it only tracks 50% of the attributes making it kind of useless).In our new setup we are considering the following:1. Every extraction gets saved in the source/extraction format (thus JSON or .parquet).2. The extracted files get stored for atleast 3 months before being moved to cold storage (JSON is not that efficient so i guess that will save us some money).3. Everything gets transformed to .parquet4. .parquet files will be stored forever (this is relative but you know what i mean).5. We will make a folder structure for each staging table based on year, month, day etc. So now you understand that we will work with .parquet files. We were considering the new method of append only/snapshot tables (maybe combine it with SC2) as then we could easily load the whole thing again if we mess up and fill in the valid from/valid to dates on basis of a loop. Yet, a couple of our endpoints cause us to have some limitations. Let's consider the following example:1. The source system table logs hours a person logs on a project.2. The data goes back to 2015 and has approximately \~12 mln. records.3. A person can adjust hours going a year back from now (or other columns in the table in the source system).4. The system has audit fields so we could only take changed rows but this only works for 5 out of 20 columns thereby forcing us to do batch loads on a daily basis for a full year back (as we need to be sure to be 100% correct).5. The result is that, after the initial extraction, each day we have a file with logging hours for the last 365 days.**Questions**1. We looked at the snapshot method, but even not looking at the files, this would result in 12 mln records per day added? I'm surely no expert but even with partitioning, this doesn't sound very durable after a year?2. Considering SCD2 for a staging table in this case. How can we approach a scenario in which we would need to rebuild the entire table? As most daily loads consider the last 365 days and approximately 1 million rows, this would be hell of a loop (and i don't want to know how long it's going to take). Would it in this case make sense to make delta parquet's specifically for this scenario so you end up with like 1000 rows a file and making such a scenario easier?We need to be able to pull out 1 PK and see the changes in time for that specific PK without seeing thousands of duplicate rows, that's why we need SCD2 (as f.e. iceberg only shows the whole table in a point of time).

1p6p35x,"Considering an offer for DE II role, would love perspectives from DE/SWE folks",Sad-Boi-97,dataengineering,"TLDR: Strategy/ops guy in the MCIT program aiming for SWE. Got a verbal offer for a Data Engineer II role doing Python/PySpark, Databricks, ADF pipelines, ingestion, and medallion architecture, but the role sits fully in the data/analytics org, not engineering, and pays $105–115K (I currently make ~$180K TC in NYC).Trying to figure out whether this DE role meaningfully helps me pivot into SWE/back-end engineering longterm, or if it’s better to stay in my current job, finish MCIT, build projects, and target SWE directly. Looking for input from DEs/SWEs on how transferable this work is, whether the comp is normal for NYC, and what questions I should ask before deciding.Hey everyone, I’m looking for some candid input from folks in data engineering and software engineering.I’m currently in a strategy/operations role at a tech company while working through the MCIT program (Penn’s CS master’s for career switchers). My long term goal is to be a SWE. I recently interviewed for a Data Engineer II position at a healthcare tech company, and im trying to evaluate whether this role would be a good stepping stone to SWE or if I should just leverage my degree and build projects to make the switch. I’d appreciate any honest advice or experience people have.Here are the key details:Background / motivation* I’ve worked strategy consulting and it has led to a good paying career but I don’t care about strategy in all honesty. I dislike the politics to get promoted, work is quite boring where im learning nothing new* I like consulting in the fact that I had to learn a new industry everyday, but TBH I couldn’t deal with 15-16hr workdays just to learn more* I love the technical side and building things which is why I considered SWE about a year and a half ago (I just expected the market to be better by then lolz) Comp* Base salary: $105–115K (Remote but I live in NYC)* Other factors are TBD as I haven’t gotten the formal letter yet, just verbal and what the job description outlines* I currently make 155k base and TC ~180k so it would be a pay cut for this roleTeam / Org Structure* The role sits in the data - analytics org, not the software engineering org* DEs partner with analytics engineers, ML/data consumers, data scientists* I would not be in the analytics engineering track or an analyst, but they would be my stakeholders* No direct SWE involvement as far as I can tellTech + Responsibilities* Mostly Python + PySpark on Databricks* AWS and Azure* Both streaming and batch pipelines* Medallion architecture (bronze/silver/gold layers)* ADF wiring + pipeline orchestration* File ingestion + transformations + schema enforcement* Some framework or pipeline component building, but unclear how deep the engineering side goes* Not much SQL involved, which surprised me, but they emphasized if they were asking for SQL it would be for more analysts vs engineersMy goals / questions:My ultimate target is a technical heavy role that still pays well, like SWE or backend, but I’m also open to becoming a stronger DE if it meaningfully raises my chances of SWE transitioning.Any insights on the following would be helpful:1. Does this sound like a DE role with strong engineering exposure that can help facilitate a SWE transition? 2. How transferable is this experience toward SWE or backend engineering later?3. For those who started in DE and moved into SWE, what allowed that transition?4. Is $105–115K base realistic for NYC in a mid-level DE role, or does that seem low?5. Would you take this role if your long-term goal leaned more toward SWE?6. Anything I should ask the hiring manager or my internal referrer to get more clarity?I’m not trying to bash the role or Data engineering, I’m genuinely trying to understand if this would meaningfully advance my pivot or if im better off staying in my current role and continuing to work on transitioning directly. Any honest input from experienced DEs or SWEs would really help.

1p8ew4k,"Declarative data processing for ""small data""?",lobster_johnson,dataengineering,"I'm working on a project that involves building a kind of world model by analyzing lots of source data with LLMs. I've evaluated a lot of dataproc orchestration frameworks lately — Ray, Prefect, Temporal, and so on.What bugs me is that the appears to be nothing that allows me to construct *declarative*, functional processing.As an extremely naive and simplistic example, imagine a dataset of HTML documents. For each document, we want to produce a Markdown version in a new dataset, then ask an LLM to summarize it. These tools all suggest an imperative approach: Maybe a function `get_input_documents()` that returns HTML documents, then a loop over this to run a conversion function `convert_to_markdown()`, and then a `summarize()` and a `save_output_document()`. With Ray you could define these as _tasks_ and have the scheduler execute them concurrently and distributed over a cluster. You could batch or paginate some things as needed, all easy stuff.In such an imperative world, we might also keep the job simple and simply iterate over the input every time if the processing is cheap enough — dumb is often easier. We could use hashes (for example) to avoid doing work on inputs that haven't changed since the last run, and we could cache LLM prompts. We might do a ""find all since last run"" to skip work. Or plug the input into a queue of changes.All that's fine, but once the processing grows to a certain scale, that's a lot of ""find inputs, loop over, produce output"" stitched together — it's the same pattern over and over again: Mapping and reducing. It's map/reduce but done imperatively.For my purposes, it would be a lot more elegant to describe a full graph of operators and queries.For example, if I declared `bucket(""input/*.html"")` as a source, I could string this into a graph `bucket(""input/*.html"") -> convert_document()`. And then `-> write_output_document()`. An important principle here is that the pipeline only expresses flow, and the scheduler handles the rest: It can parallelize operators, it can memoize steps based on inputs, it can fuse together map steps, it can handle retrying, it can track lineage by encoding what operators a piece of data went through, it can run operators on different nodes, it can place queues between nodes for backpressure, concurrency control, and rate limiting — and so on.Another important principle here is that the pipeline, if properly memoized, can be fully differential, meaning it can know at any given time which pieces of data have changed between operator nodes, and use that property to avoid unnecessary work, skipping entire paths if the output would be identical.I'm fully aware of, and have used, streaming systems like Flink and Spark. My sense is that these are very much made for large-scale Big Data applications that benefit from vectorization and partitioning of columnar data. Maybe they could be used for this purpose, but it doesn't appear like a good fit? My data is complex, often unstructured or graph-like, and is I/O-bound (calling out to LLMs, vector databases, and so on). I haven't really seen this for ""small data"".In many ways, I'm seeking a ""distributed Make"", at least in the abstract. And there is indeed a very neat tool called [SnakeMake](https://snakemake.github.io/) that's a lot like this, which I'm looking into. I'm a bit put off by how it has its own language — I would prefer Python to declare my graph, too — but it looks interesting and worth trying out.

Any resources that you're aware of in this space would also be of benefit for me to reference. Thanks!1) Data quality (DQ): technical controls vs business rules. In my last role there was a “handshake” agreement on what DQ rules are for Technology to own vs what Data Governance owns. Typically rules like reconciliations, timeliness rules, and record counts (e.g. file-level rules vs field- or content-level rules) were left for Technology to manage.2) Bronze/silver/platinum/gold layers. DQ rules apply to the silver or platinum layers, not the gold layer. The gold layer (i.e. the ""golden source"") should be for consumption.3) Any critical data elements should have full lineage tracking of all layers in #2. Tech isn't necessarily directly involved in this process, but should support DG when documenting lineage.4) Any schema changes DG should be actively aware of, even before the changes are made.

1p7bpun,I built an MCP server to connect your AI agents to your DWH,karakanb,dataengineering,"Hi all, this is Burak, I am one of the makers of [Bruin CLI](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin). We built an MCP server that allows you to connect your AI agents to your DWH/query engine and make them interact with your DWH.A bit of a back story: we started Bruin as an open-source CLI tool that allows data people to be productive with the end-to-end pipelines. Run SQL, Python, ingestion jobs, data quality, whatnot. The goal being a productive CLI experience for data people.After some time, agents popped up, and when we started using them heavily for our own development stuff, it became quite apparent that we might be able to offer similar capabilities for data engineering tasks. Agents can already use CLI tools, and they have the ability to run shell commands, and they could technically use Bruin CLI as well.Our initial attempts were around building a simple [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) file with a set of instructions on how to use Bruin. It worked fine to a certain extent; however it came with its own set of problems, primarily around maintenance. Every new feature/flag meant more docs to sync. It also meant the file needed to be distributed somehow to all the users, which would be a manual process.We then started looking into MCP servers: while they are great to expose remote capabilities, for a CLI tool, it meant that we would have to expose pretty much every command and subcommand we had as new tools. This meant a lot of maintenance work, a lot of duplication, and a large number of tools which bloat the context.Eventually, we landed on a middle-ground: expose only documentation navigation, not the commands themselves.We ended up with just 3 tools:* `bruin_get_overview`* `bruin_get_docs_tree` * `bruin_get_doc_content` The agent uses MCP to fetch docs, understand capabilities, and figure out the correct CLI invocation. Then it just runs the actual Bruin CLI in the shell. This means less manual work for us, and making the new features in the CLI automatically available to everyone else. You can now use Bruin CLI to connect your AI agents, such as Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, or any other agent that supports MCP servers, into your DWH. Given that all of your DWH metadata is in Bruin, your agent will automatically know about all the business metadata necessary. Here are some common questions people ask to Bruin MCP:* analyze user behavior in our data warehouse* add this new column to the table X* there seems to be something off with our funnel metrics, analyze the user behavior there* add missing quality checks into our assets in this pipeline Here's a quick video of me demoing the tool: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=604wuKeTP6U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=604wuKeTP6U)All of this tech is fully open-source, and you can run it anywhere.

Just let them go? for example, we may have an orders table that has a userid field which is not nullable. All of a sudden, there is 1 value (or maybe hundreds of values) that are NULL for userid (out of millions). We have to change userid to be nullable or use an unknown identifier (-1, 'unknown') etc. This reduces our DQ visibility and constraints at the table level. so then we have to set up post-load tests to check if missing values are beyond a certain threshold (e.g. 1%). And even then, sometimes 1% isn't enough for the upstream client to prioritize and make fixes. the issue is more challenging bc we have dozens of clients and so the threshold might be slightly different per client. This is compounded bc it's like this for every other DQ check... orders with a userid populated but we don't have the userid in users table (broken relationship).. usually just tiny percentage.

1p4mp28,Feedback for experiment on HTAP database architecture with zarr like chunks,xandral95,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I’m experimenting with a storage-engine design and I’d love feedback from people with database internals experience.This is a thought experiment with a small Python PoC, I'm not an expert SW engineer, for me would be really difficult to develop alone a complex system in Rust or C++ to get serious benchmarks, but I would like to share the idea to understand if it's interesting.# Core IdeaTo think SQL like tables as geospatial raster data.1. Latitude ---> row_index (primary key)2. Longitude ---> column_index 3. Time ---> MVCC version or transaction_idAnd from these 3 core dimensions (rows, columns, time), the model naturally generalize to N dimensions:* Add hash-based dimensions for high‑cardinality OLAP attributes (e.g., `user_id`, `device_id`, `merchant_id`). These become something like: * `hash(user_id) % N` → distributes data evenly.* Add range-based dimensions for monotonic or semi‑monotonic values (e.g., timestamps, sequence numbers, IDs): * `timestamp // col_chunk_size` → perfect for pruning, like time-series chunks.This lets a traditional RDBMS table behave like an N-D array, hopefully tuned for both OLTP and OLAP scanning, depending on which dimensions are meaningful to the workload by chunking rows and columns like lat/lon tiles, and layering versions like a time-axis, you get deterministic coordinates and very fast addressing.### ExampleHere’s a simple example of what a chunk file path might look like when all dimensions are combined.Imagine a table chunked along:* **row dimension** → `row_id // chunk_rows_size = 12`* **column dimension** → `col_id // chunk_cols_size = 0`* **time/version dimension** → `txn_id = 42`* **hash dimension** (e.g., `user_id`) → `hash(user_id) % 32 = 5`* **range dimension** (e.g., timestamp bucket) → `timestamp // 3600 = 472222`A possible resulting chunk file could look like:```chunk_r12_c0_hash5_range472222_v42.parquet```Inspired by array stores like **Zarr**, but intended for **HTAP** workloads.### Update strategiesNaively using CoW on chunks but this gives huge write amplification. So I’m exploring a **Patch + Compaction** model: append a tiny *patch file* with only the changed cells + txn_id. A vacuum merges base chunk + patches into a new chunk and removes the old ones.Is this something new or reinvented? I don't know about similar products with all these combinations, the most common are (ClickHouse, DuckDB, Iceberg,...). Do you see any serious architectural problem on that?Any feedback is appreciated!TL;DR: Exploring an HTAP storage engine that treats relational tables like N-dimensional sparse arrays, combining row/col/time chunking with hash and range dimensions for OLAP/OLTP.

I did that so much that I was crippled by indecisiveness because I kept going ""oh this is too easy"", ""oh, this is too hard"". On top of that, being new means I don't have the experience to be able to accurately tell whether something is hard or easy, which made things even more obviously dumb.And NOW I finally realize that, all I had to do was first cover the base case scenarios (like learning how to build a basic page that navigates around other pages) and then come up with something that I want to build, and start stumbling around 99% of the time trying to figure out how to build it. Obviously that would mean spending more time googling, reading articles, stackoverflow etc. than actually writing code. Duh! It's the first time I do most of the things required.So you think at this point ""okay bro, now you know how people learn by building projects and connecting the dots to make functional software, congrats"".

1p3myes,What is a fun way to reignite my passion in programming?,MississippiGuy420,learnprogramming,"I've been coding for a tiny company for the last three years. We've been building a site for a very large community college. It uses C#, Blazor (particularly SyncFusion), and HTML.

1p7ax9h,Naming Things in really complex situations and as codebase size increases and glossry for common terms.,Dizzy-Complaint-8871,learnprogramming,"Naming has become a real challenge for me. It’s easy when I’m following a YouTube tutorial and building mock projects, but in real production projects it gets difficult. In the beginning it’s manageable, but as the project grows, naming things becomes harder.For example, I have various formatters. A formatter takes a database object—basically a Django model instance—and formats it. It’s similar to a serializer, though I have specific reasons to create my own instead of using the built-in Python or Django REST Framework serializers. The language or framework isn’t the main point here; I’m mentioning them only for clarity.So I create one formatter that returns some structured data. Then I need another formatter that returns about 80% of the same data, but with slight additions or removals. There might be an order formatter, then another order formatter with user data, another one without the “order received” date, and so on. None of this reflects my actual project—it’s not e-commerce but an internal tool I can’t discuss in detail—but it does involve many formatters for different use cases. Depending on the role, I may need to send different versions of order data with certain fields blank. This is only the formatter situation.Then there are formatters that include user roles, order formatters that also include product details, and other combinations. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to separate order and product formatters, but in rare cases I need a product formatter with only an order number or something similar, so I end up creating another formatter because the original one didn’t include it.Beyond formatters, naming functions, classes, methods, getters, and setters also becomes difficult. I know that when naming becomes hard, it may indicate that the code isn’t following the Single Responsibility Principle. But I’m not always sure how to handle this.For example, I might be building an interface that lets users update their data. An admin can update emails, phone numbers, and roles, but a regular user can only update their name. This leads to functions like `update_user_with_role`, `update_user_normal`, `update_user_with_email`, and so on.Most of my projects have role-based access control, and different roles can view or update different fields. Sometimes even the displayed values differ. For example, if an admin views an order, they might see quantity 100, but a vendor might see quantity 70 because the order is split between two vendors. That means writing multiple getters, different database queries, and various ways of manipulating the data. This leads to many functions and a lot of naming decisions.Inside a single function, I often deal with dictionaries (like objects in JavaScript). I might fetch raw data from the database, give it a long descriptive name, remove some parts, process it again, and so on. I end up naming the same dictionary multiple times in different forms, and the names become long and messy. I’m unsure what the right approach is here.Tutorials usually cover only obvious examples aimed at beginners. They say things like “If you calculate tax, call it `calculate_tax`,” which is obvious. But my real-world cases aren’t that simple. If discounts depend on user roles, sure, the logic should be inside the function, but I still need to express it clearly. I also don’t want to get stuck overthinking names because that delays the project.Name collisions happen a lot. For example, I once wrote a function called `get_user` to fetch a user by ID. Later I needed to fetch users by email, username, and other fields. I ended up writing multiple versions, and the original vague name became a problem because it was created early in the project. I eventually renamed it, but it was painful. That’s why I want a better approach from the start so I don’t spend hours worrying about names.Sometimes it feels easier to write the logic itself. I never use meaningless names like `a` or `x1`, but I do end up writing temporary or placeholder names like “this\_has\_to\_be\_renamed”. Then I move on to the next function and write “this\_is\_not\_right\_first\_has\_to\_be\_renamed”, and so on. These names aren’t helpful, but they let me continue writing code without getting stuck on naming.So I’m looking for any guide, project, or glossary I can refer to—something with common naming patterns. For instance, I used words like “collection” or “group” earlier, but “batch” made more sense in my context.

1p6sdl5,Image Blurring algorithm,Several-Airline-5065,learnprogramming,"I recently wrote an image blurring algorithm that uses a basic approach that I learned in my computational physics course in college. Basically, pixels in an image are selected at random, and its RGB values are averaged with the RBG values of all pixels immediately round it. When this happens, the selected pixel (""pixel"" is an object I created) is also set to ""processed"" meaning this pixel has already been worked on, don't perform the averaging operation on it again. This implies that the random selector method I'm using can choose any pixel it wants to while running, so multiple pixels get selected multiple times. This is inefficient. How could I also exclude them from the set of values the random method can select? I was thinking about putting all the pixel values in a linked list and then knocking them out that way with a checkinlist(pixel) method, but maybe a hash table would be better?",6,0.8,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p6sdl5/image_blurring_algorithm/,2025-11-25 23:42:48,2025-11-29 01:39:15

1p62h5i,What I Learnt while building a puzzle solving chrome extension for LinkedIn,good_to_have,learnprogramming,"I’ve been experimenting with LinkedIn’s mini-games recently, and I got curious about how some of the puzzles actually work behind the scenes. A few of them felt like they relied a bit too much on trial and error, so I turned that curiosity into a small side project. I built a browser extension that reads the puzzle when you open it, figures out the pattern, and then gives hints or can even solve it automatically. Right now it only works with the “Zip” puzzle, but I’m planning to expand it as I go.While building this, I ended up learning way more than I expected. I got a much better understanding of how Chrome extensions are structured, how to use content scripts to interact with a page, and how to scrape and interpret the DOM in a way that doesn’t break when the site loads things dynamically. I also had to figure out how to design simple pattern-recognition logic, handle communication between different parts of the extension, and work through a bunch of timing issues that I’d never really run into before. Publishing it taught me how the Chrome Web Store process works too. Overall, it was a fun reminder that small projects are often the best way to learn things you didn’t even know you needed.If anyone wants to take a look or offer feedback, here’s the extension on the Chrome Web Store:https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/linkedin-puzzle-cracker/immohpcmpcbpfbepgkjacopkajnllpak",5,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p62h5i/what_i_learnt_while_building_a_puzzle_solving/,2025-11-25 03:51:48,2025-11-29 01:39:15

I'm a junior in college studying civil engineering, a degree in which you don't need to know anything about anything when it comes to coding. Despite that, I've started learning Python with Harvard's free online CS50 course. This is because:1) I find it personally interesting 2) I'd like to have a marketable skill that sets me apart from my peers 3) I'd like to be able to work on projects for some side incomeI chose Python because it's quite beginner-friendly and has applications in data processing, scraping, automation, among others.I don't think that I'm interested in achieving mastery of the language. I want to reach a level where I can write code well and be able to market my skills as a freelancer. I'm expecting this to take at least 1.5-2 years of learning and practice with coding projects. It's honestly a dream of mine to be able to travel the world in my 20s, and to be able to have a source of income (even if it's not much) from doing remote work cleaning data (or something similar) would be even better. This is on top of the benefit that I think I'd receive in my career from having this skill. My questions are:1) Look, I know developers are crucial and can't be easily replaced by robots. But do y'all think that a couple years of actively learning Python will make me competitive against AI that can write fast, free code? I'm not trying to offend anyone, but it's just that at this point I clearly don't know how good AI's code is or what I could be capable of after 2 years. 2) Assuming I stick to a niche like web scraping or automation, do y'all think I could get paid well by doing projects for people as a freelancer?

1p6sep4,How do you effectively compare yourself/study other programmers to find out shortcomings?,tree332,learnprogramming,"I often take advice too literally and get confused on how I should specifically structure my agenda when learning formal math, programming, and computer science. I've made a lot of poor assumptions and ended up in a bottleneck where I'm not really improving in any of these three sectors listed within computational mathematics/CS or software engineering. Because software engineering is usually an asynchronous isolated discipline it's hard to figure out what I am doing wrong and what other people are doing right, especially since people like to summarize and avoid being pedantic, but I don't always know what people mean by their advice. Sometimes I wish I could watch other people develop software or solve algorithmic in real time, read their notes and their learning journey in a biographical timeline. When I try to ask other students they might say ""I learnt from a young age from parents or other tutors"", or that ""they made projects that they liked and just coded a lot"", I don't really get to observe the specifics of what they're doing the way you can study someone when they're playing a sport or some other visible activity. I was told mathematics was the main foundation behind computer science that is mainly unchanging compared to programming languages, libraries and toolkits which change constantly, I thought it would be best if I invested most of my time into studying math while taking 'intro to CS' and intro to 'x programming language tutorials', just trying to focus on passing my CS degree and computational mathematics first before exploring a specific software engineering discipline.I thought that once I understood the mathematics understanding how to translate concepts into code would be as straightforward as making functions for arithmetic operations or other ideas people intuitively understand. But if you brought a mathematician with no programming experience in a structured course they would not understand how to program an addition function in python or C++ either.I should not have focused so much on math and expected the information to immediately convert to programming skill or at least make the implementation side obvious. In my intro to DSA class we didn’t even use discrete math or linear algebra, so there was no reason to take all 3 classes at the same time with no way to tie the classes together, but the curriculum made me do this. Eventually in my classes I reached a point where I was told despite how much I tried to study the math and computer science concepts in pseudocode, I couldn't implement anything, i couldn't code. I was confused as I tried to engage as much as I could in my intro to x language-intermediate x language classes, asking questions, going to office hours(which in intermediate java for example was usually swamped because we were given 'real projects'/'toy projects' as assignments after going over a small topic in class, and the professor told us to figure it out)When I asked how I should have learnt to code I was told to mainly ""make more personal projects from scratch"" and just to ""code more"" I wasn't sure where that meant for me to start. While I knew I was hardly software engineer material, I thought I was at least making enough progress to code the computer science concepts in my classes but I wasn't, especially since we didn't focus on literal technical problems but toy projects/ ""real world scenarios"" using the algorithm in ways that we couldn't directly google because it was a unique scenario project, and we didn't actually code in class because we were told ""I'm not teaching you how to program, I'm teaching you computer science."" Should I do leetcode and seek computational problems to solve? I tried that and I was no more prepared for the mini software assignments given in class. Should I choose a specific field of software engineering and just start learning the tools through example projects before branching off into my own project ideas? A lot of the programming libraries/tools were too niche and abstract, taking away time trying to study a specific library itself rather than the programming/ software engineering principles I was trying to gain from practicing programming with those tools to apply to my classes.I tried to read books on software design, but the books talked more about general project cycle principles such as readable and reusable code, good documentation, but computer architecture talked about low level concepts such as the ALU of which studying wasn't helping me program any better at the time nor did I fully understand. I started trying to program projects from my imagination, especially since I was told ""don't use tutorials, code from scratch, employers don't care about clone/derivate projects"" which always ended up with me taking a bunch of notes on the documentation trying to study what enumeration is or watching a bunch of mini tutorials on different classes in a toolkit I thought might be relevant to my project for weeks on end, with no actual progress on the project being made, just dismembered pieces of code in test files which I definitely can't put on my resume either.",4,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p6sep4/how_do_you_effectively_compare_yourselfstudy/,2025-11-25 23:44:07,2025-11-29 01:39:15

1p6n6ma,"I built an adaptive, error-driven Python learning template (meant to be reused for other subjects)",Tobzu-,learnprogramming,"I’ve been learning Python myself and got frustrated with two extremes: either you get full solutions from AI and learn nothing, or you get stuck with very little guidance. So I built a small adaptive learning system on top of an LLM that tries to sit in the middle.The system does three things very strictly:* Error-driven feedback: When you ask for help with your code, the AI prints your code with line numbers and only points to “Line X – syntax error / structure error / logic error / input error”. No full solutions unless you explicitly ask after you’ve tried to fix it.* Maximum 2 new concepts per lesson: Each learning unit is allowed to introduce at most two new commands or ideas. If a lesson needs more than that, it’s automatically split into smaller sub-lessons. The idea is to manage cognitive load instead of throwing everything at you at once.* Reflection and tracking: After each session, there’s a short reflection (what was hard, what worked, what to focus on next), and the system tracks goals, progress, and repeated error types.Right now it’s wired for Python (loops, input, error handling, functions, lists, etc.), but the structure is generic: goals (G##), lessons (L## / W## / T##), a command tracker, error plan, progress tracking, learning log. You could in principle swap the content and use the same engine for other things (language learning, math, etc.).The whole thing is:* A GitHub template repo* No personal data included* Documented so you can understand and change the rulesRepo: [https://github.com/Tobzu/-adaptive-learning-system-](https://github.com/Tobzu/-adaptive-learning-system-)I’d love feedback on:* Whether this kind of “error-only” feedback actually helps learning* How you would extend or simplify it for beginners* Any ideas for good Python goals/lessons that fit the “max 2 new concepts” rule",3,0.8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p6n6ma/i_built_an_adaptive_errordriven_python_learning/,2025-11-25 20:16:09,2025-11-29 01:39:15
1p6l9vk,Frontend coding just because I like it - what's next?,creative_word_person,learnprogramming,"This will be long, but hear me out.I founded a marketing agency a while back, and have always been the go-to for web dev, QC, and other stuff (SEO, UX, responsiveness etc). This is partly because websites aren't a primary 'revenue source' and that good talent is expensive. But mainly because - **I just fucking love to code**.I started out with Bootstrap, lot of template editing + debugging, moved onto CMSes like Wordpress and HubSpot, and got a fair understanding of React/JS frameworks on the way. This was mainly for brand websites, so little to no web app development (although I've helped clients with app interfaces and debugging on the way). While web dev hasn't been a primary focus, and probably never will be, I'm weirdly obsessed with good web experiences. Mixing design with dev is my therapy-replacement, and I want to be better at it. I'd think of myself as an intermediate web developer, even though I've spent less than enough time on it. I'm an engineer-turned-marketer, so I have a fair understanding of programming concepts as well. I just want to be better - and I'm having a hard time figuring out where to start.I like threeJS and GSAP, although the learning curve feels a little intimidating.

1p66bjw,Need help picking a book on fundamental Computer Science topics,crushvip,learnprogramming,"Hello, everyone.I need your help picking a book to expand my knowledge in fundamentals of computer science.I am a mechanical engineering major, and about 3 years ago I decided to switch careers and learn programming. Thing is, while doing this, I focused more on hands on knowledge that will help me find a job, not fundamentals. I started with Harward's CS50 course for some basics, then learned Java and Spring, basics of SQL and Git, and then a bit of data structures and algorithms. After about 8-9 months, I landed a job and started working.Currently, I am feeling that I missed a lot of fundamental topics and I would like to cover the blank spots before I can further improve. I have no problem understanding any technical topics, I have always been a good student, and math/physics/engineering was always my forte.I feel like I need to cover the following topics: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networking and Database Systems. I understand that all of these topics are broad enough to cover several books by themselves, but reality is, I don't have that much time to dedicate to studying each topic.Hence, I would like a recommendation of a single book (preferably, but it can also be a video course) that would give me an overall knowledge on all of these topics, so that when the need arises, I would at least know where to look for more detailed info. What I am looking for, is a book for self-taught programmers like myself, to cover some of the more glaring blank spots, that would also give enough fundamental knowledge so that I can later dive deeper into any specific subject.Thanks for reading and your help.",2,0.63,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p66bjw/need_help_picking_a_book_on_fundamental_computer/,2025-11-25 07:29:53,2025-11-29 01:39:15

1p3lq4x,"1.5 years unemployed, 1.5 years of (professional) experience. I finally got a great job offer. It doesn't feel real. Wanted to share some good news, my story, and what helped",Effective_Clue_1099,cscareerquestions,"Background: Mid 2022 bootcamp grad. Got a job as a mostly frontend developer for 65k. Was there for \~1.5 years, after our big project, they laid off about 1/4 of the company.Just had an 8 round interview process, I thought there wasn't a chance. Got the call, they said it was an easy decision for them and I signed the offer for 115k today. I'm over the moon.So what worked / didn't workApplying:Had 3 referrals, none turned into interviews. I think the value of referrals have gone down dramatically in the last couple of years and that a lot of companies stopped giving referral bonusesI didn't get a single entry / jr level interview. I think the no cs degree hurt for those roles, so many say 1-2 YoE so I thought I was a shoo-in, nahMy success rate fell sharply after 6 months unemployment. Success rate improved dramatically (only for mobile positions) after publishing a personal project (this was about a year into unemployment, I had a single interview in months 6-12 and it didn't go past hiring manager)No interviews from linkedIn job apps, despite targeting same day postingsgot 2 interviews from hiringcafe and an ai auto fill extension (simplify)I went in-person and dropped off a resume to two local companies that I saw had openings. One gave me an interview (50% success rate, you were right Grandpa)The mobile position I got, came from linkedIn. I stumbled across the tech lead of a local company posting about the opening, there was no linkedIn job posting. I messaged him about my app and he said he tried it out, liked it and wanted to interview me.I think the other 2 or 3 came from hackernews, again, where I was talking directly to somebody technical about my app.I tried linkedin premium and messaged a ton of hiring managers / recruiters, nothing came from thoseI had 6 or 7 interviews in the last year and a half, all above my last role. Was definitely unprepared for the first few, feel I went from jr. to mid level while unemployed.But yeah, highest success rate was finding local companies and contacting somebody who was technical (and part of the hiring process) about what I was working on Technical Interviews: I was grinding leetcode for a bit but found it not to be worth while (past getting comfortable with mapping and array, obj, string manipulation). I did have some coding challenges but they weren't leetcode mediums or hards, either can you fetch data, format / display / style it or a leetcode easy to see if you can code (though I didn't interview at major companies). I did have two system designs interviews earlier on that I wasn't prepared for. And one later on that I knew was coming and spent a week cramming for. Did really well in that and moved to final round but didn't get job. My recent interview didn't have a strictly system design round but a lot of topics I had studied did come up in conversation and I'm glad I was able to talk on themAnother thing that was a huge help was I was MUCH less stressed about the recent interview. I thought I wasn't going to get it, was working as a bartender so had money coming in, might as well see where it goes and try to learn something. Most of the interviews I had when I was deep into unemployment, I would get 2-4 hours of sleep the night before because I was so stressed. Somehow, the night before this company's technical, I had planned on doing leetcode all night but I was strangely tired, thought I wasn't going to get the job anyways and didn't want to waste my night off doing coding problems. I ended up conking out hard way earlier than I typically go to bed and had the best nights rest I've had in two years. I truly don't know how it aligned that way but being well rested was way more valuable than a couple more leetcode problemsBehavioral interviews:The 3 companies I interviewed with - post releasing my app - were much more interested in my app than my previous role. They were all for mobile positions.I also started keeping an interview prep journal that had 6 star stories (and what questions they could be used in) as well as all other questions I've been asked in interviews (and had a separate tab for system design notes)I would often get a ""how's your week going"" question at the start of interviews. Early into unemployment, I thought, 'I don't want to waste their time', and just say something like, 'It's been a good week, have been looking forward to this interview.' and let them jump into it from there. After it happened a few times I realize they want to see if they can have an actual, casual conversation with you. So in these last few interviews, I always made a point to spend literally a minute, 2 max, chatting. Just something like an event that weekend I was excited for. The recent interview the guy had mentioned having a kid, the next interview I asked what his kid was dressing as for HalloweenThe other thing that was a big help was the CEO really liked me. I really didn't understand the company's industry, so I spent a couple of hours with ai learning about it, making sure I knew some basic terminology, read articles about the company, and had actual, non fluff questions, about the company and the industry for the CEO. In the middle he mentioned being surprised by the questions65k -> \~27/hour -> 115k Again, absolutely over the moon. Very excited, will be working hard to make sure I continue to grow and never go through such a grueling unemployment periodTl;dr Try talking to technical people directly. Look local. Have some system design knowledge. Build something with users. Be well rested and sociable. Be able to talk about the company, past being a developer.

I'm making 200k, I have health insurance, my boss is nice, and yet still I may have just completely fucked it up.Basically, here's the situation: I'm on a small team with just me and my boss. We use an in-house office software with a built-in chat and email, but 99% of the time we just use the chat or talk face-to-face.However, the office software sucks. If you don't use it for an hour, it disconnects without any notification. While you're disconnected, chat messages get sent to email, and don't display in chat when you log back on. The home page displays new email notifications, but only some of them, not all of them. I thought it only filtered automated messages, but I was VERY wrong.This week my boss was on a business trip. He was still working in my timezone though so we could talk. I was waiting for some details in the chat, but either I was logged off or he just emailed it directly. Either way, no notification.The day after he sent it, I had a day off I scheduled in advance. While I was out, he forgot I had off and sent me an email. Same thing, no notification.Two days later, I got a message from him. While he'd remembered I had a day off, he was still extremely pissed that I hadn't seen his emails. He said it was the bare minimum act of communicationAdmittedly, it feels like he'd be right at most other companies, but we'd always used other means of communication.

The job is stable, unionized, slower paced, and has a predictable schedule. The work looks more enterprise/ERP-focused and nowhere near as chaotic as big tech.My concerns are:Whether I’m actually ready for a Principal role: I’ve operated at a mid-to-senior IC level, but I haven’t formally held a Principal title before. I’m worried about stepping into Principal-level expectations in a new domain and whether I’ll be able to perform at the level the role requires.Getting pigeonholed: Government IT tends to have slower-moving tech and more specialized enterprise systems. I’m concerned that if I spend years there, my skills might narrow and limit future private-sector options.Long-term compensation ceiling: Government positions have fixed salary steps and a hard cap. Once you hit the top step, raises are basically cost-of-living adjustments.

1p5yfr3,Senior dev doing first real job hunt...Advice?,cyber1551,cscareerquestions,"I’m about to enter the job market for the first time, and it feels weird because I’ve never actually done a real job hunt before. The funny part? I'm not even entry level.For context, I’m a senior full-stack engineer with \~7 years at a Fortune 200 company. I got incredibly lucky with an internship that converted to full-time, so I've never interviewed anywhere lol (the internship didn't have a traditional interview process. I didn't even answer a single technical question.)Required to be in another state by fall 2026, which means I need to start looking ASAP. Problem is...I'm in my late 20s and have literally zero job hunting experience.* **My first question:** How important are portfolio projects for senior-level roles? I've got a few (including a personal site) and I'm working on wrapping up a bigger Rust project, but I'm worried I'm just wasting my time if employers don't actually care about this stuff outside of entry-level.I'm also worried staying at one company for 7 years might've hurt me. I'm significantly underpaid for my experience and degree (MS in CS + certs) right now, and I'm paranoid that long tenure looks like I'm either stuck or coasting. I keep hearing conflicting takes: some say it's a red flag for stagnation, others say it doesn't matter.* **My second question:** Anyone know how this actually plays out in the job market? I'm pretty ignorant about this stuff. Can't change it now, but good to know for the future.**TDLR:** What should a senior dev actually focus on when entering the market for the first time?

I was tested on designing UI's for semiconductor (switches, data center etc) data visualization, as well as javascript fundamentals. I initially asked, wouldn't you want a graphic designer since bulk of the work is UI/UX design? but they said no, they could never understand the technicals of FE dev nor EE. they wanted someone who knew UI/UX design, FE, AND EE. So i was a unique fit for the role.**Stats:**\-TC: Years 1-4: 248k -> 276k -> 303k -> 330k (Includes estimate of guaranteed refreshers)\-High level role with mostly design + telling other devs what to create, less coding\-4 days a week, 30mi commute 10AM-2:30PM, avoids traffic, 45mins.

Told recruiter my background in FE dev, not a pro UIUX designer but i know the concepts and i work with them. Said he'll get back to me and the next week they want me for a GIGA HARDCORE FINAL ROUND with 6 directors/vps/staff engineers. 6 1:1's PLUS a presentation to all 6.Oh my god I’ve never got grilled on UX design this hard in my life. One of the directors (PhD from MIT) asked me: Say aliens are invading earth. You need to design a control panel for a missile defense system that is user friendly to the operators. Button? Console; command line etc? What’s the design like, how about communication? How do u communicate to others, alarm system? Should there be a mute button? If the operator is in a hurry and needs split second decision how do u ensure the cleanest UI design? Security?Another director (ex-AWS) asked: Say u have a data center with servers and switches that transmit data, but data can be failed / low quality / bad transmission, design a gui for this.VP asked me: Say there’s a bar graph. X axis is quality and Y is number of items. Title of graph is “amount of items of various qualities over the past 24 hours”. Now, we don’t like this presentation and instead want the X axis to be time. But we still want to show the data for quality/# , so we’re adding another data point. How do we display the graph now?Staff FE dev grilled me on js fundamentals such as closures and promises. I fumbled on a few questions but managed to get most, explaining thought process.Crazy interviews, hiring manager told me as a closing thought ""This position is challenging to fill"" and i had that thought RACING in my head 24/7. what could it mean? Did he like me and i'm a contender? Or did it mean ""this is a tough role to pass""; i asked chatGPT and it said ""THIS IS A HUGE GREEN SIGNAL"" i was like lolwut really? ok then!Week later recruiter emails me ""I wanted to connect with you regarding feedback and next steps"" im like NEXT STEPS?? GG? lets fkin goooooooooo. and boom offer.Craziest part is i couldn't prepare for these UI questions, came leftfield, i just winged it and somehow i had enough intuition to pass them. Recruiter told me many candidates were able to pass coding, but struggled/froze on the Design Mission Control System design question. I guess i have some semblance of talent in UI design?\----Some FE coding questions I had this year:**Discord -** tech screen - failedCreate a UI for a formula parser that has fields a, b, c. You can type numbers in the field and the output of the fields would be those numbers, but you can also type letters in the fields and they would add up the numbers stored. For example in field A if you type 3 the output of field A is 3. Then if you type A in field B the output of B is 3. In field C if you type in AB you get 6 (3+3) the reqs were so ambiguous so it took me awhile to understand the problem. NO AI, write on own IDE with screenshare.**Crunchyroll** \- tech screen - passedCreate a react app that renders a collection of anime titles and its image, from json data;for(var i=0; i<5; i++) setTimeOut console.log(i) ""trick"" question whats the output and why?**Crunchyroll -** final coding round - failedPolyfill the ""getElementsByClassName"" function.

1p44v6y,Embedded Software - Qualcomm vs Meta,Master10113,cscareerquestions,"I am currently working within the embedded space and was fortunate to receive what I think are 2 great opportunities:* Qualcomm - working on low-level firmware for their SoC* Reality Labs (Meta) - working on firmware for their ray-bansI'm a bit torn between the based on several factors, and I was hoping to gain insight from people here. I currently have \~4 YOE and am a US citizen (I know this helps when evaluating risk)1. **Work** \- Both companies have what I think are interesting work. I put embedded-specific details here for those are interested, but they both feel equally cool - [Embedded Software vs Board Support Package : r/embedded](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1p44co2/embedded_software_vs_board_support_package/). Meta would be more high-level / specific product work while Qualcomm is a more general role where the work will touch many of their products across their portfolio. This makes me wonder if working on a niche application like AR glasses would be better/worse for long-term career development2. **Location** \- Meta would have to be in Sunnyvale while Qualcomm is in San Diego. I currently live in SoCal so I would have a preference to stay here, but I can't deny that there seem to be more opportunities in NorCal. Nonetheless taking Meta would require moving / establishing things in a new location3. **Culture** \- I've been hearing bad things about Meta / Reality Labs, but I'm not sure how true they are since I've been relying on anecdotes from Blind (which is admittedly a negative community). I'm sure Qualcomm has its own pitfalls (e.g. offshoring), but I haven't heard of anything to the severity of Meta's current reputation with stacked ranking and PIPs4. **Compensation** \- Both roles are pretty accurate to their grades on levels.fyi. Qualcomm would be a senior engineer role in San Diego while Meta would be E4 role in SunnyvaleAny advice would be appreciated. I know having the brand name of Meta on a resume does wonders for a career, but I want to make sure I have as complete of a picture as I can.Edit: since there was some interest in the comments:* Meta (Sunnyvale) - 193k + 100k RSU/year + 35k sign on* Qualcomm (San Diego) - 147k + 43k RSU/year + 35k sign on",56,0.86,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p44v6y/embedded_software_qualcomm_vs_meta/,2025-11-22 21:33:43,2025-11-29 01:39:16

1p3o0dc,"When is it worth leaving a super comfortable and ""easy"" 4-day WFH job?",NigoDuppy,cscareerquestions,"So I’m trying to figure out when a salary increase actually justifies giving up a very comfortable setup. I officially have a 5-day/week job, but because my manager and I work remotely and are in different countries with different weekends, I’ve effectively been working 4 days a week for the last 1.5 years with a 3-day weekend. The work is simple, mostly Power BI dashboards and Power Automate flows for upper management, with nothing deeply technical or challenging. The problem is that the job is *too* comfortable. I’m not learning much, and I worry that future cost-cutting (I work in corporate) or AI could replace me since the work is so basic.Because I essentially work 4 days (32 hrs/week), my hourly rate is higher than it would be in a typical 5-day (40 hrs/week) job. For example, if I took a job with a 50% salary increase for a 5-day schedule, it would end up being only about a 20% increase in hourly pay after adjusting for the extra day and hours I would work. So I’m stuck asking myself if a 20–25% hourly increase really worth giving up a 4-day WFH lifestyle?I’m a CS graduate, but I ended up in this role because the job posting was labeled as Software Engineer. It turns out the only real engineering work was rewriting a legacy system using the Power Platform. After that, it turned into pure dashboards and Power Automate flows on the business side because my manager believed upper management liked fancy, colorful reports that were tangible and made their lives easier.Before this job, I was studying AWS, Terraform Linux, and getting into Kubernetes, but I haven’t touched any of that in a year, and I feel like I’m falling behind. If I stay in comfort, I risk stagnating, but at the same time I don’t really know where I can go from here, or what percentage increase in salary or hourly rate is worth leaving this job. Also, my company is a large corporate, and one of my goals is to work abroad. I checked their internal positions offering relocation, and almost all of them are either pure engineering or management roles. I don’t think it’s realistic for me to apply to any of these in my current position unless I sharpen my engineering skills, as management is still a pipe dream given that I’m still junior with only about 2 years of total experience.So essentially my questions boil down to:1. What kind of pay increase would make you give up a 4-day WFH job? Is 20% hourly increase enough? That’s already roughly a 50% increase in total salary.2. Should I pivot to a technical path like cloud infra/DevOps, which I plan to study over the next 6 months, or is there a well-paid path using my current skills? Would transitioning to data engineering instead be a better?

1p5ajn9,CS bachelor vs. CS Masters without CS bachelors,ButtercreamVanilla,cscareerquestions,"I'm Canadian. I have a BSc in Psychology. This is my first time posting in a CS subreddit so please let me know if this is not the right place for this question.I've been thinking of switching into CS and finally decided to apply to schools with lots of Co-op opportunities. So far I've applied to bachelor's in UToronto (waiting), Waterloo (i may not meet eligibility requirements as a graduate), UBC (waiting; 20-month 2nd degree program) and UOttawa (got in). I prefer getting another bachelors since the schools I've picked comes with a good (rigorous) curriculum and a very good selection of co-op options as well as decent hiring rates post-studies. I want a strong, guided foundation even though I've done a little bit of everything by myself out of curiosity and interest (C++ in university courses, Python in high school, JS, html, CSS, AI/ML, Data Science). However my parents think it would be better to get a CS masters directly instead of ""wasting time"" doing another bachelors. The problem is well-reputed schools in Canada don't seem to offer masters without cs or related undergrad. The schools that do offer this option seems pointless to me because the market is already saturated and I feel like I would just be doing it for the sake of having just any CS related education. Plus they don't seem to offer any of the benefits that bachelors does (Co-op for eg). Clearly I'm biased towards doing a bachelors but I don't want to be close minded. I wanna know if I should consider masters as an actual option right away. My main focus is that my education shouldn't look like a drawback to potential employers, and there should be a better chance of employment. (Also I've read multiple times that strong portfolio and CS-based projects makes you a good candidate and that you don't need formal education but I honestly don't think I can be impressive enough pull that off. I'm willing to put in the work but I also need some structured learning before I can build my portfolio. Plus CS degree is a part of the mandatory requirements for a lot of job listings that I see so I don't want to be ineligible or automatically screened out for good opportunities)So what should I do? CS Masters without Bachelors or CS bachelors. **TLDR**; Are the chances of landing a job with a CS masters without CS bachelors the same as having a CS bachelors? I know landing a job in general would be hard but which offers me a better chance?",27,0.94,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p5ajn9/cs_bachelor_vs_cs_masters_without_cs_bachelors/,2025-11-24 07:12:08,2025-11-29 01:39:16

1p6qwgs,Job search experience [8 YoE],Strict_Homework5182,cscareerquestions,">I posted this in ExperiencedDevs, but figured I'd share it here too incase it can help anyone or the data point is useful.I think everyone knows the hiring market is pretty crazy right now, so I thought I'd share my results from the last few months in case anyone might find it useful.Some background, I'm a fullstack engineer with around 8 YoE, living in a MCOLish area, not in any tech hub. I casually searched for around 5-6 months, really only applying to things that looked interesting, or any interesting recruiter reach out.My Results:[https://i.imgur.com/gjJvgQ5.png](https://i.imgur.com/gjJvgQ5.png)*Note: these are a bit general numbers. This happened over a few months, so might be +/- one or two things I forgot about*In general, I was pretty selective. I had a few dozen recruiter's message me, but only took 10 or so calls. Most were from in office startups that I had no interest in, or non tech companies which I wasn't really interested in.Some notes on my search\- I make around 220k base at my current position, so any job needed to match that number (TC-wise anyway) \- I preferred remote, but for large public tech companies, was open to moving. But any startup needed to be remote (Unless something like OpenAI, etc, which of course didn't happen) \- Needed to be at least a tech forward company \- I only responded to first party recruiters \- I refuse to do take-home assessments \- I didn't do any interview prep for any of these, so my failure rate was a bit high\--In terms of general hiring vibes, I'd say the biggest difference was in the recruiter/HM screens, much more selective there, probably due to how easy it is to AI generate a reasonable looking resume now. I've pretty much never been rejected at that stage, but did end up getting rejected a couple times from HM's after the recruiter screens.Likewise, a few companies also wanted to do take home assessments before even going to the normal techs screens. I immediately dropped out from those (I hate take homes personally)Other than that, the general feeling was pretty similar from other times I've been on the market.",22,0.83,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p6qwgs/job_search_experience_8_yoe/,2025-11-25 22:39:58,2025-11-29 01:39:16

He said it was a false positive but I had stated why it wasn’t and why it would be good to remediate the issue (although it was just in a staging environment and cloud development is not his expertise but he has done quite a bit of work with it). From reading the official documentation it is recommended to do what I said to do but I am a bit worried that I would’ve have come across as a know it all (and I’d rather not make any enemies as I started just 4 months ago) usually I would’ve left it but it’s work I’m really interested in doing so I decided to defend it.I was just wondering wether that was the right thing to do, the actual security risk probably won’t be that high but it is definitely not a false positive but I would also rather not be seen as arrogant by everyone else which I feel like is the case because they’ve know him for years and me a few months.",22,0.93,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p807h5/dealing_with_technical_disagreements_at_work/,2025-11-27 11:43:44,2025-11-29 01:39:16

1p914ke,What Market Comp Means,SuhDudeGoBlue,cscareerquestions,"I've been pretty active on both sides of the hiring/interviewing gauntlet for the last few months, and just wanted to share the following thoughts on what I believe are some huge misconceptions around compensation (that candidates, recruiters, companies, and other have).1. Engineers are not commodities. We are non-fungible and there are HUGE differences in the amount of value we can bring, even when you try to classify us into strata like junior, middle, senior, staff, etc. Engineers are more like real estate. There can be huge differences in pricing for a 1500 sqft abode, depending on factors like location, build, amenities, etc.2. Not every company can make the same use of a talented engineer. Just because you are worth $500k at Citadel does not mean Walgreens can realistically get as much value out of you.These 2 realities result in interesting dynamics, where one company may pay their junior engineers more than another company on the same street pays their principal engineers. Both may be acting rationally. It also results in some interesting dynamics where a junior engineer may thumb their nose at opportunities that may be a huge step up in title and responsibilities, and they are acting rationally too.3. The above should make you question the concept of ""market pay"". It is not a meaningful measure. However, if you want to use it, do not use job posting data to figure out ""market pay"". A job posting is an \*unfilled\* role. There are 2 good sources of ""market pay"". 1. Current pay of employed engineers in a similar role and setting. and 2. Recent offers that are accepted by engineers for a similar role and setting. The latter is a better/more effective measure for evaluating a new role as a candidate / determining how to budget for a role you are trying to hire for.",19,0.91,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p914ke/what_market_comp_means/,2025-11-28 17:45:47,2025-11-29 01:39:16
1p6yuph,Been at my company for 8 years.. It now feels unsecure.. I feel like I only know how to work at my company though..,dj292,cscareerquestions,"A little backstory about myself..Prior to my job now I was working HVAC for about 6 years, to say the least I was miserable.. Hated my boss, hated just feeling like I wasn't doing any fulfilling, hated that someone said I was going to be a lifer.. Fast forward too 2018, I took the leap, after doing some code academy and attempting to teach myself the basics of code, I applied and was accepted to do a 12 week immersive web dev program in Boston (General Assembly). Right before going to this program, my girlfriend at the time was a dental hygienist, she was making small talk with a client and he mentioned he was a software engineer. She mentioned how i was going to be going to an immersive program in Boston, he gave her his number for me to contact him, i did, we met up for coffee and talked goals and web dev in general. Fast forward to the 10th week of my program, I get a call from that guy and he asked if I wanted interview. I interviewed it was your typical interview but I feel like they were pretty relaxed about it because they knew how green I was. I mean shit, i'm pretty sure the tech challenge they let me use my own personal project I developed through the program.. Anyways they hired me probably believing they could mold me into what they wanted, although there wasnt much molding, there was a lot of extremely late nights of me trying to figure things out because I knew absolutely NOTHING. Long story short there were grueling years of teaching myself a lot but also kind of only teaching myself stuff that would get me through a specific task. I feel like I never really took a step back and really dove into soft skills or design concepts or why you would use a certain pattern for certain scenarios..Now, 8 years later I'm still at my current company and over the past 3 my company as a whole does not feel secure. I've survived big layoffs, clients leaving, entire company not getting raises, etc. I have a family now, I own a house, and I need security.. I've had one job interview over the past year and I completely botched it. The technical interview I froze, it was plain javascript and I couldn't solve it.. I was so embarrassed and couldn't believe it. Now I feel like if it was nextjs and my companies codebase? I wouldn't have had any issues what so ever because i've been working here for so long and I feel like my knowledge of nextjs is very good but thats not going to cut it if I want a new job, which obviously I do with more security.. Just getting an interview almost seems impossible though, then I'm dreading the whole interview process because quite frankly I feel like my soft skills, tech terminology, and overall understanding of frontend development is lacking and I'm so used to my companies codebase I feel like im going to be a deer in headlights during an interview process.I just need some advice on how I should go about getting a new job, do I zoom out and go back to strengthening my soft skills of javascript, do I use some platforms like TheGreatFrontend? What are some concepts companies are absolutely looking for that I should either learn or freshen up on? Any advice would be helpful.

1p8azzg,Is this normal or am I the problem?,Theprocastinator213,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR at the bottom.I joined a start up about 8 months ago and it hasn’t been going well. I’ve been having a lot of trouble with different teams and the codebase, and I’m looking for an outside perspective on whether this is common or if I’m contributing to problem.Some background:-I have 3 YoE, mid level SWE, this is my first tech company. -The company has this product with multiple teams working on different parts of it.-My role requires me to work on the product in other team’s domain and set up integrations. -The company has about 500 employees and is doing quite well. From the start, I was having a difficult time working with the team that maintains the core code of the product since the manager on that team can be pretty aggressive and difficult to work with (not just my experience, have heard from multiple people about this). The code isn’t that great either, hard to reason about, plenty of side effects, hard to test, and PR reviews tend to focus on superficial code styling vs catching issues and forward thinking (another opinion shared by others). From what I see, there isn’t a big initiative to fix or improve things but rather keep patching on top of it, and a lot of people dislike that team’s work as they have to use it and deal with the problems.This has made it so that the features I have worked on have been quite messy and buggy, where I’m constantly at odds trying to do my work in the best way but constantly have to implement workarounds or just do more work outside of scope so it doesn’t completely break. I’m always waking up to messages to fix things or staying up late to debug (not just my work), there are features that have had the same bug for months that I haven’t been allowed to fix. I have started to slow down, constantly review my work, afraid that I’ll cause another issue and have to deal with 20 slack messages the next day. All of this has taken a toll on me where I’m regularly stressed and frustrated by what’s going on and what I’m doing.I used to be very excited but nowadays I’m quite drained by the experience, I don’t work on side projects anymore and have started to stop caring about what I work on. I understand that start ups have problems but I don’t mind usual start up problems, I’m used to working a lot and moving quickly. My manager is great and we talk often, he agrees that things are messed up and says I’m doing fine, but I certainly don’t feel that way. I’ve noticed that I have reverted back to a junior mindset of slowing down my pace, staying silent in meetings, and constantly checking in with my manager because I can’t trust the work I do to not fail, yet it still does.Is this a normal thing? I am very open to feedback and everyone I talk to says that I’m doing well and things are messy, but I seriously feel like I haven’t progressed in any way since I’ve started working here and have gotten worse.TL;DR: Mid-level SWE (3 YoE, first tech company) at a ~500-person startup, 8 months in. My work depends on a messy, hard-to-test codebase owned by a difficult manager, so my work ends up buggy, I’m constantly firefighting, and I’m losing confidence and motivation even though my own manager says I’m doing fine.

Earlier today I posted about feeling discouraged because it seems like, no matter how much I improve, AI will eventually do everything better and faster. The latest Anthropic model announcement pushed me further in that direction, especially after seeing developers say they barely write code now and reading some pretty dramatic predictions about software engineering not existing in a few years from actual Anthropic developers (yes I realize they stand to gain a ton by having people believing this, but I don't know if I have the luxury to hand wave it away).I am having a hard time seeing a long-term future in this field, which might be influenced by the fact that I am not currently working in it. Still, if I truly believe there is no future for me in this industry, then I need to plan for that possibility. Right now I am thinking that if I do not land a software job by summer 2026, I will go back to school for another engineering discipline, most likely power or mining.Until that point (maybe just so I can say that I tried, or because I want to feel less horrible about the student debt I accrued getting this degree), I'm gonna be grinding a ton, trying to land something. If that doesn't work out, then I'm likely gone for good from the industry at this time next year.I would appreciate any advice from people who have dealt with this kind of uncertainty or who have thoughts on whether setting a timeline like this makes sense.

My total compensation is around 115k at 24 years old, and I currently am 8 months on the job. I have 3 years of experience, working in a university position as a data engineer before this role for 2 years.So within the stack I'm using, it's mainly PL/SQL and T-SQL - which I guess is fine because that's what I'm using to access big data and work with our internal customers. I do ETL work and requests given by customers using SQL, and of course manage loads every month with on-call/production support.The pay is great and I also live at home with my parents, so I am indeed getting comfortable. I'm not in any relationship and I don't really wish to be at all any time soon. The only thing I'm wondering though is how badly I'm hindering my career by staying here skills wise. The data engineering space seems like it is changing a lot, and our tech in our current team doesn't use any of the new tech that's in the current climate.When I first entered this team, I was hoping to use a more modern tech stack, it looks like thought it's a bit limited to just Oracle. I'm fine with the work and I am learning everyday so I'm not complaining about what I have currently. But I do want to progress my career a bit more with more skills.

But I’m honestly feeling really worried about my performance. My manager never addressed any particular issues with my performance when we met 1:1 a few months ago (we never had a 1:1 since), but I was still worried. For every task I’ve been given so far, there’s a point where I don’t know what to do after I try figuring out myself and have to ask for help. I have been asked to give ETAs fore and can my very loose estimations were always less than how long it actually took to finish tasks since I barely know what I’m doing. There had also been an instance where I messed up the deployment for some of my changes, and my teammates had to help me rollback. One of the tasks I had been working on were supposed to be finished before this past week, but I couldn’t since the changes were more involved than I initially realized because of differences in the service between non-prod and prod (whereas it worked in non-prod where I had been testing prior). Teammates also had to step in again for that. I’ll even try reading through docs our team has to try to get a better sense of things, just for things to still not click. I know I’m supposed to properly ramp myself up within 2 more months, and I’m worried that I won’t be able to. There was a new task I was working on today, and once again, I got stuck on it and don’t know what to do. I was really hoping to make some progress during the weekend so I can finish it ASAP, but…I guess that isn’t happening anymore.At this point, I feel like I should probably cut my losses and focus more energy on getting a new position since people are saying that there’s another layoff in January, and I heard that my organization was going to be impacted. I don’t have any other ground of suspicion of getting laid off, but another intern I knew had gotten laid off during the first wave when he started a few months before me, and I’m one of the least experienced people on my team.

I have a Associates degree in game programming from one college and will have a standard CS Bachelors with a certificate in game from another college. So my questions for here is what is the interview processes like for these places?Do they do the standard leet code/coding assignments/oral tests or is it more portfolio based?Should I look for standard CS work while also looking for game work or just focus on one?How would my portfolio look to standard CS jobs? Would they like the passion or shy away because of its focus in games?I have a couple projects I have worked on through school and outside of school that I have in my current portfolio that I hope would make me stand out as a new grad in the field. So anyone with experience in the field id love to know your interview experiences and tips you could give me in it!I think it's also important to note that I plan to attend GDC this coming March to network and would love any tips you have for doing that as well!,7,0.89,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p6w8f6/different_side_of_the_industry/,2025-11-26 02:40:23,2025-11-29 01:39:16

What I am looking for, is a book for self-taught programmers like myself, to cover some of the more glaring blank spots, that would also give enough fundamental knowledge so that I can later dive deeper into any specific subject.Thanks for reading and your help.",5,0.7,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p66abh/need_help_picking_a_book_on_fundamental_computer/,2025-11-25 07:27:40,2025-11-29 01:39:16

1p8o8ad,How should I expect to fare with years of industry experience but no CS experience?,throwawayacct56655,cscareerquestions,"Apologies if this has been asked recently but I’m wondering if anyone else here has had a similar trajectory and what their experience was like.I have about 3 years of experience in network engineering prior to my current position of 4 years as an escalation engineer at Microsoft working primarily in container technologies (basically anything relating to k8s: container deployment, orchestration, dev ops, etc).Currently about halfway through a CS degree at Berkeley that I’m doing on the side (yes it’s obscenely difficult to manage my time but I’m making do) and I am wondering how someone like me would rank relative to others with more direct SWE experience given that I have substantial industry experience just not directly focused on software. I’ve done a lot with automation and generally including software development in my position but I’m still limited just based on my core job responsibilities.It would be great to not have to restart at a base position level since that would likely end up as a pay cut compared to my current comp, but I’m not sure how realistic that is.",5,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p8o8ad/how_should_i_expect_to_fare_with_years_of/,2025-11-28 06:51:24,2025-11-29 01:39:16
1p7j48t,Asking to do background check earlier/unpaid internships.,KaraWSR,cscareerquestions,"I recently signed an internship offer from my dream company, but I was told the background check and subsequent formal onboarding process will be sent in March of 2026. It's not like there's anything false my resume or anything, but my previous internships are both unpaid, and the anxiety of potentially lacking verification has been eating away at me, idk if I could deal with this feeling until March. I asked my recruiter if I could do the background check earlier, and haven't received a response. Idk if asking this question made me sound sus or smth.I received another offer at a well known company today, and I was wondering if it's a terrible idea to go accept this offer, then renege it once I make it through my first company's bg check.",3,0.68,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p7j48t/asking_to_do_background_check_earlierunpaid/,2025-11-26 20:51:04,2025-11-29 01:39:16

1p559cg,Should I keep learning or move on?,WonderfulWafer627,cscareerquestions,"I’m 15, and I’ve been into tech and programming since I was a kid. I started with making small games in Godot, but I was just following tutorials step by step, and it felt like I wasn’t actually creating anything myself. That made me lose motivation, so I stopped.Later, I got back into learning again and tried CS50. I watched the first two courses, but then I dropped it because I kept hearing people say the tech field is overcrowded and that learning to code isn’t worth it anymore.Now I’m a bit older, and I still like tech. I feel like if I put in the effort, I could actually get somewhere. But I’m also scared that after spending years learning and working on myself, it might not matter because so many people already know how to code and still struggle to find opportunities.So I’m stuck between continuing with tech or looking for something else.

1p8d1lk,Not going to graduate before starting job,Odd_Newspaper4416,cscareerquestions,"I’ve been interning with a company for around a year and a half now. Originally it was supposed to be only a year but I had to notify them that my graduation date for a Bachelor’s Degree was infact December of this year instead of earlier this year in May due to a bunch of my classes not transferring from my previous university.They took this information pretty well and understood my situation and actually sent me an offer in August of this year. I accepted it and I was excited, but this semester has been rough. I have an 11 month old (fyi they know this) and I also had to cram alot of hours in this semester because some weren’t available in the previous summer. I’m pretty much going to fail my Statistics class. I was so focused on my other CS classes and Statistics has always been hard for me to wrap my head around, so it was unintentionally put last with my attention. I always thought I could improve it, but even with a final exam coming up, I don’t think it’ll drastically improve my grade. I’m afraid my offer will be rescinded because of this and I’ve already set a start date weeks ago, as well as searched for an apartment and notifying my current apartment to break lease. What should I do? Do you think I could lose my internship as well? And how should I tell them this information as well as my family?",3,0.72,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p8d1lk/not_going_to_graduate_before_starting_job/,2025-11-27 21:05:29,2025-11-29 01:39:16
