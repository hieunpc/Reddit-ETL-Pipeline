1psvmt2,"Career pivot into data: I’m a ""Data Team of One"" in a company and I’m struggling to orient my role. Any advice?",Either-Exercise3600,dataengineering,"First of all: Hi everyone and thanks for taking the time to read my post.I completely changed careers and now I’m trying to understand where to “aim” long term.My background: I’m a humanities major who took a hard pivot. After a couple of years of self-teaching (programming, SQL, data fundamentals) and some freelancing, I landed a role about a year ago in a large company (hundreds of millions in revenue).When I joined, there was zero data culture. No team, no processes, just a lot of manual work and fragmented info. My official title is ""Data Manager"", but since I’m building the function from scratch, I’ve been doing a bit of everything:* Automation & ETL: Writing Python scripts and using Power Automate to kill manual tasks.* Infrastructure: Designing and building business-oriented databases from the ground up.* BI/Visualization: Creating the first actual dashboards.* Optimization: Cleaning up the ""Excel Wild West"" and setting common data policies.My question: Imposter syndrome aside, I’m struggling to map this experience to the actual market. I love the ""ideation"" and architecture part—designing the pipelines, thinking through the data flows, and making things work automatically. But I sometimes worry I’m doing a lot of useful things, but not building a clean and recognizable profile.\- What term would you use to describe this type of role? I'm not sure if I'm closer to data engineering or analytics...\- Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?\- What would you discover next if you were in my shoes? I want to switch from band-aid solutions to more reliable, scalable procedures. At this point, what would you learn first: DBT, cloud architecture, orchestration tools like Airflow, or something else?My current stack is Python, SQL, Power BI, Power Automate, and some legacy VBA.I genuinely love this job—it's a world away from my previous life in humanities—but I want to make sure I’m steering the ship in the right direction.

1pr9fxu,Snowflake Openflow a bittersweet experience soo far,Defiant_Month_497,dataengineering,"Just wanted to share my experience with Snowflake Openflow. The client i work for relies heavily on CDC replication for their data ingestion to snowflake. We mainly bring in data from SQL server and oracle database to our snowflake data lake.Our client is using many different ETL tools mainly Firvetran's HVR, IICS and AWS DMS and in some cases snowpipe when they want to ingest data from s3 to snowflake. When snowflake announced openflow which supports CDC replication we were excited. Out of the box it was supporting SQL Server CDC replication and Oracle connector was soon to be released. We were very excited as our client wanted to move away from IICS and HVR due to licensing costs. We immediately started working on a POC when the openflow was available in private preview.POC Area: - CDC based replication from SQL Server to snowflake. Its fairly very easy to setup the connectors and start using it. We were able to configure the connectors and start ingesting the data within couple of hours and mind you none of us had used apache nifi before. Pros: - 1. easy to setup and use.2. Replication latency is pretty low. Plus it can be configured as well to fit your use case. Cons: - 1. Cannot configure target snowflake schema : - biggest downside we have found out yet. We were using the default workflow for SQL server CDC and there is no option to ingest the data into desired snowflake schema. By default Openflow is creating a schema in snowflake database with the source SQL Server schema name. We were pulling the data from SQL server schema ""DBO"" and Openflow was creating the same schema inside our snowflake database.We updated almost all the processors inside the workflow to use the custom schema name, for most part it worked. we were able to create tables and journal tables etc inside our custom schema in snowflake. But there is one processor which merges journal tables to permanent table which was not supporting to use custom schema name. Somehow it was still using "".DBO"". DB name is configurable in this processor but not the schema name. We connected with the snowflake internal team regarding the same and the guy said they working on it after receiving complaints from lots of other clients. Later he suggested us to not configure/updated the workflow which comes with database connectors. If we do update it, it's gonna be considered as a custom workflow and it will be locked out of future updates.So, customizing the pipeline is out of the picture.2. Environment variables and JVM variables: - there is no one stop UI to manage all these variables inside the workflow. You need to navigate to each processor to manage these variables. 3. Error logs: - not a fan of how openflow manages error logs, its very janky to navigate and use. these were the stuff we found out in the last couple of weeks. We have stopped our POC midway due to con 1. And we and the client are totally dissappointed with how openflow is working as of now.",32,0.97,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pr9fxu/snowflake_openflow_a_bittersweet_experience_soo/,2025-12-20 08:20:56,2025-12-27 01:45:19

1prl5t5,(Mildly) hot takes about modern data engineering,ukmurmuk,dataengineering,"Some principles I have been thinking about productive modern data engineering culture, sharing this here to see different perspectives about my outlook.First, I want to begin by making an assertion that in this AI age, code production is a very cheap commodity. The expensive part is in reviewing & testing the code. But, as long as the pipelines are batch, the processing is not in a regulated environment, and the output is not directly affecting the core business, cost of mistakes are REALLY low. In most cases you can simply rerun the pipeline and replace the bad data, and if you design the pipeline well, processing cost should be very low.So, here are my principles:•⁠Unit tests and component-specific tests are worthless. It slows down development, and it doesn’t really check the true output (product of complex interactions of functions and input data). It adds friction when expanding/optimizing the pipeline. It’s better to do WAP (Write-Audit-Publish) patterns to catch issues in production and block the pipeline if the output is not within expectations rather than trying to catch them locally with tests. (edit: write your e2e tests, DQ checks, and schema contracts. Unit test coverage shouldn’t give you any excuse to not have the other three, and if having the other three nullifies the value of unit tests, then the unit tests are worthless) •⁠Dependencies has to be explicit. If table A is dependent on table B, this dependency has to be explicitly defined in orchestration layer to ensure that issue in table A blocks the pipeline and doesn’t propagate to table B. It might be alluring to separate the DAGs to avoid alerts or other human conveniences, but it’s not a reliable design. •⁠With defensive pipelines (comprehensive data quality check suites, defensive DAGs, etc), teams can churn out codes faster and ship features faster rather than wasting time adjusting unit tests/waiting for human reviews. Really, nowadays you can build something in 1 hour and wait 2-3 days for review. •⁠the biggest bottleneck in data engineering is not the labor of producing code, but the frictions of design/convention disagreements, arguments in code reviews, bad data modeling, and inefficient use of tables/pipelines. This phenomenon is inevitable when you have a big team, hence I argue in most cases, it’s more sensible to have a very lean data engineering team. I would even go further to the point that it makes more sense to have a single REALLY GOOD data engineer (that can communicate well with business, solid data modeling skills, deep technical expertise to design efficient storage/compute, etc) rather than hiring 5 “okay” data engineers. Even if this really good one costs 5x than the average one, it’s more worth the money: allowing faster shipping volume and better ROI.So, what do you think? Are these principles BS?",24,0.58,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1prl5t5/mildly_hot_takes_about_modern_data_engineering/,2025-12-20 18:29:24,2025-12-27 01:45:19

I need to calculate sliding windows as fast as possible in real time with historical data (from SQL tables) and new streaming data. How can this be achieved in less than 15 ms latency ideally? I tested Rising Wave's Continuous Query with Materialized Views but the fastest I could get it to run was like 50 ms latency. That latency includes from the moment the Kafka message was published to the moment when my business logic could consume the sliding window result made by Rising Wave. My application requires the results before proceeding.I tested Apache Flink a little and it seems like in order to get it to return the latest sliding window results in real time I need to build on top of standard Flink and I fear that if I implement that, it might just end up being even slower than Rising Wave.So I would like to ask you if you know what other tools I could try.

Or anything along those lines? I put a huge target on my back by simply asking the questions no one was willing to consider. As long as the the final metric looks positive it's going through get thumbs up without further review. It's like simply asking the question puts the responsibility back on the business and if we don't ask they can just point fingers. They're the only ones interfacing with management so of course they spin everything as the engineers fault when things go wrong. This is what bothers me the most, if anyone bothered to actually look the failure is painfully obvious. Now I simply push shit out with a smile and no one questions it.

I’m a data analyst working in-house in a smaller unit, I’m basically a power bi developer and admin for anything pbi related. Sometimes dabbling a bit in azure but no data pipeline work. I have been in this role for 1,5y and before this for 3 years I worked part time in more technical roles which included c#, git, azure devops, ssis, ssrs, qlik sense.I have been offered a position to move to our central analytics & bi team, they basically serve all the smaller units in our org (like the one I am in) and help with BI stuff. Not sure how many units there are but this is a large company with very regulated industries (like nuclear power). This role would introduce fabric to my daily tools and sql and python based on the conversation I had with the manager. The role listing also mentions that knowledge of etl/elt and ci/cd processes is required. But it also mentions on-prem gateways and fabric tenant admin.In addition to this, I have been offered a position at a very good consulting company. It’s a data engineer position but it starts with a 4 week bootcamp to get me going in the DE skills (they mention tools like dbt, databricks, snowflake, fabric, python, sql etc) and then I start with customer projects. The caveat is that I get a \~10% net pay cut. But they offer a ton of possibilities for growth, internal academies and they pay for certifications etc. I currently have none.I have to do my decision next week and I’m not sure what to choose. I know DE can open architect roles in the future but I have no idea what in-house fabric can do for me if I want to progress.

1pv9j7y,SevenDB : Reactive and Scalable Determininstically,shashanksati,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I've been building [SevenDB](https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB), for most of this year and I wanted to share what we’re working on and get genuine feedback from people who are interested in databases and distributed systems.*Sevendb is a distributed cache with pub/sub capabilities and configurable fsync.*# What problem we’re trying to solveA lot of modern applications need \*\*live data\*\*:* dashboards that should update instantly* tickers and feeds* systems reacting to rapidly changing stateToday, most systems handle this by **polling-** clients repeatedly asking the database “*has**this changed yet?*”. That wastes CPU, bandwidth, and introduces latency and complexity.Triggers do help a lot here , but as soon as multiple machine and low latency applications enter , they get diceyscaling databases horizontally introduces another set of problems:* nondeterministic behavior under failures* subtle bugs during retries, reconnects, crashes, and leader changes* difficulty reasoning about correctnessSevenDB is our attempt to tackle both of these issues together.# What SevenDB doesAt a high level, SevenDB is:**1. Reactive by design**Instead of clients polling, clients can \*subscribe\* to values or queries.When the underlying data changes, updates are pushed automatically.Think:\* “Tell me whenever this value changes” instead of ""polling every few milliseconds""This reduces wasted work(compute , network and even latency) and makes real-time systems simpler and cheaper to run.**2. Deterministic execution**The same sequence of logical operations always produces the same state.Why this matters:* crash recovery becomes predictable* retries don’t cause weird edge cases* multi-replica behavior stays consistent* bugs become reproducible instead of probabilistic nightmaresWe explicitly test determinism by running randomized workloads hundreds of times across scenarios like:* crash before send / after send* reconnects (OK, stale, invalid)* WAL rotation and pruning\* 3-node replica symmetry with electionsIf behavior diverges, that’s a bug.\*\*3. Raft-based replication\*\*We use Raft for consensus and replication, but layer deterministic execution on top so that replicas don’t just \*agree\*—they behave identically.The goal is to make distributed behavior boring and predictable.# Interesting partWe're an in-memory KV store , One of the fun challenges in SevenDB was making emissions fully deterministic. We do that by pushing them into the state machine itself. No async “surprises,” no node deciding to emit something on its own. If the Raft log commits the command, the state machine produces the exact same emission on every node. Determinism by construction.But this compromises speed significantly , so what we do to get the best of both worlds is:On the durability side: a SET is considered successful only after the Raft cluster commits it—meaning it’s replicated into the in-memory WAL buffers of a quorum. Not necessarily flushed to disk when the client sees “OK.”Why keep it like this? Because we’re taking a deliberate bet that plays extremely well in practice:• **Redundancy buys durability** In Raft mode, our real durability is replication. Once a command is in the memory of a majority, you can lose a minority of nodes and the data is still intact. The chance of most of your cluster dying before a disk flush happens is tiny in realistic deployments.• **Fsync is the throughput killer** Physical disk syncs (fsync) are orders slower than memory or network replication. Forcing the leader to fsync every write would tank performance. I prototyped batching and timed windows, and they helped—but not enough to justify making fsync part of the hot path. (There is a durable flag planned: if a client appends durable to a SET, it will wait for disk flush. Still experimental.)• **Disk issues shouldn’t stall a cluster** If one node's storage is slow or semi-dying, synchronous fsyncs would make the whole system crawl. By relying on quorum-memory replication, the cluster stays healthy as long as most nodes are healthy.So the tradeoff is small: yes, there’s a narrow window where a simultaneous majority crash could lose in-flight commands. But the payoff is huge: predictable performance, high availability, and a deterministic state machine where emissions behave exactly the same on every node.In distributed systems, you often bet on the failure mode you’re willing to accept.

1psmc5j,"Processing large Teams meeting transcripts as a local, deterministic batch job",AuditMind,dataengineering,"Teams meetings with transcription enabled. One hour of discussion quickly turns into 10k+ words of unstructured text.Extracting decisions, action items, and open questions manually doesn’t scale. The common approach is to push the full transcript into a large cloud model and hope for a usable summary.That approach breaks down for a few reasons.Large transcripts often exceed context windows. Even when they fit, you’re dependent on external infrastructure, which can be problematic for sensitive meetings. Most importantly, you lose determinism: the same input can produce different outputs.I ended up treating the transcript like any other batch-processing problem.Instead of processing the full text in one go, the transcript is handled incrementally:- split into manageable chunks- each chunk summarized independently using a stable structure- clean intermediate results written out- a final aggregation pass over those intermediates to produce the high-level summaryIn practical terms:- the model never sees the full transcript at once- context is controlled explicitly by the pipeline, not by a prompt window- intermediate structure is preserved instead of flattened- the final output is based on accumulated, cleaned data rather than raw textThis reframing changes the requirements completely.One interesting side effect of this approach was realizing that model size stopped being a deciding factor altogether. Once the task is constrained and the workflow is explicit, even relatively small models perform reliably enough for this kind of summarization.Once handled this way, transcript size stops being a concern. A small local model is sufficient, because it’s just one interchangeable component in a controlled pipeline. The value comes from explicit inputs, deterministic steps, and reproducible outputs, not from model size.This runs entirely locally on a modest machine, no GPU, no cloud services.I’m curious how others here approach large meeting transcripts or similar unstructured text when the goal is a clean, deterministic result rather than maximal model capability.",6,0.64,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1psmc5j/processing_large_teams_meeting_transcripts_as_a/,2025-12-22 01:04:53,2025-12-27 01:45:19

Then have a secondary glue job that reads new parquet files and writes them to Iceberg tables. This can be done every 2 mins? Can I setup something like a microbatch glue job approach here for this?

1prcg35,Overwriting day partitions in table when source and target timezones differ,Data-Panda,dataengineering,"Working on one of my first bigger data projects as a junior and I’m a bit stuck.The source system stores timestamps in CST (no DST); the target tables must be UTC.I extract data using a rolling 7–14 day window, filtered by a business date (midnight-to-midnight in CST) as these are essentially log tables. This is necessary because there’s no last-modified field in the source tables and yet records can be updated up to 7–14 days after creation.The target tables are partitioned by the business date, and I overwrite partitions on each run. This works in theory when extracting full days, but timezone conversion complicates things. When converting CST to UTC, some records shift into the next day, meaning a “full day” CST extract can become partial days in UTC, potentially overwriting partitions with incomplete data.I’m avoiding MERGE because there’s no reliable primary key and analysts want to keep duplicates (some are valid), so partition overwrites seem like the best option. Essentially I just want to clone the source tables into BigQuery.One idea is to extract data as UTC midnight-to-midnight, but the only apparent option in the source is extracting as GMT Monrovia (which I think maps to UTC). This is what I’m edging towards, but not sure if extracting data in a different timezone to what it’s natively stored as is a recommended approach?Can someone please sanity check my approach and let me know if it’s a bad idea, or if I’m missing anything?",4,0.84,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1prcg35/overwriting_day_partitions_in_table_when_source/,2025-12-20 11:40:52,2025-12-27 01:45:19

I’m currently on about £75k, I have no plans to move at the moment but with the job market things can change and tomorrow my company could decide I am no longer needed. I’d like to do what I can to be in a position where I could pivot if needed without taking too much of a hit salary wise.Obviously I’ve not given too much information, but can you give an idea of the skills I ought to prioritise, things to focus on etc based on the above and if possible given an idea as to how well versed I need to be with them. e.g. with AWS is it a case of simply using EKS, MKS and being able to write functional python code or does it need to be super performant.

I have already built a functional prototype using Google Anti-gravity based on a specific framework, but now I need to determine the absolute best stack to rebuild this for a robust, enterprise-grade production environment.​The Business Process ​Ingestion: The system receives a ZIP file containing complex unstructured audit evidence (PDFs, images, technical drawings, scanned hand-written notes).​Context Recognition: It identifies the applicable ISO standard (e.g., 9001, 27001) and any integrated schemes.​Dynamic Retrieval: It retrieves the specific Audit Protocols and SOPs for that exact standard from a knowledge base.​Multimodal Analysis Instead of using brittle OCR/Python text extraction scripts, I am leveraging Gemini 1.5/3 Pro’s multimodal capabilities to visually analyze the evidence, ""see"" the context, and cross-reference it against the ISO clauses.​Output Generation: The agent must perfectly fill out a rigid, complex compliance checklist (Excel/JSON) and flag specific non-conformities for the human auditor to review.​The Challenge:The prototype proves the logic works, but moving from a notebook environment to a production system that processes massive files without crashing is a different beast.​My Questions for the Community​Orchestration & State: For a workflow this heavy (long-running processes, handling large ZIPs, multiple reasoning steps per document), what architecture do you swear by to manage state and handle retries? I need something that won't fail if an API hangs for 30 seconds.​Structured Integrity: The output checklists must be 100% syntactically correct to map into legacy Excel files. What is the current ""gold standard"" approach for forcing strictly formatted schemas from multimodal LLM inputs without degrading the reasoning quality?​RAG Strategy for Compliance: ISO standards are hierarchical and cross-referenced.

Seeing as I would have no mentor (I am the only analyst there and the only person there to even know what data warehousing and dimensional modeling is), what I ideally want is a course that will inform me on best practices and any tradeoffs and edge cases I should consider.

The idea is that some of our operators should be able to check things like how much revenue they’ve generated this month, how many clients they’ve converted, etc.As you can imagine, we’re currently discussing the best way to bring Data Warehouse data back into the app. So far, for our first use case, we’ve built a data microservice that queries tables containing the KPIs. In this setup, the Data Warehouse almost acts like an API, providing the data that the dev team can then display on the frontend with full control over colors, layout, and whatever custom UX our designers come up with.However, looking ahead, we plan to add many more charts to the product. This made me wonder whether there are already solid embedded analytics tools that allow a high level of customization so the look and feel can match our app’s design patterns. On top of that, it seems much easier for a data team to develop and test a dashboard and then embed or share it inside the app, rather than producing multiple KPI tables and wiring all of that through the app’s backend.I’d be interested to hear how others have approached this and what tools or architectures have worked well for you.",2,0.67,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ptbosv/bringing_charts_into_the_product_data_warehouse/,2025-12-22 21:35:34,2025-12-27 01:45:19

(even had to resort to manually reformatting everything to fix it up, which was quite time consuming)Fast forward a few months later, we got into contact with Definite App, and they literally fixed and setup everything from the ground up for us, connectors, pipelines, data formatting and redoing almost all of our dashboard on their platform.So currently we are outsourcing most of out data work to their team just to make sure everything's running as it should, not sure if we might continue doing this but so far it's been a great experience working with them.Have a nice day y'all! :)",0,0.17,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pr8vaa/how_definiteapp_fixed_our_data_problem/,2025-12-20 07:44:33,2025-12-27 01:45:19

I assumed the career path was basically just moving from junior to senior backend roles, building APIs and scaling web services. It felt like the industry was 90% CRUD apps and centered around the same few ""cliché"" frontend and backend frameworks.Recently, I started looking into Quant Finance, and it has been a total eye-opener. It is a completely different world where the problems aren't about HTTP requests or CSS; they are about high-frequency execution, mathematical modeling, and processing massive amounts of data in real-time. It made me realize how many deep technical niches we completely ignore because they aren't as ""loud"" as web development.I wanted to share this because if you are starting to feel a bit burnt out or bored with standard web stacks, I really encourage you to look at these non-obvious fields. Whether it is Quant, Embedded Systems, or Bio-informatics, there are rabbit holes out there that are way more technically challenging than the standard paths.

Felt that I got in by sheer luck. Academically, I’m not smart. I was generally a B-student back in CS college. But I did enjoy SWE mods like networks, distributed systems, or even learning algorithms. Over the past 3 years, my job has been rather chill and I don’t read outside of work. I didn’t learn much while doing frontend for 2 years - my code looks more or less the same because frontend frameworks are very abstracted at my company.Now that I’m in my 3rd year without promotion, I’ve been looking for jobs. I’m terrible at Leetcode, not good at systems design, my problem-solving skills aren’t great either so I’ve been failing interviews here and there. Sometimes I get frontend interviews, which will test JavaScript or React or even HTML/CSS, where each language/framework has a lot of concepts to learn about. I feel that there’s endless to study for and I’m fighting against a bar that is high but I can’t even see where it is.It’s been demoralising. I’ve moved into a backend team and I’m struggling hard. I have a difficult time grasping backend concepts, navigating backend code and understanding architectural designs. I’m lost 70% of the time during my team’s discussions. Everyone else is more senior than me, but they seem to know way more - it feels like that probably knew more than me when they were at 3 YOE. I have a difficult time visualising architectures or technical things when they’re discussing. I learn better when I dive into the code to build something. But it is inherently poor practise to dive into coding without understanding the requirements or the architecture or code itself, which causes me issues down the road. I think my lack of knowledge shows when I implement without understanding the full picture, but I have a difficult time following discussions.As an engineer, I only like to code. I like it when requirements are clear. I don’t like the ambiguity of having to dig around and define the requirements or scoping problems. I only like to build stuff and see my product coming to life and working.I think I should be studying harder for Leetcode, Systems design, and read more on whatever frameworks I’m using.

While this is valuable experience, I don’t really get the opportunity to deeply learn or reflect on the underlying concepts and mechanics of the web. The problem I see here is that there are things I dont even know about and I would I need a good overview about the things that they even exist, like a book for example. Of course, I could just google individual topics, but the problem is that I don’t always know *what* I should even be googling. That’s why a well-structured roadmap, book, or resource where the relevant information is collected and explained in a coherent way would be extremely helpful.Because of that, I want to be very clear: I’m **not** looking for tutorials on JavaScript, CSS, HTML syntax, or how to use frameworks like React, Vue, etc. I already work with those technologies on a daily basis.What I’m interested in are topics like:* Authentication & authorization (sessions, tokens, OAuth, etc.)* Cookies, storage, and state management* Caching strategies (browser, CDN, server-side)* HTTP fundamentals and request/response lifecycle* Security concepts (CORS, CSP, CSRF, XSS, same-origin policy)* How browsers and servers actually interact* General web architecture and system design conceptsI want to better understand *why* things work the way they do, not just *how* to implement them in a specific stack.If you know any resources that explain these concepts well (beginner-friendly but not superficial is ideal), I’d really appreciate your recommendations.Thanks in advance!",21,0.96,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pra5ih/looking_for_learning_resources_about_web/,2025-12-20 09:07:32,2025-12-27 01:45:19

What I've found looking at a lot C++ vs Python first questions on this reddit is that, Python makes it easier to pick up programming in general, but if you're willing to take the harder start then it's way more beneficial to your long term understanding of coding to learn C/C++ first because your brain solidifies good traits that are really hard to relearn from python.If any one has any comments on this specific parity that'd be cool. The formatting of Python also seems to be a cheat that isn't as healthy as having your base reference in C/C++'s symbolic referencing over indentation.My real question because it does seem C style is better for long term than python first and I intend to learn both, is it best to learn C or C++? It appears C and Python are around the same learning time and C++ is way longer than learning C. Should I do C first then Python to get the benefits of understanding C style code with Python's greater utility and universal usage, or should I tough it out and do C++ , which I guess is extended C, then Python? So essentially my perspective is C is much shorter and faster to learn, but C++ has much more use case, despite the fact they both equally prime you for more ""close to the metal"" thought than high abstract languages like python, what's more worth it first?Thank youTLDR; I think the first impression and perspective solidifying advantages of C and C++ beats the ease of introduction with Python for first language, thoughts?

1pu7i8v,"Understanding variable types in regards to pointers and addresses, C++",spunky_crunk,learnprogramming,"I'm trying to understand why I can pass arrays into functions by declaring a pointer parameter. I've done this several times to pass arrays of different lengths into general purpose functions (along with their lengths) for software that I've written, but although I thought I had a grasp on the inner workings, I've found I'm unable to fully explain what's going on.Here's my understanding, using a simple example. #include using std::cout; float averageScores(float* scores, int length) {     float sum;         for (int i=0; i<length; i++)     {         sum = sum + scores[i];     }     float average = sum/length;     return average; } int main() {     float testScores [] = {81.2, 90, 91.8, 76.3, 78.4};     int numScores = sizeof(testScores)/sizeof(testScores[0]);     float classAverage = averageScores(testScores, numScores);     cout<<classAverage;     return 0; } Might not be the most efficient way to do this but you get the idea. What I've done is passed an array of test scores into a function that calculates their average. However, to my understanding, when I declare an array variable, it's actually interpreted as something like &testScores\[0\], or the memory location of the first float variable in testScores. First question: the entire array is stored at that memory location, correct? So if the memory location is something like 0x5ffe60, that's where the entire array is stored?Now, in my function I have declared the parameters float\* scores and int length. float\* scores is a pointer. So, this to me seems like creating a pointer to a memory address, similar to the classic example folks usually show when discussing pointers:int x = 6; int \*pX = \&x;Where pX is a pointer to the memory location at which the value of x is stored. So, similarly, it seems that float \*scores = &testScores\[0\].Now, my ultimate question: given that C++ is particular about variable types matching, does this mean that &x and &testScores\[0\] are ""pointer types?"" Like, \* and & are just inverses of the same variable type, and that's why I can write a function that expects a pointer and pass it a memory address.So both \*scores and &testScores\[0\] are float\* numbers? I think I'm missing something because my explanation feels inconsistent. If anyone could clarify what I have right and wrong about this, that would be greatly appreciated.

1pvklab,Does uni feel like memorizing algorithms rather than deep learning to anyone else,Sea-Village-3610,learnprogramming,"Hello everyone, Im second year cs student. This is my second university experience, I dropped my last one. So I have some perspective and experience about universities. I originally self tought for one year, it was okay but I was curious about more and enrolled for this and a diploma. It is free, due to my country.So, my problem. My main issue is how we learn stuff and the testing model. In classes like Calculus, electronics, or physics, you can add more, it feels like we just memorize algorithms to solve questions. I can learn the 'why' from external sources, for example books or Prof.Leonard for calculus but at uni, if you solve 100 past years questions or questions from books, you still can get a good grade, without truly knowing the material. This means that you cannot solve a different kind of problem that involves the integral that you learned 1 week ago and passed the exam, because you didn't understand what you doing, just memorize algorithm.I have many friends, even when they got a good grade, they still lack an understanding. I don't want to be same but what's point? Am I right to feel this way or I'm being ignorant? Sorry for long post and bad english.**TL;DR:** University exams feel like testing memorized solution patterns rather than deep conceptual understanding.

I worked in law enforcement, degree in commerce and finance, and I’m an entrepreneur on the side. I was promoted and inherited my IT Department.

I never called IT because I usually figured it out (I learned that’s why they liked me - I always had new stuff without asking for it). I wanted to make sure I could relate to my people, so I decided to do some homework on IT related stuff. My love of math and problem solving combined with undiagnosed adhd kicked in and I found myself in a Python course. Became a bit obsessed because it felt natural. I am using AI to answer questions about why things operate the way they do and to assist, but only use it now for smaller blocks because it gets dumb really fast. I find myself correcting it when I get it to write blocks for me now. Fast forward to the future.

I try to take part in almost every opportunity I get.The biggest benefit for me has been the exposure. You meet new people, work with different teams, and learn new things beyond regular classroom coding. Hackathons improve not just coding skills, but also communication, collaboration, and networking. You also get to know about new platforms, tools, and technologies, which is really helpful. What makes hackathons exciting is the experience of solving a real-world problem within a limited time — whether it’s a 24-hour or 36-hour hackathon. Thinking of an idea, building a solution from scratch, and implementing it under pressure is challenging but incredibly fun and rewarding.Overall, the experience is top-notch and honestly enjoyable.

I come from a math background. Never completed my uni studies but I was fortunate enough to build somegood foundations that helped a ton in programming. Programming for me was also my only hobby for most of the last decade. Read many books, tried many tools and languages. Had tons of fun on many late nights home.Recent two years the excitement dropped off and I've been enjoying non programing stuff a lot. I've organically ended up doing team lead/tech lead stuff for the last five years and I've accustomed to that. My job is primarily reviewing, mentoring, planning and estimating effort.Due to the recent advancements in AI I've started feeling the heat. It seems to me that much of the toolset that used to make us competent as programmers is fading away. Now, as a team lead/tech lead I feel that I do a good job exactly because I've spent so many hours fiddling with stuff from many different angles. But in the age of AI I have much less consifidence in my ability to reasons about those genai system that I think we'll be dealing with in the upcoming years.I've tried to move to areas of game development and design, graphics programming but I gave up after a while. I did not feel the urge to pursue and do what it takes to jump to another field. Right now I'm asked to design systems based on AI which, I don't feel equipped to do.And even though I know that I'm through a burnout for about three years now, I appreciatey job. I appreciate how it has transformed my life and I've seen able to do and own things I never would have if I did not spend so much time studying cs and programming. This is why I decided to create a self made curriculum of data science, machine learning, deep learning and finally genai in order get myself familiarize with those concepts. This is something that's I evaluate to take at least a year. I think that if I am to continue managing development teams and since I seems to a place in our toolset, I think it makes sense. I feel it would boost my abilities and therefore my confidence in order to continue doing a good job.I don't feel like I'm going to definitely lose my job to AI. But I feel like that if I don't expand my knowledge in any way, I leave it to chance. I don't know if I'm maybe too pessimistic about this, but my gut call is saying that it's to re evaluate some things and it's time to be proactive again.Thought I'd share with you, I expect that many might have somewhat similar thoughts, with all this ai madness going around constantly.

Overall the search went much better than last time. With it being only a year since I had gone through this whole thing I felt a lot more prepared and I think it shows in the numbers.A few clarifying points about my labels:* ""Reached out to my network"" was me reaching out to anybody I had interacted with previously including co-workers, recruiters I had worked with before, and actually the offer I turned down last year. The company that gave me the offer I turned down last year met with me but they didn't have anything open and it didn't go beyond that.* ""AI agent applied for me"": I used several AI services to find and apply for jobs on my behalf. These were Jobhire AI, Wobo AI, and Sonara. I didn't count all of the applications they sent out for me because the vast majority of them were ignored. I estimate that it was approximately 200 applications that got sent out by these. I could make another post on my thoughts on these, but to sum it up, Jobhire was absolute trash, Wobo wasn't much better, and Sonara was worth the price in my mind. Overall the AI agents got me interviews with 3 companies, 2 of which proceeded to the final round (1 rejected me and the other I withdrew after accepting another offer).* ""Withdrew after accepting other offer"": This means that I withdrew from interviews before getting an offer from the place I was interviewing with because I had already accepted a different offer. If a company made me an offer, that got counted with the ""Declined"" label after ""Offer"".I've got 13 years of experience with two FAANGs and a FAANG+ on my resume and my specialization for most of that has been in developer tools and infrastructure. System design questions are still my weakest point, and I'm hoping that this next role will help me with more practical hands-on experience that I can use in the future for those problems.My offers:Series A Startup | Series B Startup | Axon-------------------|--------------------|------accepted | declined | declined$205k base | $200k base | $188k baseno bonus | 15% bonus | 10% bonusOptions | Options | $160k RSUs over two years with 1 year cliff (+ refreshers)2-3 days hybrid | 2-3 days hybrid | 4 days mandatory in office Tue-FriSome quick stats from the Sankey:* Acceptance rate from manual applications: 11% (11/100)* Pass rate for initial rounds: 64% (9/14 - not counting ones I withdrew from)* Pass rate for final rounds: 60% (3/5 - not counting ones I withdrew from) - this is a personal best for me. I'm not sure if the 4 companies I withdrew from would have been a similar success rate, but I'm happy with it.* Nearly half the recruiters that messaged me first were for shitty contracting gigs even though I indicated on LinkedIn that I was not interested in those. Ironically at least 10 of those were third party recruiters that wanted to put me right back in at Meta doing almost exactly what I was doing before ... hmm ...* A huge percentage of companies I interviewed with (maybe 85%?) had ""AI"" in their name and almost every company I talked to emphasized how they were incorporating AI in their product or process. The startup I accepted an offer from is the type of company that is selling shovels during this AI gold rush.Overall this search only lasted two months. I hit the ground running as soon as I got laid off from Meta and I had accepted an offer before 60 days had passed. So much better than last year!",119,0.97,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pty6o7/my_latest_job_search_after_getting_laid_off_for/,2025-12-23 16:26:47,2025-12-27 01:45:20

Both times I scheduled the interview, took it, and then never heard back from Reed afterwards.

1puwtmr,"21M, CS + Data Science major unable to find full-time job, even in the NYC metro area. Am I doomed?",MarathonMarathon,cscareerquestions,"So I'm soon to become one of those ""unemployed CS majors"" everyone keeps talking about once I graduate. I've been struggling to find meaningful employment, and don't have a job lined up. The way things are currently heading, after graduation I'm likely just heading back to my mom's house and maybe working some shitty retail job with 0 upward mobility. This is a future some people (including some friends) from my high school have achieved without attending college, and if that's my future, it means my mom will have wasted 4 years on an expensive degree that ended up being worthless.I'm well aware that it only gets harder and harder to find a full-time job the longer you wait after graduating. Which is why I'm frightened of being jobless or underemployed once that happens, and then having an awkward gap in my resume to have to explain, which only gets more and more awkward the longer I wait.The roles I've been applying to include SWE, data analysis, data engineer, and data science. While my undergraduate internship grinds have been very hit-or-miss, I have some ""roundabout"" experience (multiple unpaid internships + paid research) on my resume, some of it ongoing (and my performance there has been satisfactory), which I've been told is enough to land me interviews, which I have. It's just that I've been struggling to pass these interviews. I've known people who've managed to hand-wave themselves in through interviews just by talking a bit, but I've somehow failed even one of those when given one (though that was partially my fault since my reference waved me through without even giving me the JD).My clear metric for ""success"" is having enough money to *be able to* move away from home and afford a non-shitty apartment if I wanted to (and in the event I don't, it'll be because the job is in my metro area, aka NYC). If I don't achieve this, I'll have failed. I wouldn't say I'm asking for much, and I feel like this is a quite reasonably low bar to clear, and if I don't clear it, I'm a failure.Now that it's Christmas already and I still don't have any kind of post-college offer in hand, things are not looking up. I've barely applied to any positions between Thanksgiving and Christmas and have secured 0 new interviews therein. I barely even grind Leetcode anymore, since it just makes me disappointed whenever I fail questions that are supposedly ""Easy"" or ""Medium"". If you gave me a Leetcode-style interview or OA right now, I'd probably fail it. I've yet to actually receive such an *interview* (OAs I have, with mixed performance), but I'm well aware that many companies do ask them. A lot of what I've failed so far is behavioral, though I've passed a few.I've received mixed messaging on whether to consider grad school. My parents aren't going to pay for it and I'll have to take out expensive loans if I do go for it. And I know cheap online programs like OMSCS exist, but I don't know if they're right or if it'll be too challenging, and I'm not even sure if it's something I'm seriously invested in either. The whole field just seems like a sinking ship with AI and all, and people seem to be right about there being no need to hire any more juniors.I just want to know what to do, because things seem absolutely grim, and people who've been through 2008 keep calling me entitled and telling me that the job market now isn't nearly as bad as 2008. Keep doing what I'm doing and hope something lands? But if nothing lands, what then? Certmaxx and pivot to IT?

And by impact, at the end of the day, one could say I mean money. Nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on has ever helped anyone and in turn made money. Simultaneously, every project, every product I have ever worked on was heavily overstaffed and with extreme food envy among developers.Is there anyone out there that actually works on something that people need? Is there any project out there that actually needs me?I've been interviewing for over a year now too and I ask the interviewers:\- ""What are you working on?""\- ""Why are you hiring for this role?""Nobody can answer these questions. It's always some hand wavy explanation. You know, the kind you usually get from people lying about their resume. ""Oh this and that bla bla...""At the same time, as we all know, life has gotten so expensive that, at least I, personally, cannot really say ""Oh I will just do this job and in 5-10 years I can buy a house or something.""

I don't really want to own a home. I got into this field, because I wanted to build something that helps people, that makes their lives easier or more enjoyable.

1ptjnxx,Breaking into tech feels impossible. Why don’t more people try building real products together?,AnteaterAvailable571,cscareerquestions,"I’m trying to break into tech, and given how difficult the job market is right now, I keep wondering why more people aren’t trying to build things together instead of endlessly waiting for opportunities.My background is a bit non-traditional. I have an education and basic proficiency in software engineering, but I’ve spent the last 10+ years working in transportation and diesel mechanic environments. In that space, a lot of workflows are still very manual, handling breakdowns over the phone, outdated desktop software, poor coordination between dispatch, mechanics, and drivers. From the outside, it feels like there are real opportunities for software to improve productivity in industries that aren’t “tech-native.”I have an app idea based on problems I’ve personally dealt with, but it’s too ambitious for me to realistically build alone. In theory, it seems like teaming up with a few other engineers (2–4 people) to build something useful could be a better use of time than waiting for interviews that may never come.What I’m trying to understand is why doesn’t this happen more often?

1pvf6oe,Are traditional engineering degrees safer than CS nowadays?,userh1bcr1lwg3,cscareerquestions,"I’m a first-year CS student, and honestly, the job market has been stressing me out. Between tech layoffs, market saturation, and the rapid rise of AI, it’s hard not to feel anxious about the future of this field.Luckily, I’m still a freshman, so if shifting to another degree would truly offer better job security and a more stable income, I wouldn’t hesitate to consider it.Don’t get me wrong: I genuinely love tech. I can see myself studying and working in this field long-term because of how vast and interesting it is. But we also can’t deny reality: the industry feels oversaturated, entry-level roles are extremely competitive, and the barrier to entry is relatively low. Anyone who self-studies can technically enter the field (even if they don’t have the same depth as someone who studied CS formally), and that definitely affects competition.So my question is this:If you were in college right now, still studying CS and not yet graduated, would you consider shifting to a traditional engineering degree instead?I’m talking about fields like:Electrical EngineeringElectronics EngineeringMechanical EngineeringCivil EngineeringDo these degrees actually offer better long-term job security compared to CS today? Or is the grass just greener on the other side?PS: I know some people will say, “If you’re doubting CS, then it’s not for you,” or that those who truly grind will succeed—or that this is just a way to reduce competition.

But using total compensation numbers to hire, then removing a major component post-joining, is at best misleading and at worst a deliberate bait-and-switch.This has nothing to do with:Performance Role change Level changeIt’s purely a policy change that benefits the company at the expense of employees who already joined.Posting this for visibility because these “global alignment” narratives are increasingly being used to quietly roll back compensation after offers are accepted.Has anyone else at Walmart or other big tech seen RSUs removed after joining?Is this becoming the new normal in India under cost-control pushes?Any real leverage employees have in situations like this, or is the offer letter basically meaningless once you join?Sharing for awareness.

1pto1gr,Other career options besides SWE with stem degree,Mishkle,cscareerquestions,"Hi, I transfered into a computer science degree during covid. Even before AI, I think I was better at taking computer science exams as opposed to coding. I was always better at debugging existing code and loved designing code on white board with people, but not writing it myself. On group projects it seemed like I was good at explaining things to people who could code better than me, and they would code it. I don’t know what it is, but I don’t really like coding itself. I think I was so tired from my theoretical/math-heavy my degree was, I didn’t have the energy for projects. I don’t code unless prompted to by others. I did technical product internships in quantum and I tried really hard to “look successful technically” by starting a club around it. I build a huge network and got 2 internships (one FAANG, one not) out of it, but I just…never seem to code. I think I did this club partly out of embarrassment and because it was more meaningful to me to create opportunities for students bc it had real outcome. I also made it my whole personality. I then tried to do a “PhD” to make myself “better” but I just get lost with starting a project from scratch or actually wanting to do it. Everything I tried took me literally all day. Mastered out. I am not necessarily depressed, but I think my brain adjusted to existing in perpetual uncertainty while needing to do hard math I don’t want to everyday. I always enjoyed things doing a dog walking business or uber in college because of the minimal success/interest I experienced in programming. I did an entrepreneurship minor, and I always loved those courses. Working at front-desk jobs and TPM felt like the same skill set to me kinda, so I think I minimized “TPM” roles because it’s a “non-technically” impressive degree. I did try really hard to like coding/hard topics for so many years but like… I feel like my brain only does it for exams/assignments or to teach others. I would rather do not this at all if other things paid well. I now have two technical degrees, a CS and electrical engineering masters, but I feel like I have no skills bc all I did was math or people-oriented things.I have noticed all other areas of my life social life, hobbies, etc. just wither away because I just sleep until I have to do something code related.I think right now, though my resume “looks impressive” the job market grind is a lot. I literally will just sleep in my car at a parking lot because I just don’t want to do leetcode or specific company prep. I think a lot of life goals like having friends, finding partner, climbing, having interest to do anything besides sleep have like withered in my mid-20s due to how much I forced this interest.There’s a part of me that does think if I do get a nice paying CS job, I can save so much money and retire early due to how much I have minimized my other life needsWhat careers can I consider with my degrees that are more people-oriented, or what can I do to look marketable for TPM roles now.",21,0.97,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pto1gr/other_career_options_besides_swe_with_stem_degree/,2025-12-23 07:37:44,2025-12-27 01:45:20

I know Austin has been going downhill for the past couple years and lots of jobs are leaving the city, but I'm not sure if it's gotten as bad as Houston yet. I also don't want to move to another city and if it's going downhill, end up somehow being worse than Houston 5 years from now.

1pvt3po,Dealing with stress about performance?,tupakkarulla,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone. I recently graduated from my bachelors and started working as a DevOps/Test automation engineer. I work at a pretty big company, and was working as a trainee before getting hired full time.I think I’m probably struggling with some self esteem / performance issues, and was wondering if someone has a similar experience.I work really hard, usually do overtime every week, try to overachieve constantly and am the youngest full time engineer my team has ever hired (21). In my performance review, my manager said that my performance is bench mark for others and he’s not able to find any areas for improvement. All in all I should be really happy.So, even with all this considered, why do I still constantly fear that I will be fired and I am not performing? I feel like I’m overanalysing every interaction, thinking I am one mistake away from losing my job. Partly this is triggered because some of my fellow trainees and new hires were recently let go because of poor performance, and I am afraid I will end up like them. I’ve noticed it’s started to affect my sleep and happiness in general. I will think about buying something nice for myself for example, and immediately think (but do I deserve it, and what if I need this money in a month when I get fired).To add to this even more, I live and work in Finland although I’m from the US. As in, I’m in a union and if I got fired, I know it would be a 4-6 month process with severance etc, but I still keep thinking I’ll suddenly be let go like in the US, and I keep reading horror stories online of young careers ending because of X and Y reason. I genuinely made one mistake last sprint where I fucked up an automation script and I genuinely thought I was getting fired over it for a week straight.Sorry for the ramble, just feeling weird about my situation.",9,0.8,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pvt3po/dealing_with_stress_about_performance/,2025-12-26 02:22:14,2025-12-27 01:45:20

And honestly enjoyed all of them but AI the most although I had more of a natural aptitude to networking/security.So taking all that into account I would love some advice or thoughts towards which of these three would be best to work towards in terms of job opportunities, security and career growth, especially (this is a big thing for me) being able to eventually either work remotely or transition to more of a freelancer to have more freedom. Also higher pay wouldn’t hurt. And how best to go about doing this, for example i know that if going down the cybersecurity route I can get some certs such as sec+ or something to improve my chances at getting a job as well as having a deeper knowledge in that area.

1pukjxr,"Junior dev in a small startup: learning fast, lots of trust, but unsure how to grow and where to focus. Looking for advice.",AirlineEasy,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone,I’m looking for some perspective and advice from people who have been in similar situations.I joined a small startup about three months ago as a *full-stack developer*, although in practice I’m doing almost entirely front-end work. The company has been around for about 7 years, ~20 people total, and only 3 developers:* One backend developer* One senior developer who is currently transitioning into a Customer Success role* And meBefore this job, I did a bootcamp and a lot of self-study, but I’m very aware that I’m still junior. I’m learning every day, but there’s a big gap between where I am technically and the level of responsibility and trust they’re giving me.That said, the company has been incredibly supportive so far:* I asked for Frontend Masters access and they approved it* I asked to understand more about the business beyond pure frontend, and they gave me a project building JavaScript automations in Airtable, touching operations, product, inventory, etc.* I asked for regular time with the senior dev to review things together, and that was also approvedFrom a support and trust point of view, I honestly couldn’t ask for more.The company is very product-focused and mainly B2B. They sell hardware and services to other businesses, but they also have a SaaS product. Around 80% of customers actively use it and pay for it, yet there’s no clear long-term SaaS strategy or roadmap. It feels more like “it exists and works” than “this is a core growth engine.”Here’s where my internal conflict starts:* On one hand, I know I’m still junior and should probably focus on fundamentals, shipping solid frontend work, and not overthinking things.* On the other hand, I see a real opportunity here to grow the SaaS side of the business, help shape a more structured software team, and eventually take on more responsibility if things go well.* I’m interested in full-stack and system complexity, not just UI work, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself or become “the guy with ideas but weak execution.”So my questions are mainly:* Is this a good environment for a junior dev to grow, or is the lack of senior technical leadership risky?* How would you balance learning deeply vs stepping up when the company clearly gives you room?* Should I focus narrowly on becoming a very solid frontend engineer first, or is it reasonable to also invest energy in understanding the business and SaaS side early on?* Any red flags or opportunities you see from the outside?I’m genuinely grateful for the chance I’ve been given, but I want to be intentional about how I grow and avoid making preventable mistakes.Thanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to read or respond.",6,0.81,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pukjxr/junior_dev_in_a_small_startup_learning_fast_lots/,2025-12-24 10:42:26,2025-12-27 01:45:20

1pu15ox,How much do majors matter in the CS job market?,allalongthewest,cscareerquestions,"I’m going to college next year and have been having multiple changes of heart regarding my future career prospects and my major. For context, I learned how to program when I was 8, and now I would consider myself a pretty well-accomplished programmer with many great projects to boast. I’m excellent at Rust, C++, C, and JavaScript, and proficient with Java, Python, and other C-like languages. Since ages 8–15 I built multiplayer games, full-stack websites, physics engines, and ECS frameworks, with some projects having thousands of GitHub stars.By 15, I discovered I really liked systems programming and learned theoretical CS topics like OS theory, compiler theory, networking, and embedded programming through open courseware. At 16, I made a dynamic memory allocator that rivals the speed of tcmalloc and jemalloc using a decentralized approach with journals, embedded metadata, and slabs. At 17, I built an ahead-of-time compiler for a Rust-like language with a complete frontend, a robust type checker handling traits and generics, a MIR system with monomorphization, and an LLVM backend generating cross-platform IR.Very recently, I’ve had an intense desire to learn math. I’ve already studied Calc 1–3, linear algebra (Axler is great btw), real analysis (baby rudin, abbott, fitzpatrick), abstract algebra (d&f, aluffi), and category theory, and this interest sharpened after reading Ahlfors' Complex Analysis starting in September, to the point that I'm now seriously considering majoring in it.My mind has been flipping between studying math, CS, double majoring, or minoring in one. Given my extensive programming experience and familiarity with upper-level CS, I feel I’d rather spend college learning something I’m less proficient in (math). Double majoring in Math&CS might make it difficult to take all the math courses I want due to CS requirements, and I dislike entry CS courses like DSA that I likely can’t test out of.I don’t currently have job prospects (they keep changing), but I want to keep SWE jobs as an option after graduation, and I will 100% continue programming and building projects throughout college. If it helps in your consideration, I've been admitted to MIT and will likely commit there, and I might pursue a PhD afterward. My main question is whether majoring in math without a CS major/minor would be bad for SWE jobs given my experience and projects.Edit: I'll be majoring in pure math, not applied math that's nonsense.",7,0.63,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pu15ox/how_much_do_majors_matter_in_the_cs_job_market/,2025-12-23 18:23:59,2025-12-27 01:45:20

1psugln,Math PhD with No Internships for AI Industry Research: Bad Idea?,ThomasHawl,cscareerquestions,"I received a fully funded PhD scholarship in Mathematics. Originally, I applied for a PhD in Computer Science, but since the PI is affiliated with both departments, the scholarship was formally offered under Mathematics instead.My main motivation for pursuing a PhD has always been industry research, not academia. I’m particularly interested in roles at places like DeepMind, FAIR, or smaller, niche AI research labs. From what I can tell, these positions typically expect a PhD in CS / ML (or very closely related fields), and a PhD in Mathematics does not seem to be the standard, or even explicitly listed, in most cases.I am not interested in becoming a professor. I see the PhD primarily as a means to access research-oriented industry roles, not as an academic career path in itself.That said, there are several red flags that are making me hesitate:1. The PI is very new. I would be their second PhD student, and the first one is now a postdoc, still in academia.2. The PI has few publications, mostly in mathematics, and a very low h-index.3. The scholarship itself has some worrying conditions: * Internships are not allowed. * If I decide to leave the PhD early, they may require full reimbursement of the scholarship.The internship restriction is especially concerning, since I want to move into industry research and not stay in academia.At this point, the only reasons I still see for going forward are:1. Is it realistically possible to enter big tech / AI research labs without top-tier publications and without internships?2. Gaining research experience and living abroad.3. I genuinely find the research topic very interesting (I can share more details via DM; I’d prefer not to be too identifiable here).One more important piece of context: I am already working as a software engineer, although with a very old tech stack and in a sector I don’t enjoy (defense).

1pu5qcz,How should students manage professional/real-world development skills and academics at the same time?,tree332,cscareerquestions,"I have struggled figuring out how to manage this since high school.Because the software engineering industry was changing so fast, I wanted a full understanding of the fundamentals of program design and computer science.I had done clone-tutorials and courses to learn how to build projects that came to mind such as 2d game engines in SDL2 or an app clone, but I would always forget the code I learnt because I was ""studying"" a bunch of programming libraries and the program design of the tutorial by trying to copy line by line, after I see the working project I try to google each part of the code in the documentation, get lost googling more concepts without understanding the big picture, then I had to go back to my schoolwork and would forget everything I ""learnt"". It was as though there was a big valley between: (intro to/ intermediate /advanced xyz programming language + intro to object oriented programming course structure then getting into a specific software programming discipline such as ""intro to app development"" and being overwhelmed with the sheer amount of libraries and how exactly these tools are designed in order to implement anything. I had no idea how to reach the point to even just read the documentation and code from scratch without having to read half of the entire class attributes while still confused.) I felt insecure about this learning style and decided I would focus more on trying to study mathematics and computer science topics before college, an effort that just amounted to doing a bunch of practice problems and khan academy constantly as per my math teachers instruction.I wanted to be able to design programs and dissect pre-existing designs, to be able to understand research on algorithms if not to design my own, to explore future applications of CS research or at least to be a software engineer that could make something without relying on a tutorial with code to copy. In college I had to split my focus between biology, chemistry, anatomy, anthropology, discrete math, calculus, linear algebra, bioanthropology.. as you can see, a lot of topics required by my CS degree before I could even think about programming, yet pre-existing programming knowledge was expected and in our CS classes our assignments would consist of fairly complicated 'real world projects' to implement the concepts we were learning but we never talked about any code in class. Most professors were laissez faire in defining how students should learn to program. ""Just code"" which made it hard to see why I was doing so poorly compared to other students.My cohort consisted of: people who had parents who were in STEM/programmers or very STEM oriented schools so they had learnt programming & CS a structured environment for so long they couldn't really define their curriculum beyond ""I just learnt it"" compared to me who just struggled on youtube & stackoverflow without any help.people who were using GPT & friends for all assignments and somehow getting away with it, but I didn't want to risk it and I had no friends either way. People who seemed to make ""just think of things you'd like to make, watch tutorials and ask questions"" work, but I still don't understand the specifics of how they learnt to dissect program design from tutorials without flailing around in the documentation taking notes on a dozen functions and variables that still don't tie together conceptually, especially while dealing with schoolwork at the same time.As professionals, how are students supposed to manage learning software engineering and computer science + other coursework independently?",7,0.9,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pu5qcz/how_should_students_manage_professionalrealworld/,2025-12-23 21:32:23,2025-12-27 01:45:20
1pu40fl,Unsure about IBM offer,WildlyPlatonic,cscareerquestions,"I currently work for one of the WITCH companies, and IBM consulting is taking over our project from us soon. The new IBM project lead is offering me a position on the new team, and I just wanted to get some outside opinions on IBM consulting. Switching to them would represent around a 25% raise, and would be fully remote. That might be all that matters at the end of the day. I've read some worrying things about them though in the industry I'm in. They've been sued twice for under-delivering on very similar projects.

1pt9dk5,Internship While Doing Master's to Break into Big Tech,DOUG_DlMMADOME,cscareerquestions,"Hi all,I am currently a backend Java software engineer at a large bank, 3 yoe. I actually recently got promoted to senior but I don't really see it that way as I don't think I've learned much during my time here. Most deliverables are business/regulatory related and not much technological innovation or otherwise. For that reason, and to avoid stagnation, I've been doing OMSCS and have maintained a 4.0 so far. My question is, since I am doing a master's anyway, and I feel like my technical skills could improve by working in big tech, would it be worthwhile to apply for internships? My undergrad was in physics so I didn't have any CS internships in undergrad and jumped more or less straight into the field. I don't mind quitting this job if it means I can transition into more technical companies and positions where I can learn a lot more.I know all levels of the SE field are super competitive but think that going the internship route may be the best option right now.Thoughts?

1prb879,Transitioning from Software Developer (4.5 YoE) to Project Manager – Worth it?,Flamyngoo,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone,I’m a full-stack software developer with around 4.5 years of experience, and I’ve been at my current company for a couple of years. Recently, the company has been expanding and hiring more IT roles, mainly software developers and project managers.Over the last months, I’ve been more and more involved in client meetings, discussing requirements, planning work, and coordinating what other developers should be doing. Our IT manager noticed this, as he was present in many of those meetings, and he recently offered me the option to fully transition into a Project Manager role.The plan would be to stop recruiting an external PM, hire one additional developer instead, and have me move almost completely off coding (or at least do very little of it). I have about one to two weeks to decide whether I want to stay in a hybrid role with roughly 70% coding, or make a full transition to PM.I do enjoy the planning, organizing, and communication side of the work, but I’m not sure if I enjoy it more than coding in the long run. I’m also unsure how beneficial this move would be for my overall career. Is project management a good long-term path coming from a development background? If I end up not liking it, is it realistic to move back into a coding role later, or would that hurt my career?I’d really appreciate hearing from people who’ve made a similar transition, or from anyone who’s seen this kind of move work out (or not) in practice.

I’m prioritizing depth, clean design, and being able to clearly explain tradeoffs rather than learning many stacks superficially.My question is not about whether I should learn more languages.I’m specifically wondering:* Is it generally acceptable to list a single main tech stack on a resume if all projects use it but demonstrate different problem domains and complexity?* For companies like the ones mentioned above, do recruiters/interviewers care more about stack diversity, or about project quality and engineering decisions?* At what point (if any) does repeating the same stack across projects become a negative for full-stack SWE roles?Context: first year student in CanadaWould appreciate perspectives from people who’ve reviewed resumes or interviewed candidates.",5,0.73,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1puvo12/is_it_okay_if_all_my_projects_use_the_same_tech/,2025-12-24 19:45:26,2025-12-27 01:45:20
