1rdv80s,"Am I missing something with all this ""agent"" hype?",KindTeaching3250,dataengineering,"I'm a data engineer in energy trading. Mostly real-time/time-series stuff. Kafka, streaming pipelines, backfills, schema changes, keeping data sane. The data I maintain doesn't hit PnL directly, but it feeds algo trading, so if it's wrong or late, someone feels it.I use AI a lot. ChatGPT for thinking through edge cases, configs, refactors. Copilot CLI for scaffolding, repetitive edits, quick drafts. It's good. I'm definitely faster.What I don't get is the vibe at work lately.People are running around talking about how many agents they're running, how many tokens they burned, autopilot this, subagents that, some useless additions to READMEs that only add noise. It's like we've entered some weird productivity cosplay where the toolchain is the personality.In practice, for most of my tasks, a good chat + targeted use of Copilot is enough. The hard part of my job is still chaining a bunch of moving pieces together in a way that's actually safe. Making sure data flows don't silently corrupt something downstream, that replays don't double count, that the whole thing is observable and doesn't explode at 3am. So am I missing something? Are people actually getting real, production-grade leverage from full agent setups? Or is this just shiny-tool syndrome and everyone trying to look ""ahead of the curve""?Genuinely curious how others are using AI in serious data systems without turning it into a religion. On top of that, I'm honestly fed up with LI/X posts from AI CEOs forecasting the total slaughter of software and data jobs in the next X months - like, am I too dumb to see how it actually replaces me or am I just stressing too much with no reason?",323,0.98,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rdv80s/am_i_missing_something_with_all_this_agent_hype/,2026-02-24 22:37:48,2026-03-01 02:29:19
1rdqsaz,My experience with DE Academy’s “job guarantee” program (1-year review),Hour-Yesterday-6197,dataengineering,"I wanted to share my experience for anyone considering DE Academy’s data engineering program with the job guarantee.I enrolled in February 2025 under a one-year agreement. The contract stated they would apply to 5–25 jobs per day on my behalf and provide unlimited support (mock interviews, Slack, coaching, etc.).In practice, that’s not what I experienced. The daily job applications were inconsistent, and access to some of the “unlimited” support resources wasn’t always available when needed.I stayed in the program for the full year and remained engaged throughout. By the end of the guarantee period:* I did not receive a data engineering job offer* My refund request under the guarantee was denied* I now have a one-year gap in my professional timeline due to participation in the programBased on my experience, I do not recommend doing business with them.

1rbk3ov,New CTO has joined and is ignoring me,anxiouscrimp,dataengineering,"Keen for any thoughts or feedback.Background - I’ve worked at my current employer, a mid-sized luxury retailer. We turn over about £200m annually. I’m the sole BI architect and have been for the last 5 years or so. I’ve been with the company for 11 years. I do everything - requirements, building out the data warehouse, building and maintaining the cubes, some SSRS development. In the last two years I’ve designed and built a new ELT framework for us to move away from SSIS and integrate to all of our various disparate systems - ERP, CRM, GA4, digital marketing platforms etc etc. Then I’ve cleaned all of this data, modelled it and built a PBI semantic model on top to bring everything together. That’s the first (and biggest) phase of replacing our existing estate.Challenge - I had a very good relationship with our previous CTO. Now a new CTO (a contractor) has joined and he seems to be completely ignoring me. We’ve barely had any interaction. He’s worked with GCP in the past and immediately has set up meetings with a google partner. In the first meeting they opened with ‘so we understand that you’ve got a very fractured data estate with no single source of truth’ which is just totally untrue. But this CTO seems to have no interest in engaging with me in the slightest and I’m hearing from other people that he just wants to ‘move us to bigquery’. We’re entirely on Microsoft for everything - not just BI - so this is an enormous piece of work without a clear benefit. In my opinion the issues we have are generally people based - not enough people and certainly not enough people translating data into something actionable or understandable. I’m open to the idea of moving some or part of our estate to GCP - but shouldn’t such a large move like this be considered in the context of ‘what problem are we trying to solve?’I’m feeling pretty upset - I’ve given a lot to this company over the years and this behaviour feels disrespectful and weird. I’m keen to hear from anyone if they’ve seen this behaviour in the past and how to approach it. At the moment my plan is to write a document outlining our current data estate for him to read and then talk him through. Obviously I’ll also update my CV.TLDR: new contract CTO has joined and is ignoring and sidelining me. He seems very intent on moving us to GCP despite not really understanding any of our actual challenges. Why is he doing this? Is this a strategy?",131,0.92,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rbk3ov/new_cto_has_joined_and_is_ignoring_me/,2026-02-22 12:00:41,2026-03-01 02:29:19

1rdf9gk,"Dev, test and prod in data engineering. How common and when to use?",No-Buy-3530,dataengineering,"Greetings fellow data engineers!I once again ask you for your respectable opinions. A couple of days ago had a conversation with a software engineering colleague about providing a table that I had created in prod. But he needed it in test. And it occured to me that I have absolutely no idea how to give this to him, and that our entire system is SQL server on prem, SQL server Agent Jobs - all run directly in prod. The concept of test or dev for anything analytics facing is essentially non-existent and has always been this way it seems in the organisation. Now, this made me question my assumptions of why this is. The SQL is versioned and the structure of the data is purely medallion. But no dev/test prod. I inquired AI about this seeming misalignment, and it gave me a long story of how data engineering evolved differently, for legacy systems its common to be directly in prod, but that modern data engineering is evolving in trying to apply these software engineering principles more forcefully. I can absolutely see the use case for it, but in my tenure, simply havent encountered it anywhere. Now, I want my esteemed peers experiences. **How does this look like out there ""in the wild"". What are our opinions, the pros and cons, and the nature of how this trend is developing.** This is a rare black box for me, and would greatly appreciate some much needed nuance. Love this forum!

Decided that this would be a fun challenge, to turn those JSONs into a usable star schema in a relational database.[Here is the repo.](https://github.com/Lastrevio112/MyAnimeListPipeline)I created an architecture similar to the medallion architecture by ingesting raw data from this API using Python into a ""raw"" (bronze) layer in DuckDB, then used Polars to flatten those JSONs and remove unnecessary columns, as well as seperate data into multiple tables and pushed it into the ""curated"" (silver) layer. Finally, I used DBT to turn the intermediary tables into a proper star schema in the datamart (gold) layer. I then used Streamlit to create dashboards that try to answer the question ""What makes an anime popular?"". I containarized everything in Docker, for practice.Here is the end result of that project, the front end in Streamlit: https://myanimelistpipeline.streamlit.app/I would appreciate any feedback on the architecture and/or the code on Github, as I'm still a beginner on many of those tools.

I’m the only DE and BI professional in the company.Before I joined, there was no one working as a DE, and the last person in that role left three years ago.When I started, I migrated from Microsoft SQL Server to Databricks and integrated other data sources. At that time, I had to handle migrations and take care of old systems and reports.Then, we had to meet reporting requirements. We had around 100 reports, but now we only have 8. While working, I realized that not only did no one know how the business logic was set up, but a few teams didn’t even understand how our ERP system worked.Some reports were showing incorrect data because the source of that data was an Excel sheet that was last updated three years ago.When setting up new reports based on defined logic, I encountered a number mismatch. Upon investigation, I discovered that the old logic they were referring to was incorrect.On top of these issues, no one in sales has been properly trained in our ERP system. People create a lot of data quality problems that disrupt the pipeline or show incorrect numbers in reports, and I get asked why the report numbers are wrong.Whenever a new requirement comes from a team, they implement it and check the numbers. They then say, “Try to update the logic,” and they raise a ticket as a bug.

Because right now my pipelines are about as self healing as a broken arm. We've got airflow orchestrating about 40 dags across various sources and when something breaks, which is weekly at minimum, someone has to manually investigate, figure out what changed, update the code, test it, and redeploy. That's not self healing, that's just regular healing with extra steps.I get that there's a spectrum here. Some tools do automatic retries with exponential backoff which is fine but that's just basic error handling not healing. Some claim to handle api changes automatically but I'm skeptical about how well that actually works when a vendor restructures their entire api endpoint. The part I care most about is when a saas vendor changes their api schema or deprecates an endpoint. That's what causes 80% of our breaks.

I hope this will help some of you as I've seen similar questions many times in the past.Here's the essenc**e:**Most data engineers hit a career ceiling because they focus entirely on mastering tools and syntax while ignoring the actual business risks. I've had the wrong focus for a long time and can talk a lot about that.The thing is that you can be a technical expert in a specific stack, but if you can’t manage a seven-figure budget or explain the financial cost of your architecture, you’re just a technician. One bad architectural choice or an unmonitored cloud bill can turn you from an asset into a massive liability.Real seniority comes from becoming a ""load-bearing operator."" This means owning the unit economics of your data, building for long-term stability instead of cleverness, and prioritizing the company's survival over technical ego.I just promoted a data engineer to senior. Worked with her for year until she really started prioritizing ""the other side of the job"".I hope this will help some of you.",24,0.76,4,https://www.datagibberish.com/p/how-to-own-risks-and-boost-your-data-career,2026-02-23 19:51:32,2026-03-01 02:29:19

We'll have those in silver. Let's say:Cust1 Cust2In gold we have a fact table that has consolidated data from both ERPs. factSalesEither we have a conformed dimension dimCustomer that is a master list of all customers (no duplicates), but that gets messy if the externalId gets changed (now you're rewriting records and have to consider that fact tables are linked to the old dimCusotmer SK)We could use dimCustomer and just have 1 record per customer per system. So the same customer would exist twice if it were in both systems. factSales will link to the right customer of the right ERP system it came from.

I have mostly certified to ""show"" that I know these tools and frameworks (CKAD, AWS SAA and Databricks Certified DE Professional). These two roles do data of all sizes and batch/streaming, which I am both extremely comfortable with (even crazily nested jsons sometimes).1. My current role (first DE job) is in a fortune 500 MNC, where they utilise the azure platform to do mostly everything (synapse, adf, adls, devops), and recently, databricks which I am fairly proficient in (i helped migrated legacy stuff + pipelines to here).2. I have been offered a DE role in a pretty big cybersecurity company. The stack they use is completely different from my current role, where they use a variety of modern and open source tools (GitLab for CI/CD, argo workflows, iceberg, downside is no full cloud utility but its a mix of AWS S3 + on prem stuff).From the looks of it, my limited knowledge speaks to me that cloud experience in a job experience is invaluable and transferable within the big 3 cloud platforms.I’m not looking to compare total compensation between the two roles (they’re roughly equivalent, with the first one being 30% higher for the first year if bonuses are included; although this is negated if i stay >1year with role number 2, where they will offer bonuses equivalent after my first year).Putting TC and benefits aside, I also want to evaluate purely from a **data engineering tech stack perspective**: which role is more valuable in the long run for building strong fundamentals and skills as a data engineer, and for shaping my career trajectory, assuming my goal is to break into bigger tech companies in a few years?\*\*p.s, i put tc comparison incase some of you want to knock some sense into me for taking a paycut\*\*p.p.s this is not in india but automod put india LOL",2,0.58,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rgaui7/which_data_tech_stack_is_more_valuable/,2026-02-27 16:10:05,2026-03-01 02:29:19

1rgsews,Need advice on Apache Beam simple pipeline,g_force0410,dataengineering,"Hello, I'm very new to data pipelining and would like some advice after going nowhere on documentations and AI echo chamber.First of all, a little bit of my background. I've been writing websites for about 10 years, so I'm reasonably comfortable with (high-level) programming and infrastructures. I have very brief exposure on Apache Beam to get a pipeline running locally. I don't know how to compose a pipeline.Recently I got myself into an IoT project. At very high level, there are a bunch of door sensors sending \[open/close\] state to an MQTT broker. I would like to create a pipeline that transform open/close states into alerts - users care about when a door is left open after a period of time, instead of the open/close event of a door. I would also like to keep sending out alert until door is closed. In my mind, this is a transformation from ""open/close stream"" to ""alert stream"".As I've said, I'm getting no where, because I'm not very familiar with thinking in data streams. I have thought about session windowing. Does it work if I first separate source stream to open stream and close stream, then session windowing on the open stream. For each session, I search for a close event from the close stream?I chose Beam because: 1. I had very briefly used Beam 10 years ago. I think it's the least resistance to get a pipeline running. 2. I understand Beam is abstracting and generalising how stream processing across different Runners(e.g. Flink, Spark, ...). This seems like an advantage to a beginner like me.Any help on my thought process is much appreciated. Please forgive my question if it was too naive.

1rc1qde,"Same PKI, same raw data, two platforms (Databricks, Snowflake)… different results. Where would you even start debugging this?",MitocondrialPoro,dataengineering,"Hej all,I am running in to a metrics consistency problem in what felt like normal, decent architecture. But now it behaves more like a trains here in winter. Mostly works, until suddenly not.Here are the details.Data comes from:* Applications sending events to Kafka* Files landing in S3* A handful of databases (DB2, MySQL, Oracle)* A couple of SaaS systemsFrom there:* NIghtly spark jobs on Databricks create curated tables* Some of these curated tables are pushed into Snowflake* We also have streaming jobs writing to both Databricks and Snowflake* Snowflake is shared across multiple tenants. Same account, separate warehouses, ACLs in place.On architecture diagram this looks reasonable. In reality, documetnation is thin and mostcontrols are manual operational procedures. Management is crurently excited about “AI agents” than investing in proper orchestration or governance tooling, so we are working with what we have.**Problem**: A core metric, let’s call it DXI is calculated in Databricks using one curated table set, and in Snowflake suing another curated table set. Both sets are ultimately derived from the same upstream raw sources. Some pipelines flow through Kafka, others ingest directly from DB2 and land in Databricks before promotion to Snowflake. Sometimes the metric matches closely enough to be acceptable. Other times it diverges enough to raise eyebrows. There is no obvious pattern yet. What makes this awkward is that one of our corporate leaders explicitly suggested calculating the same KPI independently in both systems as a way to validate the architecture. It sounded clever at the time. Now it is escalating because the numbers do not match always and confidence in the architecture is getting shaky. This architecture is around 7 years old. Built and modified by multiple people, many are no longer here. Tribal knowledge mostly evaporated over time. **Question**: Since I have inherited this situation, where should I start? Some options I am struggling with:* Valdiate transformation logic parity line by line across about 350+ pipelines that touch the raw data and see where things could be diverging? This will take me forever, and I am also not very well versed with some of the complex Spark stuff that is going on in Databricks.* The lineage tool we have seems to overly simplify the lineage by skipping steps between curated tables and raw sources and just points it as an arrow. It gives no concept of how this could have happened as there are many pipelines between those systems. This is probably the most frustrating part for me to deal with and I am this close to giving up hope on using it.* I do notice sporadic errors on the nightly runs of pipelines and there seems to be a correlation between those and when the KPI calculation diverges on following days.

1rbjw48,We integrated WebMCP (new browser standard from Google/Microsoft) across our data pipeline and BI platform. Here's what we learned architecturally,YourSourcecode,dataengineering,"We just shipped WebMCP integration across Plotono, our visual data pipeline and BI platform.85 tools in total, covering pipeline building, dashboards, data quality, workflow automation and workspace admin. All of them discoverable by browser-resident AI agents.WebMCP is a draft W3C spec that gives web apps the ability to expose structured, typed tool interfaces to AI agents. Instead of screen-scraping or DOM manipulation, agents call typed functions with validated inputs and receive structured outputs back. Chrome Canary 146+ has the first implementation of it.The technical write-up goes more into detail on the architectural patterns: [https://plotono.com/blog/webmcp-technical-architecture](https://plotono.com/blog/webmcp-technical-architecture)Some key findings from our side:* Per-page lifecycle scoping turned out to be critical.* Tools register on mount, unregister on unmount. No global registry.* This means agents see 8 to 22 focused tools per page, not all 85 at once.Two patterns emerged for us:* ref-based state bridges for stateful editors (pipeline builder, dashboard layout) and direct API calls for CRUD pages. Was roughly a 50/50 split.* Human-in-the-loop for destructive actions. Agents can freely explore, build and configure, but saving or publishing requires an explicit user confirmation.What really determined the integration speed was the existing architecture quality, not the WebMCP complexity itself. Typed API contracts, per-tenant auth and solid test coverage is what made 85 tools tractable in the endWe also wrote a more product-focused companion piece about what this means for how people will interact with BI tools going forward: [https://plotono.com/blog/webmcp-ai-native-bi](https://plotono.com/blog/webmcp-ai-native-bi)Interested to hear from anyone else who is looking into WebMCP or building agent-compatible data toolsFor transparency:I am working on the backend and compiler of the dataplatform",0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rbjw48/we_integrated_webmcp_new_browser_standard_from/,2026-02-22 11:49:08,2026-03-01 02:29:19

When business asks questions, they ask in world ontology.Data model describes data and doesn't carry world semantics anymore.A LLM can create a data model based on ontology but cannot deduce ontology from model because it's already been compressed.What does this mean?\- Declare the ontology and raw data, and the model follows deterministically. (ontology driven data modeling, no more code, just manage ontology) \- Agents can use ontology to reason over data. \- semantic layers can help retrieve data but bc they miss jontology, the agent cannot answer why questions without using its own ontology which will likely be wrong. \- It also means you should learn about this asap as in likely a few months, ontology management will replace analytics engineering implementations outside of slow moving environments.What's ontology and how it relates to your work?Your work entails taking a business ontology and trying to represent it with data, creating a ""data model"". You then hold this ontology in your head as ""data literacy"" or the map between the world and the data. The rest is implementation that can be done by LLM.

And nobody warns you about persistent storage, configs, logs, cert files, all of it needs proper volume management or you will have a very bad day during a node failure, and thaat took us longer to sort out than the actual containerization.

Recently I started learning backend development and decided to build a purely backend focused project to actually understand how things work beyond tutorials.I built a CRUD API for a social media style application with users, posts, and votes tables. Creating the routes with FastAPI felt surprisingly straightforward at first. Authentication, however, was a completely different story. Integrating JWT took me a few days of going through videos, debugging, and trying to understand what was really happening under the hood. Eventually I got it working, which felt like a small breakthrough.For the database, I used PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy as the ORM to define my schemas. I also set up Alembic for migrations, which helped me understand how schema versioning works in real projects. That part made the project feel much more realistic.After finishing the core functionality, I realized that writing endpoints is only half the job. They need to be tested properly. So I created a tests directory and used pytest to cover different scenarios and edge cases. That was another learning curve, especially figuring out test databases and dependency overrides.The biggest hurdle for me was Docker. I had never containerized an application before, and initially it felt overwhelming. But after spending time reading the docs and experimenting, I finally managed to dockerize the app. That moment felt like a genuine win.I know this is still a basic backend project and there is a lot more to learn, like proper deployment and scaling. I am thinking of adding a load simulation using Locust to test with 1000 plus virtual users just to explore performance aspects.It may not be groundbreaking, but it feels like real progress to me. I am excited to keep improving it.Also, if anyone can suggest free platforms where I can deploy this as a college student, I would really appreciate it.Thanks for reading.",14,0.9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rcgff0/dockerizing_my_application_made_me_feel_like_a/,2026-02-23 12:43:52,2026-03-01 02:29:20

I want to follow the advice in both books, because I see their point of view and I agree with them, but I am having a hard time doing it because in one of the most important aspects, function/method design, they have very different views.Even if they talk more in general, for the sake of making the problem simpler and for simpler exemplification, I will reduce their advice to functions. I use ""functions"", but I also refer to ""methods"".**A Philosophy of Software Design** suggests deep functions with simple interfaces. This means functions which hide a lot of complexity behind a simple-to-use interface. Many times in this book it is pointed out that functions with a lot of parameters increase a function's complexity, and thus increase the overall complexity of the program. The book is also against passing objects or data down through many functions, essentially creating parameters in functions whose only purpose is to pass data down. He suggests contexts or global objects for this. Also, small functions or functions which just call another function are recommended against in this book, as they do not result in deep modules, and create extra complexity through the increase in the number of functions and parameters that exist for developers to learn.**Grokking Simplicity** makes it very clear from the start that functions should be split into calculations (pure functions, with no side effects) and actions (functions which interact with the outside world). The main idea the book recommends is reducing as much as possible the number of actions inside a codebase by transforming actions into calculations or extracting calculations from actions. Extracting calculations from actions has the natural consequence of increasing the overall number of functions. Also, in order to create calculations, some implicit inputs need to be converted into explicit inputs, resulting in functions with multiple parameters. Because reading from / writing to a global variable is an implicit input/output, the book also suggests using functions which only pass parameters through many layers.As you can see, the two idioms are very contradictory.",10,0.73,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rdg2fh/a_philosophy_of_software_design_vs_grokking/,2026-02-24 13:20:49,2026-03-01 02:29:20

1rf5b75,"Learning how to think ""overall"" to people learning programming?",WinterGabe,learnprogramming,"A lot of learners don’t seem blocked by not knowing a language. They seem blocked by not knowing how to approach a problem. They try to write the finished solution in one go instead of drafting and refining. They don’t isolate the core logic of a function before building around it. They don’t reduce complexity before adding features.It makes me wonder:Do they actually teach people how to think in programming?They teach loops, conditionals, frameworks, and patterns. But do they explicitly teach:* Iterative drafting* Breaking problems into smaller pieces* Building the smallest working version first* Stripping a function down to its essence before expanding it* Using code as a tool for reasoning, not just producing an answerWhat thinking gaps have you noticed in programming? I've never taken a formal course so I am unsure if they teach programmers courses on how to approach problems. I taught myself Python, SQL, PowerShell, Bash, PHP, VB. Which makes me wonder if others have seen this and what are some examples - curious for personal growth since I am not a programmer by trade and my overall journey started with problem solving, order of operations, baselines, etc - all in frame. But then again - no one sat me down and taught me those things. They came from a need to solve real world problems and to be as effectual as possible over the course of my career.I'm asking because I come from a Systems background and I don't feel like I think like a programmer and I feel like that gap causes a disconnect in communication sometimes. When I sit down to build something, my mind immediately expands outward. I’m thinking about database design, developer experience, user experience, scalability, infrastructure, and long-term stack decisions and how what I am writing fits into all of that so I can tailer my approach to the end goal as a whole. Things like - this service is going to be running longer than 15 minutes, so a lamba function isn't an option.What are some gaps in regard to overall approach and problems solving you see? I feel like if I know more about that, it will help me bridge the gap.The two things I see the most is - 1. Not just getting the logic out in a draft *then* refining.2. Just focusing on making it work and calling it a day rather than thinking more into - how comfortable is this going to be to use.And I find it hard to explain why those two things are important.Thanks.",7,0.77,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rf5b75/learning_how_to_think_overall_to_people_learning/,2026-02-26 09:01:18,2026-03-01 02:29:20
1rddc8b,First-Year Student Feeling Stuck and Worried About AI,mobbplayerr,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I’m currently in my first year of computer science in France after switching majors (I used to study international business). Honestly, I’m convinced I’ve finally found my path.

When I’m faced with a blank file or an empty editor, I never know where to start, what to write first, or how to structure my thinking. It’s frustrating because I really want to build projects, create things, and deploy them… but I feel stuck when it’s time to actually begin. Is this normal in the beginning? How did you get past that stage?Second, I want to learn more than what we cover at school. I’m motivated to go deeper and improve faster, maybe explore other technologies, but I don’t know where to start. There are so many resources out there (YouTube, online courses, bootcamps, books, open source projects, etc.) that I feel overwhelmed and unsure what’s actually worth my time. What would you recommend for a first-year student who wants to seriously improve?And finally, something that’s been on my mind a lot: AI. To be honest, it really scares me. It feels like it’s evolving incredibly fast, and I’m afraid it might drastically change the developer job market. I worry about investing years into this field if it’s going to be completely transformed. I’m not even sure how to fully explain the feeling, but it genuinely makes me anxious.Have any of you felt this way?

1rffo8y,Kind of stuck in tutorial hell,GameDevilXL,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone, I've been pondering over a problem I'd been having and reckoned it best (after about a day of thinking about it) to just ask people who're probably more experienced.The title might or might not be slightly inaccurate, given that I've been programming for quite some time (since middle school), and have made multiple projects (mainly games, but also a commission for a local institute as well as a data analysis tool) by myself. No AI shenanigans and no copy-pasting from tutorials for any of them. I'm mainly trying to learn and get good at programming because I think it'll be a useful skill, i.e., I'm mainly trying to cultivate better programmatical thinking and approaches to problems, even though I'm going for a physics degree. I'm going to be finishing with school in like 10 days now, and for the last few months (about 8 or so) I'd kind of put my projects and everything on the back to focus on my entrance exams for uni. Now that all that is mostly sorted, I'd kind of been thinking about starting a course for actually getting more advanced stuff in my head, mainly for Java. Thing is, I've already tried doing this course about... 4 times now. Each time I do end up doing it, I complete about 50ish hours, am almost done (80 hour course), then an important exam comes up that requires me to stop for like a few months or so and focus completely on my books. Basically the same thing I described in the second paragraph.By the time I'm able to come back, I've forgotten enough little tidbits across the entire thing, and at that point it makes sense to just start from a lower point again. I doubt something like this will happen anymore, since I'm going to be just done with school now (my school has been very invasive on my schedule), but I still just really, really don't want to repeat the cycle again, especially since I just 'doubt' the possibility, and can't say for certain that it'll never happen again. I have taken CS in my school up till the final year, but its way too easy to actually be fun or require me to think, except for the bits on data structures and sorting algorithm techniques.I could just buy a book (the complete reference for java had seemed good to me), try some other method of learning, and although I always learn something new with projects, I'm afraid these methods alone won't be able to help me master programming by learning every concept there is to learn, which is the whole point of me doing this whole thing in the first place. I'd appreciate any advice anyone would have on how to proceed with learning to be honest. Although buying a book sounds like a good plan, I really just don't want to continue the same cycle again. Apologies if the post is overly and needlessly long, I'm not sure how to properly convey my situation here. I have about \~5 months before uni starts, and I really don't want to waste them by making the same mistakes again. Not expecting to become a master in 5 months of course, I know that'll take at least a couple years, but I just wanna set up a proper base.",3,0.67,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rffo8y/kind_of_stuck_in_tutorial_hell/,2026-02-26 17:00:51,2026-03-01 02:29:20

1rdpj61,Websockets Vs MQTT vs HTTP LongPooling,Tito_Gamer14,learnprogramming,"I need to build a complex application, and to give you some context, there are 3 interacting entities: a Type 1 Client, a Server, and a Type 2 Client.The **Type 2 Client** will be web-based, mainly for querying and interacting with data coming from the server. The **Type 1 Client** is offline-first; it first captures and collects data, saves it in a local SQLite DB, and then an asynchronous service within the same Type 1 Client is responsible for sending the data from the local DB to the server.Here’s the thing: there is an application that will be in charge of transmitting a ""real-time"" data stream, but it won't be running all the time. Therefore, the Type 2 Client will be the one responsible for telling the Type 1 Client: ""start the transmission.""The first thing that came to mind was using **WebSockets**—that’s as far as I’ve gotten experimenting on my own. But since we don't know when the connection will be requested, an active channel must be kept open for when the action is required. The Type 1 Client is hidden behind **NAT/CG-NAT**, so it cannot receive an external call; it can only handle connections that it initiates first.This is where I find my dilemma: with WebSockets, I would have an active connection at all times, consuming bandwidth on both the server and the Type 1 Client. With a few clients, it’s not a big deal, but when scaling to 10,000, you start to notice the difference. After doing some research, I found information about the **MQTT protocol**, which is widely used for consuming very few resources and scaling absurdly easily.What I’m looking for are opinions between one and the other.

I just changed what's inside the braces. In other words, I don't exactly know how it works.From my understanding, the basic idea behind line 2 is that on the button being clicked, it calls a method. So, I thought, instead of doing all the stuff in line 2, why not just call the method?However, line 3 of the snippet causes this error: /home/vncuser/runtime/Main.java:29: error: 'void' type not allowed here Backend.reverse_visibility(list));The reverse\_visibility method is one I defined in a different class that's a void type. Considering in the documentation of setOnAction, it's parameter requires a type of EventHandler, the compiler is expecting a completely different input than the one I provided. So, the error makes sense. However, why doesn't line 2 cause this error? It doesn't look like it's returning an object from EventHandler. Shouldn't it also get the void type not allowed error?Sorry if this post is incoherent or if the question is stupid, again I was literally thown into the deep end yesterday and I'm very new to reading docs.",2,0.67,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rgi514/whats_the_difference_between_these_2_lines/,2026-02-27 20:36:33,2026-03-01 02:29:20
1rggffh,Time in game dev? C#,Puzzleheaded-Law34,learnprogramming,"Hello! Amateur programmer here. I was wondering, when you have a time-dependent event in a game, don't you end up having to set an individual counter for each entity?? For example, each time the game loop progresses, a unit (of counting or of time) is added to the player's ""action-animation counter"", such that it progresses smoothly. Of course, this has the drawback that every single thing whose animations have different frame times need their own counter. Or, I set a general counter that keeps cycling from 0 to 100 with Update() (what I did) and the npc frames are based on that. But, that means their frames actually don't always start at 0 but any point between 0-100. It works fine but in other cases it might show them starting with the final frame and then it jumps to the first... Also, say a character tosses a grenade. It has to explode after 3 seconds; does the grenade need its own counter that is incremented each Update() too??

1rg0dtv,Trying to switch roles as an ML engineer and nothing makes sense anymore,thekomedyking,cscareerquestions,"Very crazy experience interviewing for MLE roles in the USI honestly don’t know if I’m doing something wrong or if the MLE job market is just completely broken right now.I’ve been interviewing for \~6 months now. Currently working as an ML platform engineer at a mid sized product company since 2 years after graduating — so mostly infra, backend, cloud, big data, ML Ops, some GenAI here and there. I have built some complex systems at wok and I’ve also done fairly complex ML research projects in the past and have a Master’s in CS specialising in ML from a top 5 school, so it’s not like I’m completely new to the modeling side either.But man… this whole process has been so wild.Uber — got an MLE interview, was asked some Fisher–Yates shuffle variant + time complexity derivation + probability + some experimentation stuff in a single question. I didn’t get the optimal solution, only a suboptimal one. Felt kinda shaky. Recruiter still told me I cleared the screen, had positive feedback and scheduled the loop. I prep hard for like 2–3 weeks… and then all interviews get canceled one day before the loop because they “decided to move with other candidates.” Like what?Tesla — was told it would be a DSA round by the recruiter. I grind Tesla-tagged Leetcode for weeks. Got into the interview and the guy asks me to redesign some AI agent code with tool calling. I’ve literally never worked on agents before. Role didn’t mention it either. I try to steer it toward infra/scaling/FastAPI stuff (which is what I actually do), but yeah… that didn’t go great.Apple (first role) — job description says MLE (ML, NLP, etc.). Screen was DSA + ML+GenAI basics, went well. Then the interviewer tells me the loop will heavily focus on AI agents (again, not mentioned anywhere).So I go all in. For like 2+ weeks I’m basically working day and night — learning AI agents from scratch, going deep into LLMs, revising NLP/transformers, practicing Leetcode, brushing up everything. Honestly one of the most intense prep phases I’ve had.Loop was brutal — beam search implementation, AI agents, deep dives into LLMs, DL concepts, another DSA round. I actually felt like I did really well overall.Then they drag me for a month and a half, make me talk to one manager, then another manager, and eventually reject me despite both the rounds going really well. And the kicker? I later find out the team mostly does SQL + dashboards and barely any real ML. Why am I implementing beam search and answering questions on LLM internals for that?Apple (second role) — manager says it’s more of a SWE team doing some GenAI. I prep DSA + system design. In the tech screen interview, I get asked to improve performance of a classifier on an imbalanced dataset and actually code it.Now this one is partially on me — I haven’t really done hands-on classical ML in like 2+ years since I’ve been focused on infra. I talked about adjusting class weights and trying different loss functions, but I blanked on classifier threshold tuning in the moment. I had studied ML theory pretty deeply (derivations, intuitions, all that), but just didn’t recall that threshold tuning knob under pressure. Got rejected. Anyways this felt more like a data science interview than a SWE interview.Microsoft (Applied Scientist II) — going into the loop, the recruiter explicitly told me that they would be focusing more on ML coding and data-related skills (including SQL/data cleaning), and that the Leetcode round would carry less weight.I intensely studied SQL with complex joins, CTEs, Pandas and ML algorithm implementations for over 2 2 weeks.The two ML rounds where one was ML system design round (recommender systems) actually went really well. One of the interviewers even mentioned she was very impressed with my research projects, and overall I felt strong about the ML depth and ML system design discussions.But then the Leetcode round ended up being a shortest job first scheduling type OS problem. I’ve solved \\\~350+ problems and had never seen this one before, and I genuinely don’t think most people can come up with the optimal solution on the spot unless they’ve seen it before or maybe I am just not that great at LC. I did give a working brute force solution and was able to successfully derive the optimal approach by myself during the interview (\\\~15-20 mins) and gave a dry run, but didn’t have enough time to fully implement it.Despite the earlier indication that this round would be given less importance all my efforts grinding SQL and Pandas gone to waste because it was not even asked in the loop, I got rejected after a couple of weeks,Series C startup for an ML/data infra role — this one honestly drained me the most.I went through an HR screen + like 3–4 technical rounds (coding + traditional system design). I felt these went fairly well, and the recruiter even said they had very strong feedback, so I was expecting to at least get to the offer stage.Then they invite me for an on-site… and it turns into another 5 rounds.These rounds went super deep into distributed systems — like MVCC. One round literally asked me to implement something similar to a PyTorch DataLoader from scratch — loading data from disk into buffer memory, handling batching, etc.At that point I was honestly just done. I straight up told them I haven’t built something like that from scratch before. I’ve used PyTorch DataLoader, but I haven’t implemented one myself, and I didn’t want to BS.Some of the rounds did go well (especially system design), but overall I think they were expecting experience at a scale/depth that I just haven’t worked at yet. I do a lot of ML infra / MLOps, but not at that level of distributed systems depth.Just felt like the bar kept getting raised at every stage — like no matter how many rounds you clear, there’s always another deeper filter.I’ve solved like 350–400 Leetcode problems. I have good ML infra experience. I’ve worked on pretty complex systems for my level of experience. I’ve done ML research. But every interview feels like a completely different role:•One wants hardcore DSA•One wants deep ML theory•One wants LLM/agents•One ends up being SQL dashboards•One throws random OS problemsThere’s no consistency at all.And yeah, at this point I’m honestly just kind of done with MLE roles. Not because I can’t do ML — I’ve done solid ML research and I understand the fundamentals well — but I’m just tired of how random and overhyped everything feels right now.Especially all the glorification around RAG, prompt engineering, “agents”, etc., when half the roles don’t even know what they actually want or end up being something completely different.Honestly, part of this burnout is also coming from what I’m seeing at work. There’s a huge push toward “AI agents,” RAG, prompt engineering, etc., and it feels like everything is getting reduced to just vibe coding apps and pushing them to prod with a ton of tech debt. People are getting rewarded for shipping quick demos rather than building solid systems. I don’t get the level of hype around it — a lot of this stuff feels fairly straightforward to prototype, but no one seems to care about the actual infrastructure, scalability, reliability, or the complex interactions behind the scenes.

1rg03si,Landed Meta and Coinbase offers after spending nearly a year getting rejected,Left_Relationship240,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I used to scroll through a ton of interview prepping posts when I was deep in the job search slump and struggling. So glad I finally pushed through all these struggles, and got offers from Coinbase and Meta, so I figured it’s time I finally put mine out there now, and share my journey. It took me around 9 months of interviews, rejections and rejections again before things finally started clicking.I’ve been in the industry for about 8 years. Early on I spent a lot of time just getting my engineering skills up to speed and figuring out how to work well with people. I didn't really practice Leetcode or work on any interview preparation skills for many years. I thought everything was going well, but then suddenly got impacted during a company-wide lay off. It was really stressful and hard at the moment, but now thinking back it's also a life turning event that push me to go find opportunities from other better companies.# BehavioralFor behavioral, I made sure I had stories that landed with company values so I wasn’t fumbling around mid-interview. I always research and read the specific company's core values beforehand, and preparing stories for those values. For example, for Coinbase, I made sure to read their value posts like this:Other than this general behavioral tip, another tricky part I had to figure out is later in the job search, because I had a long gap between last job, I kept getting asked why I left the last job and what was I doing during this gap. For someone who's in a similar situation, my tips is try to do some small side projects on the side. Then you could answer that you were doing those side projects rather than leave an impression that you haven't worked on any eng related projects for a long time, which I noticed sometimes HM responded negative to.# System DesignFor system design, I actually practiced mock system design with AI a lot, and you can practice talking through trade-offs and architecture decisions out loud, and asking AI for feedback or alternative solutions.Other than these practice, I find the following helpful:* Look at the company's recently asked system design questions, and practice all those questions with AI. This helped me a lot* [Grokking Modern System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview) Seems like the original version came out many years ago but it's still so useful to read nowFor many companies, they only have a few system design questions in their question bank. Finding resources or posts that shares the companies' recently asked system design question bank was what worked the best for me.# CodingFor the coding parts, I didn’t do anything too different at first. I pretty much:* went through a bunch of common LeetCode problems tag by tag to get used to different patterns* watched walkthrough videos on Youtube to see how people think through problemsHonestly, after solving a decent amount of problems, the ones I have seen before or at least seen a similar one, I could start writing decent solutions, but I have a hard time figuring one solution for any new questions. If you’re somewhere like I was, rusty or not used to DSA, don’t stress too much, I hope my following tips will help.# What Really Helped MeAfter this general process, I felt like I've improved but whenever I encounter new/unseen questions, I still having trouble coming up with solution, and keeps getting rejected. I was feeling discouraged and started doubting whether I could really find another good job again.Then what finally started clicking and helped me was targeted preparation for specific companies as soon as I passed the recruiter screening. Instead of just practicing random problems by tag, I'd use the following resources to find all the most asked questions within 6 month to 1 year for that company. Especially for question bank companies like Coinbase, Meta or Doordash that have a really small question bank, this step helps immensely.* Check LeetCode interview experience posts like this one for people who share actual questions they got asked* Check recently asked question bank on site that shares resource like this such as offerretriever and practice them all. Question bank sites are especially useful for companies that have unique rounds that are non-leetcode, like Coinbase Tech Execution , Doordash code craft, or Stripe debug round.From my own experience, for some companies like Coinbase, they don't ask typical leetcode question even for OA. But they have only around 3 questions for OA as shared here on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/7583079/got-blocked-by-codesignal-cooldown-annoy-4nrw/), and around 10 questions in their question bank. Since I have practiced them all before, the onsite coding rounds felt much easier than other companies that asks leetcode and have a huge question bank. If you are also stuck like I was, trying to apply to companies like this that are less leetcode heavy and have small question bank might help a lot.Here are a few question bank companies like this I know of:* Coinbase* Stripe* Doordash* AirbnbIf anyone else knows other question bank companies like this, feel free to also add to this list. I can keep this list updated if it helps.This was way more useful than just grinding the leetcode tags blind. Coding rounds are the foundation. Without it, even if you perform well in system design or behavioral rounds, a lot of times, if the coding round fails, it won't lead to an offer.# Mock InterviewsI did a few mocks with friends and even a couple of paid platforms. They helped me feel more comfortable talking through problems, but they didn’t magically fix anything. I'd recommend mocking with friend but most of the paid mock interview platforms I tried are too expensive to be worth it. AC# MindsetThere were definitely points where I felt stuck. When I had months without any offers, or interviews that seemed to go well but ended in rejection. That definitely lowered my confidence and made my started doubting myself. What kept me going was just sticking to a simple idea: consistent effort will pay off eventually. If I don't want to do anything or practice any interviews, I force myself to be consistent and practice something everyday. Even if it's just one easy question on a bad day, it keeps me feeling consistent, and don't keep spiraling into endless negativity.Overall, narrowing down prep based on company's question bank and practicing those questions ahead of time is what finally clicked everything into place for me. I hope this post would help someone else too. If you’re still grinding away, hang in there. Everyone’s path and timing are different. Keep learning, stay consistent, and one day you’ll look back and realize all the work was worth it.# Which one should I pick?Finally after sharing, question time, I'm wondering which companies should I pick if anyone's familiar with their culture or worked in one of them before. Meta definitely has a strong brand name, but Coinbase allows for fully remote which is really attracting. Does anyone know which one has better WLB? I honestly value WLB a lot more than compensation.",194,0.82,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rg03si/landed_meta_and_coinbase_offers_after_spending/,2026-02-27 07:24:22,2026-03-01 02:29:22

1re3rf0,Worth leaving job security in this climate?,confusedanteaters,cscareerquestions,"5 YOE (\~2 YOE at current company) - U.S. SWE. Don't feel like I'm learning much and that I'm stunting my growth (potentially career suicide?).Pro's of current company:* Decent pay* Super job security (their last layoffs was \~2000 and it was solely due to new state legislation that f'd them over for a year or two)* Company stock outperforms SP500 (over the past 2-3 decades)* Good WLB (WFH) and you can potentially work for 2-3hr/day and coast. CEO randomly emails entire 1k+ person company telling us to take a Friday off to spend time with family.Con's of current company:* Career/skill growth is important to me and I feel like I know way too little; no support from management (I talk to my manager maybe once every 2-3 months)* 1 coworker (4 YOE junior SWE) and 1 lead SWE (10 YOE) * lead SWE refuses to do anything differently from what he learned 10 yrs ago. I'm talking about stored procedure hell, 500+ line dynamic SQL queries, HTML in DB tables, etc. No problem, they're database focused with deep DB expertise, I can be open minded. Except he's never even heard about query statistics nor query plans. E.g. we have a GET request that scans a table over 5000-10000 times. I don't mean 5000-10000 pages/rows that get scanned; I mean the table itself gets accessed 5000-10000 times. * They used to collaborate by sending code files over Teams. I set up Git in our workflow and it still gets a lot of resistance. Reason? ""I don't really like working with command lines"". * No modern software practices -- no testing, no CI/CD, etc.To be clear, when I say ""leaving"", I mean applying to other jobs. I don't mean leaving without another job.

1rgrsdm,"Brave Software director screening went south fast, these companies are weird",Street_Anxiety2907,cscareerquestions,">I interviewed for a Release Engineer role at Brave Software and the experience was not what I expected. I went in prepared to talk about CI/CD architecture, Jenkins declarative versus scripted pipelines, TeamCity with Kotlin DSL, scaling Chromium builds, artifact promotion, reproducibility, and release orchestration at scale. Instead, the interview focused almost entirely on low-level Linux and networking fundamentals. They wanted exact `df` and `tcpdump` flags, not general debugging approaches but precise switches. The discussion moved into the TCP three-way handshake, congestion control under latency, reciting the OSI model in order, explaining how `iperf` works internally, how to build a VPN tunnel from scratch, kernel parameter tuning, and filesystem internals like inode mechanics.What stood out was what they did not ask. There were no questions about pipeline design, distributed runners, artifact lifecycle management, branching strategies, or optimizing large-scale Chromium builds. Nothing about LUCI, how canary releases are structured, or how GN generates Ninja build files. Those are systems directly relevant to a browser release workflow and stuff I've actually worked with. Instead, the evaluation felt like a screening for a low-level Linux systems engineer who lives in `/proc`, tunes sysctls manually, and debugs networking stacks from first principles.The issue was not technical depth. Deep systems knowledge is valuable. The issue was alignment. If the role is effectively “senior systems engineer” that should be explicit. When a position is labeled Release Engineer, most candidates will prepare to discuss build graphs, caching strategies, deterministic builds, artifact promotion models, and release safety mechanisms. Fast-fire trivia about command flags and OSI ordering, without discussion of process or systems design, does not evaluate how someone actually engineers reliable release pipelines. Besides, I have familarity with all of these tools, but I haven't been a sysadmin for 10 years, so remembering the IPTABLES flags to allow or reject rulesets is something I'd google and automate in Pulumi or Ansible or preferably just create an AWS security group or GCP firewall rule. Seems a bit odd to be using iptables as your first line of defense in 2026. In fact, I'd prefer to be creating builds for a browser in a private VPC with NAT gateways to publish them?It raises a broader question: why do some companies advertise one scope of work but interview for another? If the day-to-day work revolves around Chromium build infrastructure, LUCI orchestration, GN/Ninja workflows, and staged rollouts, then those should be central to the interview. Otherwise, candidates end up preparing for large-scale build engineering discussions and instead find themselves taking what feels like a Linux internals exam.The interviewer was the director and had previously held the role of release engineer, so confused by it! It did not help this guy was rapid firing questions, seemed very annoyed and detached and was very clear he felt he wast wasting his time, and came off combative at times during the discussion. For instance he challenged aggressively why I do not use brave as my browser and made me defend my position. It's a job, not a cult sir? I've tried it out, but I don't have to religiously use software just because I'm interviewing there.Anyone else interview here and find the process here to be a bit odd?",151,0.94,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rgrsdm/brave_software_director_screening_went_south_fast/,2026-02-28 03:23:56,2026-03-01 02:29:22

1rfcymt,How do I politely unassign work from an incompetent coworker,munchingrice,cscareerquestions,"This might be a bit of a vent but I'm honestly so fed up with this man. I'm working on leading a new feature for our app and was assigned this dude to help me out. I just gave him some basic UI work, but his code still ended up being a AI generated mess. He doesn't even have the decency to not make it look AI generated, every single change has a comment before it explaining the code. I've been through three rounds of review with his PR, and it's like he has the inability to comprehend the English language (English is so very clearly his native language). I'm like 'hey can you fix these things' and he does like one change out of the seven things I commented on. At one point I'm like 'hey could you not code this way it's an anti pattern' and he was like 'oh yeah that was just copilot doing some set up for me, i can update that' and in the next iteration not only did he not change that section of code, he added ANOTHER section of code that had that exact same anti pattern.At this point I'd rather just do all the work myself, it would be easier than working with this man. I have no idea how to approach this, my manager/the higher up situation is a bit of a mess right now as there has been an org shift and I'm newer/younger to the team than he is. I don't want to get him in trouble or anything, I just don't want to work with him directly anymore. When I planned out the work for this project I had delegated him work for future sprints, but now I want to take that all back. Honestly, even though I'm swamped with other stuff, it would be less time consuming to just code everything myself.

1reyzy6,Feeling pessimistic about AI,ilovefamilyguy69,cscareerquestions,"I know this sub is filled with these types of posts but I just want to say. I do think a large number of people are coping so incredibly hard about AI in terms of the future of software engineering. I am about to graduate, and it feels pretty hopeless, though I would love to be proven wrong by someone with more knowledge/experience than me. My fear isn’t that “AI will replace software engineers”, I just think the rebuttals are lacking so much awareness of what will actually likely happen. “Companies are hiring more SWE’s, so how can they be replacing us?” Software engineers will not be replaced. I believe that the work will be devalued to the point that software engineering will be nothing more than a slightly higher than entry level job that maybe requires a certification after a short period of training, not a bachelors or higher in computer science. I fully expect to make $20/hr as a software engineer in 10 years and not be able to live in a major city. It will be like working tech support in the 2000s, all we will be doing is fixing a few minor issues here and there but mostly just consulting AI on how to fix AI code. Of course tech support is mostly AI now, so lol. If AI makes sloppy code now, what is stopping it from making good code in 5 - 10 years? What is stopping it from having the ability to check its own work and factor in countless variables that even humans struggle to think of? Of course I am totally open to being wrong and would love to be shown something that negates any of that, I just have yet to see something that factors in the reality of how dystopian our world is and will increasingly become. My only optimism stems from the fact that it seems a large amount of people are vehemently against AI, and hopefully will not want to engage with software they know is AI generated, but I don’t think most people will have a choice, the way we all hate social media but use it daily. My real question is this: what are the “safest” fields that will likely stay for a while? Should I just study COBOL and hope I will magically get hired?",119,0.81,219,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1reyzy6/feeling_pessimistic_about_ai/,2026-02-26 03:15:54,2026-03-01 02:29:22

1rhdpk8,Is it worth still pushing for a CS job when I already have an out?,mitchellediting,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, I'm looking for some insight from those already in the industry if this is my sign to pivot away for the time being. **Education & Part-time experience** I'm a 2024 CS bachelors graduate from a small state school in California, during my studies I worked at a small (4-6 person) gauge cluster/display manufacturer that eventually got absorbed by a local EV startup company. I primarily setup CANbus test benches and implemented UI changes (both front and backend) on their infotainment/HMI systems. Combined I worked at both for about three years (part-time).The gauge cluster manufacturer eventually broke off from the EV manufacturer as they had differing goals. I was supposed to work at the company full time after I graduated, but a potential large-scale customer ended up going bankrupt before the company secured the contract, meaning the funds to hire me full time had gone away. I'm still first in line to be the systems developer if they can secure another big-scale customer, but I'm not holding my breath.I've secured interviews at a few smaller companies (one of which I was in line to get an offer, before they realized they could hire a more experienced developer due to the supply/demand of the market). I also had a controls system interview at Rivian which I failed part of the C++ technical portion (I had been told the interview would be all Python, and I ended up getting grilled on bit manipulation which I wasn't prepared for).**My alternative path** After searching for about 6 months I reached out to my buddy whose dad owns a stone shop (think kitchen/bath countertops + cabinets) and they gave me a job templating which involves driving around to different job sites and measuring/drawing out the stone pieces that would eventually get cut by CNC waterjets/saws. The hours varied and could range from 30-60 hours a week, but the pay was very good even at the start. The job is super interesting but I couldn't help to feel that I should be doing what I've been passionate about since I was a kid, and what I studied since high school. They eventually put me on salary (just below 100K) with a path to make much more in the future if I stick with it and eventually start to manage/program the shop CNC machines. The job would be stable for the foreseeable future (as I cant imagine coastal California housing prices will ever drop considerably, and thus more wealthy homeowners will always have $$$ to renovate). I don't have any ties to where I currently live (other than my parents and the countertop job) and would be open to a SWE position across the country if that's what it takes. But at the end of the day, I don't want to piss away a well paying job that would be way more stable than anything in tech (what tech company could guarantee a \~100K job for years to someone entry level?). I always imagined myself being an engineer of some sort, especially in the automotive field (My interests gravitate heavily towards embedded design and lower-level hardware solutions), but I'm tired of applying to hundreds of jobs just for a few recruiter callbacks. Is this a sign I should take what I have and focus less of my free time on brushing up my C++ and system design knowledge?

I've been struggling to land another job since my layoff last year in January 2025.I graduated as a CS major in 2021 and immediately started interning at a medical equipment company. I can't say that internship gave me much experience since it was in QA, but it did help me secure a full-time position as a Software Tester for a year. I then got promoted to Software Test Engineer, where I got to work with automation frameworks. You could say I got comfortable and didn't really work on any personal projects outside of work. Fast forward three years, and I was affected by a mass layoff at the company.I've been struggling to find a new job since. I only had about four interviews, and I bombed two of them. One I thought went okay with the first screening, but it seemed they wanted someone closer to their office. Another is my most recent interview that I thought went well, but after the first screening, they told me the position had been put on hold. Then, they told me I could actually schedule a second interview a week later, only for them to tell me it was put on hold again two days before our scheduled meeting.All of these were for similar positions in QA and Automation. None of the SWE roles I applied for got back to me, which I understand since there isn't much on my resume that screams ""experienced developer"" (I've included my [latest resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FzrFIkjVyphC9AhWNiFrTD8EnpxEnfHB7hs_E0uBto/edit?usp=sharing) for reference).I know I should've spent last year building out a portfolio of projects, but I felt so unmotivated and wasn't mentally doing well. My parents have been suggesting I go back to school for a master's while the job market is bad. Maybe enrolling in a master's program can reignite something or at least give me more knowledge to feel confident in this field, but I truly don't know which degree I should pursue.I don't really know what excites me anymore in this field. I just want to be able to work and have money so I can live comfortably, travel, and start a family in the future. I feel like being in QA for the past three years has not prepared me with any meaningful experience for a long-term career in tech. I just feel so lost right now, and I would love some advice.",20,0.89,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rfph6p/need_advice_struggling_after_mass_layoff_and/,2026-02-26 23:01:58,2026-03-01 02:29:22
1rdcbme,Are Junior engineers going to be able to adapt to the future of AI assisted coding?,Counter-Business,cscareerquestions,"Previously juniors were expected to get assigned a clearly defined ticket and implement the code. They were judged on how fast they can write code not so much their ability to reason through first principles thinking.Now that ai tools are so good, clearly defined prompts can be oneshot with no coding time required. All of a sudden your coding speed is irrelevant. The only things that matter is your ability to break problems down to first principles, review and evaluate the plan and output and to catch issues early.Essentially AI has replaced the role of the junior from 2 years ago. Are juniors going to adapt to this and begin learning systems engineering earlier or are they going to be left behind? A engineer who is unable to plan and design is useless now. If they don’t verify and fix small bugs with the ai then I end up spending more time in code reviewing than if I was to build the feature myself.Seniors now spend less time reviewing boilerplate and more time iterating on system design, which means juniors must be proactive in planning, reasoning, and taking ownership.",18,0.74,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rdcbme/are_junior_engineers_going_to_be_able_to_adapt_to/,2026-02-24 10:07:40,2026-03-01 02:29:22

1rbv6qc,Would you stay a manager at a company who promotes only based on need and not merit?,MaleficentCherry7116,cscareerquestions,"I'm quickly learning that the company I thought I joined is not the company I was told I was joining. Every company I've worked for in my career promoted based on merit, or at the very least, pretended to.I'm a manager of four very hard working junior developers and was told last week that they have no chance of ever getting promoted unless we can show the company a need for a promotion. For example, the software engineers that work for me are underpaid level 2 engineers. No matter how hard they work, they have no chance of getting to the next level unless we can prove to the company that we have some need for a level 3 engineer. I have a couple of engineers who are very ambitious and have made it clear that they want to advance. They're willing to do whatever it takes, but the hard truth is that their chances of advancing have almost nothing to do with their work.As I understood HR,.they would rather have an overqualified junior developer leave and replace them with a new junior developer than promote them and pay more for a more senior developer.Level 2 developers make around $80K at my company, which is located in Austin, Texas. I've seen the recruiter turn down great software developers who asked for $81k. If you couple that with the fact that there's almost no opportunity for wage growth or promotions, it's going to be very tough on me as a manager.There's a lot more going on with this company than this issue, as you may see from my other posts, but my current thinking is that I'm going to stabilize the office as much as I can and then head for the exit. I hope that's as soon as possible, but I know the market isn't great.

Over time, it became a habit. Now I rarely write code completely on my own without AI assistance.Most of the time things work fine, but there have been a few situations (3–4 times) where errors slipped in or something broke because I didn’t fully understand what was generated.

I don't want to be solely dependent on the software engineering job market, which, while having the most job openings, also has the most uncertain future.While this path sounds good in theory, I’m looking for anyone who has followed a similar route or knows someone who has.

1rbhsp2,Should i go all in on Android app developement ?,Odd_Basket_8045,cscareerquestions,"In my 4th semester, I was introduced to Java for the first time and I genuinely loved OOP. I ended up building an app in Java for both Android and desktop, and that’s when I realized I actually enjoy building software.Being the nerd I am, I started digging into whether Java is enough to build real-world apps and land a dev job. That’s when I found out Kotlin is basically the go-to for Android now, so I switched and started learning it.Fast forward: I’ve built a few apps with Kotlin. I understand a decent amount, but I’m definitely not an expert yet. Still learning, still breaking things, still enjoying the process.What’s messing with my head is this:I’ve used AI agents to implement features in my apps that I haven’t fully learned yet, and they work surprisingly well. Almost too well. It made me wonder—should I really spend years learning all this deeply if tools can already do a lot of the heavy lifting?So I’m a bit confused about direction right now:* Should I double down on Kotlin and Android dev?* Does Kotlin/Android actually have a solid future career-wise?* Is it realistic to aim for a job with this path?* Or am I setting myself up to learn skills that’ll be half-automated by the time I’m job-ready?I enjoy building apps a lot, and I like understanding how things work under the hood.

1rg8yaz,Is this enough of a hostile workplace situation to warrant going to my manager/lead?,HarveyDentBeliever,cscareerquestions,"I feel silly asking because I'm a grown man and all that and haven't been in a situation like this before, but it's really weighing on me mentally now. A lot of dread booting up the work computer every day.I recently started as a Senior Dev at a new company (remote job). Everything had been going great so far, love the place, love the people and culture. Got familiar with my team and started working on things and learning about the environment.There was another Senior Dev who wasn't assigned as my mentor, but was weirdly overly friendly and trying to help me learn things and get situated and I was happy for the help. Well things turned quite sour.Background info: I have a lot of experience in backend REST API services/microservices, so I know all of the best practices and conventions by heart, basically. I was hired to help work on a brand new backend API service as they were moving away from a legacy monolith. As such a lot of the devs are stuck in very dated, bad practice ways, spaghetti code, arbitrary coupled architecture, stuff like that. I found a few simple things that I felt could be easy refactoring wins for the team here since the service was only a month old and just being stood up (don't want to let tech debt compound and wait), and I shared it in a group chat with the seniors and lead dev for their thoughts, dialogue I was used to at prior workplaces where ideas are shared and good ones chosen. Nothing big.The lead agreed with a simple new direction/refactorization that would significantly cut down on development time and get us more aligned with very clear, important industry standards/conventions (it's basically not debatable, it's just an axiom of how you build a REST API). The other ""helpful Senior"" (let's call him Tom), was immediately incensed and Teams called me. We had a weirdly hot debate over something that I have never found to be debatable anywhere else, that the lead had agreed with. Apparently Tom had been in charge of setting this new service up and its architecture and was taking it personally. I tried to keep it as formal and impersonal as possible and simply stand on the merits, using all citations and reasoning possible to talk him down, but he wouldn't budge from certain arbitrary ledges. It's clear Tom is not used to normal backend REST API development and was clinging to legacy monolithic app anti patterns ""as the way we always did it"", etc. Anyway the official decision was that we would use the method I suggested and I kept going on with developing like that.Another couple of days went by, I had a pull request I was putting together to add code to the new service. It included the new style/logic I had proposed and we had agreed would be the way. Once again Tom called me hot and simply wanted to bicker about everything I was doing, every detail, clear obfuscation tactics. As if to make matters worse, Tom was in charge of writing the requirements for these stories, but he had apparently not researched anything he had written so they were all ""possibly wrong"" as he put it, and ""my job to figure out as I worked."" So simultaneously, he wanted to have a requirements discussion at the PR stage (after all the development had been done), AND continue to argue that the proposed new method/style was still wrong. At some point he didn't want to talk anymore and told me I either needed to shut up about it and do as he said, or he was going to escalate to my manager and lead, telling me that he was due to become a lead sometime soon (I hadn't been informed of that either). I was just frozen as I had never been spoken to like this at my job. I was having what I thought was an honest dialogue about work and it turned into a sort of mugging, or shakedown. I told him to go ahead and we hung up. Later that day we had a half-hearted reconciliation call with my lead where we *again* went over the new method and the lead reaffirmed this was the best way.Anyway, the next week obviously I felt kind of shaken and wary and unsure of how to proceed. I did my work as usual and set the PR out vs this service. Tom immediately jumped in and started spamming my PR with endless comments and requests, mostly pedantic and tedious things (like linting, comments, style), which I said whatever to and did. But also lots of puzzling requests, things that contradicted the requirements he had given, new requirements, he would even ask for something to be done then reverse his decision. This has gone on for days now. After a week of this, today, it genuinely feels like a hostile workplace and like he now wants to make sure I can't get anything done, as payback or something. This is all very confusing to me and I'm starting to get quite depressed, hostage situation stuff.If there are any managers or leads, does this qualify as a situation where I can approach them and ask for some help or a resolution, or even a transfer to another team? I know lots of teams are hiring right now as it's a fast growing company. At some point it's going to look like I simply don't get any work done if he buries me with scope creep and shifting requirements on every single PR, and we can't finalize any work until a PR is approved, so yeah, hostage situation.
