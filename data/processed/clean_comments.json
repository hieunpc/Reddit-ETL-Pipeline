A common loading pattern we have been using is:- for streaming: source --> Kafka --> snowflake (snowpipe streaming to tables)- for batches: source --> AWS s3 (~lake) --> snowflake (external tables)- in both cases once in Snowflake: raw staged tables (bronze) --> structured, type-cast, deidentified views (silver) --> Kimball/star/mart views with metadata (gold)I've been liking this system so far. The key difference with streaming and batch in the above cases are that the batch method keeps the raw/bronze data in s3 via external tables, so I guess that's a \"lake\", while the streaming method loads the CDC events into a table resting in the snowflake data warehouse. We use dagster to orchestrate and dbt to run the jobs. The technologies are good - the challenges are behavioural in nature.There's probably a more consistent way to do the above, but it does work. I guess the lake/s3 component just exists because it is simple and cheap to read from some provided s3 dump than to add a \"copy into\" step. We would probably would have done the same for streaming, but snowpipe streaming is a good enough solution at the moment so we can skip a redundant intermediate load to s3.",

Model the infrastructure (make it modular and scalable), create some processes, and give power to the people within some defined boundaries. It’s more work, but I feel it’s easier — after inital cost I can go do streaming, swap out tools, optimize DB tables, create alert systems and stuff.Plus the experience managing your own files, metadata, debugging fucking notebooks is atrocious. But maybe that’s just me. I like sitting in my black terminal with a box cursor….",

Here you learn to be good, while the first is where you learn to be a consultant :face_with_tears_of_joy:But my experience, the business starts by hiring data science / “ML” experts and then they find out they need data. At this moment the salary of the experts is ticking, so when the data engineer comes in, he/she is already behind schedule.

Keep at it consistently, talk with your manager or your manager+1 about the things you're interested in, ideas you have for other things.If you want more, push for more. You're most useful when you're engaged and that'll often show. It doesn't always mean staying with the same company, but often times it does.

But here are some general pointers from when I first started that might help.\\- Learn general data engineering practices / lingo. You're going to hear things like: Data Governance, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage, Data Warehouse, ETL, ELT, Data Lake, OLAP, OLTP, Data Mesh, etc. You don't have to learn everything all at once, or even fully understand everything the first time. Start with who / what you'll work with, expand from there.\\- Learn SQL VERY well. Two sides to this: learn a dialect VERY well and learn a database implementation well. The former will help you with your day to day job as a junior. Learning how to solve common patterns, use common functions, solve common SQL problems, etc will help you for your whole career. For the latter, you would want to really be able to explain things like indexes (which ones to use, why), data storage internals, how to read execution plans and optimize, etc. This is something you should be picking up gradually throughout your career, and I would only expect more mid level / senior engineers to know more and more about these things. For a junior, just begin learning it slowly, but don't stress out too much. \\- Lots of companies are now on the cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP). If your company is one of them, you should learn the stack. Learn the services that your company is using, what role / problem it solves, and how to configure/work with it. Whatever your company uses, be it Azure Synapse/AWS Redshift for data warehousing, ADLS / AWS S3 for object storage, learn that tech deeply, learn how authorization/authentication works on your cloud platform, and those two alone will carry forth across cloud providers. Once you learn what you work with, you can slowly expand outwards if you so desire. \\- Additional point to the above, lots of companies also use Databricks / Snowflake. If applicable, learn what each of those companies provide in terms of offerings or services. IMHO learning either of these opens the door for more data engineering roles in the future.\\- Maybe a controversial tip, but as a software engineer turned data engineer, I personally still apply software engineering principals just through a data engineering lens. That means following best practices when writing clean code, working with things like CI/CD, git, code review, etc. This may seem like a no brainer, but not every shop hires data engineers from the software engineer / CS grad pipeline. Lots of DEs I knew came from data analyst or scientist positions, and had no clue of the SWE fundamentals. I think treating this job as a specialized SWE position will help you a LOT with the menial stuff, and it'll allow you to pivot if you ever want to.I omitted a lot, but I think this is good to start, and I think these are general enough to help you no matter what kind of DE position you're put into.",

In SQL, try to build common patterns in data engineering with some sample data - MERGE INTO, SCD Type 2, some small star schema design. In python, know common patterns used with data structures - list, dict, set and iterators. These will help you in first few months. You can slowly move towards understanding the bigger data engineering architecture - SQL Optimization techniques, ETL, Data Vault modelling. I recommend you get 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering' book and read it once in a while. Re-read the concepts again once every few months as it will add new perspectives as you gain experience. Once you master SQL and python, tools are not going to be difficult for you. You will get to see that irrespective of tool - Spark or Snowflake, Airflow or ADF (or any GUI based orchestration) - the build patterns and outcomes are almost exactly same. While you master technical things, also try to be curious about the business problem you are solving. It doesn't matter if you know 4 different tools, if you cannot answer what business problem you solved. For this, AI would be immensely helpful. Let's say someone wants to build a CRM dashboard for which you are building data model - You might hear terms like Sales Funnel or Conversion rate - Try to ask AI and get an overall perspective of the problem you are trying to solve. You will work with lot of business analysts who will be more than happy if you talk their language. These should be enough for now.",

        "body": "We have a small team of 2 data engineers. We self host airbyte and also airflow. I must say we handle it pretty well. Airbyte does not give any issue whatsoever wrt hosting. We create connections declaratively using terraform and orchestrate them with airflow. We barely touch the UI, only for logs and maybe the occasional manual sync. The open source and number of different connectors are worth it. Only con for airbyte is that in our opinion the normalization step from having the data in json blob to a RDBMS table takes unnecessarily long. It stupid. Therefore, we are pivoting our RDBMS sources to ingest them with Trino. Where we use dbt to write models that serve as ingestion with no transformation. So, Trino + dbt = ingestion. With dbt incremental models you can handle all sorts of ingestion patterns. For our other sources such as sftp, API, sharepoint etc., we keep using airbyte. Around 90% of our sources are RDMS though.Additionally Trino can handle reverse etl easily to another database. Moreover, we can also write them as dbt models maintaining full lineage from ingestion all the way to Reverse ETL and other exposures.",

It can certainly ingest data from SaaS solutions as well as on-prem. It's not as nice/easy to use for ingestion as Fivetran but it does work. Fivetran can get expensive (high MAR usage) when you have cases of large datasets (SaaS or on-prem) that need to get ingested each month but also have low number of updates (meaning you cannot save MAR if rows change may times per month). I had never heard of 'Precog' before but it seems to only have been around since 2020. Not sure I would want to partner with a company this new.Hope it works out for you.",

I've built ETL pipelines both ways over 12+ years.Minimizing dependencies makes sense when you're building something simple and stable that won't need much maintenance. We had a batch job that ran for 8 years with zero external packages beyond requests and psycopg2. Worked great.But rebuilding ORM patterns from scratch is different from just not using one. If you're writing your own query builders, connection pooling, retry logic, and type coercion, you're now maintaining all that code forever. Every bug fix, edge case, and security patch is on you. SQLAlchemy has had hundreds of contributors finding problems you'll never think of.The return code pattern concerns me more than the dependency choice honestly. Python's exception model exists for a reason and fighting it creates code that's harder to read and debug. If your senior prefers explicit error handling, that's fine, but there are Pythonic ways to do it without making every function look like C.The real question is what's the maintenance horizon here. If this is a one time data migration that runs and gets archived, vanilla Python is fine. If this is production infrastructure your team will maintain for years, the cost of rolling your own ORM will compound. Every new team member has to learn your custom patterns instead of reaching for documentation.Worth having a direct conversation about it. Ask what specific concern drives the no dependencies stance. Sometimes it's a bad experience with a package breaking, which is valid but solvable with pinned versions and testing.",

I had nobody telling me no, I just communicated to IT what I was doing and got their blessing in email to cover my ass.Aside from that, I think I was also pretty strict about choosing libraries. I try to stick to stuff that's in the Anaconda suite since it seems to get a buttload of community and support.If a vendor has their own libraries that they actively maintain, I'll use those. If it's a real niche thing by some dude and I can't find a way to feel good about it, hell no. I've never had anything bad happen, but it only takes one time. I don't think my situation is a very good comparison. Nobody was really supporting me or looking at my work. I just packaged code where I could reference a config file like a control table. Send queries, save them as flat files, do the things like package them into this or that or upload them here or there.I was never given the greenlight for an actual database, but it got us by in the interim as we grew. Again, my situation was very specific with weird constraints.If your senior dev dude is having you basically write your own stuff instead of using a library, take that is a chance to reverse engineer a process that many might take for granted. A few years from now you'll be that much more versed in things I guess? Like, I had nobody to review my code. If anyone had to go back and look at it, it was me.

Your fundamental knowledge from work with databases/ ETLs will really help - many of the core concepts are the same.",

So fast that it outpaces the slog it takes to get things implemented at an enterprise company. Your best bet is to find a data engineer or developer role you enjoy, and start using the AI tools to do that job better. Better put, focus on the role and supplement it with AI, don’t focus on a role that only exists to promote some x AI tool for your company. Sorry this is long but one more example: my company has “AI engineers” that spend a lot of time and energy making AI agents specific to certain areas - AI agent for M365, an AI document agent, email agent.. you get the idea. Then a few months later the outside world AI space comes out with agents that essentially work in any space, making a lot of their work extremely outdated in a matter of week/months. I can’t overstate how fast AI is progressing in comparison to how slow companies implement changes.",

In interviews you’re expected to “compile in your head,” which is a different skill.What helped me was practicing a small set of patterns until they felt automatic. Things like group by with aggregations, joins across 2 to 3 tables, window functions for ranking or deduping, and basic subqueries. If you’ve internalized those shapes, most questions are just variations.Also practice explaining your thinking out loud while you write. Even if the query isn’t perfect, interviewers often care more about how you reason about edge cases and data shape. If you blank, start by restating the tables and columns you have, then sketch the result you want. That usually gets your brain moving again.",

        "body": "At 6 months you should be well on your way to \"doing some things\" and at 12 months you should be mostly self reliant and productive. So you're still in that window. You can't make up for the tech debt and disorganisation of some places.Documentation is a mess absolutely everywhere and those consolidation projects take years and fail every time, in that there will be N+1 repositories. And then they will do it again. It's the biggest boondoggle in the business. Funnily, they always go hard on permissions on that latest repository and will require multiple panel reviews and checkins for literally anything you want to put in, to the point it's impossible to use. So don't think about that anymore. Focus on building your own documentation silo wherever it is and however you want to. The goal is a foundation for your own work, not a general thing for other people. And you've got other responsibilities? That's also common. Try to see it as a good thing in that you get some extra job stability. That aside, are people complaining? Have you looked around and realised there are others who have been there for years or decades and not pulling their own weight? lol. They probably created most of these problems too!This is all extremely common. If you move on now you will likely experience the same thing and worse, so my advice: seeing as you are not fully invested in this job, try to see it as your personal playground to try some other working and thinking styles, until you find something that lets you function there without the anxiety.If anyone ever asks something you don't know, you're not the expert on that, but will try to find someone (and often, people will just forget it entirely!) If anyone calls you out on not knowing every atom in the universe, just repeat the same thing. Some people are aggressive like that but it's not you, they just have it in for easy prey. You'll do okay.",

I'd say without a doubt you made the right choice to focus on SWE over DS. The thing you actually get in DS is about Statistics-with-programming and how to properly employ research against data. All good things, not really what we're concerned about with DE. 2. Since you're in SWE and looking at design patterns, keep in mind what it would be like if the only thing you had to care about was the data inside the objects. A lot of folks coming from a SWE background focus on the abstract object versus what is contained by the object. To move to DE you have to care a lot more about the latter. 3. Things that will be evergreen in DE: python, SQL, databases, warehouses, data modelling (although the meaning of this varies person to person, company to company, much to my chagrin). Focus on these. Python at an expert level (focus on the data packages. Polars, Duckdb. And DB packages. Pscyopg, etc.), at least 1 RDBMS 1 NoSQL and 1 DB system you're just interested in, SQL to an expert level which will give you passable knowledge for most Warehouses as well. 4. Tools that will be evergreen in DE: Airflow, Docker, GitHub, K8s. TOML/YAML as well. DBT is very good to know as well. 5. And that the issue is that job descriptions are very heavily implying mastery while the actual job wants a jack of all trades. Get good at probing for this information in interviews with tech staff. Take advantage of mock interviews if you have the chance.",

So if you are plainly asking for data to model and not aware of the actual requirements or insights, then i will recommend the data to load as data vault until silver, which is composed of raw vault ( bronze ) and business vault ( silver ). Then you can do dimensional model on silver gradually as you gradually try to find the questions you want to answer. This is one of the many patterns currently practiced in big enterprises. You will learn integration patterns (conformed layer) not just modelling. Dont dimensional model just because you have data. It depends on what you want to do with it. I wont dimensional model if that goes to data science or ai space.",

That is all irrespective of AI.I do agree with your idea of treating metrics like APIs, that’s a really key thing to get right for AI, and you’ve got some other really good practices in there too.

The other is to think about distinctions between: abstraction, generalization, opacity, and other similar \"operating at high level\".Usually abstraction in engineers context means finding a simplifying solution over otherwise individuated problems. Example, any math theorem you learned in school, or theory in engineering. So the abstractions applicability is limited to the details covered.Thus how abstract is your problem space and what are the details, in rough terms it's variety. Then do the solving & problem abstractions vary in requisite ways?So to answer, if you are truly lost in core syntax and implements like debugging, you don't fully know the abstraction. But does not mean anyone cannot use the abstractions, just being general to a problem or solution. With all the abstractions these days, you won't know everything and a general knowledge is often where one starts.Lastly your final questions around AI model roles, my feel this is opacity not (your) competence. The core vector and matrix abstractions in AI and context models are not that deep, nor new. But given they're \"cutting edge\"-ness often these models are purposefully opaque. So if you simply cannot see detail, don't blame your abstraction skills lol",

The \"interface\" changes with model updates. Your DBT model doesn't randomly decide to restructure itself, but your AI-generated pipeline might.The debugging question is real. When traditional abstractions fail, you trace through layers until you find the bug. When AI abstractions fail, you're often just... prompting again and hoping.

I work with data teams and use Claude Code daily, so let me share what actually matters.The vibe coding thing you're seeing is real for building quick demos and web apps. But for analytics engineering work, especially in niche domains with messy data like you describe, it doesn't work that way. The hard part of your job is not writing SQL, it's knowing which parameter to look at based on domain knowledge. That's exactly where AI struggles.Where AI actually helps me is the tedious stuff. Debugging weird errors, generating boilerplate tests, converting between formats. I'd say 6/10 useful is about right for debugging help. Where it falls apart is anything requiring judgment about your specific business [context. My](http://context.My) honest take after a year of heavy Claude usage for data work is that the people who are no longer doing anything technical are probably working on much simpler problems than yours. When you're eyeballing raw files to figure out which field is correct because documentation doesn't exist, there's no prompt that replaces that institutional knowledge.Try Claude for the parts of your job you already know how to do but find tedious. That's where it shines. Skip the hype about agents replacing analytics engineers, that's not happening anytime soon for anyone doing real domain-specific work.",

Not know what is the desired end result, or stakeholders not knowing what they want and you having to guess that is not. It's not clear to me what is the situation here, but you can use AI for both:- use AI to generate documentation of where each parameter/column is, what it describes, how to query it, etc. Review that documentation for mistakes/errors and rewrite/fix what needs to be fixed in the documentation. Then, the AI can refer back to this documentation when generating code, saving you time- ask AI to clarify requirements, or identify information gaps, and draft responses to requests that are not clearUsing AI to code is fine and useful, but you said that's not the part you struggle with. So try to think of ways to use AI for the parts that you actually struggle with. Maybe AI won't find the information for you, but once you find it, have it create documentation that will help and save you time in the future.",

Sometimes by myself, sometimes feeding it back in with my notes.At the bottom, I let it create code for me where it is well defined. I'll ask for functions or skeleton templates that I can go back and flesh out later. If I've broken it down cleanly enough, it is another round with AI to fill that part out.I also review what it puts together for me 100% and tweak it a little bit to fit my preferences and style.What I don't do is have AI do something I don't know intimately. For example, If I need to connect to a new service and I don't know how the APIs are laid out, I will figure that out before I ask for anything to be created; though I am willing to ask AI to narrow down the documentation and examples to what I am specifically interested in so it takes me less time to get that knowledge.",

        "body": "The way that I have ended up managing Data Infra in a couple of roles now is by being able to rapidly produce a prototype. You'll want to pick up, and use regularly, systems like Docker and Kubernetes. Even for your own small data projects. This will introduce you into that world where those things are heavily used. These are also cloud-agnostic meaning no matter what service provider your future employer(s) use you'll be squared on this front. In the same vein are things like VPCs and general networking which I spend more time debugging than anything else in DE/DataOps. After that you can get into the specifics of particular platforms. As far as practicing is concerned: Start with `docker`. Learn the ins and outs of taking arbitrary python code you have and stuffing it into a container. Learn how to find images, how Dockerfiles work, run into the issues so you can troubleshoot them. Then see what it takes to incorporate tools you may be using to develop your code into the dockerfiles. Things like `uv`. If you can have one system managing both your local dev and your container builds you have less points of failure to troubleshoot. Then grab `k3s` for local development. This is, notably, \"actual\" kubernetes. That is opposed to things like minikube which are \"kubernetes in docker\". Nothing wrong with that, but when we're talking about \"rapid\" prototyping, k3s is as close as it gets to just managing raw k8s on your local system. You'll probably immediately want to grab `helm` as well. Read up on `k8s`, `k3s`, `helm`, and `kubectl`. Play around with trying to get your docker containers that do things or expose things up onto k3s locally. See what it takes to setup `postgres` on kubernetes, and how to expose it so you can communicate with it externally.Outside of those things, which are more typical of `self host first` shops, you can likely find playgrounds around specific tech. I believe `databricks` recently opened up a playground of sorts. Snowflake may as well, but I don't honestly remember. Google on `GCP` used to give you like $300 in credits, plus they have the open BigQuery datasets you can mess around with. I think all of these things are secondary or tertiary things to focus on though, as they are mostly provisioned and managed for you from an infra standpoint. It's not bad to see what the platforms look like behind the scenes, though!I find Data infra specifically very interesting. It's got some nuance that can apply to standard web infra, but often times deviates from it. Which ends up as a nice challenge and break from the typical DE work for me!",

I have thought of studying Linux (more than your regular CLI commands) and from there jump to Docker. I am following a book on Ubuntu and as the book progresses it introduces the concept of Docker in Linux in chapter 10 I believe, that's why I had thought of it as a good path to follow. Additionally, I am reading an intro book to Networking, I think is called \"Networking for Sysadmin\", it is the only book I've found is easy to follow on that topic with practical examples. From there my idea is to start doing labs in Azure and Amazon, to start getting hands-on experience in building infrastructure with IaC and then finally visit K8, possibly get a cert on that if time allows. Of course, my day to day for the next year will be familiarising myself with Snowflake, DBT and learning how to use Claude to write more efficient code. This is a 2 year plan. Alternatively, I could go the Masters way, and enrol in one to get a better picture of CS as a whole, but I feel there are many topics that I don't need, and my best bet would be focusing on the tools that I use day to day and potentially the ones I could use in a couple of years.",

If that’s the case, then your business needs to find or create a way to enforce data contracts with the source data properly.

Alerting on those meant we caught issues within minutes of ingestion rather than days later when someone noticed a dashboard looked wrong.The other thing was making rollback trivial. If bad data gets through, can you restore the table to its previous state in under five minutes?

How did you advocate for engineering in this case?”I had one interview where the recruiter literally reached out to me prior and told me to MAKE sure I had the STAR method down.

Before the snapshot hits create\\_auto\\_cdc\\_from\\_snapshot\\_flow, you run a step that carries forward rows for items currently in their grace window. Keep a small side table tracking how many consecutive days each product ID has been missing. Under 3 days, you re-inject the last known row into the snapshot. At 3 days or more, you let it fall off and the CDC engine sees it as a real delete.For backfill, run it outside the DLT pipeline. A separate script that iterates through dates sequentially, calls the pipeline with a date parameter, and validates Silver row counts before proceeding. Trying to do date iteration inside a DLT definition is a pain with state management.Bronze cleanup is safe once you have done a sanity check that Silver covers your full date range. The risk is if a backfill needs to go further back than 7 days, so just validate before you purge.",

The math is nontrivial. Linear algebra, especially rotation matrices and quaternions for coordinate transforms, and the Newtonian equations you'd learn in a 1st year calculus based physics class, and also a bunch of other stuff that I had to learn/relearn to work here. (I have an undergrad degree in math.) I don't have to *implement* everything, but I do need to understand what's going on conceptually and use appropriate mathematical libraries correctly.2. The folks I work with are PhDs, so a lot of building a pipeline is listening, very carefully to what the (let's say) rocket scientist wants and building exactly that. No creative metrics here. The physics is the physics. I ask a lot of questions about what is supposed to happen through a series of calculations. What does a good result and a bad result look like? Where are the best places along the way to spot-check things like an intermediate matrix becoming ill-conditioned?3. The PhD's are not hired for coding ability. I need to detangle messy MATLAB code to turn into data pipelines that I actually want to own and maintain over time.I work on the \"easy\" stuff that still fits in a Postgres database. So, I use python and other fairly standard tools. I want to upskill into rust/pyO3 which I'd hope would make some of the calculations complete faster than numpy/scipy. I suspect I do a lot more software engineering than my retail data engineer peers: There is a lot of custom code written specifically for our particular uses/devices that just isn't available in open source libraries or even as a commercial product (besides the stuff sold by my employer and our direct competitors).",

You can even kind of simulate that functionality using old fashioned SQL, but it's a huge pain.If, like most folks in our situation, you have no resources, no support, and no external understanding of the probelm, I've tackled it in Python. If your data isn't \"Big Data\" you can basically use Python to iterate over records like it's replaying an event stream. I basically have it scrutinize the identifiers on each event and ask \"Have I seen any of these identifiers in prior events I just processed? No, alright I'll give them a master, internal warehouse ID. Yes, I'll go back and find the master ID I gave some of them previously and assign it to this batch.I'm usually not a big fan of probablistic methods so I only count observations where there is some real identifier in common.",

Our dbx admin was clueless having never worked in Postgres beforeAnd why are there like 7 different identifiers instead of 3 to talk about the database, schema table? (The dbx compute, the dbx catalog, dbx schema, Postgres database, and the Postgres schema too maybe?) the only thing in common is table names and schema. Everything else is differentThere is no way in SQL editor to safely know what actual Postgres instance you’re in besides the compute name at the top which may not line up with the database name and also if it’s too long will be abbreviated spelling trouble whether you’re in dev or stage or potentially even prod. Open a new tab you better triple check which compute instance you’re in otherwise you’re going to have a bad day.This seems like a rushed implementation on the paid for version",

It allows you to virtualise the parquet files (and other sources) as a single db table (recent iterations also work with Delta tables with limited features, but I believe pushdown and partition pruning are supported) which removes the need to have the separate staging layer. I then just set it up with ‘staging’ model files which query the external table and set the right column types because it will do things like read your columns that are supposed to be CHAR(8) as VARCHAR(MAX) since most flavours of parquet that I’m aware don’t have that extra column metadata, and the rest of the project builds from there as normal. I had a similar thought process while I was designing this in terms of it enabling an easier transition to a proper lakehouse architecture in future, and it does help a bit with managing schema drift, but for an established DWH I’d be doubtful about whether the juice is worth the squeeze - the only reason I did it is because everything is new.",

I have another question then: if we wouldnt use linked servers what else would you propose so dbt in the dev environment has the same data pretty much at the same time as the prod environment. We also have 20-40 api scripts through azure functions ingesting to bronze prod. And a couple of bigger source systems that ADFs copy activity handles. But i wouldnt want to clone stuff and insert everything twice. Also the DDL statements to create and prepare th tables for dev ingestions would be needed twice too. Should we backup and redeploy the prod bronze db maybe after each time? Is Linked Servers really a bad option and what do you mean with cross env drift and permission weirdness? I would give the dev server read permission to the prod bronze only",

When Pandas infers types from Postgres it sometimes gets more specific than PySpark did, especially with numeric precision and timestamps. You end up with timestamp with tz vs without, or int32 vs int64, and the UNION fails.What worked for us was adding a casting layer in the raw zone specifically for the new ingestion path. Basically land the data as-is into a staging table, then have a simple transform that casts everything to match the old schema before it hits the raw layer the VIEW references. Keeps the VIEW logic clean.On question 2, if you are switching to the new ingestion permanently anyway you might consider letting the new types be canonical and backfilling the old data with a one-time cast migration instead of maintaining two type systems forever. Depends on how much historical data and how painful the backfill would be.",

For example, if the old is a varchar and the new is an int, use varchar - you can implicitly convert any int into varchar but there's no way of getting non-numeric varchars into ints. The downside of this is that you're losing the benefit of having an appropriate data type, so you're probably going to use more storage and invite unoptimised behaviour by downstream tooling.Another consideration is whether the old data will actually change at all. Using our example, if the historic data was stored as varchar but you can query to confirm all the values can be converted to int, simply do that in the view. You would only want to do this if you're sure that the historic data is static though, because if not you're inviting a failure condition if anyone puts non-numeric data in the varchar.",

For large datasets I typically save the data to s3 as a parquet and then copy to a temp redshift table, and then copy from the temp to the target table. Define the types of the temp table to match your data from python then cast to the desired types in the query that copies from temp to target. Another benefit of that is that the copy query can join or anti-join with the target table to implement upsert or insert-ignore logic.Instead of the join view I would recommend copying the old data to the new table and then just appending it with new data.",

There’s an enormous amount of money invested into AI right now, which means that these companies providing it are feeling serious pressure to make it profitable. So far, nobody really has. We all see at this point that it’s a huge bubble similar to the .com bubble, and we’ll probably see similar result - AI is likely here to stay, but it probably won’t be used very differently than how it’s being used today and the demand to put AI into every app or service will die down. In the programming world, that means that we’ll probably get used to tools like Claude Code or Copilot and adopt patterns where we let it write the boring parts for us, but skilled programmers will still be valuable when building complex software while using these tools. We’ll likely see a knock-on effect of even cheaper compute as all these data centers are built to meet a demand for AI will inevitably to drop off.In the short- to medium-term, there’s probably a pretty penny to be made by contractors who can untangle the mess of code written by companies who went overboard on writing their software with AI.So I guess TL;DR is that if you’re a total AI Luddite you should probably at least experiment with AI to get used to where it’s helpful and where it isn’t. If you’re an AI hype beast, you should probably make sure not to let your actual technical skills atrophy because the future where AI writes 100% of the code is just not coming. If you’re still programming pretty much like you always have but spotting the cases where you can use AI to save yourself some time, that’s probably where we’ll all be over the next few years",

You should be able to run your code, and see that a chrome browser opens up, navigates to the site you specified in code, does the things you expected, and then shuts down. Suggestion: Have it perform this 10 times, and you calculate the average times between each action. Gives you brief superficial performance data.* Read all the rules of a large international lottery, then emulate it in a script. Write a for-loop or an equivalent that prints every X amount of money spent on lottery tickets until you hit the jackpot. It'll teach you basics about for-loops, ToString(), classes and to avoid lotteries.* Create an API that you can test using Postman/Insomnia (real world valuable experience).* Create a windows service (if you are learning .net that is), that you can install, start, stop, restart in windows gui (also valuable experience).* Install Docker Desktop or the equivalent on your computer. Then create a containerized small project, doesn't matter what the project is. What matters is that it runs inside the container and you can interact with the project through the exposed port (very valuable real world experience).* Create a project where you split its component into several containers, then orchestrate them through Docker Compose or an equivalent (very valuable real world experience).",

These are all high level tasks that previously entered at mid level stage and grew in importance as you moved towards principal/staff engineer position. Coding agents cut out the lower rungs of the ladder and now you need those skills from the get go. Your knowledge of software design, system design, understanding of product development and life cycle, the thinking and the vision and where your value now lies as an ai assisted software engineer. I am investing my time into getting comfortable with agentic engineering, ramping up my system design knowledge, software patterns, technology and system solutions to common problems - everything that I need to know when AI is bullshitting me, when it is heading in the wrong direction, what are viable options etc. The profession is changing, and being able to wrangle syntax alone is no longer enough.So, I would say it is not about being ai resistant, it is more about being ai effective.

The fact that many people is leaving their companies is, for me, a hint that they do not have much more world-changing AI in their labs than what they have been publishing.Regarding being 28, it all depends on how much you want to invest in it, if you invest 4 or 5 solid hours daily, in a few years you will have more coding experience than most people who started at 18.",

You'll end up with a poorly performing mess, but that's okay. You have all the pieces. Now make it clean. Refactor to a solid structure that is maintainable and flexible. And finally make it fast. Optimize, profile, and optimize again. Most people burn out, trying to get everything right on the first attempt. It's important to keep the passion alive, and keep focused on one thing at a time.",

Start with core Python concepts: syntax, classes, functions. But then I’d recommend learning about SOLID/Clean architecture and use it to build an API project for practice. Separate things into application, services, domain, and repo layers. Learn how to apply abstractions with protocols and ABCs, and injecting with FastAPI depends(). Start with just a REPL app if you must while you get the core structure, then evolve into fastAPI. (You can just write to a json file until you get a DB connected) But I’d look into fastAPI, sqlalchemy for ORM, Alembic for migrations, pydantic for serialization and DTOs. Etc. You have a lot to learn with Python alone. Could also throw in unit testing with pytest, also start thinking about docker, see if you can get a dockerfile + compose to spin up your app in one container and Postgres in another (I’d recommend focus on Postgres). It’s a lot if you want to go full stack with Python. It’s also not like C# where repo and unit if work patterns are implemented for you. So start getting comfortable with repository and unit of work design patterns.",

Stick to the scheduled hours, and don’t study anything else until you finish the roadmap.7.

        "body": "Coding is difficult (saying it as a professional developer) but indeed there is a whole lot of lack of confidence that filters people out. People like you do not send your CVs, LinkedIns, Githubs, etc. Or they hesitate a lot before they start applying to places.Then there are people who do send but visibly are not confident during the interview. I do not mean that one should start lying and exaggerating things but I mean, be confident in what you know and in what you do not know. \"Yeah, I do not know frontend development but I'm considering learning it.\" or \"I'm a backend developer but having to do frontend tasks seems to be a good challenge.\" I have told these. Not during interviews but during 1:1s when I was moved to a fullstack position. And my boss was fine. Because she saw that I actually show an interest in improving myself. If I would be \"I'm worried about frontend tasks. I really hope I will not get any of these. Backend tasks are much safer bet.\" then that would be bad. Lack of confidence, no wish to grow, perhaps even stagnation.Then lack of confidence when being on probation period. Cool, you got hired! You passed all these interviews. But the next 2-5 (however long time period) months are also critical. Either you pass the probation period or the company has to tell that \"Sorry. We considered it but we do not see how things will progress from here.\" Perhaps different countries have different laws and such, but where I live, a person is put on a \"test period\" of a couple of months before his contract is finalized (meanwhile the contract is temporary). So, some juniors, they are not confident. They do not ask questions. They do not share their thoughts. They do not participate in discussions over new tasks and such. They get stuck and do not voice it out. They start comparing themselves with younger colleagues who have been in the field for longer time, then get some irrational fears, and let it affect themselves even more negatively.What I'm trying to say: this field indeed is difficult. But one should be confident in himself. Have a growth mindset. When you see you are lacking in something do not see it as a weakness but see it as an opportunity to learn new things. When you see that people are more experienced and more skilled than you then do not see this as a threat but as an opportunity to learn from them.",

Apply as you learn, doesnt have to be complex stuff, just get the reps in. Learnt arrays? Cool, now practice appending to the array, removing from the array, getting an item at x index etc. Basics.The stumbling block also comes in where the parts is all there is. Theres no holistic understanding of how to apply it all. I was there too. Guess what helped... Build shit.A learner needs to put it all together to make something work, it involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller actionable steps. Pseudocode can come in handy here where ou focus on the flow and shape of the code without worrying about methods and built-in functions. Once you have a plan then you can go into details.For example, lets build a lasagna. Ok, how tf do i do that, break it down into smaller pieces, stuggling, then google the steps, find out, look for solutions. Ok so we need 3 parts to build this, a meat sauce, bechamel sauce, and lasagna sheets. Cool cool how do i make the fucking meat sauce bro and wtf is bechamel... Google it, search, look for answers. Ok sweet so i need the following for a simple meat sauce but how do i put it together... Google it, search for answers....its all an interative process. Tldr: its all about, I dont know so i find out and apply it. Break it down into smaller and smaller problems until you can.",

A football player don't think he'll improve by only reading books about football. Another pitfall is to only practice the language in some situations.

        "body": "Professional software developer here, and I agree with everything you've said. Building on your post, here's an analogy from my own experience that I think supports your point:I learned to write code before I learned to cook. I was equally interested/enamored by each of these skills when I first started to learn them.One of the first things I learned to cook was [stir fried chicken with rice noodles][stir-fry]. For at least a month, I made this dish several times per week. This repetition afforded me space to observe and learn - I noticed when the color of some ingredients started to change in the cooking utensil (an observation I wasn't previously able to make). I started adding other ingredients to the dish because I had learned some intuition (which gave me confidence that even if my didn't turn out great, it wouldn't be terrible) over repeated exposure. Slowly, I was able to rely on visual cues without needing to set a timer (\"hey! the broccoli is starting to look like it's cooked\" instead of \"it's coming up on 3min, time turn down the heat\"). This is how I learned how to cook and how to understand what I was seeing on the stove. Prior to this, I had watched many cooking shows/videos and family and friends had even tried to show/teach me - all of this was \"tutorial hell\" and I never felt like I knew what I was doing. One lesson from this experience is that \"know what you're doing\" doesn't come before you build something for the first time. It's actually the other way around - you learn by doing stuff. When I say that, I am reminded of providing tech support for my grandma. She'd always be afraid that she was going to accidentally break something. This is a real concern with programming languages - you could potentially delete files or crash your OS through some bug. But starter/learning projects rarely expose you to that functionality. If you're still afraid, consider using a virtual machine. It wasn't until I read this post, OP, that I made the connection between this cooking practice and something else I did when I was learning to write code (back in 2007 - I'm old, I guess). After I first learned python, I would often (and for no real reason other than \"I like to write code\") write a decimal to binary function in python. Sometimes it would take me a long time to write (30min was not uncommon), sometimes I'd write it in a few minutes. The point was never to write it quickly to \"beat my personal record\". The point was always to practice this new skill. Sometimes I'd write it recursively, sometimes I'd try something different.But this repeated practice did for me, the same thing that repeatedly cooking the stir fry did. I was able to study different ways of solving the same problem and hone my understanding of how python works. Now, I didn't write my decimal to binary converter every day - I think the most frequently I did this was \"once a week\" for a few weeks (then, about once a month, and I eventually started to use it to test whether I liked a new keyboard). At the time for me, it was like re-reading my favorite passage out of my favorite fiction book (the was before Netflix, so that might translate today as \"rewatching my favorite episode of a TV show\").That's really the secret sauce - practice for familiarity. When I use LLMs today, the value for me is that the LLM writes the code. The time savings for me comes from not having to physically type out the code. The thinking that goes into it beforehand (what architecture to use, what algorithm to use, what data structures to use, how to model the data flow and problem solving, etc; If I haven't yet made these decisions, I have a conversation with the LLM to help me decide) - I communicate all of that to the LLM and let it do very little beyond writing the code I described.It does feel counterintuitive that learning to write code requires as much time and practice, because this learning time is often compared to learning other skills that require more time and practice to acquire and gain proficiency in. The key realization is that while learning to write code is faster than (say) learning to become a neurosurgeon, it still takes a lot (nowhere near zero) of time and effort. And while the proficiency threshold to make a meaningful contribution is lower than in many other professions, that threshold is not a plateau - the proficiency curve does go a lot higher and I think this might be one reason why beginners often get a wide range of feedback (from experienced developers with a wide range of proficiency levels)Ok I took a couple of rambling tangents (sorry, it's Sunday afternoon), but the takeaways are:1. repeated exposure and practice are the key to escaping tutorial hell1. the proficiency threshold to \"build something\" is much lower to escape tutorial hell than it is to (for example) contribute to an existing project in a professional or opensource capacity1. the probability of accidentally making a catastrophic error is very low1. the notion that repeated exposure improves proficiency is not new (my cooking story), thought that's maybe more of a \"hard truth\" than a \"comforting fact\" as I had originally intended it to be[stir-fry]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8f752SdeAI",

It’s possible the thing you want to build has never been built before or at least hasn’t been built before the way you want to. So you need to go out and find info about how to build the pieces and parts that you can, and extrapolate and experiment with the rest until it works the way you want. Along the way you have to make a myriad of decisions that will all teach you about architecture or storage or performance or what have you.

If not, then see if you could replace some of the apps you use with open source alternatives, or simply take a look at fairly popular repos on GitHub and see if there’s any tool that catches your attention and start learning how to use it.Then think about a feature you’d like it to have or try document bugs you encounter and start working on fixing them. By that I mean: read the project’s description and documentation, take a look at the code base and use LLMs to quickly figure out how things work behind the scenes.

You setup the code and pick an issue and try reproducing the issue and then determine the fix for it and write a neat technical report and paste it as a comment explaining how your fix works and how the application runs after you fix it and request them to see if they can review your PR* common mistakes to avoidPutting in no effort and using AI to make superficial fixes (eg commenting out the code that prints the error and claiming that you've fixed it etc). Making no effort to learn what the project is about and just choosing it because open source looks good on your resume. Commenting on random issues with 'Can you assign this to me' or 'Can I work on this' instead of actually putting in the work and then posting the solution there. Your job is to make their lives simpler and to contribute in a positive way, if you're making them put extra work then you're not helping open source but actively setting it back (especially if you end up not contributing and giving up midway)",

Figure out the mouse works and screen regions, callbacks, etc. You’ll abandon this but you gained insight into what’s going on. All of that mouse info is tracked in real frameworks. Be aware of it and use it.Now start higher languages. Try some procedural and some functional. You’ll start to like one. Next, learn threads and asynchronous coding. Wrap your head around the different ways languages and systems handle threads and how not to shoot yourself in the foot.In parallel with learning threads, learn I/O, bottlenecks, buffering, streams, etc., combining these with threads and async code. Do extreme tests and see how quickly you can process insanely large files. How many large files in parallel? How about millions of small files?Then there is database connectivity. Combine the async IO stuff and now start getting structured. Learn file types, how to process them, filter them, project to new types, get things in and out of databases. What kind of database works for different problem sets?At this point, you can good job in most shops.To take things next level, learn AI and machine learning. Learn the problems they solve and how to implement them. This will give you insight into where the industry will be.So the chain is understanding data. Data turns into knowledge. Knowledge turns into wisdom. Turning data into knowledge means identifying patterns. These patterns are timeless, like identifying faces in a photo, or are a time series like identifying engaged customers based on purchase history. 15 years ago pattern identification was costly and hard. It has since turned into toolset. We can identify more and more patterns now. And this isn’t going to slow down any time soon.",

I did have to implement various data structures and algorithms using the language itself without any libraries. You could also learn stuff like Boolean algebra to get a handle on the theoretical underpinnings of CS.

I don't really care if I learn anything from the tutorial or not, and the application doesn't really matter, except that it has to use (some of) the same libraries that I intend to learn.Then I convert one of my old projects to this new stack - e.g. I have so many CRUD backend and frontend applications, that I know all the ins and outs of, so I try to re-implement one of them. Looking at my old code in one editor, implementing features one after another in another editor, and every time I get stuck, I look for either documentation, stack overflow answers or even tutorials for that single part. I like to learn a lot allround about the new stack at first, and then only when something strikes me as interesting or different, I might take a deep dive into that, but I don't want to learn every single detail one step at a time - as most documentations otherwise seem to suggest.I have a few \"basic\" projects that I always implement, like a \"guess which number I'm thinking of\" game, a small shoot'em up game, a simple text-adventure, and a CRUD frontend as well as backend, and pick whichever looks most like what I want to build in this new language.Once I've reimplemented the old project, I begin my new, actual project, what I intended to use the new stack for - first by planning the features required, and which ones I already know how to implement based on my reimplementation, and which ones I have to learn more about - and then I learn about those things in depth if needed!",

Deploying to production, managing microservices, building full commercial projects in 4 days — that's not intern work, that's senior developer responsibility being handed to someone they can pay intern wages. The fact that you're pulling it off doesn't make the expectations reasonable, it just means they found someone willing to absorb an unreasonable workload.The \"it builds resilience\" crowd isn't entirely wrong — you'll come out of this with real production experience that most interns never get. But don't confuse surviving a bad situation with it being a good learning environment. A proper internship gives you mentorship, code reviews, reasonable deadlines, and the space to actually understand what you're building instead of just shipping it.Practical advice: document every single thing you're building and deploying right now. Screenshots, architecture decisions, problems you solved — all of it goes in your portfolio. This experience, framed correctly on a resume, is genuinely valuable. Then when the internship ends, use that portfolio to land a job at a company that treats its engineers like humans, not disposable output machines. The market for people with real production deployment experience is solid, even for juniors.",

The use of a contiguous memory layout, as well as enforcement of homogenous contents, are both secondary aspects of what makes something an array. An array is an ordered data structure which has (close to) constant time access to its contents by index. It’s better to think of these data structures in terms of the performance guarantees they provide for different operations than to try to focus on their implementations. Implementations can involve all sorts of hairy performance optimizations which obscure the intent of the data structure.The weird thing about JS arrays, and ArrayList objects compared to something like C or Java’s primitive arrays, is that they allow the data structure’s size to efficiently dynamically grow. The other weird thing about JS arrays is that they can be sparse, but that’s something you hopefully will never have to deal with. To be pedantic, it’s pretty common for arrays to “hold” heterogenous contents in languages other than JS. I use scare quotes because arrays of objects generally don’t hold objects themselves, but rather pointers to those objects. In languages with subtyping (like Java) the pointers may indeed point to multiple different types of objects as long as they are all subclasses of the array’s declared generic argument. A typed language like Java thus allows arrays to hold heterogenous data, but requires you to access the data as though it is homogenous (unless you use an unsafe downcast). Dynamically typed languages like JS and Python are more permissive, but it’s (IMO) a difference of degree, not a difference of kind.",

The important part is the \"sequential\" part. You can look things up by index, and the items appear in predictable slots. Contrast with an \"associative array\" (no analogue in vanilla C, `Map` (and arguably `{}`) in JS, `Map` in Java). These are non-sequential. You look up by key, not by index. Some associative arrays define a predictable _iteration_ order (Java's `LinkedHashMap` uses insertion order, Java's `TreeMap` uses natural key ordering), but that's not true of all of them (Java's `HashMap` provides no guarantees).",

And this *can* be used as an Array Data **Structure** if you want to, but it can also be used as a lot of other Abstract Data Structures, e.g. a **List**, a **Stack**, a **Queue**, and even a **Map** (or Dict) as long as you limit yourself to using integers as keys. And of course, as with every other variable in the dynamically typed language, you can always change the type of any variable, including any element in your array, at any time.JavaScript do have actual Array Data **Structures**, but not as direct data types defined by the language, rather as custom objects that you have to instantiate. Take a look at [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global\\_Objects/TypedArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) for further information.

In Javascript, everything is pretty much the [Any type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_type), which in other languages may be called things like `Object` or `interface{}` or `void*`. So it's entirely expressible as a type, and as such the array is homogenously `array[Any]` or however you'd want to express the type.The other thing is that pretty much any language has some affordance for creating some sort of union, which you can then use in arrays. It will vary how ergonomic and error-prone it is, but in any case you can cook up an array of data that holds heterogenous base types.As in, you can define some union of integers and floats and put that in an array, which will be homogenous in that it only accepts that union and rejects stuff like strings, objects, etc; at the same time it'll be heterogenous in that you'll need to have some way of knowing which of the types in the union a given entry is.So the idea of homo/heterogeneity can be misleading,* because any sort of collection will always be homogenous if it's well-typed: all the elements in some collection `C[T]` are of type `T`* but may still be heterogenous in terms of base types: `T` may be a union of `T1 | T2 | …`",

After that id start to expand. Something front end. Probably react / node. Then I’d hook that up to my back end thing I’d built. Learn things like responsive design by trying to run your front end in things like a mobile or tablet emulatorAgain have that checkin and deploy functionality all automated. And then I’d look at replicating my back end code with Python. So I can see the difference between the two languages. Then take all that database code and replace it with an ORM doing the same thing in a new branch. Compare how the two perform and the differences you get in things like execution plans etc. understand what the ORM generates vs what you did. Amongst that I’d study DS&A and Design patterns. Why all this?Because it will give you experience with tech that is used in enterprise and also in smaller startups, you get full stack experience and you have options then to deeper dive into either language if you want to focus on one area or another. Learning sql directly rather than just ORMs is something people miss these days and very important for debugging. And the cloud / infrastructure stuff is something which will help you later in your career and interviewing. It helps knowing what’s out there when you need to do system design interviews.",

There are tens of thousands of different APIs out there and while getting access to them is standardized (mostly), identifying what is being used and how that integrates with everything else is still a job that companies need. Then, to make yourself even more valuable, learn how to build a data warehouse and the pipelines involved in that.I still do a ton of coding. We do have engineers that use tools like n8n or SSIS to do basic integrations. But soon the permutations start to overwhelm those systems and you need code. You need people flexible enough to use different languages and are comfortable on different databases.On a parallel track to this - monitoring. Large orgs will want visibly into all of this. So, there are data pipelines that move performance data into monitoring systems. And in 5 years, a new monitoring system will show up with a “must have” feature so you have to redo it all.",

You're doing great. But keep in mind that I myself started at 13, and there are people out there who started later than me and are way, way better developers. Starting early has many benefits, but learning programming takes time (and never stops!), depending on how you spend it, you become better faster or slower. The point I want to make is, you should focus more on your skills than on your age.You're very ambitious and motivated, great, keep that and you will reach the goals you mentioned.

There are some things that you might wind up doing differently over time, especially in bigger projects. Which is to say, they can be considered overengineering for a program of this size & scope, but overengineering otherwise small programs can also be a decent way to learn about those engineering practices.*Avoiding \"magic\" numbers*: Your `else` case for the difficulty rating is meant to result in `easy` mode, but this can drift apart. If you decide to give `easy` mode 4 tries for example, then you need to update that number in two spots. There are a couple of ways around that, like storing the numbers in constants, e.g. `const int EASY_MODE_TRIES = 3;` and then using the constant rather than the literal number, and/or having an extra parsing step where you wind up doing something like an extra function that ends on `else { cout << \"Something…\"; return EASY; }`, returning something like an `enum` of the valid difficulty ratings, or even a struct. Error handling and parsing user input can be kind of big topics with lots of options.But generally, magic numbers are a hazard for code maintenance, because it very often turns into questions like \"why is it _this_ number? can I change it? what happens if I do?\" and some constants with names and rationales go a long way to alleviate that.*More functions*: Generally we break code up into what's hopefully logical chunks. Often to avoid repetition, but also sometimes just to break up long reams of code into something more like a condensed sequence of subtasks. Opinions vary on how long a function should be allowed to get. My opinion is something like trying to be able to fit the entire function on the screen (but also not trying to bend over backwards to follow the rule), which I think is a fairly common middle-of-the-road opinion.There are also a whole bunch of C++ concepts and best practices that you'll kind of have to pick up over time; one that may be good to get you to look into as soon as possible is \"[const correctness](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness)\".",

I like your use of the imperative in your git commit subject! That's actually how it's done. Perhaps also look into rewriting your git history to avoid those multiple 'Update README.md' commits. Check https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History. It's a bit complicated, so experiment on a repository that does't matter. You'll learn a lot and your git commit logs will look utter professional afterwards.",

Why is `` included? Because if you didn't, the code wouldn't compile, because `time()` is missing. Right? In this way, the code speaks for itself. // Convert difficulty input to lowercase (so EASY, Easy, easy all work)See? This isn't a bad comment, though you could tighten it up. The important thing is to not tell us what the code tells us, because here's the thing - typically such comments and code disagree. So who's the authority? Which is right? The code? Or the comment?One thing your comments are doing is making up for a lack of functions. You're lacking expressiveness, and so you're trying to name what you're doing with the comment. Perhaps your next lesson will introduce functions to you, and this will dry up. std::transform(difficulty.begin(), difficulty.end(), difficulty.begin(), ::tolower);There is a bug here. It's really technical and subtle, and I don't fully understand it myself, but the [reference documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/tolower.html) warns you this is unsafe, that you need to write a function that casts your character type to `int`. random_num = rand() % max_num + 1;This is the same in every branch of your difficulty condition. Just hoist it out and write this code once, after the condition block. std::getline(std::cin, guess); // Take guess as string user_guess = std::stoi(guess); // Convert string to integerToo many steps! Streams know how to extract integers! Your problem is interleaving extraction with line grabbing.The rules of extraction are:1) Ignore leading whitespace2) Start grabbing characters3) Stop at some delimiter character. Leave the delimiting character behind, in the stream.The rules for line grabbing are:1) Grab characters one at a time2) Stop when you find the delimiter character, discarding it.So imagine first extracting an `int` - something like `\" 123\\n\"; the stream purges the leading whitespace, grabs \"123\" and leaves \"\\n\" behind. Now you line grab, and what happens? We grab \"\\n\", which is our delimiter, and we stop.So the thing to do is know when you're switching between the two, and `ignore` the newline as necessary. int x; std::string s; std::cin >> x; std::cin.ignore(); // Purge after extraction, before getline std::getline(std::cin, s); std::getline(std::cin, s); std::cin >> x; // No purge necessary after getlineAnother thing you should be doing is checking your streams. A stream is implemented as a \"user defined type\", which are made from `class`, `struct`, `enum`, and `union`. One of the things you can do is \"overload\" almost any of the language operators. That's how `operator >>` and `operator <<` - the bit shift operators, are made to work as stream extraction and insertion - they're written as functions that work with stream types. And when you learn to make your own types, you can write your own stream operators for them without having to modify the stream class itself - the pattern is extensible.Continued...",

I found a site that listed 10 books that every programmer should read and read Code Complete 2. It filled in a lot of gaps that I had missed around the process of software development. I then proceeded to read every book on that list. I mark that as the moment I became a senior. That was about 15 years ago.What after this? Nothing. I'm happy with what I'm doing. Management would just be more stressful for a marginal salary increase. Otherwise, I will shift where the IT winds blow me. Meaning, I'll do what's needed whatever that is.

For me that was low-level graphics. I sincerely believe the exact technologies are not vital for internships, rather it's about showing your appetite for learning. Knowing OS fundamentals, and having practical projects with memory management, and cache-awareness in mind already knocks the majority of competitors out, especially for internships if you are targeting low-level domain (most go for latest and greatest shiny deployable frameworks).If backend is referring to servers, databases, and interfacing with web, I have no idea. For more closer to metal, I assume getting an Arduino starter kit and do some of the guided projects could be a good idea.It sounds like you simply need to do the reps with any type of project. I believe you don't really \"study\" programming. Rather, you start with something you want to create. Unless you are following a tutorial step-by-step (which I highly do not recommend), you have to be inquisitive and work your way backwards from the goal, to figuring out what's needed, and then figuring how to build those blocks.Naturally, based on problems you want to solve, you find that you want to express some computation, where you then realize that you need some language constructs to do so (just like normal language).As a personal aside, it wasn't until after Year 3 (of 5) in uni where I started doing any fully self-directed projects. I understand the \"feeling lost\" emotion well. My gateway was a 3D graphics course using Direct3D and reading various old and new blogs of seasoned graphics programmers, even when I barely understood most and half understood some. A million instances of trial and error from \"I don't understand this, let me try myself\" later and today I work with GPU drivers. You do not have to have it all click and figured out with bombastic portfolio by the end of Year 2.",

You have to learn to architect systems and break down work such that you can take the harder problems yourself and set your juniors up for success while also being responsive to your users.Another way to look at it is that junior and mid level engineers get their work from senior engineers while senior engineers have a more active role in defining the work. You have to do that in such a way that you carve out safe rails for junior engineers to work along and good bones to respond to often chaotic business needs. Don’t discount the degree to which that will strengthen you technically.It sounds like you are an experienced mid level engineer but a pure focus on directly improving your own technical skill will hold you back. Counterintuitively, you will grow more technically at this point in your career by taking on more of an ownership/leadership role with your people and learning to apply your technical skills to power everyone up.",

Don't identify problems that aren't really problems. For instance, if the code base is full of cruft and you say \"the code is bad and I'd like to clean it up, let me lead a team for 6 months to rewrite it\" then you're just stepping on toes.Instead, be ready to show the ROI and to show you've thought through the hard parts of what you propose and already have a feasible solution.One of the first things I did when transitioning to lead was identify a problem with our database. Every day we got an automated data feed, which triggered a program that dropped a large table, did a bulk data import, reindexed it, and ran a bunch of queries. Almost like clockwork, the DBMS would fall to its knees and one or more senior people would do a little fire drill, 45 minutes wasted every day. They were just used to it and couldn't think outside the box. I did a proof of concept that did everything totally differently and placed almost no load on the DBMS, studiously avoiding any hint that the people who came up with the original system were idiots, and my project was adopted with me as the implementer. My star at that company rose significantly because they could see I could be entrusted with more than run-of-the-mill tasks.",

        "body": "Everyone has answered things really well, but I want to touch on the question about whether folder structure is essential and does it depend on the framework.While others are correct that folder structure is not bound, required, or essential; it is often very important to the build tools you may, or may not, be using. Different build tools whether they are used in JavaScript, Java, C/C++, all follow some standard folder structure. Most Java projects are built with Gradle, Maven, or Ant and the Java folder structure is pretty rigid among these. Cmake for C/C++ is less picky about folder structure as your program's include statements control much of that. React, Svelte, and many JavaScript frameworks also use their own folder structure. Even Rebar3 for Erlang has a fairly fixed structure it uses.Build tools automate building of final product code so they expect certain files to be in certain places. These can be changed in the build configuration, but then working with a team used to standard structure can be chaotic. Also, many build tools will create the folder structure when you request a new project to be built.So, if you are building projects within a team or for a business, the folder structure will likely be mandated and essential. Even if you are planning to share a project, using a standard folder structure is still highly recommended. If you are writing custom code only for you, whatever works for you is just fine.",

Outside of getting a degree in CS, that has always been the most helpful, since it both keeps me busy and gives me something to gauge my learning by.If it helps, here was my road. I didn’t have a map for my programming career initially, but I’ve learnt that adapting is the best strategy for my own path. I wasn’t familiar with computer science at all growing up, despite having a father who was a programmer. I tried to go to college but dropped out to protect my grades. Then I worked at Lowe’s for a time. While there, I bought a game on steam that taught Python. Overnight, I fell in love with coding. I took a year and taught myself how to code in Python through learnpython.org. I also gave myself the framework of making a fully-Python-based game engine (which I still haven’t finished), so that I could learn how the language worked. Now I’m back at the university learning coding. I took the required course on C++ and also researched ahead on some C++ concepts before they were taught, such as C++ classes and templating. Now I have practiced with C++ for over a year and am working on my own language. So all that to say we each have different roads and different ways of navigating through life.If you think you’re an imposter, you don’t have as much of a right to feel that way as I do, since I’m so late to the game and my life has more twists and turns than yours has. And I don’t feel that, because I’d rather give myself purpose and structure than to feel like I’m useless. If it helps you, a programmer should be able to find their own purpose when they seemingly have none. That is what is required in order for a programmer to come up with the software they make.",

No OpenCV just to resize images, no OpenSSL to calculate a CRC, no ICU to find out if a text is pure ASCII.Keep the amount of non-essential features small, especially if they require more libs etc.No own code shoud run at eg. each key press or something. Build some delay that eg. it only runs if the user stops typing for 3sec, if you need it at all. (Of course it depends on the use case what/how it makes most sense).And so on...For any actually \"extreme\" optimizations, first think really hard if you really need it. Don't proceed before you have identified the code part that is the problem, measured extensively how slow/wasteful it is, decided how fast etc. it should be, and decided how much of your life time you'll spend on optimizing it. After that, the answer heavily depends on what \"it\" actually is.",

DevOps was a large part of my first job and the first task I did when I joined was a cloud migration (myself with zero input in two weeks) but I had a decade of hobbyist experience by that point so it was fairly easy.

That can be implemented with interleaving on one core, or with true parallel execution on multiple cores. The key idea is that tasks overlap in time from the system’s perspective.Parallelism is about execution. It means multiple tasks are literally running at the same time on different hardware resources.So yes, parallelism is usually considered a subset of concurrency. A concurrent program may or may not run in parallel depending on the hardware and runtime. But a parallel program is inherently concurrent because multiple flows of control exist at once.You’re also right that race conditions and deadlocks show up in both cases. They are properties of shared state and coordination, not of whether the CPU is single core or multi core. Even with context switching on one core, the interleaving can expose the same hazards.One mental model that helps is: concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.",

Concepts from concurrency like reentrancy and semaphores are important in this domain, too.The difference is that concurrency concerns have to be understood even when there is no parallelism at all - they arise just because different computations interfere with each other even when it's guaranteed that only one task can be executed at a time.",

        "body": "I'm working on a Kotlin math library for higher math. I was going to post my Cayley-Dickson construction to show how I generate the complex numbers from the field of real (double) numbers and then apply CD once again to get one of the six unital quaternionic (not commutative but still associative) involution division rings by doubling the complex numbers and mapping i to one of ±i, ±j, or ±k, but I would have to post too much code (a few dozen interfaces) to make it make sense, so instead, I'll post something more self-contained that will probably be more interesting to people here, i.e. the factoradic representation of a number.Still, it's a really cool algorithm and way to generate the \"Cayley-Dickson tower\" which creates an infinite sequence of algebras starting with the reals to create the complex numbers, the quaternions, the octonions, the sedenions, etc. without needing to explicitly code any of them.The thing about Cayley-Dickson is that you lose \"nice properties\" every time you recurse:When you go from the Reals to the Complex, you lose ordering, but you do get an algebraically closed field, which is always nice. (Every polynomial has a root in the field, and thus splits.)When you go from the Complex to the Quaternions, you lose commutativity (so xy ≠ yx for all x, y).When you go from the Quaternions to the Octonions, you lose associativity (so x(yz) ≠ (xy)z for all x, y, z, but you still have alternativity, which is a weaker form where (xx)y = x(xy) and y(xx) = (yx)x for all x, y.)The Sedenions are where the shit really hits the fan: you only have power associativity and you get nonzero divisors, i.e. ab = 0 where a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson\\_construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson_construction)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4)**Instead: Factoradics**So you know how normally, we write numbers in base 10, e.g. 1234?And then we can write them in hexadecimal and binary?1234 in hex is 0x4d2 and in binary it's 0b10011010010?Well, another representation of numbers is called factoradic and is based on factorials. The rightmost digit is always 0, and the number is written: a_n * n! + a_{n-1} * (n-1)! + ... + a_1 * 1! + 0 * 0!where `0 ≤ a_i ≤ i` .Then 1234 in factoradic is: 1411200_! = 1 * 6! + 4 * 5! + 1 * 4! + 1 * 3! + 2 * 2! + 0 * 1! + 0 * 0! = 720 + 480 + 24 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 1234 (as expected in base-10)Here's my factoradic encoder / decoder and the explanation. Note that I prefer to use functional programming constructs when possible: hence why there are no loops here (tail call optimized recursion is my looping: in Kotlin, when you use the keyword val, you cannot reassign to a variable): hence why you see the `aux` function in encode. I (distastefully) use a MutableList all the same to avoid unnecessary list copies.I can't seem to paste it here (too long?) so I made a link to it:[https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS](https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS)Released under the 3-Clause BSD License, but not of much use to you unless you implement your own Factorial implementation (and there's a reasonable bit of machinery there as I represent a few dozen integer sequences and arrays).Right now I just finished polynomial rings / semirings and am working on quotient rings / semirings / fields so I can get the full gamut of finite fields for combinatorial constructions, elliptic curve cryptography (and other forms), coding theory, linear feedback shift registers, etc, as well as implementing geometric lattices nicely and naturally using rings like ℤ\\[x\\]/(x\\^2 + x + 1) for the Eisenstein integers instead of jumping through hoops to replace ω\\^2 = -ω - 1.(Not a beginner: I started programming when I was five and I'm 48 now and work in space astronomy. I have a BSc and MSc in comp sci and a PhD in math, but I have lots of holes in my math background, so this has been a great way to fill them in and learn more and program challenging, fun algorithms.)",

This will likely not work running it directly from Android, but a suggestion:If you're genuinely worried about songs disappearing off of YouTube (and I would be - it's happened to me so many times), I would cache the songs locally to my machine: check to see if the song exists locally, in which case, play it, and if not, download it using yt-dlp (a fork of the - I believe now dead - youtube-dl, which runs in Python):[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)I have the following alias set up on my MacBook Pro (should work on any machine). Substitute your browser in. alias yt='yt-dlp -f '\\''bv+ba'\\'' --cookies-from-browser chrome --no-check-certificate'Then if you want, say, video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w) (you don't), you just exec: yt \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w\"and it should download locally. Save it as \"XqZsoesa55w\" and search for that locally and play it if you have it, and if you don't, download it. (That actually downloads the video and the audio: you can also modify the alias to just download the audio if that's all you want.)You can also download entire playlists by putting in a playlist. (Quotes are probably necessary in that case, and optional in the case of single songs / videos.)You don't need a YouTube subscription or anything like that, but I recommend you be logged in (so the cookies will work).I have had way too many videos that I loved throughout the years get yoinked either by their creators or by YouTube, and I no longer risk that happening. Every time I find something I like or something educational that I want to check out at some point, I download the entire thing locally.The other option would be to just keep going the way you are, still cache songs locally, and keep a log of any files that are no longer accessible. Just copy those to your Android device and if a song doesn't show up on YouTube, check your \"saved files\" to get whatever has been deleted.Just a suggestion so you don't get burned like me and my \"significant other\" have multiple times over the years.",

        "body": "Generally, high vs low level, and interpreted vs compiled are 2 completely different aspects of a programming language. The definition of high and low level languages has shifted over the years as we have developed more and more languages. But strictly speaking, a high level language is any language that abstracts away any specific hardware details. This means that pretty much every programming language falls into the category of “high level”, with the exceptions of assembly and machine code “languages” (if you could call machine code a language). This means that even languages like C, are considered a high level language. This is because when you write C, you do not need to consider the specific characteristics of the hardware your code will be running on. As long as a compiler exists for a target system, your C code will run largely the same on any system (assuming whatever libraries you use are similarly supported). I would say that your professor is largely correct, using this historical definition of high and low level language. However I would add the asterisk that some projects, most notably Linux, have plenty of source code written by humans in assembly. In this case, the assembly is still source code, but is still a low level language since it is dependent on the hardware it will run on. (In large projects like Linux, this often looks like writing the same functionality multiple times in assembly for each target hardware system. So while C code largely only has to be written once, you may find multiple implementations of the same functionality in multiple assembly languages)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_languageHowever, this distinction has somewhat shifted over the years and people some times use more relative terms like “high*er*” and “low*er*” level programming languages. These refer to how close or far to the hardware your language is abstracted away. So this means that while C is technically a high level language, it is often perceived as “low*er*” level than something like python. You’ll even see some people say that C is generally a “low*er*” level language. However these distinctions are largely semantic and don’t have much real meaning, especially when you’re first learning. I would not get caught up on these.The difference however between an interpreted and compiled language is completely different, and also in the modern day, much more complex. Generally speaking, an interpreter is any program that takes as an input some source code, and executes it without first compiling it to machine code. (Ripped from the first line on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing))) A compiler is then any program that takes source code in one language as an input, and outputs code in another language. However, almost always, this looks like translating a higher level language, into a lower level language, typically from a strictly high level language, into a strictly low level language (like C -> assembly).So the 2 concepts are somewhat related, but there is no exact relationship between them. Modern compilers and interpreters are much more complex and have many stages that translate source code through many different levels of abstraction. And, modern programming languages have started blurring the lines between what is seen as higher level and lower level.",

You might write a `mov` statement, but which specific instruction you get is dependent on it's parameters.High level languages target abstract machines and are portable. C++, for example, targets an abstract, byte addressable stack machine, two's compliment signed integers, little-endian, etc. So byte offset and bit manipulation on up - calling conventions, etc, all that is beyond the language, and must be defined by the implementation. So if your machine is word-addressable, the compiler has to translate byte addressing into words in some way.Languages can affect architecture; C++03 is THE DEFINITION of the x64 Itanium ABI, and is standard for the hardware, which was designed around it. That doesn't some how lower the level of the language on that particular platform.So it doesn't matter if the language is compiled or interpreted. You can build an interpreter around a virtual Turing Complete stack machine that runs an assembly. Or you can JIT compile an interpreted language like Java or C#, neither execution actually affects the high level nature of either language.",

C is considered high-level by people working with firmware, embedded system, chip design, etc. But application developers consider it low.More formally, you would be more precise by categorizing a language based on how it approaches specific things developers want to use:Memory managementType definitions/constraintsAccess controlStatic vs dynamic definitionsAccess to Interop/embeddingImplementation of paradigm-specific features",

But honestly, having to mutate an array while iterating through it, should NEVER be an excuse for using a traditional for-loop. Always use the foreach-version if you intend to iterate through an entire list, no matter the language. The only reason to use the traditional for-loop would be when you don't want to iterate exactly N times, but some other arbitrary number.And also you rarely want to mutate an existing array, most of the time you would want a new array with a different set of elements, created by filtering the existing array or something like that.And if not, most languages also have methods specifically for removing elements from arrays depending on certain criteria.",

        "body": "This is why I often say programming is easy, at least at this level. The real challenge is taking a specification (word problem) and turning it into code.One thing I can suggest is to take everyday tasks, that a person knows well, and turn them into a word problem and then turn that into code. It might be as something as simple as checking the mail. That might sound simple at first but you generally have to open a door or two, walk to the mail box, open the mail box, grab the mail and return. The more one thinks seriously about what appears to be a simple task, the faster one realizes how detailed one needs to be to get software to do the job. Creating the pseudo code becomes a challenge of iteratively walking through the code until you can actually get the mail. The interesting thing about checking the mail word problem, is that you can check your work by physically walking through your pseudo code.In any event there are lots of things in real life that can help you understand the conversion of tasks into code. The more \"everyday\" the task the more impressive the complexity of what a person does everyday not thinking about it. Brush your teeth in the morning and start to think about how all those actions would be expressed in code. Would the stroking back and forth, be a function to simplify your code.As for the OP I have to point out that this is an extremely common issue. That is turning written requirements into code and frankly it often has nothing to do with programming. However it is absolutely critical to becoming a good programmer. In the real world many times your specification might not be well defined causing one to do some research. That might mean reading a manual to get a device into a mode that you wan work with. The point is your word problems become outlines leaving out critical information you need to fill in. In other words in school you are lucky in that the word problems are generally complete, sometimes you need to figure out what a department really wants.",

        "body": "I'll list some things that might make you consider using message brokers, not in order of importance and not in a mumbo jumbo scientific way.1. A message broker is a separate, usually unchanging serviceThis means that redeploying your service has no effect on receiving data and storing event data. You could argue that writing events to a database is the same - and you'd be right, however we're not done yet! 2. Let's take a topic exchange as an example, you've created your topic exchange and have many routing keys for it. One of these routing keys is lets say for messages indicating that a payment has been completed.One day, you'd like to send these payments to a fraud detection company (totally random example, I'm still having coffee), you could make the most barebones service that simply registers a new queue/binding to this exchange listening to the same routing key your main service already listens - and you'll receive a copy of all the payment events.This plug and play style once your messaging system is set up is really comfortable and doesn't require extra work apart from occasionally adding a new field to your message.3. Manual acknowledgement + outbox/inbox patterns for your messages/events is intuitive and safe to work with . Retries are handled with minimal work from your side with the correct configuration for your queue - connectivity issues and the like can be glossed over and you can define a threshold for dead letters where you'll actually have to think if messages reach there - but little connectivity issues or temporary outages don't really hurt you. 4. It's super easy to scale! Apart from being able to plug different consumers into the same routing key to get copies of messages to do different things with them you can also plug multiple (usually identical) instances of a consumer to a single queue so they can fairly share the work. It's really simply to dynamically scale this by adding or removing consumers to a queue that isn't doing the work fast enough.4.5-ish. Like you already mentioned and as it might be a bit obvious it really helps keep your system tidy(er) where each instance can just do its own thing and if you need something *else* you just make something fresh and connect it without bogging down your existing services with more responsibilities. Obviously it's not all sunshine and rainbows and you can easily make a sprawling mess of events flying all over the place and eventual consistency does have its own considerations.",

If the API actually also does stuff (goes to the kitchen and makes the stuff requested), it stops being interactive for that duration, which is its primary job. So the API delegates as much work as possible to keep being interactive, the work is done via queues and message brokers.In short, any (real) work should not be done by the API, it should get done by something else.

Depending on your messaging setup, a service can just fire and forget to the message queue, cuz the delivery guarantees are provided by the queueing system.2) similarly it allows different apps to work at their own pace3) all your queues are in one place. Like imagine there are multiple instances of your application each with their own local in memory queue, a message might be sent to both and the work is duplicated or some consistency criteria might even break. You can have this sync without queues but if you need queues anyways, just using a service for queues that can observe all the events is massively helpful.4) the queue can scale independently 5) observability, you have once central logical place where the queues report to even if internally they are all running in different physical/virtual systems. So you can then do 2nd level of adaptations based on the state of your queues. A queue suddenly having way too many events in it from normal might be signalling an issue somewhere else.",

For “metrics,” people often use it to avoid coupling request latency to logging/storage and to survive DB outages without dropping events.

Pull raw data with SQL, clean and transform it in pandas, then rebuild the visuals with matplotlib or seaborn. It forces you to understand what the BI tool was abstracting away.A solid starter project is a small end to end analysis on a public dataset. For example, take a sales or e commerce dataset, write SQL queries for KPIs, load the results into pandas, do some feature engineering, and produce a short narrative with visuals. Treat it like you’re presenting to a stakeholder.If you want something more exploratory, try analyzing your own habits. Track expenses, workouts, or study time in a simple database. Query it with SQL, then use pandas to find trends and seaborn to visualize patterns. Personal data makes it easier to stay motivated.The key is not just plotting charts, but practicing the full workflow: question, query, clean, analyze, explain. That’s what really builds analysis muscle.",

It's a different path than data analysis, more ML/engineering focused. Cool, but not what most analyst roles ask for.How to structure it:1. Pick a dataset you find interesting (Kaggle, Maven Analytics, or your own)2. Ask 3-5 specific questions3. Clean the data with pandas4. Analyze and visualize with matplotlib/seaborn5. Write up what you foundMake it look like a real deliverable, not a code dump. Add markdown explanations, clear charts with titles, and a summary of insights.Some good datasets to start:\\- Superstore sales (classic, easy to find)\\- Spotify tracks (fun, lots of angles)\\- E-commerce transactions (realistic business data)\\- Any public dataset from a domain you care aboutSince you already know Power BI, you could even do the same analysis in Python and compare, shows range on your resume.If you want to skip the hunting and just start building, I put together The Portfolio Shortcut — 15 ready-to-go projects with datasets and code.

So, for me personally, it is to have everything planned out ahead of time so I don't have to struggle with decision paralysis. AI is very useful with this.Also I take a lot of notes because that helps me be focused.Reduce distractions. Uninstall any crap you can't live without and remove notifications for any app that isn't life or death.Lifestyle make a huge difference. Sleep a full night. Every night. Have a consistent sleep schedule. Keep yourself hydrated (with water, not soda) and try to eat a well balanced diet. Remove alcohol from your diet. Do some sports, even just a light jog (search for c25k if you're a couch potato) and preferably do it in the morning just after you wake up.You're brain is all over the place so you need to create habits that give you structure and stability. Removing distractions and having a healthy lifestyle are the most important things you can do.After that go for a course with some structure and predefined pace.

Git + Java + side projects is good, but don’t constantly switch directions.3.Build tiny projects you can finish in a few days.

If you use callbacks instead, you have to take care that if you have multiple actions: What if the callback-state is achieved multiple times? What if it is only temporarily achieved?3) If the state you're checking for is complex (i.e. you don't have a single callback-state, but instead a rather big set of states which all should result in a callback), it's cheaper to have, once per update, a single centralized call checking for it, instead of every action within an update having to check for whether the callback-state is achieved.",

Long polling is where you poll the value, but the poll operation does not succeed until the value changes. This usually blocks a thread, so there is thread overhead cost, but not a processing cost. Long polling is pretty popular for network operations where the server cannot initiate a connection back to the client to execute a callback.

This is how I personally have progressed my career at my IT job, that is, by being willing to be essentially thrown to the wolves, do the research, put in the work, and deliver. Look through the current code and functionality, and for what you can’t piece together on your own, utilize the resources available to you. Chat GPT is not great at writing code, but it can be used effectively for parsing large amounts of data (say one singular or multiple files provided as context) and giving you a somewhat accurate and human-readable breakdown/overview of functionality. You can use it to give you ideas, and even to point you to valid documentation and resources that exist on the internet for VBA and excel projects. Other than that, YouTube is a great resource, and experimentation and practice are essential for understanding. Don’t just copy and paste shit.

All i need is a button the on excelpage, which opens a window with some drop-downs and preselected inputs which can be generated as new row in the page. Plus another button to delete the inputs if their are wrong and i'd like to make them dependent on the previous input. So basically you put your name first, then the dropdown for the station becomes visible, you select the station and depending on the station, the next dropdown only shows the robots which are located in that station. You choose the robot and the next dropdown only shows part which are build onto your selected robot. So there is no chance to pick something which wouldn't make sense (we have lot of entries on our current list, which are false because the part isnt used on that robot). The other department has much more variations on stations, robots and parts so the cross-checking does make sense for them, but not for us and also with my idea of preselecting the inputs it would be obsolet aswell. Maybe i put that incorrectly and the code itself isnt confusing for an expert on that matter, but for me (and my skilllevel) it is. And again the whole cross-checking thingy isnt necessary for my/our project.Thanks for you insight and for the hit about VB net. I'll keep that in mind.",

That is because you're writing imperative procedural code like this: std::cout << \"Enter your name: \"; std::getline(std::cin, name);Real code will look something more like this: class name: std::tuple { static bool valid(std::string_view sv) { return !sv.empty(); } friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &is, name &n) { if(is && is.tie()) { *is.tie() << \"Enter your name: \"; } if(auto &[s] = *this; std::getline(is, s) && !valid(s)) { is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit); n = name{}; } return is; } };This is still the barest of basic. C++ gives you primitives, you are expected to build up and composite layers of more robust and expressive types in terms of them, and then deliver a solution in terms of that. Ultimately you make your solution more expressive: if(name n; std::cin >> name) { use(n); } else { handle_error_on(std::cin); }An `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. All names are strings, but not all strings are names. Streams are themselves a whole system and style to work within.Unfortunately, there really isn't any good source material that teaches you use. Most code across the industry looks like people put their academic materials, picked up a compiler, and have written exactly as they had learned ever since. You have to figure it out. Try to find people who see the bigger picture.",

Try to think of the questions they will ask you (like \"lemme see your code\"), and get answers ready so that you don't get the stare of death.Sometimes this is known as \"rubber duck debugging\", or simply \"rubber ducking\", because if you can explain your problem clearly to a rubber duck, then chances are you will stumble upon a clue along the way that will lead you to a solution. Many bugs have been solved by developers talking to rubber ducks in their offices. I have found myself in position where not only did I waste the senior dev's time, but he was the senior dev at another company we were working with so I made my entire company look incompetent because I didn't see a basic issue. Luckily I spotted the problem before he did and we were able to laugh it off... But please learn from my mistakes.",

If you're not that attached to Python, my standard recommendation for new developers is to complete The Odin Project, following either the Ruby or Node track (just pick Node if you aren't sure.) The Odin Project is an excellent resource, it's hard to do better. The thing I like about The Odin Project is that it teaches you the ecosystem *around* software development, such as setting up a Linux environment (Linux is an essential skill for many developers, especially entrepreneurs who have to think about Docker, AWS, etc.) If you're not interested in web development at all, still check out CS50. They have a lot of follow up courses in various topics.",

One thing I'd watch out for: e-commerce frameworks are optimized for \"customer buys → store ships\" flows, not real-time multi-party coordination (customer :left-right_arrow: store :left-right_arrow: courier).The courier assignment and live status updates will likely be custom anyway, so the question is whether LunarPHP's cart/checkout saves you enough time to justify learning its patterns.If you're already comfortable with Laravel, starting with a clean Laravel app + Filament admin and only pulling in packages for what you actually need might give you more flexibility. Less magic, but fewer surprises when delivery logic gets complex.",

You don't just jump right in to full competency in a change like that, but I was fortunate that an organization needed people and I learned on the job (just like I learned networking, databases, Java, CRUD and most everything else earlier).I was probably lucky in that I worked five years for an IPTV company so I did both backend (Java) and C++ work on a proprietary client.Continuing education in the field is vital and breadth of experience is a positive, at least it has been for me.",

I would consider something like installing Scheme and going through the first couple chapters of exercises: it'll teach you a very different way to program.If you haven't done any programming, but want to get a head start, get set up with a GitHub account and create a couple test projects on there or read up on the basic theory of source code control management. It's an extremely useful skill to have that they likely won't teach you in school and it'll help you get set up to have a portfolio by the time you're applying for jobs and show that you understand how it works. Most companies use GitHub or GitLab (pretty much interchangeable) these days, and you can learn pretty much almost all the essentials in less than two weeks.Here's also a list of genuinely free programming books:[https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/books/free-programming-books-subjects.md](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/books/free-programming-books-subjects.md)You might find a subject on there that interests you and isn't too far above your level.Here's one for git (GitHub, GitLab) beginners:[https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)",

However they rarely deal with most of the issues that companies use in programming.

Assuming you knew they existed and were they were hidden. It was not a good idea and didn’t last long.There’ a few HCI problems with the idea. Hidden non-noob features have no perceivable affordances, so users can’t discover them. When they are hidden behind the noob shield users can’t just gradually start to use more and more features. They have to remove the shield and then the UI looks entirely different than what they are used to.I don’t think the quantity of features even really creates issues. A powerful app will by necessity have a lot of features when it’s a tool for professional’s inherently complex work. That userbase can deal with having to learn the app’s basic functions while being exposed to the existence of other more advanced functions.The subscriptions maximizing UX focus of trying to make e.g. Figma accessible for every stakeholder is plain damaging to the core user base. Only designers need to be able to use it, just the same as only developers need to be able to use IDEs & git, and only engineering and architects need to be able to use CAD. Stakeholders with other expertise areas can make their contributions with whatever tools they are comfortable with.",

Then they can only use prototypes, look at designs, and stick comments on the specific places they have change demands.This works way better than them changing a single world or pixel by themselves. Designers get to do their work of making changes in ways that maintain the integrity of the whole project (e.g. one page doesn’t suddenly use different words for things than the rest). They also get to make the change in a way that doesn’t f*** up their figma workflow. I mean, when you are using Figma as a power user, you have your component libraries and larger components build from components. Then the right place to make changes is nearly always way somewhere else in a component library rather than on the screen that the stakeholder is looking at. When stakeholders do their own edits, even just changing texts, thats a shitload work for the designer to clean up in a way that doesn’t cause confusion later on.As an odd mix of dev and design, I probably care about this last part way more than designers in general.",

Then it sends the signal to make the change.This is the simplest way to do something, and it doesn't have a lot of protections that come with more sophisticated means.

It makes unit testing easier as well.**Services**I put them in a folder like this as separate functions that can include other services:[https://github.com/ndokter/walldb2/tree/main/backend/wdb\\_wallpaper/services](https://github.com/ndokter/walldb2/tree/main/backend/wdb_wallpaper/services)You can add additional sub folders there when a specific part is more complexThen i call them using the full path: `wdb_wallpaper.services.wallpaper.set_ai_generated_description(wallpaper=wallpaper)`You can also use classes, but i would keep them stateless.**Services in views**I dont have the best example because this project doesnt have create/update calls from the API:[https://github.com/ndokter/walldb2/blob/main/backend/wdb\\_wallpaper/api/views.py](https://github.com/ndokter/walldb2/blob/main/backend/wdb_wallpaper/api/views.py)Instead of letting serializers save, i would use the arguments/object from the serializer and put them manually in the service. Here i did that with a search argument, but you can also do that for create and update.Im not sure if i would put all 'get' / queries in the service layer like i did here, but maybe in a 'selectors' folder like this style guide describes: [https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide?tab=readme-ov-file#selectors](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide?tab=readme-ov-file#selectors)",

I don't condone cheating in general but you and I know very well that our interviews are fundamentally broken to begin with, even before AI. They are designed intentionally to focus on CS concepts but not actual day-to-day software dev work. Examining someone on whether they can solve a leetcode style question tells you nothing about a candidate's ability to write and ship software. I have met people who work at FAANG that have been able to get there purely by memorizing leetcode questions but not all of them are actually good engineers and a good amount of them have never shipped anything.The people who are using these cheating tools are just shining the light on the bigger problem here which is that our interviews are fundamentally broken and should be redesigned to actually examine someone's engineering skills and foundations. If I am hiring an engineer to work on web apps, I would want them to know skills related to that not whether they can invert a binary search tree.I expect this trend of cheating to continue growing until companies begin to realize how stupid the current interview structure is",

        "body": "One thing worth remembering is *why* Ruby and Rails were huge. It goes something like:At the time, backends were *huge* clunky things built out of Java, maybe .NET, and sometimes mainframes and COBOL. That means tons of Java-isms -- better bake a serial number into all of your classes in case you use native Java serialization to save sessions, but also you need an ORM with fifteen XML config files just so the ORM knows to set the `email` property to the `email` column, and that the `users` table goes to the `User` class. Except wait, you don't set the `email` property, you call `setEmail()` on the `User` class. And you don't create a `new User()`, you call a method on a `UserFactory`, which you need to get from the AbstarctDefaultFactoryImpl or whatever. And this isn't even Java 8, even a *simple* Java list looks like: List emails = new ArrayList();Yep, repeat `String` twice and `List` twice and generally be the most verbose, repetitive thing anyone had ever seen until Go gave us `if err != nil { return err; }` after every goddamned line.Or, at the other extreme, there was the LAMP stack -- stupidly-sloppy messes hacked together with Perl and PHP, the kind of thing people were building blogs out of. Wordpress was maybe the state of the art. PHP is a whole programming language that grew out of a glorified template language, so any notion of separating the view from the model was not really happening -- this is a world where you're taking some static HTML thing you built in DreamWeaver, renaming `.html` to `.php`, and adding a mysql query right to the middle of it with `` tags. IMO this explains a lot of why Facebook is the way it is -- it grew out of a tool that was built for adding a guestbook and a hit counter to your Geocities homepage.So Rails did a couple things: It cut out a ton of the boilerplate with \"convention over configuration\" -- if you have a `Users` model class and a `users` DB table, Rails can figure out that those are supposed to go together, and you only need to add configuration when you have something that doesn't fit the very obvious pattern. Ruby cut out more of the boilerplate by not making you repeat your type names five million times. It gave you a CLI tool that generates a working Rails project for you instantly, makes it super easy to get started filling in the blanks. It gives you enough structure that you're probably not building your whole app inside the HTML view like you would in PHP. On top of that, Ruby was a nicer language than most of the competition -- PHP and Perl are both pretty ugly, and Java doesn't even have lambdas.Other replies have pointed out things that made Rails less relevant -- more microservices and fewer monoliths, more web APIs and React and such instead of pure CRUD at the HTML level. But I think it's also because a lot of the basic ideas Rails had either ended up going way too far -- to do that `User``users` mapping, every Rails server needed a complex set of rules on how to pluralize English words! -- or ended up not being necessary for what they were trying to do. Like, turns out with decent type inference (Typescript, Golang), you can do strong, static typing and not constantly have to repeat yourself. Java and even C++ got lambdas, `var` and `auto`, and other basic quality of life code-level stuff.",

And here's the truth: people don't have even have the slightest clue of what they're talking about.Originally I studied Finance and Accounting. My first job was at a Big 4 public accounting firm in 2016, they demoed an AI agent that could do our job to show they were \"cutting edge.\" Did we use it? No. We used excel workbooks that have been around longer than your grandma's fridge. Did we leverage Python, VBA, and so on to work better and faster like I knew how to do? No. Some of these people could barely move around a single sheet in Excel.Then I worked at a F500 company. In addition to regular accounting and finance work, tried as much as possible to automate. I tried to do things better, faster, more efficiently. I wrote \"shadow apps\" (not managed by the dev teams) for other financial analysts and accountants as the massive dev teams we had didn't have \"capacity\". Eventually I hit a wall and essentially there was so much I wanted to incorporate and change but was denied the tools needed to deploy and maintain them. Basically \"sorry you're not an SWE so we can't give you access.\" So I left and now I'm building financial systems and doing meaningful work as a SWE and getting my masters in CS. And making more than I did before and happier.Here's my takeaway: you will be stunned to see how SLOW companies adopt tech outside of big tech companies. Even if you TRY you'll hit resistance.If you have a desire to build a solution, you will have a job. If people on this sub or the vibe coding subs think an accountant at a F500 company will use Claude Code to vibe up a solution, I'm sorry but it will not happen about 90% of the time. If they didn't write basic Python scripts before, they are not vibe coding now. Anyone that believes that will happen are either delusional or have never actually worked outside of tech roles.And a final note: I could have automated 80% of my work as an accountant and financial analyst pre-AI. The only people to look at that career path as bulletproof are tech people who never worked in that field or tried to get a job in it.",

Advice on how specifically you can/should upskill requires more context than fits in a Reddit post. Pick any arbitrary pile of podcasts or blogs related to product development, and when you read something which relates to a skill you haven’t mastered, learn that thing. Pay attention to what’s happening in your organization, and make sure your skillset is well aligned with the “big rocks” coming up.Frankly, not every software product demands “FAANG-level” engineers to be successful. But pretend you’re a company trying to be competitive in a market. The hypothetical skill-curve of labor isn’t flat among your competition. If literally every competitor sourced from the same off-shoring agencies, and all of those agencies were equally skilled at product development, what a fantastic opportunity for you to disrupt that market by having significantly higher performing teams right?",

Meaning your work needs to be exceptional while the team also having runway to preserve your employment I bring this up because most teams have a changing budget that goes up and down based off priorities. They may have room in budget in 2025 but that doesn’t mean 2026 will. In short, contracts are usually going to end. If you’re diligent and reach out to your manager more you can usually determine if you’ll be extended 6+ months in advance. In my experience, all of my contracts were extended 3 or 4 times until the team inevitably ran out of budget and offshored but I seen contractors let go after 6 months",

This is at a larger upfront cost but hoping the gamble will pay off., there doesn’t seem to be a tangible benefit to them as of yet but they are in highly competitive spaces where they don’t feel they can’t.About 2/3 are waiting for pricing to stabilise, and want a clearly defined use case to take on the challenges AI brings. There is concern that they will be left behind, but they cannot find a business case that drives profitability long term over the increased tech debt and server costs.Then we have our govt clients. They are looking at using AI for making citizen touch points better, think better signposting to resources etc, but super hesitant from a security POV and will likely be last adopters of any AI tech past chat bots.No idea if that helps settle you, but everything we see is that more companies are holding back, but the ones diving into AI have to be loud about it to generate interest and growth.",

With 26 YOE, I wouldn't limit myself to individual contributor roles. Cast a wide net. Quitting without another gig locked in is a possibility, but you should avoid it unless the alternative is hurting your health.I had to maintain an ancient and pathological system at my first job, also accounting related. Obviously you're way better equipped than I was to make good decisions, but here's my rough survival guide:- make peace with the fact that you will never be able to clean it up properly- start from the biggest pain points with the easiest fixes, in your case adding source control- if the language supports either classes or closures, you will be able to create sensible abstractions around the things you touch- learn as much accounting as you can to be productive and make reasonable decisions- have an honest discussion with the system's stakeholders in your company about the intended longevity of the system",

We need to start defining metrics and details BEFORE anything is calculated or reviewed. Sure there's some bad data that should be excluded or whatever BUT it needs a valid justification and NEEDS to be visible to others who will use the report/data. It's amazing how little my team actually cared about the metrics. It's obvious they are not the ones asking for it and are simply passing along something their boss asked for. This is utterly pointless and the data won't mean anything",

I'm too young to remember the dotcom and financial crash but as i've grown older my parents have started telling me of the financial/career decisions and personal decisions they had to make to support me and my brother growing up ie. dealing with horrible bosses to earn a paycheck to support the family, picking areas not related to the degree they studied and working their way towards the path they have now, how they made budget decisions etc. I was part of the new grad cohort in 2022 who lost their new grad career opportunities in 2022 when the beginning of the layoffs started with the zuck/elon movement. It was about time tbh because new grads according to my parents were becoming entitled twerps trying to command 150k+ TOC, expecting MAAANGA perks were the norm for new grads with only internships and between 0-2 years experience. back when my dad started in this industry there was not a huge salary gap between the CEO and the engineers and the rest of the staff and now there is millions of dollars difference and entitlement, people studying computer science only for the money. i think somewhere in the zirp era the engineering meaning of computer science and computing got lost through the bootcamps and the allure of salary. this correction was bound to happen as companies are now going back to actual engineering fundamentals.I think most people including myself forget that tech careers are cyclical and there will be a correction and change when the technology changes. unfortunately for us there are many more toxic factors like social media, reddit, which encourage personal comparison, competition and breed mental health problems that didn't exist for the millenial people. imagine if zuck, adam mosseri(instagram), elon, sundar pichai, satya nadella, eva chen(instagram) and all these ceos had to live in our world as kids. there's so much denial from zuck, mosseri and co about how they are ruining our daily lives and the irony they are shielding their own children and families from these issues with no accountability. I doubt they'd be able to survive the world that we live in right now.I've been talking to a lot of people who graduated in the financial crisis of 2008 for life advice and the main thing they emphasized was that careers are non-linear and the truth is that it takes many years to reach however you define success - it varies from person to person ie. eliminating debt, buying a car, buying a house, getting a job you really wanted etc. social media warps this unfortunately. the best thing we can do right now is become really good and passionate about the things we work on.",

Any junior dev now with AI if given the specs and what not can generate easy endpoints no problem.

After 1 year, they finally placed me on a project, as the project lead, working with an obscure hardware vendor, no documentation, and as the only member of the team.I asked for help or more time to finish the task, the manager refused to change the 1-month deadline he imposed, I got reprimanded harshly in front of other employees, forced to come in during weekends until we could finish the project (longest week of my life), and lastly, terminated for gross underperformance the moment the project was delivered by a smart programmer (and as far as I am aware, I was the only person to ever be fired in that team).The hiring manager even confessed to me personally that he wanted to yell at me, but was holding back, and asked me if I could stop talking in exchange for not yelling at me (this was in response to a brief, polite, and professional answer I gave to him in response to a question he addressed to me).I was applying for jobs for 2 years with no success after that, bringing my total unemployed after graduating count to 4 years (goodbye self-esteem \\~).I saw a job posting for a GPU Software Engineer position (pfft I can't do that!), I applied out of spite. Desperation can drive someone to make very illogical actions.I have a job that pays more than double than my previous employer, they give me free sodas, and everyone is really nice to me (despite the fact that I suck balls as a problem solver). This job is too good for me and all my income goes straight into my chipmunk cheeks. The company itself is ancient, stable, all about technology/computers (it's neither Nvidia nor AMD). Given that it's a GPU job, I used C++ both on the role and to persuade my interviewers (I **hate** higher\\* level languages).It's fine if you don't consider it a solid career (because I'd agree).My current compensation as a junior is $200kI'm posting this in hopes that it will make an unemployed soul out there feel a little better today.Oh, and they also take us out to eat for free every once in a while and have around \\~5 company holidays (in addition to the normal holidays). It's so cool. I'm going to bleed this company dry and hopefully become smarter by the time I have to return to the job hunt.",

Some of them may not land that SWE role right out of college and need to apply to help desk or some other entry field to get their foot in. Their CS degree is very versatile.But for many it’s SWE or nothing. They go on for 2+ yrs of no tech experience (let alone developer wise) and the longer you’re unemployed the harder it becomes to get an entry level job.",

CIS heavily focuses on business operations, has a bit of coding, some network stuff, etc. It overlaps tech with business management and that sort of stuff. IT strongly focuses on Networks, servers, traffic, databases (which is a bit businessy), etc. The programming tends to focus on more automation type stuff similar to CIS. Some colleges have different curriculums for these courses, others don’t really and you can take any classes. It’s just a big toss up. That’s why almost all job posts have CS, CIS, CIT, IT, or other tech related field. Even if they don’t, it’s usually just implied. Someone with a CS degree that has an oracle box virtual home lab setup, has maybe messed with their home network, and builds computers would obviously be strong contender for Helpdesk. Vise Versa, someone with an IT degree built their own small OS in Rust, maybe has another project developing their own language from C++, and maybe does science and math simulations in OpenGL then they’d obviously be a strong candidate for a true entry level (0-3 years experience, unlike the 3-5 we see now) low level software engineering position.So, all of this to say, it just really depends. They 100% have their differences and should be recognized for that. In the world of experience trumping everything, it doesn’t even matter which is why I can see these roles asking for any tech bachelors.",

        "body": "I think some variation of this is what often gets overlooked. Let's just say that AI, across the board, makes all software dev take 25% the human time that it used to. On the surface that means 75% of devs get laid off. But in reality, this ignores the factor of human ambition and greed. The ultimate goal of a company isn't to punch off its current TODO list. It's to maximize profits. So at least some of those 75% should end up building new features and launching new products to generate more profits through efforts that wouldn't have been justifiable at the previous cost of development.And some of them will go off and start their own companies doing things with a person or two that previously would have taken a team, startup capital, etc.And so on.I think the same thing applies to the idea of people sitting idle overall. If you look at all of the laid off people coldly as a resource pool sitting idle waiting to be exploited to generate profits, it starts to look as silly to not find a way to put them to work as it would be to not tap into an oil well sitting idle in your backyard. Not because you're trying to do a good deed by giving them a job, but because you're trying to make more money. Which is really the only reason anyone has a job today.The truly difficult part could be the relative pace of all of this - if millions of people get laid off at an unprecedented rate, it will take time to figure out how to leverage this new human resource - what happens in that time? But in the long run, I suspect that the ultimate answer to how we keep ourselves busy in the face of these new tools will be the same answer that has accompanied every productivity increasing technological development in human history: we'll just do more. That drive is pretty central to what it means to be human, IMO.",

But it’s not there yet and won’t be anytime soon even though our entire economy is propped up by that idea.The point of Ai currently is to cut down on entry level and mid level roles. Theres a two fold approach to why companies do this, both of them have to do with money.1. Just hire less people and cut down on time to train them as that’s lost revenue, and also lay off employees who are not absolutely essential or senior level people because they obviously just do nothing right? Makes their labor cost go down, shareholders see better numbers in the immediate, everything is smooth sailing until it’s not.2. The senior level people that stay on assume the work of their peers that got laid off, get a slight pay bump (or none sometimes) to do their work being “augmented” by ai, this basically allows the company to get more labor for paying the same price effectively.Dollar now > dollar tomorrowEveryone loses, they win, economy gets wrecked we lose jobs, they get record profits and re invest into other business ventures or just pay themselves with the “returns” :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:",

On top of that, the field is shrinking. Software jobs aren't going away, but as efficiencies improve and people continue to upskill their credentials and experience, people will be squeezed out of the job market.Why would anybody in 2026 choose a new bootcamp graduate over them? On top of that, even the bootcamp graduates from a while back who broke into tech are at risk of getting squeezed out of the job market as it shrinks while the number of more qualified CS graduates continues to grow. Bootcamp + 15 years of experience at small scale no name companies < top 10 university + 5 YOE at FAANG.The lesson to pull from all this is that there are no shortcuts, and if you want to succeed, you need to put in the work to be better than everyone else on paper and in practice. CS is getting outsourced, so we're being graded on a curve across everyone in the world.",

What is broken now is the opportunities for learning those marketable skills on the job are shrinking, and furthermore formal education arguably never squared the circle of teaching those skills in the first place.The signals and heuristics for high skills and experience are generally broken at the moment, or at least, there isn't agreement on what should replace them.

Would really help if you can devote your time to building something tangible beyond project tutorials, ideally solving a problem aligned with the industry you want to work in, whether that's sales, e-commerce, finance, etc. But you can also leverage your background in medical devices right now as some sort of domain knowledge in healthcare/medicine. Also not too late to network, even if it's just online like virtual conferences. And even if you're not targeting FAANG, use this time to practice your interviewing skills, reading [interview guides](https://www.interviewquery.com/companies) to know which companies also value projects as proof of employable skills.",

A problem a lot of new grads have is they aren’t applying across the entire country. In this job market, you have to apply across the entire country and be willing to relocate anywhere. This is what people use to do several generations ago btw, move to random no-name towns for cheap housing and opportunity because life in the big cities was too competitive and expensive. Eventually, these towns became the powerhouses you see today. Military is also a terrific option. I came from the military. Joining the military was the single best decision I ever made in my life, getting out was the second best. I got out with $50k to my name at 23 and more character development than college could have ever provided for me. A lot of hiring managers are also former military and they will almost always prefer other vets that apply, for good reason too.",

Dream up ANYTHING and then start building it, this is not about the product topic, it is all about making software systems. Keep doing this project after project and you will learn a ton about systems, design, logging, communication, etc.I used to be a big book person myself, and they are good to get some ideas to get started, but it's better to go start building constantly, and then come back to the books when you need to reference, get unblocked, or learn how to do a specific thing. I think another aspect of this is that the building of systems/services/projects gives you more things to connect mentally when going through books on \"advanced topics\". For example, after building a bunch of projects, when you go through your next system design book, you will make mental connections to what you've already built and think up use cases and improvements with the topics they are talking about. If you just read books / take courses from the start and aren't building, nothing will stick as easily.",

Offshoring jobs to \"cheaper\" places means that those places become less cheap over time because increasing demand for actual skilled talent which is generally not too high in supply causes salaries abroad to increase and the cost of living to likewise increase from the capital being sent there. It's the reason why tech salaries in a lot of offshore locations like Eastern Europe and Latin America have jumped dramatically in recent years. Not only that, but there's nothing really to suggest that \"expensive\" countries couldn't just lower salaries domestically. This is honestly something that everyone on these subs seem to miss and I don't know why. It may be argued that nobody in such countries would be willing to work for a fair amount less if it came to that, but if push comes to shove, I think it is reasonable to assume that there would be a lot of people willing to do so because otherwise it might mean not having a job. Also:\\> Over time, those countries will develop expertise, infrastructure, and competitive companies of their own. That could eventually mean they outperform Western firms and that further weakens Western dominance in the long run.Yeah, no that's very likely not going to happen. Apart from ex-communist nations, there's a reason that the \"cheap\" places you mentioned are low paying. I'll leave you to figure that out for yourself.",

But I luckily found something during that time.It will probably take several years or so until the next boom. I think there were several things that happened in succession like legislation and business tax law updates, the covid and recession years, and then AI becoming more of a focus, and then offshoring becoming easier. It will take a lot to overcome so much global change. I enjoy programming and solving complex logic problems so that's the reason I am in the field still. At work we are encouraged to use AI more so I do it because it's being tracked. So less manual workflow and more of an agentic or llm type of workflow at the moment. But overall just to say that even if I had the free time I still enjoy the craft and learning opportunities it provides. That is to say try and find a job that is at least tolerable and ride the wave. Try to keep the skills sharp in case the layoff hammer comes around. That's been my philosophy for the past several years been through a couple recessions so always be ready to shift if needed.",

The strike price - this you know, and it's whatever strike price they are listing2. An exit event - this you don't know. In order for you to be able to exercise the stock options, there needs to be an exit event for the company, i.e., the company needs to be sold or it needs to go public. Most companies never get here, and if your company doesn't get here, then the stock options are worth nothing.3. The stock price at the exit event - if your lucky enough that the company hits an exit event, then you'd need the stock price in that exit even to be higher (ideally substantially higher) than the strike price. If the strike price was $2 per share and the company is sold to a megaconglomerate for $3 per share and you have 15,000 shares worth of options, then you just make $15K. On the other hand, if the stock price goes to $32 per share, you would make $450K.This is why most people will tell you that stock options and RSUs and SARs from early stage startups are not worth anything - because the odds that there will be an exit event while you're still employed AND that the exit event will be profitable enough for your options to be worth substantial money are very, very low.",

I’m talking your earning potential is going to drop off quite dramatically as you approach the 5 year mark and don’t have good experience.

The right employer will look at your experience and your eagerness to do real SWE work and see someone worth investing time in. It probably won't be a big tech company, maybe not a big company period, but at this point you just need someone who is willing to take you on for your qualities beyond raw experience. I can only speak to my own experience, but I'm a mostly self taught SWE who switched from a completely unrelated field and have managed to do pretty well for myself at this point, but the thing that made my career growth possible was that I spent the first 4 years of my software career at a tiny startup that just wanted hard workers willing to learn.

So if you ask on experienced devs, you'll probably get a lot of people who are saying language doesn't matter and what not, but the good ones will say the opportunity is only good if you are willing to make the leap to learn the other language.Java is one of those languages that can feel \"old fashioned\" by todays standards because of the fact so many other languages figured out shortcuts or answers to common problems that still exist in java. So my conclusion has been it always is universally painful when anyone is trying to traverse going from something like dotnet or python to a java system. I'm living that pain right now and I'm primarily a dotnet dev that got hired into a java shop that needed a dotnet dev for a side project. And you are right Java Spring is full on magic box because people have built answers to so many problems. It's less programming and more like fitting together pieces of a puzzle, which is why I kind of dislike it. However, it got that way because raw java is the literal boards and nails of high end compiled languages because it was open source and the first one. Had this experience when going between android, iOS, and windows. It was like the windows stuff was somehow between two extremes in approach.",

Don’t worry about Kafka and distributed systems in general. There’s tons of projects that don’t use that at all.Your goal is to actually get a professional job and see how stuff works. I am slightly surprised you can get a senior job without ever working. My worry would be - how do you work in a team, are you familiar with code reviews, shared code bases with git, writing architecture documents, clarifying requirements etc. Especially in senior role you get a lot more responsibilities that are not just code, but you need to be able to drive architecture and communicate to management effectively, steering them in the right direction.Regarding questions and what you put into your cv, full stack vs backend - it doesn’t matter. They will hire based on what they need for the role. If the role leaning to front end they will ask more about frontend. The cv won’t change that. So just keep your cv truthful. There’s a lot of backend leaning full stack positions and you fit that, don’t apply to front end leaning positions.Blazor is definitely used and I do see some positions for it. It’s more used in enterprise applications , which I doubt you can get hired as a senior without ever working in that scale before.",

Your 8 years of keeping a production app running is honestly more valuable than most people realize bc that shows you understand the full lifecycle, can handle real user problems, and know how to maintain code over time. The fact that you've dealt with race conditions, auth systems, and layered architecture tells me you're not just copying tutorials.For the interview prep, I'd brush up on basic SQL optimization, maybe review some common C# patterns, and be ready to walk through your architecture decisions on your main project. They'll probably ask you to solve a simple coding problem, but it's more likely to be \"write a method that does X\" rather than dynamic programming puzzles. As for the full stack vs backend question, honestly your Blazor experience might be more of an asset than you think as lots of .NET shops are curious about it but don't have anyone who actually knows it well. I wouldn't pivot away from mentioning it, especially since it shows you can handle the whole stack when needed. Small companies love that versatility because they don't have huge teams. The 2.5k salary is solid for a first industry role, especially remote from LATAM, and once you have that professional experience on your resume everything gets easier.",

After that, they sent me an email offering me the Senior C# SQL role.I know that I'm not near to a Senior exactly because of what you say, those are the exact same feelings I have. I kept my systems up and running without issue for years but I work alone so fixing problems always has been easy because I know everything about my projects.Yet I feel like I would never be ready and I saw no offers for remote positions for Jrs, I've been looking for them in LinkedIn for weeks, and the market is really harsh for people without a degree to miss this opportunity. I have nothing left to lose, So I applied.I'm hoping the bar is not set too high and I'll just be honest in the interview, I'm not a regular Senior but their requirements didn't say anything about leadership nor complex tasks, so this may be a good fit.Anyways, thanks for answering, I'm glad a human can try to help me, I'm sick of speaking to AI and it just gives me fake hope lol, I'd stick to fullstack with Blazor then, at some point I may find a job with it.Btw, where did you saw the job offers?

As SWEs we build products that provide value to customers. Unfortunately users don’t care how scalable a product is (unless there’s an outage), or what design patterns were used, they just want it to work. A sloppily built app with tech debt that works and a better coded app that also works at the end of the day both do the job. I definitely struggled a lot with doing it right vs getting it done at the start of my career and a big thing that helped for me was understanding “blast radius” i.e. if this breaks how bad is it going to be? Why should I care about building a perfect solution for a service only a few customers actually use/care about. Of course customer obsession is a good trait to have, but trying to minmax happiness can help with burnout and understanding what actually needs to be done right.",

In most interviews I've seen, they test your ability to write clean queries that solve real business questions - things like \"find the top 5 customers by revenue last quarter\" which combines JOINs, GROUP BY, ORDER BY and LIMIT. Window functions (ROW\\_NUMBER, RANK) are nice to have but not always expected at entry level. CTEs are worth learning though since they make complex queries much more readable and interviewers appreciate clean code. One tip for practice: try converting everyday questions into SQL queries. Tools like [ai2sql.io](http://ai2sql.io) can help with this - you describe what you want in plain English and it generates the SQL, which is great for learning query patterns and syntax you might not have seen before.",

Try to get any tech job during your break between school.Something you can try is look for full time jobs in your area. When you see the posting, try to contact through the careers area of the website, email, or if you have to, through the application itself.However you are able to try to contact someone, let them know you are an older student who will be graduating in two years, you are checking out different careers, this one caught your eye, and you are wondering what the career is like, what courses might help, and any advice anyone who will talk to you has.Ask for a phone call, email, or buy them a cup of coffee or lunch. Get the advice and just listen, don't \"but what about, or I heard, or people say\", just listen and ask actually meaningful questions. Right after, and I mean right after, write everything down, whatever you can remember.This is both local advice, networking, and a sort of introduction to an interview.Keep doing this as you can. Keep your eye out for and ask about any local events where IT people meet to talk IT stuff, if you can, try to attend. The goal is to be seen.Getting the degree and being a good fit for the company and the team are what is important. Regardless of what you take, you are not going to really know what you are doing for the first five years, so when people give you free advice, listen.Ideally, you will graduate having had a few tech summer jobs, and have networked with several people. When you are close to graduating, reach out to any of them that gave you their contact info and ask them if they know if any job opportunities. Do this slowly, not all at once, you don't want to burn any bridges.Good luck",

Idk how your experience has been with your current company, but my biggest takeaway from being at the position I am at currently is that you should switch jobs when you feel you knowledge has stagnated (as in not learning much) or you prefer to go in a different direction in your field (switching from a Full Stack Engineer to say a Back End Developer).It also appears getting past the 2 year mark is pretty much the golden rule. Now depending on how much you are learning or if you have stagnated, the 2 year mark could be a good indicator to look at how far you have come since starting and analyze how much you have learned. I specifically plan on getting to around the 3 year mark before I start applying to much higher paying position. Be it, I am only a few minutes from my house currently and don't have a house, car, or kids to worry about in terms of big monthly payments. Whatever you do end up doing, do not just quit your job and hope to get picked up elsewhere fast! When I graduated college in 2023, it took roughly 10-11 months before I got the position I am in currently. Just be aware that when you do start looking, it could be another full year till you find that next job.",

I've seen several people who still can't get a job even after doing OMSCS which really makes me question if it's worth it.OMSCS is not going to move the needle in terms of recruiting, most recruiters are aware of the program and its 90% acceptance rate after they've seen thousands of applications of people blasting through Georgia Tech MSCS (online omitted of course). Everytime I say this I get someone pointing out the rigor, which I don't find to be a working argument because any decent engineering program is going to be fairly rigorous in its own right. What recruiters actually care about is name brand and the selectivity signal that comes with prestige. Example in point: a majority of interns are completely useless and are a complete net loss for the company. Having a nice internship from a good big tech is still going to move the needle very favorably resume-wise because of the bar of what it took to be accepted, and the signal to recruiters that you were able to get in a prestigious company, even if you didn't really do anything productive.>I've heard several people say they completely blacklist WGU grads so that's why I'm concerned with just having it on my resume.No one is specifically blacklisting WGU, this seems very unlikely. The simpler and more likely reason at hand is that your resume is probably not competitive enough for the current landscape. Adding OMSCS to your resume is not going to change that either.The reality is that it's going to be very difficult for average CS grads to find work within this environment and landscape. The easier times when many people could reasonably make their way into a decent SWE job have passed, and is most likely not going to come back. SWE payroll has always been one of the biggest costs that companies look to reduce within their financials, and rampant outsourcing and AI have done a lot to cut down on available jobs.",

The third is University of Maine in presque Isle. All three of these schools take a ton of transfer credits that you have from your associate's degree and your mechanical engineering studies. They also take a ton of alternative credits like clap and other things. In terms of financing it, you probably still have a little bit of money available in terms of government student loans. You might be able to get out of this whole thing for under $10,000 and loans and that will be well worth the cost.Check out the r/WGU and r/umpi subreddits.

If I know I didn't have a good explanation of a detail on my resume, I can brainstorm a few and practice them until they sound natural. Or if I flubbed a coding section, practice it. Look up the questions I didn't know.I guess you can try to read between the lines of the little feedback you did get too. Like if your profile was impressive, they might have thought your performance didn't match their expectations (for that experience or title before).Or ask for very broad suggestions on places to improve. It could be near the end of the interview itself, before the decisions. Maybe even offering ideas yourself to make it easy for them to parrot it back if you're worried about bothering them. And to show where you think you could best improve.Maybe I've just gotten enough experience finally, but \"culture fit\" (and confidence) has felt really important for a lot of my previous interviews. Do you fit in. Are you like us. Can I work with you, and do I want to. Information can be learned. New tools often are like other tools (new dialect). Is your first instinct like mine (different means unique solutions, same means they'd agree with it).Or they need a Kung Fu master to come in and be the expert/owner.

I don’t know if HR sends generic rejections or just ghosts you if we reject.Phone round - I stopped doing this because i felt it’s pretty useless, it was useful screening tool when we didn’t do virtual interviews and instead had in person interviews. Generally I go over work experience, poke around some technical areas, see if you know what you’re talking about or if the resume was exaggerated. Also good opportunity for both parties to calibrate expectations, so we aren’t wasting eachother’s time. Then wrap up with LC easy question, my go to is a graph search algorithm.Onsite/Virtual final round - now this highly depends on the role. For IC I usually do system design round, for other EMs, I’ve done system design and roadmap planning and strategic vision. Main reason I’ve failed people who solved the system design was due to lack of depth in understanding. It’s very clear when they’re regurgitating from a video they’ve seen rather than make live trade off decisions and ask clarifying questions. Did I really say speed was necessary? Or do we care about accuracy and freshness of data? Why are you adding a cache? Did you clarify the DAU and types of requests to be confident in your cache hit rate? You get the picture. For EM side, it’s usually their examples from their previous job lacks the scope we were looking for. “How did you drive alignment across the organization? How many teams were involved? Did you come up with a proposal for leadership? How much coordination tax would this take? What is the risk if we don’t complete?”TL;DR - we’re human, your interviewer needs to like you and you need to fit their similarity bias. Most rejections are because someone better applied, more knowledgeable, better work experience, and just had a good day.",

My entire time working towards my CS degree I have been a full-time employee, some of the time in management positions - hence some of the more managerial sounding bits of work experience. This is a long shot, but do you have any advice for this? I feel like the management experience / team leadership experience isn't worth nothing, but I struggle to spin it in a way that translates to a CS job without it being obvious that I'm trying to sell something. Also, one of my final classes focuses a lot on common algorithms and common problem runtimes / solutions. Would these be worth putting onto my resume if I am able to create optimal solutions to them? My gut instinct would be to *not* include solutions to things like this, as they're often common interview questions.",

Most of the applied stuff is stuff you eventually pick up in the industry based on years of career specialization. It's fine to have an interest in many different specializations, but it's not particularly realistic to expect that schooling is gonna bridge the gaps (which are more like chasms for the breadth of things you're listing)More realistic is pick one thing and go deep in that. Pivoting professionally generally assumes you'll work your way into the relevant experience somehow, either through lateral moves in your current employer or startup experience or something along those lines, rather than starting from scratch as a new grad junior all over again.",

I disagree with comments saying going back to school for CS can't hurt, because it absolutely can hurt to study while working full time: your bank account, your relationships, your health. I had a lot of difficult life events happen almost as soon as I started the OSU program that made the whole experience really painful. Don't take the decision lightly",

The imposter syndrome is real, but tbh I think you're overthinking this.Here's the thing about those foundational gaps you mentioned. Yeah, they're important for certain roles, but for the path you're describing (backend dev, cloud infrastructure, applied ML), you can absolutely fill those gaps without going back to school. I've been learning this stuff in real time while building, and honestly some of the best engineers I know are self-taught or have non-CS degrees.The AI systems architect goal is totally doable without a formal CS degree. What matters more is understanding how to design scalable systems, knowing your way around cloud platforms, and having practical experience with ML workflows. I'm seeing this firsthand - we're building Sprout (an AI job search tool) and the technical challenges are more about system design, data pipelines, and user experience than theoretical CS concepts. The foundational stuff comes up, but you learn it when you need it.That said, if you do want structured learning, there are way more efficient options than a full degree program. MIT OpenCourseWare has excellent systems courses, Coursera has solid ML specializations, and honestly YouTube + building projects will teach you more practical skills than most university programs. The Georgia Tech OMSCS program is solid if you really want the credential later, but you could probably test into it with your existing experience and some strategic self-study.The real question is whether you need the degree for credibility or just the knowledge. For backend/cloud/systems architecture roles, your portfolio and ability to solve problems matters way more than your diploma. Plus you're already employed and gaining experience - that's honestly more valuable than classroom time right now.What specific foundational concepts are you feeling most lost on in your current work? That might help you prioritize what to tackle first without the whole degree commitment.",

Honestly, lately, i tend to prompt engineer a lot of my work, especially boiler plate tasks. Not because I can’t solve it myself but just to expedite tasks that would have otherwise been super tedious. Of course, i always make sure to double check what’s been implemented.Anyways, i came to realize that I don’t really encounter too much heavy math or really any of the foundational topics i mentioned in my post. Well, except maybe data structures and algorithms. But I know for a fact I can just revisit those topics on my own. Even then, the type of data structures and algorithms that I come across or use aren’t really all too complicated.I guess i’d like to pivot into something with a little more “job security”. I feel like ai systems management is the way to go. But, to be perfectly frank, i haven’t taken much of a deep dive with system design nor machine learning. Im just at that stage where I’m thinking about pivoting into those roles. Right now im doing mostly basic crud both fe and be. Which is why im wanting to do something that’s a little more future proof. That’s why im considering perhaps going back to school. To learn the fundamentals of cs. But, I honestly do feel that I can teach myself these things. The tricky thing is coming up with a solid structure/strategy. In fact, i asked chat gpt and it actually did lay out a pretty solid plan. Thank you for those course recommendations btw, ill make sure to look into those. Maybe it’s the confirmation bias talking (i really do try to look both sides of the equation), but your response has sort of helped put my mind at ease. Honestly, I’m fine with hearing both sides. I just like not keep all of this bottled up in my head as I tend to overthink. I generally go with my intuition, but, it’s still good to keep an open mind. Thanks again for your perspective",

It just means better.I've seen people with 2 YOE get Senior titles because they were at the right place right time—young team, desperate, whatever. Or just dumb. It's all dependent on who's in the room when. Someone can be at a place where they don't have anything more than Senior because, well, they don't, and cap out at Senior even though they've been doing the same shit for 25 years. This exists... more than I want to admit. Remember: There are more than just 1000 companies in the world that are powered by applications—custom or out-of-the-box.I'm not saying titles don't matter—they do, they gate a lot of things including but not limited to your dating life—but if you want to level up your skill, that's a lot more of a different thing than just saying \"I want to move up to Senior Backend.\"",

        "body": "Hey friend, I get you, you are going to be ok.First of all, you have a lot of anxiety and expectations, that oozes out of your pores. It's not going to help you if no one takes you seriously. Pick a 24 hour period once a week to do no school work, you need to let your brain rest.Graduating with a bachelor's of science majoring in computer science, for me at least, was an exercise in stubbornness. I just didn't get \"it\". The thing about computer science is it is not about specifics, it is about concepts.If you can understand the concepts, you can code in any language. You aren't getting a degree to \"learn to code\", I know it might feel like that, but that's not it.Your degree is learning how to learn to code, and that is a very distinct difference.If you are a first year student with no coding experience and you jump right from class to assignment and expect to bang out code, it isn't going to work; to get it to work you need to build the synaptic pathways, to do that you have to work through it. To do that, you need to pseudo code.You can write out pseudo code like an essay.Let's take something very simple, adding two numbers.Do we need anything? I don't think so, but let's put a comment at the top where we can ask for anything that we need to be brought in.Next we need to numbers. How are we going to get those numbers? We need to decide what type of numbers we want. Let's say that we want two whole numbers, we need containers to hold those numbers, and we want the containers to be empty.Name container one and empty itName container two and empty itThen we want to get two numbers. Let's assume we are going to ask a person, then write a function.Ask person for two numbers and store them in the containers, then call the function we will write.The function will then be a box we put something(s) in and then something(s) come out.So we say we cut holes in the box for thing 1 to go in so the box knows that thing 1 has the properties of the hole for thing 1, and the same for 2. Then we cut another hole in the box for one thing to come out.Then that is it. You start very high level and then you write out what you want to do, then you try to figure out how to do it.You have be able to understand the concept of what it is that you are doing before you can code it. Once you know the code, then it is figuring out the syntax.You then start from the top and go to the bottom and change all that you know into code. If you don't know it, try to figure it out, look it up in a book, spend a good 15 minutes on it. Once you can't figure it out, put that specific part into AI and ask it to change it to code. See if anything clicks.Make a word document and name it whatever you are having problems with. Then copy and paste the pseudo code and the AI code into the document. Then tell the AI that you don't like that one and you want it done differently, and keep pasting in the different ways of doing things as you tell it that you want it different; there will be a finite number of ways of doing it.Look at the document, is there anything in that document that \"clicks\" and makes sense to you? If it does, put it at the top and highlight it. That's the way to remember doing it. Rinse repeat.There's no other way to code than understanding the concept of what you want to do and then turning that concept into a reality through syntax. Computer science is like a pyramid, the concepts you learn in year one will hold up year two. I still remember having to use the Jacobian from calculus and being like \"What the actual fuckity fuck fuck?\"If you don't have the time to learn the concepts of how to psudocode at a high level, I think you need to consider making more time by doing less.If you can understand the concepts, but not the syntax, you'll be fine. That will come as long as you keep working at it.",

I don't want to say it's impossible or anything, but I haven't actually met many people who transition around their 40s into tech from trades. I know people who've met one or two, but it's pretty rare. Maybe you're overselling how coarse you are - most cultures I've seen have a lot of flexibility unless they think you're being a dick. mWhat do you envision life as a game developer would be like? Would you ever try making a game?",

        "body": "One thing I can comment in your post is related to the following:>The thing is, I'm still a tradesman, I'm a bit rough around the edges, I have knuckle tattoos, full sleeves and a small face tattoo. I've been arrested for a DUI in the past, I smoke and I swear a lot. I'm also a no bullshit and very blunt kind of person. Frankly, I don't think that I would survive in a big corporate office with an HR department. I have no interest in dealing with office politics or having to be around people putting on airs and then throwing their fellow employees under the bus to further their own career.There are a lot of environments that are surprisingly open-minded about their tech staff, even corporate environments. Part of that was due to supply and demand, and even though that's shifting, corporate workplaces have changed quite a bit. I have worked with many people with tattoos, gauges, and dressed pretty casually. The dress code might be the biggest issue, but I've noticed some offices seem to have loosened things post-pandemic. I'm seeing more people in jeans and casual shoes than in the past. I've spent most of my career wearing shorts in digital agency/consulting companies.There's obviously a spectrum to this, it's not black and white. Sometimes people will shift things around depending on who they're talking to at the same company.Regarding the swearing and no bullshitting, that will depend a bit more on the company and team. It also depends on context. There's also some grey area between being blunt and being a dick. If you're blunt, people will be understanding and fine with it. If you're a dick to people, that's something else. I worked with someone who could not be civil to clients, and it came back to haunt them. A lot of people in tech forget that not everyone is as deep in the tech, and they sometimes have a bad time hiding their frustration. Perhaps similar to trades, there are some skills that translate across jobs/teams, there are other's you'd probably expect people to know, and then how much grace are you extending to people? You hope you receive the same grace you give to others. Some people are understanding of others, and there are others that always seem to be in attack mode to people who are supposed to be teammates. You will encounter people who flat out lie, but I think that's a thing across all industries. I have worked with plenty of devs who turned out to be lying about all sorts of things. It's not just evil managers and the good guy dev.I think you're making a lot of overgeneralizations. There's probably quite a bit of throwing under the bus at game studios, and a lot of them have gone quite corporate. Game companies are also more notorious than others for firing/laying people off very aggressively. Again, there will be a range. e.g., EA vs a smaller indie studio. But some of the smaller studios, as they start growing, end up becoming pretty toxic. You should evaluate each company on its own.Oh, one other thing regarding the DUI. That also will vary by company. I know someone who drank a little too much at a happy hour and shared they had been arrested for selling drugs and was paranoid about that. That person is an Engineering Manager at a social media company now. It's not FAANG but a decently big name. It will depend on the company.",
