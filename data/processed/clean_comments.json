Some candidates tried inviting an AI \"note taker\" to the Teams call, that was denied access and was an immediate red flag (not one of them \\*asked\\* if they could do so).We then had people who seemed to hesitate before answering any question. Once or twice, nerves, every single question? It's pointing the way of stalling before waiting to see the text appear for them to regurgitate! There's also the tell of the eye darting off screen to read something... could be notes, but... given what they then said, it just gave the impression of reading from either someone else googling on their behalf, or AI LLM output.But every single one was derailed by this one simple trick... as hiring manager, I was interviewing the person for them, not their technical skills. There was some of that, but more in approach and mentality, rather than specific abilities, that would come in the next round. So I would just say to the candidate \"You have listed these ETL tools on your CV, which is your favourite and why?\"Every single time, the ones reading AI output would turn into a marketing bot, sounding like an advert for the tools, bullet point after bullet point. Not one of them highlighted a favourite without being asked again, and then couldn't actually answer definitively as to why they chose that above another, almost as if they'd just picked one at random. The humans answering that question would do so in a conversational manner, often immediately blurting out their favourite and then going through the pros and cons as to why.I can see the appeal of using AI to help, to act as a pointer to guide your answers, especially in areas of theory where you're rusty because you've been at the coalface for a while. But don't rely on it 100% to the point where you cannot actually hold a conversation with the person you're talking to.",

Many “new” platforms are abstractions over familiar engines (Spark) anyway.Most content creators aren’t learning everything from scratch each time; they’re reapplying the same approach to new tools. Once you’ve done that a few times, picking up a new stack is a breeze. Also, free tiers and cheap cloud setups make experimentation easy. You don't have to break your bank to spin up a Spark cluster. I’ve worked across multiple stacks as a consultant, and my approach has stayed the same: understand data, compute, movement, and modelling. The tool is just the means to get there.",

This is why most teams cannot afford to maintain it. It's working because our team is very mature. I don't think you can expect it for a team that has been stable for less than 5 years and is still overloaded with requests and production issues.

However, IME for very complicated jobs, the catalyst query optimizer behind Spark performs better than the other two - if you have more than 10ish non-broadcast joins in a given query, I would rather trust spark. You will need to spend more time on a dev setup (e.g. unit tests are awfully slow without a spark connect server which you fire up each morning), but you also get some goodies such as Spark UI/History Server and a really powerful and stable API.- As you are using Delta, I would be cautious with duckdb. Afaict, write support is not yet there, and even for reads I had undocumented not-implemented errors bubble up from the internal c++ code (on1.41 if I remember correctly). The API there does not yet look super stable.- On the off chance that you are in a corporate environment where your development machines run windows, strongly prefer polars over spark. Delta spark on windows is possible but a pain because of the Hadoop dependency.",

A lot of good data engineers started exactly where you are, analyst first, then thrown into DE work.Those two books are solid choices, especially The Data Warehouse Toolkit. That already puts you ahead of most people watching random YouTube playlists.A few practical suggestions that usually help in this transition First you should lean hard into SQL beyond analytics use. Window functions, performance thinking, indexing basics, and understanding how queries behave on larger tables matter way more in data engineering than fancy Python at the start.Second, focus on systems, not tools. You do not need to master every framework. Try to really understand things like how data moves from source to warehousebatch vs streaming at a conceptual levelidempotency, backfills, and schema changes If you get those ideas, tools become much easier to pick up later.Third, build small but realistic projects. Not Kaggle-style analytics, but things like:ingesting CSV or API data into a warehousetransforming it with SQLhandling schema changes or bad data Even simple pipelines teach more than watching videos. For courses on a budget, I would look at Data engineering content from freeCodeCamp and similar channels, but selectively, some Udemy courses can be decent if you wait for sales, just avoid anything that is purely tool-driven without explaining why things are doneCloud provider docs and tutorials can actually be very good once you know what to look for. since you are already doing DE tasks at work, that is huge. Pay attention to what breaks, what is painful, and what people complain about. That real-world friction is where most learning happens.You do not need a formal degree right now to grow into this role. Curiosity plus hands-on exposure beats structured programs more often than people admit.If you are enjoying the work and asking these questions, you are probably on the right path.",

Remote is often misunderstood as \"work anywhere at any time\". Remote more accurately is rephrased as \"work from anywhere within the country you have working rights during specific hours which have been stipulated in a contract\".You also have the situation where if you work in the evening and there's nobody there with you, there's a strong possibility you're doing fuck all/maverick shit which is about to murder production tomorrow and there's nobody there to help.That being said, no harm in asking.

The entire company is remote.I can generally work \"U.S. business hours\" but might work East Coast hours one day and West Coast hours the next day depending on what works for my schedule. If I need to be gone for an hour in the middle of the day, I block it off on my calendar. If I need to go to a longer appointment, I'll book it either at the beginning or end of the day, block it off on my work calendar, then let people know in Slack the day before. If I need to flex more than two hours like that, I usually just take half a sick day--I think I get 9 sick days a year? \"Unlimited\" vacation days, though. The assumption is that sick days are short-notice while vacation days are approved in advance.I usually have two 1-hour meetings on Mondays, then no meetings the rest of the week; every 4-6 weeks, I have a 30-minute meeting with my manager. There is a monthly Engineering \"meeting\", but it's recorded, so you only need to join the Zoom if you feel like watching live or want to ask questions in the Q\\&A; the agenda is provided in advance. Everything else is asynchronous, including the daily standups, Product updates, etc., unless you want to ask someone questions \"live\" to debug a project you're working on. Then, a meeting is scheduled. \"Just hopping on a call\" isn't really a thing in my team, because if you need to ask detailed questions on how to do something, that means the documentation needs to be improved, which means someone needs to write more down for the next person. So again: the call should have an agenda prepared and sent in advance.I am on-call 24/7 a week at a time, every 6ish weeks. There are rarely pages outside of business hours, though. Only a few times per year.I would say all the flexibility on my team is because everyone is senior+, so no one really requires close \"supervision\" per se. We also have tight delivery deadlines, so regardless of schedule flexibility, you won't last long if you don't get your work done.",

This is also a softskills problem. Sorry to break it to you but markets do not operate on merit alone. It's also who you know, who you get to know, and timing. I was working a junior salary for the longest time (40k a year junior dev) and then I went right up to 170k/year as of today. I was lucky to have the Elixir slack group back in the day sit me down and have this talk with me and make me realise I'm letting myself get hustled (or fleeced if you're a northerner like me :) ) because I lack the self confidence to apply for positions that pay a respectable income, in the UK, above what a copywriter makes.

I do the same I used to on SQL server DWH just with spark now. Combined with delta lake it’s kinda nice though especially the Change data feed capabilities. We don’t have huge data we don’t need spark but it integrates nicely with fabric so we use it. All these jobs with big data require you to be good at spark /dbx but it’s just hard to get that experience out of nowhere especially coming from smaller orgs.

Are there null values in your join keys (this is usually a problem that causes a lot of skew and performance issues)? How much data are you joining per row, as in what is the content of the columns you're joining (if this is big this also causes problems)? Are you increasing the number of rows with these joins? Also, what is actually failing when it does? Try to see what's going on using the Spark UI while it's running to see what's taking so long, or what's going wrong.I think repartitions and partitions will mess up your performance. Repartitions will be pointless because I think Spark will reshuffle with the next join anyway, and persists make it more difficult for Spark to optimize the entire plan and may take up space on memory / disk, which you may already be lacking.If column renaming seems to mess up your execution plan try to do all of the column remaining before the joins (so rename columns for each dataset first) and/or do all the renaming at the end. I don't see how your action plan would result in anything other than a bunch of BroadcastHashJoins with no shuffling in between this way, given all of the joins are joining small tables to a large table on the same unique ID.Also check how much memory each executor is using and how the data is distributed across your workers. If your data doesn't fit in your cluster's memory it will become very slow either way.All that said, if you're doing 27 joins on 820k rows with max 64 cores it might just take a long time either way. That's a lot of work and a big plan to distribute for very little cores.",

Even if each side is small, Spark’s optimizer might not treat it that way. Tools like AQE exist to reshape joins dynamically, but in practice they are not always enough, especially if Spark does not recognize your joins as equi joins.What changed the game for us was three things combined:* Using explicit broadcast hints instead of letting Spark guess, for example `broadcast(df_small)` Forces a BroadcastHashJoin rather than a nested loop join.* Reducing the logical plan spike by collapsing intermediate transformations. This means fewer repeated `.withColumn()` calls.* Using DataFlint’s plan diff tooling to see where broadcast dropped out. That exposed the real culprit.You can tune memory, partitions, and caching, but none of that matters if the plan never selects an efficient join algorithm.",

There are a lot of people who say they want things, but they don't prove it even a little bit.As I said, it's a very exciting field with a lot of opportunities. Foster some excitement by exposing yourself to interesting things. Good luck.",

It spends more time shuffling the index tree than actually storing your data.Try using \"rewriteBatchedStatements=true\" in your JDBC Connection String and let us knw if it solves the performance issue.Also, if it is one time thing or full reload, you would be better off dropping the indexes, the non-primary ones at least, before you begin with the load/reload.Hope this helps.",

A lot of the workarounds requires airflow or similar but that doesn't help us dbt cloud folk.Also, to be clear, parse is likely a misnomer here, dbt doesn't have to touch the db on a parse normally. Compile is what is probably eating OPs compute and time. Even then it's kinda crazy how much time it's taking for them. We have 5000+ models (with thousands of tests too) and it doesn't take that long for a full compile. Like 3-5 minutes. And that's including a lot of introspective adapter calls.I've also seen other folks manipulate the hash that dbt checks so it doesn't think it needs the full parse as an alternative workaround. It does need something like airflow to do it, given I'm on dbt cloud I can't.",

There might be other tools (BI tools, proxies, etc) that have built in support for more popular platforms that won't work with MotherDuck out the box. None of these are particularly insurmountable, just costs you should be happy to take on in exchange for the experience you like. One thing you might do to hedge is store data at rest in Iceberg on GCS and self host a catalog like \\[Lakekeeper\\](https://docs.lakekeeper.io/). Then your data is completely portable. If you for some reason determine you need to switch to Snowflake or Databricks, they can read data form this catalog and you don't have to move anything. Or you may even find out you want MotherDuck for most things but have specific use cases where another engine like Clickhouse is useful.

It is not a super complicated stack but it *is* work and creates an additional point of failure, especially with the networking and security side of it imo. My recommendation is keep it as is if you love it since Motherduck appears to be a very affordable service, if you end up having to migrate later on it should not be a very heavy lift. Best of luck on your business!",

I don't think this information is really a hard requirement for getting started though.Data engineering is just so incredibly broad. So much of your day to day job is dictated by what size company you end up applying at as well as the industry. For example, Kafka is a foundational piece of tech for a high percentage (forget the actual number) of fortune 500 companies. But it's also totally overkill for many smaller companies who may not need near-real-time analytics or near-real-time data processing.I'd say to become very comfortable with SQL (postgres and one data warehousing dialect such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery), Python, and dbt. While some may classify dbt as an \"Analytics Engineer\" tool, I think it's a great bridge between the worlds of data analyst and data engineering. Plus it's very common at companies of many different sizes.Then become comfortable with some form of orchestration tool such as Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, or some equivalent of those. For Airflow, there is a MWAA local runner docker image that might be useful for running a local version of Amazon's managed Airflow instance. Just search \"github MWAA local runner\" to find the repo which should have instructions. This is way easier and cheaper than running a real airflow instance.Maybe just read up on data ingestion tooling such as Airbyte, Fivetran, or Meltano, just to fill in that gap so you understand how transactional data gets loaded into a data warehouse (ELT is a good term to know/research).At that point, I'd say the knowledge you've acquired is transferrable to most tools that small to mid-sized companies would require (or at least desire) for an entry level data engineer position.Good luck!",

Ive been called in various roles data manager, BI developer, product owner, tester, data consultant, data scientist and data engineer. Currently platform engineer.Second, In my mind, its mostly about experience and doing. Not only read, but just be out there solving data problems for companies. You learn by doing. And all the experience contributes to growing as a data professional, whatever the role you happen to fill.Lastly, the only thing I really recommed you to read, is kimball modeling and to write a lot of python and sql.  Those skills (largely) transfer. All the rest (gcp, azure, aws, snowflake, adf, fabric, databricks) is dependent on the stack you happen to end up working with.  Great that you can learn gcp now and id do it, but chances are your next job is azure..",

Someone saw this post and sent to me so here I am writing my first Reddit reply lolLance does support most of the catalog on the market, check out this page: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/) I guess I did a bad job marketing these features. I did publish a few blogs, but mostly under the context of integration with compute engines, like [https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/](https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/) and [https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/) . For all the supported catalogs, you can basically use Lance side by side with your Iceberg datasets.But I think you raised a great question - \"anyone actually cataloging their lance datasets? or is everyone just yolo-ing it\". I did these integrations because we do have real customers using them. But I do see a common trend that data engineers in enterprise corporations that have data lake, data warehouse or data lakehouse setups, and trying to integrate Lance for AI features tend to want catalog support. For the frontier labs AI engineers, they tend to just prefer having storage-only solution and yolo-ing it.To bridge that gap, I also did one catalog within Lance, the Directory Namespace: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/) . It is basically a catalog living in a directory, backed by a Lance table, so everything still stays purely in storage. It is also compatible with just a plain directory of Lance tables, which is typically how people start using lance format, when they do pip install lancedb and create a table. In general, most of the users I interact with treat embedding as a part of real data assets. You can definitely store multiple versions of embeddings generated by different models for different use cases or just compare their effectiveness and switch over time. That is actually one key use case for Lance, which is you start with a table with just a single column, maybe images or videos. You continue to do data evolution - add embedding columns, caption columns, feature columns over time, and they accumulate and become a very wide table. That becomes your entire multimodal data asset. Check out some case studies with for example Netflix [https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/](https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/), Runway: [https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/)",

There's a creative tension there that needs some judgement to negotiate, and sometimes, there'll be a shift or some contextual thing that changes that means suddenly it's time to tweak your implementation model again. You need some freedom to be able to do that - but it should be constrained - go too far off-piste and nobody will understand what you're up to.Back to the question, if you've got multiple dev streams working in the same area, it pays to have a canonical representation that they can all agree on (whether they're human or machine) to support data-sharing and integration later on - therefore, there has to be some design-first approach to data - at least at some level.If your approach to that is to all agree on some canonical higher-level model, then you can handle implementation-specific choices by always providing a well documented mapping from your system's model back to the canonical one and get the best of both worlds.",

Snowflake (SF) would probably be much easier to learn as SF is more of a SQL-first paradigm; I'd recommend learning **Iceberg** in parallel to SF.Maybe look into experimenting with real time streaming solutions as well like (Kafka / SQS) + (Spark Streaming / Flink / Golang) to stream table changes (CDC) from an RDBMS (e.g. Postgres) into an Iceberg table that could be queried via Snowflake.Also be sure to know when to use a row-based file format (e.g. Avro) and when to use column-based format (e.g. Parquet).From there you'll have a solid starting point in the SQL + Snowflake + Iceberg world and can branch out to the Spark + Databricks + Delta world if required or curious.",

Better if your metadata is more about \"what happened\" (observability) vs \"what should happen\" (control).I'd skip anything with \"connector\" unless it's actually handling source system connections. That term is overloaded now, half the modern data stack thinks connector = Fivetran/Airbyte-style ingestion.Quick side note: if you're manually querying these tables at job start to figure out dependencies and last-run timestamps, might be worth checking if your orchestrator exposes that natively through its metadata DB or API.

There is 0 gain from making it a snapshot and eating the storage and eventually processing speed. I wouldn't worry too much about what others think of how and where the data should work in theory. Theory rarely ever applies in the real world, the data and how you get it dictates what you do and in this field most cases, you have 0 control over the source of the data. Which means almost nothing operates like it should and you just have to get the data as accurate as possible, as efficiently as possible space, and processing wise. To me, Bronze always matches source, or at least as close to it as you can possibly get. If it doesn't, you are going to have a horrible time running down why things don't match up. Snapshotting like option A is really only good for if you need to see how things have changed over time, or doing day to day comparisons at the Bronze level and I'd rarely ever want to do that because that's honestly a waste of space and processing. As for Option C, I would avoid anything that makes data right after the fact and there's a point in time where non-dirty read data is inaccurate. That's asking for someone or something to query it when it isn't fixed yet and you running down nonsense for a day.",

But it's a way to get you practical experience on something end-to-end without being too high stakes.If you really want to practice before you join, build a DAG in Airflow just to understand how it works. Meta uses Data Swarm as an orchestrator which is most similar to Airflow, but they've abstracted so much as to make it trivial to create a new DAG. With Data Swarm you're not even really building a DAG, you're just building the config and the back end logic is doing most of the work for you. They also have a custom visualization software, so play around with the free version of Looker or Tableau. Most onboarding projects are going to be something like \"take this raw data, build a denormalized / aggregate table, build a dashboard on it\"If you can do those things, write good SQL, and write basic Python, you're already ready for the job.",

You should think about how that contract might open up more opportunities to get paid even more without having to do DE jobs. You don't even like the DE job you're doing. There's nothing to miss. Also if you're worried about AI take over DE job, all the more reason to get out of it? The concerns are contradictory, if you know what I mean. I'm a DE and I don't think AI can take my job in the next 5 years. Nobody is gonna tell AI what the data looks like for security reason and also it's just spouting things based on probability not actual logic so the procesing logic and domain knowledge still need to be done by human. If anything, it might generate more demands to build data warehouse to train AI models, which are separate use case from the existing analytics and financial report use case. The real concern is the market downturn and if the AI bubble bursts, people might stop hiring altogether because they want to cut cost (which has nothing to do with AI as a technology but AI as a balance sheet problem). There's no way to bullet proof that future, other than a beefy saving just in case....",

Store as JSON. Why? For SSoT and what if the supplier of that API goes out of business, changes their API in some way, that breaks your code? What if in your dataframe the tuple you extract as a table, you're not pulling all entites or all columns - then the business wants you to add those extra columns, retroactively from Day 1 you've been gathering. You're screwed - you don't have it anymore.So E-L-T. Extract (Python + API), Load (into storage for 100% retrieval of 100% of that data), Transform (into a Staging layer, dedupe, business rule(s) for ingestion UpSert or Rejection, into the Bronze layer.So Bronze has proper types and only valid data, Bronze can be destroyed (for a particular source) and recreated at any point in time in the future by rereading all the data in the Datalake and redoing the L & T of the ELT. Staging is usually truncate/load style, and uses Datalake functionality for ingestion - Python isn't needed here at all. Python only for reading from APIs and other distant sources, not for moving data around in the database.Python has another function - for ML - where Python does extensive transformations by reading Bronze & Silver (or even the raw Datalake data) to \"invent\" new data that is then fed back into a Staging layer. For example, a customer \"rating\" based on criteria that can span multiple source systems for that customer.",

Once the contract is up, SAP disables your company account, and boom, APIs no longer work, that SAP data that the company created is gone forever.Or, the cloud supplier doesn't use a version # in their API https url name, and they change the JSON structure enough to break existing code.When the L of ELT is done within the database layer with staging, this is an easy fix, and the Python gathering part, the E of ELT, continues to work as-is.In most cases, the SELECT statement reading the JSON data through the Datalake and putting the result of that Select statement into a staging table will continue to work, as you never ever do SELECT \\* FROM (external table), will instead specify which columns.So fixing the SELECT into the JSON can be done without stress / alarm, and you can easily go back in time to gather the new columns since the time they were available.So Python -> DL -> Staging (Snowflake + Snowpipe with Python as the language can be used here - event driven - or simple SQL) -> Business Rules -> Bronze or Reject.You add audit columns and hashing as required in the Staging table to facilitate the UpSert logic. Remember to do Delete tracking, and other special cases, like Customer B buys out Customer A, what does the business want to do with the Customer A data? Merge or keep distinct, or both!",

Still, right now, our question is whether or not we need to run delta lake maintenance operations (optimize/vacuum) on the bronze table that we currently have.I'll make sure that we revisit the question about storing API responses as files.For context: We are migrating an existing solution, which used to be an Azure Function running C# code that wrote the data to a staging table in a SQL database, to a python notebook in Microsoft Fabric that writes the data to a delta lake table in a lakehouse.We are replacing SQL database + Analysis Services with Delta Lake + Power BI.Currently, our setup is a blueprint copy of the existing solution, which doesn't store the raw data in files.I'm unsure whether we will get the budget to rewrite that part of the process now. We have fast-tracked this project so far, and it's not clear how much work the budget will allow us. I'll also admit that I don't have years of experience as a DE.I highly appreciate the inputs, I'll use this as ammunition for budget discussions about rewriting the ingestion part.",

Then for every IsDeleted propagate into silver and gold according to the business rules what they want to do. So convert, yes, but see how some things can be improved later.

Two quick pushes though: I wouldn’t drop line items entirely (you’ll want them for margin/returns/cohort/LTV and subscription analysis), but you can keep them in a separate table/partition and only join when needed; and I’d strongly consider adding a lightweight transform layer (dbt or even scheduled SQL) so your “business tables” (orders, customers, subscriptions, spend) are stable and not raw connector schemas.For costs/lock-in: biggest surprise costs are usually (1) Looker exploring raw wide tables, (2) GA event data blowing up, and (3) Airbyte sync volume if you pull too much too often. oh yeah also get budgets/alerts in GCP day 1, partition/cluster core tables, and create curated views for Looker so analysts aren’t querying raw. Also, if you ever want less lock-in later, keeping transforms in dbt + storing raw exports (GCS) makes migrating much easier than relying on tool-specific modeling.",

So, you either will have a vendor lock or mixing different entities in one (like Hive Metastore + Hive SQL).Second option looks nice, for example, an OpenLineage standard can be used, but the existence of lineage in catalog will depend on query engine.If I would build a solution on open source technologies, I would prefer a second option. Something like DataHub that supports OpenLineage ingestion via REST API. But I would avoid heavily tighten \"all-in-one\" solutions and would keep lineage as an option.",

The Platform Approach (Unity Catalog) **-** I’ve used Unity Catalog extensively for this. It essentially forces the catalog and lineage to live together. Because the governance (permissions, access controls) creates the lineage automatically as jobs run, you don't have to \"maintain\" the lineage separately. The catalog is the map of the lineage. If you treat them as separate tools, you end up doing double the work to keep them in sync.2. The Open Source Route (OpenMetadata) **-** If you are looking outside of a specific vendor ecosystem, tools like OpenMetadata are tackling this exact \"all-in-one\" problem. They treat data assets, lineage, and quality checks as a single entity. It proves that the market prefers a unified view. Data engineers don't want to tab switch between a catalog to find a table and a lineage tool to see where it came from.3. The Shift to Orchestrators (Dagster) - The most interesting shift right now is actually happening in the orchestration layer. I’ve been using Dagster, and they handle this through “software-defined Assets.\" Instead of lineage being an afterthought or a documentation task, the lineage is defined by the code itself.* Assets **-** You define the data asset, and the lineage is inherent.* Asset Checks **-** You attach quality checks directly to those assets in the graph.So, to answer your question, Yes, a combined solution is useful. In fact, things are moving even further, merging Catalog + Lineage + Execution (Orchestration) into one view so that \"accountability\" isn't just a log you look at later, but part of the pipeline run itself.Hope this helps.",

When you have 100K+ datasets, this breaks governance completely. **Why integration matters more than people realize:** • **Metadata propagation** \\- tag one source table as PII, lineage cascades it downstream to 50 derived tables automatically. Manual tagging doesn't scale.  • **Impact analysis** \\- \"this pipeline failed, who owns the upstream data?\" If you're jumping between tools, you've already lost.  • **Trust flows backwards** \\- you can't assess data quality without tracing upstream. Separate systems = manual stitching every time. Most of the modern catalogs are moving to a model of \\- out-of-the-box connectors that \"pull\" lineage into the system from external systems \\- support reporting of lineage INTO the system via standard catalog-native API-s/agents/emitters or vendor-neutral protocols like OpenLineage **The caveat the other responses touched on:** some solutions like Dagster's \"software-defined assets\" are elegant but only work for what the orchestrator controls. Your data doesn't start in the warehouse: • Production systems feeding Kafka streams  • Real-time stream processing (Flink, Spark Streaming)  • Cross-cloud data movement that never touches your orchestrator  At my previous company, \\~40% of critical lineage came from **outside** the orchestration layer. You need a catalog that can **aggregate lineage from multiple systems** (streaming, production databases, warehouses), not just generate it from one orchestrator. **The test:** can you trace a BI dashboard → warehouse → dbt → Kafka → production database in one query? That's 5-6 systems owned by different teams. The catalog is your aggregation point. Best of luck with convincing your customers and the world!",

A few design things that usually matter more than model choicee would be like always ground generation on the actual schema + metrics layer, not just table names. Most failures come from the model guessing joins or columns, Add a validation step before execution (dry run, limits, blocked queries). Don’t let raw generated SQL hit prod blindly. Start narrow, Constrain what users can ask for (time ranges, metrics, dimensions) before going fully “chatty”. On the knowledge side, most teams I’ve seen keep it simple, Use RAG for business logic, definitions, metric semantics,Treat schema and relationships as structured input, not embeddings.GraphRAG helps when relationships are complex, but it adds a lot of operational overhead.Solr *can* work for retrieval, but it’s usually better as a search layer than a true graph store. If relationships matter a lot, a dedicated graph or just explicit schema metadata often ends up clearer and more reliable. and correctness and guardrails beat clever architecture early. If users don’t trust the numbers, they won’t use it, no matter how good the UX is",

You'd learn whole lot more if you were to build your own pipeline portfolio, load them on GitHub. Perhaps, look into bootcamps if that interest you at all. 3) Data Analyst is generally an entry point into data field. Can scale up from there to senior DA roles or pivot into data engineering, data scientist, AI/ML, Data Architect, Solutions Architect roles. 4) Don't leave your current role if the pay is good and career is stable. Job market right now is pretty harsh, will not make sense to leave a good paying job. Take full advantage of FAANG stocks, benefits and their free online courses taught by FAANG on coursera. Check with HR to see if transition is possible as an internal employee into tech, what would be the process. Find out data engineers internally on outlook, teams, slack and setup 1-on-1 with them, ask all kinds of questions about the skills needed, about their career path, etc. 5) The most fundamental skill required for any data role is SQL, there's no shortcut to that and one cannot survive without knowing SQL at good level. From here skills will pivot based on the role. Ex: Data Engineers require strong data modeling, distributed systems (ex: Databricks, snowflake) storage and compute skills. Tools don't matter at all, focus on the core, basics, foundations as everything else is build on those.Data Scientist: Strong Applied Math or Applied Stats skills, domain knowledge helps a lot.  Feel free to dm me if you want to talk more.",

Even though you say these are one-off parsing datasets in my experience there's still a huge need for: * writing code to handle a lot of backfilling - go pull 20 years of whois data in daily csv files... * building *tested* library modules to do common things - log record counts at each step along with reject counts by reason to a common table that can be used for audit reporting - and that you go back to when people are using the data later & have questions. * rerunning the parsing *numerous* times until everyone is satisfied - on things like whether or not which fields get url-decoded, what to do about fields that were decoded or encoded multiple times, fixing fields with multiple timestamp formats, etc. Recently we had to do this with a nasty vendor feed - and ended up writing code to loop through about two dozen timestamp format attempts until one worked - for every record.If you spent a few years doing this and wanted to go back to engineering and interviewed with my team and then told us that you thought the work would be fun, and you learned a lot, we would have no problem with that. But some teams might though - so I would see if you could get them to title you as an engineer. Not a showstopper for me if they wouldn't though.",

Snowpipes can be triggered when a new file appears. Airflow deposits the file in the DL.Then a staging area (schema) that links to the landing area and allows hashing to eliminate dupes. No transformations here. All columns varchar. A reject schema for data that cannot fit into bronze due to an error. Then Medallion architecture for schemas bronze, silver, gold. Bronze (column transformations to correct types) from the staging. Any data rows that do not conform go to reject schema. Also Bronze is a great place for SCD2 tables. Silver is new & inferred data that is valid but doesn’t exist in bronze. Like splitting customers by geographical zones based on their address. It can make sense for some silver tables to be SCD2, but that’s rare. For geolocation you go get another single source of truth, stage it and bronze it. Then the silver combines two different bronze tables. The silver geolocation could be scd2 for tracking the moves that PK did. And so on. To meet all Gold requirements, for dimensions and facts. Gold is dimensional tables that Kimball and Snowflake are famous for. DIM and FACT. Using Airflow for pushing the data in the Medallion layers is standard practice. To go from BigQuery directly to Snowflake FACT, this is called a Proof Of Concept. Nothing wrong with that. Suggestion, put it in a Dev environment and build a Prod environment. Dev & Prod (maybe UAT eventually) can simply be different database names, same Snowflake account, same Datalake account. You do NOT want the PowerBI people doing their own “fill in the blanks“ that’s how you get data silos. They Will Do This !!!For example (true life example) the PowerBI people will go get their own geolocation data from god knows where and make mistakes, so that Sales Dept will have X$ in one zone and Finance Dept will have Y$ in the same zone for the same time period, as each Dept will have a different PowerBI person. Data must be centralized. For SSoT to work, and in every data row identity the source system for each PK. Maybe as part of your naming convention for the column. Don’t be afraid of typing long column names. Use acronyms when it makes sense. If you haven’t already, take an online course on Medallion and Kimball architecture.",

The sane pattern is raw + PII stays in-region, and only aggregated/anonymous data can move cross-region (if allowed). Practically that means separate regional stacks (EU BigQuery dataset + EU Snowflake / or whatever) and your Airflow just orchestrates per-region configs.

        "body": "Man, I feel your pain. Being the only data person at a startup is a trial by fire. Your founder is right to be concerned about regional compliance, it's a huge headache waiting to happen if you don't address it early. We had a similar situation at my company. We're a SaaS platform, and we started getting customers in the EU and APAC. Suddenly, we had to deal with GDPR, various data residency requirements, and a whole bunch of other fun stuff. Our initial setup was a mess data scattered across different databases and cloud services, no clear understanding of which customer data resided where, and absolutely zero auditability. It was a compliance nightmare. The initial thought was S3 and Iceberg like your mentor mentioned. That adds a ton of complexity in terms of infrastructure and data management. Imagine having to manage multiple S3 buckets and Iceberg catalogs, one for each region? Plus, you'd still need compute instances for processing, potentially Snowflake instances per region as you mentioned. The operational overhead alone would be insane, not to mention the cost. What we ultimately did was implement a virtual data platform that sits on top of our existing infrastructure. It basically created a unified view of all our data, regardless of where it was physically stored. The really cool part was that it automatically discovered relationships between different datasets and identified Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It even flagged data quality issues, like duplicate customer records with slightly different spellings. This would have taken us weeks to untangle manually. Once we had that unified view, we could easily define data policies based on region. So, for example, any data tagged as EU customer data automatically adheres to our GDPR compliance rules. The platform also provides a complete audit trail, so we can easily prove to regulators that we're compliant. And here's the thing that really saved our bacon: we built automated data pipelines using a no-code interface on top of all of this. Before, marketing and sales were constantly bugging the data team to pull reports, create custom dashboards, and integrate data from different sources. It was a huge time sink. Now, they can do most of that themselves with the no-code tools, freeing up the data team to focus on more strategic projects. It sounds like you are running into very similar problems. The company we used has a referral program, so I'm happy to connect you. Full disclosure, I get a little something if they end up helping you out. But honestly, it was such a game-changer for us that I'd recommend them even if I wasn't getting a kickback. They really helped us get our data under control and avoid a major compliance disaster. Happy to make an intro if you think it could be a fit.",

You’re reacting to constraints like messy data, changing requirements, cost limits, and systems you didn’t choose. So the thinking becomes things like where this pipeline will actually break, what happens when volume doubles, what can fail safely and what cannot, and what’s expensive to recompute versus cheap to store. If you’re not on a DE project right now, the closest substitute is to simulate real pain. Take a public dataset and design ingestion, transformations, and reporting, then deliberately change assumptions like schema changes, late arriving data, backfills, or higher volume, and force yourself to optimize for cost and reliability instead of elegance. Books and blogs help with vocabulary, but most architectural thinking comes from asking what the simplest thing is that won’t hurt you later, then being wrong a few times. Reading postmortems and migration stories taught me more than polished tutorials ever did. You don’t really learn architecture in a vacuum, but you can train the mindset by constantly reasoning about constraints, failure modes, and long term impact",

I assume *you* guys care what version is in the wild, same as any need for source control. Depends what you're using, I guess. As u/chronic4you said, if you're using Delta Lake then versioning and metadata is part of it. I can't comment on Iceberg, we don't use it. We do use Delta Lake, and in my case, we wouldn't have differently-named versions knocking around in terms of production. They just get replaced. But we don't run parallel releases and stuff like that. For capturing version metadata in Delta Lake, you could use custom commit messages when altering/replacing tables. This is kind of something I've been thinking about a bit, too. The potential for drift between the DDL code that *is* source controlled and the object in the catalog that the DDL defines concerns me. I don't really have a solution.If you're using simple SQL tables for example, good luck to you. Times past I've had various permutations of \"x\\_dev\", \"x\\_revision\", \"x\\_update\", and even \"x\\_new\" sitting in the database alongside the proper table. Good times.",

I've found things like \"Software Engineer - Data Warehousing\" or \"Software Engineer - Data\". I think those are fair game for DE's, but beware, they are significantly more technical than the generic \"Data Engineer\" roles and the interview process is much more difficult.with all that being said, anything is possible.",

Generating high quality Q&A from 100k word documents with a 70B model is always going to be slow and expensive unless you constrain it hardWhat usually works in practice is breaking this into stages. First chunk aggressively not just by tokens but by semantic boundaries like sections or topics, otherwise reasoning quality falls off anyway. Then do cheap filtering or summarisation passes first, either with a smaller model or heuristics, to identify which chunks are even worth turning into Q&A. Only send the “interesting” chunks to a large modelFor cost people often mix models like small or mid size models for chunking, summarising, and question generation, then a stronger model only for refining or validating a much smaller subset. Trying to run LLaMA-3 70B end to end on a million long documents will blow your budget no matter the platformAlso, be realistic about “challenging reasoning” because most synthetic Q&A pipelines degrade if you push for depth at scale. You usually get better results by generating simpler questions at scale, then curating or rewriting a smaller evaluation set manually or semi automatically.",

Are they fine at that point that the roll-up for ID=1 will change to the v6 value?\" -->** We have two sets of these gold fact tables. One set will always be updated, so it will always get the v=6 record when it comes. The fact table I was writing about in the post will remain at v=5. Business reason comes from our Financial Controller. When the data comes in, we expect that after X days after a reporting period, if there are no upstream data changes, we consider it official. There is an audit requirement to keep a permanent record of this official data for that time period because this is the data that was reported. There is a main gold fact table that will always be up to date and that's used for other purposes, but will always be accurate.We are implementing 'write controls' on the gold layer partition to limit this, but it won't be perfect. We're also going to store the snapshot of this data that can never be written to outside of the gold layer.**\"I'd be more concerned that the record can be updated and they don't want you to propogate the data up through the layers.\" -->** Generally, yes. But we have a pretty unique requirement here. We are fully propagating to gold but also maintaining a separate snapshot that will keep that snapshot in time for reporting purposes. (They need to report on what was reported at the time as one requirement even if what was reported used an older version of the same record).,",

So I am not sure how this applies in your country.Make sure that in the interview you stay authentic. The coach said.Remember you sell work time. Your personality is the bonus.And before the job interview say to yourself that you can do it that you want to do this job.Sometimes it is not about you, why you did not get the job. You can only review the interview in your mind and think if you are unsatisfied with some answers.If you think you nailed it in the interview, then I would say you had bad luck.Hth",

        "body": "I think the limit is mostly hardware and cost, so as long as the cluster/warehouse can handle the IO and compute, 100 TB by itself isn’t a blocker.But the more interesting question is why you’d need liquid clustering on a 100 TB table in the first place.At that size, it often looks like a raw or near-raw table, and raw tables usually have predictable access patterns (time-range filters, append-only writes). In those cases, directory-level partitioning on a timestamp is usually sufficient and cheaper, because partition pruning is extremely effective and requires no ongoing reorganization.Liquid clustering starts to make sense at this scale when:* Queries frequently filter on high-cardinality keys (e.g. account\\_id) in addition to time.* The table isn’t strictly append-only (MERGE/UPSERT, late data, corrections).* Access patterns evolve and you don’t want to constantly redesign partitions.* You want to avoid over-partitioning while still getting good file-level pruning.So the question isn’t “can liquid clustering handle 100 TB?”, but rather whether the workload actually needs it. For a truly raw, time-sliced dataset, partitions alone are usually the right tool. Liquid clustering is more justified when the table behaves less like raw ingestion and more like a shared, multi-consumer analytical dataset where time alone isn’t selective enough.",

When you're on the cutting edge, there is nothing to fall back on. Everything I could copy was just very basic stuff and I only ever really copied it from myself 1000 lines ago.

While all of them have this idea that they're using AI \"as a tool\" that is \"no different than a calculator\" or \"no different than using stackoverflow\" it is fundamentally different and they don't have the knowledge to realize it.

Momentum matters more than the perfect language choice. Once someone experiences progress, the overthinking usually fades on its own.",

If you've been \"trying for years\" to start and not made it happen with today's resources, maybe you need to give yourself peace, allow yourself to let go and admit that it's not for you and that's ok.

Research. Find the tools that can help you fulfill your project goals.3. Set up a dev environment. This can be suprisingly difficult, both because there are many obscure setup challenges that can arise, and because it's kind of boring and frustrating to troubleshoot the part that doesn't give you any immediate results.4. Try basic examples. Use things you research, see if you can reapply them, get an understanding of how new things work.5. Apply them to your problem. In a bigger project, and if you have more experience, you will want to keep in mind maintainability to make changes to this easier. But it's still valuable to just take a crack at it. Maybe it works, maybe you'll run into a dead end and have to start over, this tiem with a better understanding of how to make things work better and be more maintainable.6. Revise until you're done.That's my cycle for my personal projects, at least.

I make a lot of POCs, a lot of demos, do a lot to get ready for training sessions. I mostly fill gaps. If a team or the organization needs something and I am asked I fill it. Not long ago, I was meeting with customers a few times a week as well. I moved to be the tech lead/architect for the Data Science segment (mostly internal facing) in the middle of last year so I don't meet with customers as much anymore.P.S. I just wanted to add there are 7 of us and we all write production code. Probably too much of it. We also have two VPs in our group that also write production code. We are told to do as much as we can to not do the actual coding, but we all fill in the gaps where we are needed.",

I'm sure they still collected their crippling tuition, though, didn't they? That's not your fault. You're not in charge of the school. I'm an Engineering Manager and a self-taught coder, and it grinds my gears every single time I interview a new CS grad and find they can't code. I don't even know how many times I've seen it. 2. Your idea for learning to understand code completely is misguided. Your goal should be to build and deploy a working project. Something super simple. Do it in the next three days. Then immediately go to work on a slightly more complicated project, which you should also deploy within a few days. Then add a database and deploy that within a few days. Etc. Your big problem isn't that you don't understand everything about code, it's that you can't code on your own. There is a huge difference there. It isn't even the same topic. Keep learning but consider all lessons to be an expense you have to pay to build a project. All projects should be as inexpensive as possible. Learn the bare minimum to get building again. When you've built and deployed at least two non-trivial full-stack projects and you feel comfortable with a programming language, a full-stack framework, a database language, a testing framework, and a deployment strategy, then you can start researching better design patterns. Then build another project. I'm sorry to hear that your school let you down so completely. If there is a bright side, it is that all of us become self-taught eventually. Good luck with your studies.",

        "body": "I'm going to go out on a limb and argue this: It's not programming, it's the way school taught you how you should learn. School education is built on spiral patterns and a tonne of scaffolding. Both of these together make the natural position of learners so that it is clear what they should do to solve a given problem, so if they don't know what to do the assumption is that it is your fault. When in reality, learning is complicated, messy, and difficult. I'll give you an example. In maths, let's say that we are learning how to move variables around an equation. We provide the proof, completed worked examples, worked examples that are partially solved with hints, partially solved worked examples without hints, simple problems that are basically worked examples without hints, and some problems that can be breadcrumbed through multiple worked examples above. The end result is that you probably can go from start to bottom without encountering any trouble. Teachers might make questions that are tricky, compound, or both, but you've probably encountered *everything* before. The problem is that you've never learned how to synthesise something new (to you), and that's what you are trying to do here. I'll give you an example. You might have learned how to make an object. You might have even learned how to assign a variable to an object. But when you have to make your own simple data structure that stores a bunch of data like an array, but can dynamically add and remove stuff without empty spaces or resizing arrays ... well, all of the steps to smash your face into designing or inventing a linked list are really, fuffing, hard.So, what happens is that learners sit there and go: \"Man, I feel that fancy maths is easier than this because I always know what I'm doing,\" because they've hit a problem that could have a dozen or more possible solutions. Instead of simply accepting that they don't know and starting problem-solving, they just feel bad.I'm also going to extend a programmer's olive branch: I've been programming for twenty years. I'm not bad at it. I've built all sorts of complicated systems in multiple languages. Yet, every single day I'll be coding something, and I'll mutter to myself \"holy fuff I'm stupid\" because I couldn't solve some problem. I also couldn't tell you how long I have smashed my face into problems trying to understand how to build it, only to discover that once I learned the underlying systems, it was actually pretty simple (after I did a lot of work to learn new stuff). This is natural. In fact, I often wonder if you don't feel like this regularly, you probably aren't programming. edit: Lastly, I've been learning how to write novels. Not really to do anything with, but just to tell stories. I'm constantly frustrated at how hard it is to express what is in my brain in words. It has been a year, and I've learned heaps, but I'm still not good at it. Sometimes I forget that just because I am good at programming, networking, writing formal documentation, and teaching, it doesn't mean I will, or even should, automatically be good at other things like creative writing. So, be kind to yourself.",

This can be programming it to send automated texts to your parents when it realises that you won't be home by 9pm, it can be a reminder to drink water every 3 hours and so on.As a human you write computer programs to make it help you in random small tasks, eventually you automate and get used to writing all of these programs that you move on to other bigger tasks in your lives. You one day realise 'wait a minute i would like a simple website about my new bakery that im opening up' so you do just that. You make multiple games and you realise that manually writing physics is a pain for each game so you decide one common code that handles this physics for you and call it the 'game engine', the name is all fancy but at the end of the day its just a bunch of code doing physics.You find it difficult at the moment because you're not starting bottom up, you don't start with a basic necessity in your life that needs to be solved and work from there. You start with knowing zero programming as you mention in your second and blindly just copy paste tutorials which are more complex and use stuff that you do not have the prerequisites for. You think you got far because you copy pasted the tutorials but the truth is you have to accept that you know very little about programming and start writing simpler programs until you get the basics right.Codeforces / Leetcode / <insert similar sites) is meant for two kinds of people - Folks who just enjoy puzzle coding and folks who are into competitive programming / want to pass interviews at companies where leetcode is askedI don't think you are at the stage where you enjoy programming so much that you should be getting into the hobby of puzzle coding? The problems there are deliberately difficult on purpose because its meant to be competitive and you need to go in having practiced a huge bunch of algorithmic ideas and topics. Its like you wanting to take a leisurely walk to get fit but accidentally ending up signing up for the local extreme parkour club. Both achieve the same thing but are meant for different kinds of people with different kinds of mindset",

Another thing that might help is Python with its very easy to understand object model.OOP requires a different way of thinking - kind of a rewiring of the brain to look at things differently. In OOP it's more a dialog between the individual objects than the sequential command patterns we are used to in procedural programming. In OOP you more or less \"talk\" to the objects. You ask them to do things for you. You ask them to change their internal state if needed (yes, the \"immutability\" topic will now come up and I might anger a few people with my mutable approach).My breakthrough with OOP was when I got into my current job in Industrial Automation working with our DCS (Distributed Control System) and with our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems. There, everything was object oriented with inheritance and I started to see the advantages and how OOP works. Our SCADA even goes further in the direction of being an Entity-Component system where each Entity can have many components with many different aspects, but that leads too far (it's basically just some very extended form of composition, not inheritance).> it often takes me hours what my developer colleagues can do in minutes.This only boils down to practice, ample practice.You will feel stuck and dumbfounded for quite some time but you will eventually reach the point where things fall into place and you all of a sudden understand. It's not as complicated as it seems.Don't give up! Keep going!",

It's a natural instinct if you spend most of your time close to the machine itself, but it's actually disruptive to learning HLLs.HLLs are designed to be somewhat implementation-agnostic; they have rules, and they trust that some intermediary layer will implement a thing that makes those rules go. Getting bogged down in how that intermediary layer might work (\\*) generally will impede your understanding of the higher-level layer. This is a skill I had to learn when learning SML/NJ: the fine art of no longer worrying about how the language represents a function, trusting \"It just does,\" and learning the language independent of its implementation. The language is just rules and math; you could implement it with pencil and paper if you had the time and patience. Once you have the language under your belt, you can start caring about how it was implemented on a Von Neumann architecture with registers, RAM, and the like.(\\*) C++ might be an exception that proves this rule; there are actually quite a few features of C++ where the reason they work that way is \"It made it a lot easier to write the compiler\" or \"Look, this language is old, and older computers didn't have enough RAM to do things like lookahead compilation or multiple passes, so it is what it is.\"",

        "body": "So, I wrote [a few chapters on OOP in a free book](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/). I tried to think of the ways we incorrectly teach OOP (because that's the way we learned OOP.)I think the summary I can provide is:* A class is like a blank paper form template. You go to the doctor's office and fill out strings for your name, phone number, a list of allergies, etc. This form is a *class*; everyone fills out the same fields (i.e. the member variables) to represent a real-world thing. Each filled-out form is an *object*, a specific concrete thing.* I hate the isolated \"Car\" and \"Shape\" and \"Animal\" classes you always see in tutorials. What a \"Car\" class looks like in real code depends on what software you are making: a used car ecommerce site, a traffic simulator, a racing video game, etc. Meanwhile, the same real world person would be described by different classes: `Customer`, `Patient`, `Employee`, `WeddingGuest`, etc. Ask yourself how a paper form would describe the person in each of these roles and what fields it would need.* A common mistake is to write classes a certain way because we heard that they \"should\" be written that way. If you feel like classes and extensive hierarchies of classes are causing more bureaucracy than organization in your code, go without classes. (If you can; a complete rewrite has its own problems.)* For a second, forget about OOP: imagine you have **a bunch of functions and they all have the same data structure passed to them as an argument**: that's your class. That tells you what the member variables and methods should be. I have an example Python tic-tac-toe program done [with and without OOP in the book.](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/chapter15.html)* Inheritance is overrated.* For a moment, stop thinking of inheritance with genetic or grandparent-passing-away metaphors. Imagine you need a new class that is very similar to an existing one, but you just one to change one or two methods, so you copy-paste the code entirely and just change those methods. This is what inheritance does, but instead of copying-pasting code, you leave that out and make a subclass and then only specify the methods you change.Anyway, in general we explain OOP badly, and it is a bit (but not entirely) overrated. Don't feel bad for finding it confusing.",

The most close synonims for an *object* is: record, structure, set of variables, and now comes the difference: with the *methods* (functions, subroutines, procedures) operating on it.If you ever worked with files on Unix-like systems or Windows, you've already familiar with OOP. You create a File \"object\" by *open()* or *creat()*, which you can refer with the *file handle*, which these function returned. The variables of File is hidden for you, we have some idea how it looks, but we don't care as far we can call *read()*, *write()* methods to do what we want with the file, then we can *drop* or *destruct* it by calling *close()*.In OOP, instead of file handle, you got a pointer (sometimes called reference), and you can \"call\" methods. Now comes the part where you'll understand the whole shit:`read(file_object, &buffer, length)`is same as`file_object.read(&buffer, lenght)`In Python, you can call a method both way, although, highly recommended to use `obj.method()` variant.And again, as elctronics, programming is not *difficult*, but *simple and* *complex*. OOP is just as *difficult* like pull-up resistor: if you know struct, function, memory, OOP is easy-peasy, and if you know current, instable state, DCC and GND, pull-up resistor is straighfoward... but try these two simple things to explain someone who knows nothing about programming and electronics.",

The first thing I did was get assigned as an extra code reviewer for an MR that was written by a developer experienced in the language. I did my review first, and I had to spend time reading through his code, cross-referencing documentation for the libraries being used, and generally just building my understanding of the code. When the other code reviewers and testers also did their passes, I read their issues to see what I had missed. (Which is a good habit that I do for everything I review, not just this).After that, I did an MR of my own and had it reviewed by the person who had done the previous MR. There was still a ton of referencing documentation but I had a fairly good idea of what I needed to do.It gets substantially easier the more experience you have under your belt. I've coded in more than a dozen languages, so at this point picking up a new one is pretty simple as I already know how to \"think like a programmer\" which is the core skill that we need.",

Something concrete like parsing a file, building a tiny game, automating a task you already do, or reimplementing a simple tool you use. Then you learn just enough syntax to make the next thing work, look things up constantly, and accept that forgetting is part of the process. That cycle is what actually builds memory.Docs and references are great once you’re actively coding, because you approach them with a question instead of passively watching.

What I'm saying is not that only certain people can learn to code, but if you're the kind of person that coding doesn't come as naturally to and you're surrounded by people who just seem to naturally be able to code, it can be very disheartening and some persuade some people that coding just isn't for them.",

Also many don't develop a passion, because they follow bad advice online. C, C++ or Rust evangelists telling them they must start with their favorite language, instead of them starting with easy to learn languages. Beginners then tend to think that all programming must be hard and complicated, and it turns them off. Have seen this with at least 1 friend, who even did a \"nanodegree\" on some learning platform, using C++. I told them to not start with C++. Wouldn't listen, convinced that it is a good idea. Well they probably learned tons, for sure, but after doing that nanodegree, they never again touched computer programming.On one hand it is a filter to weed out non-passionate people, on the other hand it is throwing potentially great learners onto the train tracks. It burns them out.Also it needs to be said, that people are wired differently, and that not everyone must be born to become a computer programmer or developer. It's OK to not be one. Better than what we have now, with tons of not passionate people only in the job for the money.",

Keep paying attention in your classes because what often happens is some penny drops and you remember all the stuff in that context, so it is not necessarily lost.

Part 1 would be a preparation for the exam done at home with whatever tools they want (ai, colleague,...) and they could take any code they would have done to part 2 (which was the actual part cut from Internet).The first part had exercises centered around getting every child from a node in a tree (and going deeper till getting the last).The first exercice from the second part was going up the tree till the first node was found and then, the exam was basically going down the tree either from top or from a specific node with the eventual join here and there on another table.All that to say : if you understood your code from the first part, second part should have been no problem at all. going up a tree being so close to going down but a lot less complicated to implement - It's a sole loop. And once done with going down and up, every other exercise could be done with some copy past from your own codeWhen the result was in, most of the student had the first part nailed in tight. But some would have no idea at all about what was what (one exercice asked to check the depth of the tree and one of the student thought that just taking the node.parentId was the answer. Not to throw shade at the guy (I'm pretty sure he's one of the smarter) but he clearly didn't understand the first part that was, most likely, generated (or copy pasted from a student. But since I checked every file before allowing them to bring them to part 2, I have some idea.)In essence, ai didn't write bad code. That's not the point.The point is, they used it in a way that didn't make them grow their understanding of what they were doing.That's the part I'm really critical when in comes to ai use in learning... But in general too. No matter if you're a junior or a senior. If you don't learn, you, at best, stay at your level.",

Many tutorials make it really easy to work within a certain paradigm, but the paradigm falls apart as soon as you apply it to a real world example with real world requirements.> Is it just based on the number of years you work on building software or simply the environment where you can get feedback from top tier engineers?I've been mostly working on my own, even as a Junior and never had a Senior who would teach me good programming practices. For me it's been mostly about reflecting about my work, about **why** things become difficult and how I could avoid these traps. I started to watch many different talks from software conferences on youtube and while many of those talks are about fixing symptoms of problems instead of identifying problems, there are some that help you understand why you end up having certain problems. So you need both, a number of years of experience to reflect on, and actually reflect on the experience. Also, in any case: do not listen to people saying things like \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\". They likely have no idea what they are talking about and they don't know what that quote actually refers to. Usually these people think that they lose about 5-15% performance when they follow their programming paradigm and think that's an acceptable price, but they actually lose at least factor 30, in many cases even factor 1000 performance (Yes, things taking 2 seconds when they could be done in 0.002 seconds).A good way of structuring your code will also give you good performance as a free benefit.",

Github is a massive source of real code that drives real projects which you can read and download and involve yourself in the discussions of. If you're looking into a career, I recommend finding a university within your state with an accredited computer science program. The degree matters a lot when it comes to job prospects unfortunately. I also think it's a medium quick way to actually develop serious development skills. I know for me personally, I was on the self-taught path for many years and just very stuck. It was my degree program with the help of professors and peers that finally unlocked things for me and got me over the tough parts of learning development. You'll find no shortage of universities that offer remote degree programs in computer science as well. This is an expensive path, but its the most reliable path to a career.If you're not sure what you want yet, and you're just out to explore maybe try joining some community projects. Hackathons, game jams, competitions. Even if you don't feel like you're ready, just be honest about your level and express that you're there to learn and you're bound to find loads of people just like you who would be glad to learn along-side you. That's a great way to 'explore' and get a sense of what actual development is like even before you have the skills yourself. Even if it means you're joining a discord call just to watch and hear how more experienced developers are working it'll give you a sense of what its actually like once you're in the middle of things.I won't recommend any particular course or source of information personally. I've found that everyone seems to click with different materials. But the wiki has lots of linked resources [r/learnprogramming FAQ: Getting Started with Coding](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq/)",

I'm still not as on-top of testing as I'd prefer, but I've noticed that my code has evolved to make unit tests easier, mostly by creating command/context structures (or objects if it's an OOP codebase). These more easily let me test arbitrary sections of code by simply generating the appropriate structure for the test to consume, so my testing functions are just wrapping regular calls with a generated struct and comparing results.Take a few minutes to ask yourself \"how could I verify this works without having to run the whole program or use a test environment?\", it'll likely lead to developing better code. Some languages/frameworks handle a good portion of this for you, but also the more divergent your test and prod environments are, the less valuable your tests are.",

The course is free, textual, extremely practice oriented with actually checked exercises, and a proper first semester of \"Introduction to Computer Science\").The key to learning programming is to practice as early as possible and as much as possible. Play around with the code, break it, fix it. Learn to read the error messages. Learn to work with the documentation for your language. These are all key points.Stay away from AI for the start. At the very utmost (and even that should be the ultima ratio) use it to give you explanations. Never use it to give you solutions nor code. AI is tempting. Still, it is far superior to pretend it doesn't even exist.Don't be afraid of making mistakes. We all do (even with decades of experience). Mistakes and failures are what teach us, from what we actually *learn*. You need to struggle to learn (and that's why I said to avoid AI - it will take the struggle away).",

Spent countless hours exploring the codebase to understand the toolsets we had to be familiar with, so I got to see a ton of different ways to solve very similar problems. Old methodologies combined with more recent standards and practices all cobbled together to create robust pipelines that ran at scale.You get experience both by seeing how complex systems run, but also by stepping up to the design challenge when opportunity presents itself.I still write bad code, but I'll iterate on that bad code until it isn't so bad any more.

Maybe you were nervous and didn’t think about it at the moment, in which case experience and practice make the difference. In Python for example you have people that naturally sugar things up/use decorators and it seems unintuitive (especially coming into an ongoing project) until you’re forced into edge cases/collaboration and start doing it regularly. Senior level code is a YMMV kind of thing imo, as you will work with people that understand everything but document nothing.",

You just start to get a feel for what good patterns are as well as what goes wrong when bad patterns are followed.But as for more concrete tips I'd say you want to keep your API /API layer as agnostic as possible from the implementation details - your API layer should ideally be focused on defining the contract and routing the logic to internal code to fulfill the contract. You don't want to expose internal details, raw primative implementations, or anything not relevant to the contract. This is both so external clients have a clean interface to work with as well as minimizing the blast radius of any changes to the workings of the API itself. Yeah you can implement a key value store with a dictionary but if you abstract it behind a data provider then your API layer doesn't care if you're using a dictionary or a database or a cache, and you can swap between them easily.In addition anything that's exposed to the public internet should have protection against anything that could possibly go wrong, malicious or otherwise. This includes sanitizing inputs, protection against injection attacks, rate limiting, proper status code handling etc...",

There's no fast path.Dunning-Kruger's seminal work principally has to do with how we internalize and comprehend information: known | unknown known | known ----------------- known | unknown unknown | unknownIt's not their original chart but it has all the right quadrants... Mine makes a C.You start in the bottom-right where you don't even know THAT you don't know something. There's shit rocket scientists contemplate I haven't the slightest fucking clue. I'm not a rocket scientist. I can't possibly know. Can't even fathom.Then there's shit you know you don't know. I don't know how to implement a Monte-Carlo simulation. I know I don't know that. I know Monte-Carlo is used to march approximations toward a correct result with sufficient precision. I've just never had to do it.Then there's what you know you know - this is active recall stuff. Rote memory. I know a closure is a poor mans object. I can repeat that all day. It's not very functional memory because I have to actively think about it with intent. I can write a closure, but it's not intuitive to me. I make mistakes. I can't see the forest for the trees.But I have a shitload of unknown knowns - shit I know, but don't actively think about. We're beyond active recall. This isn't rote - this is intuition. You can FORGET you know something, and yet that knowledge passively informs you. When you see me work, I can go straight to code and produce something. Hundreds, THOUSANDS of decisions are being made not because I'm considering all this stuff in the moment, but because I've considered it all over the last 37 years. I'm not making a decision, I've already made it. I'm acting on connections and associations and relationships you haven't made yet, leaving you wondering how the hell I'm getting my work done - it's because the work was done 20 years ago at that one job.This is what you're going to accumulate yourself. When you've fully internalized and integrated your knowledge, you can speak on it as an authority. You won't be quoting a book or resource, you'll be saying it yourself, and you'll hardly think about how you're even doing it.So then how do you learn? It's not just time. You can sit on your ass for years and not learn a god damn thing - especially if you don't have compelling work or don't care. It's not JUST experience - but the quality of the experience. You don't learn from successes, but failures. And if you want some failures, you need to be trying to do shit.> I realized afterward that I hadn't considered concurrent access, didn't validate inputs, returned mixed types from methods, and used raw dictionaries instead of proper data structures. You're already gaining self-awareness, seeing more than trees, but the forest for what it is. To accelerate your experiences - you need to have more of them; finish that project. Validate inputs - that's easy as shit. Use data structures, that makes it easier to validate your inputs. Add concurrency, this will apply pressure upon you to design a more consistent architecture.You didn't do these things in your demo because you don't have the intuition to do them. If you had it, you'd have integrated all this into your solution as a matter of course.Continued...",

You can keep learning, and it's a positive experience, but you never finish anything. And finished projects are way more important than unfinished-but-optimized projects.But do try to set time out for learning about the deeper things about your current tech stack. It'll help you grow long term. Otherwise you may get stuck always implementing the \"good-enough\" solutions and never the perfect ones.And regarding learning new tech stacks: you'll notice they're all more similar than you'd think, so each stack is way easier to pick up. And a lot of the lessons are transferable.",

Trying to master an entire stack up front often turns into endless prep with very little feedback.Surface level knowledge is fine as long as you are aware it is surface level and you know where the edges are. The risk is not shallow knowledge, it is hidden gaps that you do not realize are there. Projects are good at exposing those gaps naturally.Exploring multiple stacks can help you see which concepts are universal and which are just implementation details. Over time the fundamentals stick because you keep encountering them in different contexts. That usually beats trying to learn everything in isolation before you build anything real.",

You can’t learn “the whole thing” at all. You can only learn the parts you need. There’s many things I’ve used over 20 years and I still don’t know even nearly “the whole thing” because I’ve never needed all the things there is. As long as you know all the things you will need, and have understanding how they fit together then you can go piece by piece and learn those parts. It’s much easier and sticks much better when it’s “ok I need to do X so I’ll look that up and learn it and do it” rather than “oh yeah I looked it up a week ago, but now that I need it I don’t remember it anymore…”Also one tip: write down some things you feel are useful or important to remember from the start. Like “ok when I use this way to connect to database I need to set that up” and whatnot. It’ll be handy later when you jump between things and definitely will forget things.",

I worked in C and C++ professionally until 2013, when I switched to Java with a spring in my step and a song in my heart. So when I say I disagree with Mr Spolsky, it’s not because I’m defensive about not knowing C or pointers.I guess if you want to contribute to the Linux kernel, it’s got to be C and you need to understand pointers like you understand your native language. Ditto drivers. But 99.9% of programmers aren’t getting that deep in the weeds with things. Even in 2005, they weren’t. People can’t come out of undergrad knowing everything. You’ve got to pick what’s important to get started.Also C is hard in a lot of stupid, picky ways that have nothing to do with intelligence. Mostly it’s not portable the way a lot of modern languages are. Programs that compile and run fine in one environment won’t in another because the libraries are in a different directory, or you’re using different compilers, or different versions of the compiler, or different levels of optimization (it shouldn’t matter, but I’ve seen cases where it does.) Or all kinds of stupid crap. This was already a serious obstacle to collaboration and knowledge-sharing in 2005. It’s gotten way worse as more knowledge is shared online. It’s why Java was such a hit—the intermediate bytecode step meant that it works the same everywhere. (I mean, you *can* find incompatibilities between the Oracle JDK and IBM Semaru or whatever, but you have to be doing something really obscure.) And the creator of Stack Overflow should know that better than anyone!",

Literally even assignment felt like I was relearning basics to eventually figure out the harder concepts every time I wrote a program. Don’t do that to yourself.",

So start building stuff to *apply* what you learn, and don't get hung up on what you're building. Especially in the beginning, **do not** worry about having a novel idea, finding a practical problem to solve, writing something that's been written 1000 times before, always doing things the 'right' way, or whether you'll ever use what you build again. Just build *anything*, even silly or pointless or 'incorrect'. As long as you're practicing, receptive, and care about continually expanding what you know, then you can improve over time into a capable developer.Think about it like learning a natural language. No one would expect the first thing written by an elementary English student to be a great, singularly creative, professional-level work. Yet some people have this conception that a relative newcomer to programming should \"find a problem that hasn't been solved yet\", or build things that are pRoDuCtIoN rEaDy. It's absurd. Everyone has to slog their way through the elementary years first, and that's fine. Have fun with it.",

For me, I think the answer is no. As others have said, starting a project is a really effective way to learn. Then your code can be your notes and you can refer back to code when you want to remember how to do things. Regarding how to take notes, there are studies that claim writing notes by hand makes you learn the material better than typing.

Everyone feels this way at one time or another, even those who doesn't appear so.2. Also, instead of giving in, to feelings of being an imposter, actively identify and address the weaknesses you've already identified, and do something about them.3. E.g. Note down terms you don't understand and learn/clarify them for yourself. Ask here. Or research on the internet. Or start a conversation with Claude or ChatGPT and say \"I am a programmer and I ran across the concept/term of 'dependency injection' \\[for example\\] the other day. I don't know what this is. Write me a short treatise on this subject including references so I can get up to speed. Include examples and exercises.\" (for example.)4. You also observed you do nothing outside of work. Well, that's a hint/tell: Start doing something outside of work then! (\"Doctor it hurts when I do \\*this\\*\" Doctor: \"Well stop doing it then!.\" You get my drift.)5. For example, start answering questions on a programming site, or try to. Sometimes you'd have to do some research in order to answer. From doing this, you will learn.6. Try sites like: [exercism.com](http://exercism.com), [codingame.com](http://codingame.com), [codewars.com](http://codewars.com), etc7. One final point: AI is no magic bullet. The presence of AI is going to increase the demand for competent engineers that can also be AI whisperers. You can get ahead of the curve by incorporating and learning and developing the art and science of making effective use of AI in your current job context. As time goes on, I expect this skill might be more important that your naked skills, important though they remain too. (You cannot effectively use AI in anger if you cannot properly judge and evaluate an AI's output. So your human intelligence + experience is essential for the effective use of AI.)The software industry is wide and deep, give yourself time. Rome wasn't built in a day. Read Peter Norvig [here](https://norvig.com/21-days.html). I have been in industry for more than 25 years now and not a day goes by that I don't learn something. Make peace with not knowing everything, that is not where your most important skill lies.",

        "body": "You have to think of a web application project as an ongoing project. You have to start by breaking down the application's main objective into smaller, realistic goals. As you say, you need to know the fundamentals of programming, but you'll acquire them during development. If you don't start at some point, you'll feel like you're in an endless learning loop: you learn the basics but never apply them to the real world. Obviously, depending on the complexity of the website, you'll need more or less knowledge, and you have to be sure that the resources and skills you possess are sufficient to reach the goal. But this part relies primarily on research and patience.Basically, what I would do if I wanted to prepare to create a project is to create a sketch. It could be a diagram, a text document, or both. I write a brief outline of the idea I have in mind, then a list of the workflow, resources, and basic knowledge I need.Once I have this, I start working on gathering resources and coding. The first thing I do in a web application is the design. I establish the typography, icons, brand colors, and that sort of thing. Functionality is what I do after I have all of that in place.Keep in mind that you can never know for sure what your project needs at the beginning. You should try to prepare to start as soon as possible; don't waste time or energy trying to have everything under control from the start, because it's pointless. You'll learn to program by programming.Establish a work plan by setting short- and medium-term goals and adjust them as you go. If something blocks you, move on to something else, and at some point, you'll find what you need to unblock what you were creating.",

Maybe I can become artificial intelligence.I don't do mobile apps myself, but if you want to do that, look into React Native.If you want to build projects, like putting JS to use, you will want to watch videos or think about things you want to build. Like, for example, why don't you think of some things that are out there, like a contact form, or a blog, or just some tool like a calculator, and figure out how to build them from scratch.With a contact form, if you're building from scratch (don't use a 3rd party form), then you have to figure out not only how to accept data, but allow a user to submit, and then where does that data go? that's a project. Maybe you want the data sent to your email or to the cloud or stored in a Db, so maybe you need to learn Azure or SQL, but that'll get your brain thinking about a real, functional projectFor a blog, you need to get user data to print/post to the screen, but again, do you want to be able to store/archive data, if so, what tools will you use to make that happen.You can make a calculator look real with html and css, but how about accepting user input (when they push buttons) and the calculations behind the scenes to do the math and then display it.The best thing you can do to learn is to break down these projects to figure out what parts will be HTML and CSS, but knowing what else you'll need to make it functional.Check youtube for beginner html css javascript projects.",

I’ve leaned so much and I’m only halfway through. You learn the entire life cycle of full-stack web development, from creating your first React app locally to deploying your app on the web through Docker and Google Cloud. You definitely need to have a basic understanding of web development and programming concepts, but it’s still a book I’d recommend to anyone who is wanting to go into web dev. Hope this helps :)",

Those will make you a much more efficient programmer. Then you can go back to building more advanced projects, or make your earlier projects better.Udemy courses are helpful to get you started on a topic, similar to reading Python docs + some examples to get you started. It's helpful for exploration. But they're not that helpful for depth. You can use some of them to figure out what you want to learn next. (Protip: Never pay full price for Udemy courses.

And a population of 4119.7 means the exact same, but RoundToInt will round the previous result to 4119 and this one to 4120.So, use Floor or `FloorToInt` whenever you want to use the population in any other calculation - and also use `ints` for all other population-numbers, like `previousPopulation` and `deltaPopulation`.

BASIC is dead and has been for a long time. (Yes, I know about SmallBASIC and VB.NET, but they have nothing in common with the BASIC of old) Python does the job much better nowadays. Especially if you transition: Python - Python+PyGame - Godot + GDScript you're going in the right direction.One thing to understand: it's not the *programming language* that makes a good programmer. It's what they can do with the language, how they can analyze and break down problems and create step-by-step solutions for the individual sub-problems that then can be implemented in a programming language, that makes a good programmer.The people of old didn't have too many choices (I was there - learnt programming in the first half of the 1980s). So, BASIC was the common entry. C, PASCAL, and Assembly usually were the successor languages.",

        "body": "I grew up back then and frankly unless you where insanely rich, the only thing available where computers running on Z80 or 6502 chips. Great chips but all you easily had for programming was the built in BASIC. By the time I got to college, almost 10 years later the college was teaching with Modula 2 at the introductory level. Note the phrase \"teaching with\", if you are learning to program the language is really a tool to learn concepts. By the time one would finish the full program a student would have been exposed to at least 3 mandatory languages.People often ask why? The answer is pretty simple out in the real world you may end up working with a number of languages. The problem with BASIC is there is very little real world use of BASIC anymore, even gaming has gone to Lua for scripting.Now what do I suggest for beginners, that is easy C or C++ for the equivalent of the first 3-4 semesters of a Computer Science program. Why low level languages? This is again simple, you can be forced to building data structures at a low level. Personally I See languages like Python as damaging to the development of good programmers as it hands user modern concepts and unfortunately most programs designed around Python don't dive into how things work. The other reason is that properly done, by mandating the command line for the first few programs (2 semester equivalents) you also learn how compilers and linkers work, at the user level anyways. The command line is important because there are Python programmers out there that can't even create a directory at the command line. So I'm not a big fan of people learning programming with Python.However I really believe that most programmers need to learn Python at some point but properly educated that will be a piece of cake. The reality is Python has been relative simple for a scripting language. At some point a programmer will also have to learn the languages suitable for the platform at hand. The problem is platform languages are a moving target, you need a good understanding of the basics of computer science to adapt to what is new. Languages like RUST or Swift are literally works in progress, it is a continuous learning challenge to remain effective with these languages.",

You can't do much to speed this up aside from getting a faster computer, or choosing a non-JVM language. The reason it was faster the second time is probably just because the JVM's files were already in your operating system's disk cache and didn't need to be loaded from disk again.When people talk about the JVM \"warming up\", they're usually talking about something slightly different. The JVM starts out in a \"bytecode interpreter\" mode, and only switches to JIT compilation when it detects that a certain piece of code is heavily used. This warmup process actually *improves* startup time, because it can start running code right away instead of waiting for everything to be compiled to machine code.",

You'll have a backpack that only holds a certain number of objects. You can pick up objects and drop objects as you traverse the map. Objects have states - like a door can be locked or unlocked. You have to have a key to change the state. You get the idea. You'll have to use data structures, like maybe a linked-list to keep track of items in the bag. It only takes a small number commands like: go forward, turn right, open door (which will only work if it is unlocked), look around, attack monster. Each room is an object as well. It could contain treasures or it could have a monster in it that will kill you if you go in unarmed. Weapons would have properties that describe how much damage they do, how many times it can be used, etc. Same for monsters. This could be a fun project that will keep you engaged.

Use Backend-as-a-Service:* **Firebase** \\- Auth, database, storage, hosting. Free tier is generous. Perfect for solo devs.* **Supabase** \\- Open source Firebase alternative, uses PostgreSQLThis lets you focus on the app, not server maintenance.**When you need a real backend later:*** Node.js + Express (JavaScript, easy transition)* Python + FastAPI (clean, simple)* Basic REST API concepts* PostgreSQL or MongoDB**The practical path:**1. Learn Flutter basics (2-3 weeks)2. Build a simple app with local storage (todo app, notes app)3. Add Firebase for auth + database4. **Publish it** \\- even if it's simple5. Learn backend properly for your second or third app**Skills that matter more than people think:*** Git (version control)* App Store / Play Store publishing process (it's annoying, learn it early)* Basic UI/UX senseDon't overthink it.

C++23 IS THE latest standard - C++26 will go to final vote to ratify in March this year.C++11 is old and was incomplete even then. They missed shit like `std::make_unique` - which had to be added in C++14, the `chrono` didn't finish until C++17, which is when we also got `filesystem` and `variant`, and finally type punning was defined. We didn't get library support for type punning until C++20, which is when we also got the `ranges` library - a god damn revolution in implementing algorithms. C++23 gives us `#embeded` to bring us to parity with C, type-safe formatter strings, UTF-8 support, and more container types. Starting with C++11 also leaves almost all of `constexpr` on the table.1) Install the latest compiler package from your vendor of choice.2) Always direct it to use the latest ISO-strict standard it supports. The compiler will default to an earlier and non-standard tolerant mode. When C++26 is ratified, it'll be a following software update that suddenly you'll get the new features.3) Keep learning C++. We all learn variables, functions, loops, conditions, pointers, user defined types... You're still going to slog through all the basics. There's no point in limiting yourself to a specific standard in this journey. You'll arrive to the latest standard when you're ready for it and it's ready for you.4) It takes time for compiler vendors to catch up. Microsoft with MSVC is still scrambling to implement C++23 features. All the vendors are struggling with modules. Don't be surprised when stuff is missing. It's not actually a big deal. But keeping up with software updates means you get to capitalize on their latest additions day-of. C++26 also comes with some changes that are worth being there.5) Most teaching materials are going to teach you the same basics. For the most part, the rules of C++ have never changed since before the C++98 standard... Except when it does. And that's the thing about fixing on a specific standard - there are very standard version specific rules you don't want to get bogged down on. Template deduction, initializers, `auto`, constexpr, move semantics... A lot of that gets nuanced changes over versions, and there's always breaking changes between spec versions. I think it was C++14 that finally said you can't specialize standard library template functions, and fuck, I had a code base predicated on that.Ultimately, the differences between the specs MOSTLY won't really matter until you get through the introductory materials. C++26 does change that a little bit - because it's going to require catching the use of uninitialized variables, which was formerly undefined behavior. That's going to send ripples all the way back to the beginning of learning C++.",

The important thing is to check that the written documentation or learning material is written for at least C++14 or preferably higher. Learning C++ is a long journey where the really advanced stuff takes years to even start with. The later language versions modify and add progressively more advanced features. The language is old and has lots of traps and strange quirks. Every solution has at least 3 different ways to write it and each C++ version makes them easier (usually) to write.

Done right the first few semesters of a CS program should be covering concepts that are applicable to most if not all programming languages. If you are learning on your own your goals should be to obtain the same level of understanding.Here is the thing, you don't know what languages will be in demand by the time you are good enough in any one language to even apply for a job. If you learn well you should be able to adapt to what ever language a project requires.Frankly I don't see C++ as a good language to develop apps in as it has been eclipsed by more modern languages. What it is though is a very good language to teach the principles of programming. So is it a decent place to start, yes with one qualification, the program you follow should have at its goal teaching you from the ground up. At some point while going through a decent program, you should start to invest time in learning another language and hopefully seeing how the technology transfers from one language to another. If you have the goal of a specific platform like MacOS then start to learn Swift. At some point you should also pick up Python, however if you do it right Python will be a no brainer. In fact you will have a better understanding of how Python works if you have followed a CS program and actually did some data structure development, memory management and the like in C++. You spend some time at that level and you instantly can grasp what is happening in almost any language.",

Unless you're in the gaming industry, where C++ is huge.Of course, all this is a very over-simplified generalization. C++ can do most things C# can as well, and the situation really depends on the company you work for.On the other hand, C# is more general-use, just like Java.What's clear is that, in developer surveys over the past 20 years, C# consistently ranks as one of the most satisfying languages to use, while C++ usually has a poor reputation (it even has an unofficial mascot of a diseased rat with its leg blown off). That means C# tends to be more enjoyable to work with day to day.edit: gaming use case for C++",

You haven't written lots of useless comments, and the few you have seem suitable. You have made a good choice (generally, but see my next paragraph) on naming things, which many beginners suck at. My main criticism would be the name of the function `generate_board()` - I don't think that's an accurate description of what it does. The board is already \"generated\" and present in the `board` array. This function just *displays* it, so I think a name such as `display_board()` would be more accurate.There are many areas for improvement once you learn more and gain more experience, though. For example, your `check_winner()` function could be split up to make it shorter and more readable, e.g. create a function `bool is_tie()` which encapsulates the tie determination and returns true or false appropriately, then call that from `check_winner()`.You could try separating the game logic from the input/output. By doing that you make it easier to change how the game looks (such as making a GUI version, where the logic is the same, but the display mechanism is entirely different). For example instead of `check_winner()` printing the result, it could return a value that indicates the state of the game. The main game loop would then use that returned value to decide what to output.",

Here's feedback from beginner stuff to more advanced:The good:\\- Input validation with cin.fail() - many beginners skip this\\- Clean separation of functions\\- Consistent formattingThings to improve:1. Avoid global variablesRight now board, playing, size\\_of\\_board are all global. This works but doesn't scale. Pass them as parameters instead:void check\\_winner(std::string board\\[\\], bool& playing);2. Use char instead of std::string for single charactersstd::string for \"x\" and \"o\" is overkill:const char X = 'x';const char O = 'o';const char SPACE = ' ';char board\\[9\\] = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};More memory efficient and faster comparisons.3. Use std::array instead of C-style array\\#include std::array board = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};Then you get board.size() instead of the sizeof trick.4. Tie detection bugYour tie check breaks early if it finds a SPACE, but that's wrong - game isn't a tie if there are empty spaces. Should be:bool is\\_full = true;for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {if (board\\[i\\] == SPACE) {is\\_full = false;break;}}if (is\\_full) {// it's a tie}5. Use ternary for turn switchingcurrent\\_turn = (current\\_turn == X) ? O : X;6. Consider an enum for playersenum class Player { X, O, None };Prevents invalid states and makes code clearer.7. Magic numbers3 and 9 appear everywhere. Define them:constexpr int BOARD\\_SIZE = 9;constexpr int ROW\\_SIZE = 3;Overall solid for a beginner. The logic is correct (except tie check), code is readable, and you handled input edge cases. Next steps would be wrapping this in a class and adding a simple AI opponent.Keep building!",

What you can do is to have functions that don't touch IO at all, and just take parameters and return values. For example, `generate_board` returns a board object (or sets a global variable for now, if you haven't learnt classes yet). `set_cell(x, y, state)` sets the value in the cell, `check_winner` returns the winner. Then you'll have a method called `render_board` that renders the board on to the screen. Separating your program into various parts helps in testing (later), and also you'll be able to easily change parts of your program without breaking the other. For example, you can use the same tic tac toe logic, but instead use a GUI window.",

If your computer dies you can recover your work.- Allows you to work in teams, review others work easily etc.- Allows you to show off your work.It also has lots of tools that wont be relevant to you.Some people are saying you should keep your GitHub clean but are failing to mention that you can simply mark repos as private. The contributions will still even show on your profile if that is something you are concerned about. Not pushing because you are worried an employer will see a junk project? No just use the tool for it's purpose.I would say if you are using git, you may as well do a git push and at the very least have a backup of your work. Mark it as private if that's a concern.",

When your main function calls Pat\\_Divide with an array of exactly 1 element, you should be able to see that the `if` statement is true and then Pat\\_Divide immediately returns with only that one element.When your main function calls Pat\\_Divide with an array of exactly 3 elements, more imaginary people get involved:* Pat\\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\\_Divide and the other list to Alice\\_Divide.* Bob\\_Divide gets one element, immediately sees that the `if` statement is true, and immediately hands back that one element.* Alice\\_Divide, on the other hand, gets handed a list of 2 elements, and so is unfairly forced to do more work. * Alice\\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists (of 1 element each) and hands those lists off to Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide. * Mildred and Leroy act just like Pad\\_Divide did when Pat\\_Divide was given a list of 1 element, and each immediately hand back that 1 element. * Alice\\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) produces a sorted list of 2 elements. * Alice\\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\\_Divide.* Then Pat\\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)* Finally, Pat\\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.When your main() function calls Pat\\_Divide with a very long array, even more imaginary people get involved, but we don't really need to know all their names:* Pat\\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\\_Divide and the other list to Alice\\_Divide.* Bob\\_Divide returns a sorted list of all the items in the left list (by involving other yet-unnamed family members).* Alice\\_Divide does something similar to what she did before: * Alice\\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists and hands those lists off to Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide. * Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide divide their individual lists into even smaller pieces, and hand them off to other family members, who eventually help them produce sorted versions of those lists. * Alice\\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) combines the 2 sorted lists into a single sorted list. * Alice\\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\\_Divide.* Then Pat\\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)* Finally, Pat\\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.(Optionally, you may later learn multitaking techniques, so that Mildred, Bob's side of the family, and Leroy can each work on different parts of the problem simultaneously. ).Good luck trying to explain recursion to the next person!",

Take a selection of playing cards, and put on the table in front of you, make sure they aren't sorted, but still layed out in a nice uniform \"array\".2. Then split the array in two halves - moving them a bit towards you (down the table)3. Split the two halves in another two halves each, so you have four groups of playing cards, and move them a bit further down.4. Continue until you have a number of individual cards layed out with space between them - it still looks exactly like the original array, and feels a bit silly at this point.5. But now, merge the two cards to the left, in order from lowest to highest, and move them a bit up the table - do the same for all the rest, so you have a collection of groups of two cards, each group sorted.6. Then merge the groups two and two, moving them a bit up the table, so you end up with a collection of groups of four cards, all sorted.7. And continue doing that, until you have only a single list of cards, all sorted ...It is important that you actually do it, and not just try to imagine it in your mind!Every time you move down the table, it is another call to the \"divide\" function, and every time you move up, it is a return from the latest \"divide\" function. Note how you can't return from a divide function, before you returned from the next divide-function that was called! This is what recursion is all about, and it is mindboggling to think about - but it works :)",

        "body": "1. You’ve given a lot of reasons that you think you aren’t/can’t be good at programming, and your whole post reads like you’re looking for a reason to stop. Why don’t you stop and go learn about something you feel good about? Do you like programming? Do you like the idea of programming? I’m not judging here — just looking for the other side of your story.2. A lot of programming involves not knowing the answer. Very often, things don’t work the way you think they should and you have to figure out why. You have to be very open to the idea that you might be wrong, because accepting that is often the key to finding the answer you’re looking for. You have to be okay with feeling frustrated for long periods, and you have to be persistent. Being good at programming is less a matter of knowing all the things and more a matter of being good at figuring out what you don’t know on an hourly basis. If those kinds of feelings make you uncomfortable or unhappy, programming may infeed not be a great career choice.3. The thing that hooks a lot of people is making stuff work. Seeing your program work exactly the way you want it to feels like an amazing combination of magic and certainty: it’s inspiring even though you know exactly how and why it works. It’s probably the same feeling someone gets when they fire up an engine for the first time after months of rebuilding work. If you’ve never experienced that, you might want to hang in there until you’ve built a few things to see whether you enjoy that part — it might make the rest worthwhile.",

Now, I'm trying to apply to other companies, but I'm scared of the coding assessments. Back in 2025, whenever I applied elsewhere, I would receive LeetCode-style assessments before even getting an interview. I lost hope immediately and didn’t continue with my applications.Right now, I’m using freeCodeCamp, but I struggled with one of the CSS labs, so I decided to take a break. I also started The Odin Project this new year, and I’m trying to learn it slowly.Since last week, I’ve been studying DSA because it feels like the only way to get hired in this job market. I try to code on my own first, but I get stuck—especially when there are nested loops. My brain just can’t comprehend the logic. I understand bubble sort and selection sort, but I can’t code them without looking at examples. I don’t know what will happen to me in the future; maybe if I keep learning, I’ll get better. The Odin Project says I need to practice a growth mindset, but studying DSA is so hard that it makes me wonder if I chose the wrong degree.I didn't choose my degree, my mother wanted me to take it, and I don't really know what I wanted to take before, so I just went with it.Back in college, I almost failed college algebra and my DSA subject, but I still managed to graduate on time. For algebra, the only reason I struggled was because I didn’t have eyeglasses. By the time I got them, it was already too late to catch up since I couldn’t see what the professor was teaching. For DSA, I didn’t really understand coding and syntax at first. I only started learning properly in my second year.Maybe I just got lucky before, because my first two jobs only required math assessments and quiz-style tests. If they had required coding assessments, I’m sure I would have failed and not gotten the job.I wish you the best OP, please know that you are not struggling alone.",

The indecision comes from looking for certainty that doesn't exist.**My decision process:**1. **Start with the usage code, not the implementation** Write how you WANT to use it first: cpp*// Option A* if (Keyboard::Get().IsPressed(Key::Space)) {} *// Option B* if (input.keyboard->IsPressed(Key::Space)) {} Which feels better to read/write 50 times? That's your answer.2. **Ask \"what might change?\"** If yes → avoid Singleton, use the second approach If no → Singleton is simpler, go with it * Will you ever have 2 keyboards? (multiplayer local co-op?) * Will you need to mock input for testing/replays? * Will input devices be added/removed at runtime?3. **Set a time limit** I give myself 30 minutes to decide. After that, I pick one and move on. Bad choice? I'll refactor later. Most \"wrong\" decisions cost way less time than endless deliberation.**My take on your specific case:**Singleton for input is fine for a hobby engine. Big engines avoid it for testability and flexibility, but you're not building Unreal. The simpler mental model of `Keyboard::Get()` is worth it.**The real skill isn't picking the \"best\" design - it's getting comfortable refactoring when requirements change.**Ship something. You'll learn more from hitting real problems than from theorizing.",

This may shock the non devs incthe room, but git doesnt just work for code, nodes you write in a text file can be habdled the same way. New devs hate git, but eventually you'll have used it so much if yiu use it all the time that that feeling would be like an artist wqtching new artists hate using a pencile. Dont take any shortcuts because its annoying, itll become second nature if you use it every single day, touch typing and keeping your fingers on the home row was probably annoying when you learned how to type, now you dont even think about it, and people who type with their pointer fingers look crazy to you simply because you have built the muscle memory needed to use a skill that makes you better at typing without even trying. Git isnt gonna get in your way at all once its second nature, and if you dont use it youre just hurting yourself. But just like how you can learn to type by playing games online, you can passively get better at git by using it when you decide to learn Rust or build a game or write a novel. Dont think of it as some big deal that you need to treat as its own lesson plan and practice over and over again, think of it as salt you add to every meal from now on",

You may have some variables to store registers.One crucial part is timing. You need to execute only a certain number of \"cycles\" per frame.

Last night I had an interesting dinner conversation with a friend who I consider a genius in tech and business, and he believes the cost of software dev will approach zero as current advances in AI are continually eclipsed by improved models. Another friend tells me the latest Claude code is unbelievably good. Having AI as your learning partner is going to remove so many friction points. Spend some time learning how to get the most from AI and you’ll be running faster than if you first try to learn one syntax and formal language. Example: my dinner conversation friend likes to make boardgames for himself and friends. He recently made it in his todo list to a really interesting one where people cooperatively roll dice to try to beat a timer, with a difficulty scaling and hero exhaustion mechanic so the longer some heroes play the more tired they get, causing late rounds of the game to be more challenging. He needed to build some simulation software to play thousands of rounds of the game in order to derive the right numbers to use as timer values for easy, intermediate, and hard modes. He started by using AI chatbots to “write by prompt” a python program (he chose python for familiarity) He had written about 30 txt files describing the game,!the dice, the heroes, the colors, the map, the paths of forking decisions to move from point to point on the map, the win conditions and on and on. They were his personal notes, and he hadn’t shown them to any LLMs yet. Then he opened the folder in Cursor. The AI agent read all the files, and a whole list of notes to self and future todo items written in his personal notes. Then it proceeded to upgrade and expand his simulation script into a ful featured and useful tool. He has used it to simulate around 200,000 rounds of the game, and even had AI wrote an evaluative controller which would make adjustments to the difficulty levels until simulated games reach a desired success/fail percentage (ie. hard mode should fail 65% of the time on level 1, scaling to 80% fail rate for level 7)He opened his laptop and we told AI to rewrite the entire thing in Rust, which completed flawlessly in about two minutes. Thousands of lines of python translated to rust trivially. Then we thought of a stumper: build it in Lisp… it succeeded in another minute or two. Get conversational with AI … if you want to learn a formal language in depth, study the very well written code it outputs.",

But ussually their are other more popular or apropriate options for specific specialities. Gaming happens to be an area where C# excels, largely due to unities game engine.Java can do alot itself.

Their is no unity equivelant for java, no visual studio equivelant, razor, blazor, winforms, microsoft learn etc... for java.Learning by making very simple games can be a great way to avoid burnout and stay engaged and once you learn the basics of a language, you will find that learning additonal languages is very possible.",

Couldn't find a way to implement my chosen approach. I tried a couple days, but then left the exercise and kept revisiting it regularly.

        "body": "> My question after all this intro is, is it possible to apply DDIA concepts to personal projects for the sake of it?Yes. Basically, what you should do is weigh the importance of having applications that can:1. Horizontally scale, and2. Tolerate/self-heal from outages ...much more strongly then you normally would for personal projects.Usually, we ignore reliability for personal projects. But if you're trying to practice distributed systems, it makes sense to make it your main focus, even if there isn't really a need for it.> Is this viable in the slightest to learn these technologies? While I understand the theory behind them, distributed systems is not something I'm learning or will learn at my job and it's something I found super super interesting.I think it'll be possible for you to pick up a solid basic understanding of these tools -- enough for you to get an understanding of their strengths/weaknesses, and when to use them.Picking up a truly in-depth understanding may be harder. Usually, that deeper intuition comes only after either dedicated study or after spending an extended amount of time using the tool in production, seeing first-hand the limitations and quirks of that tool.> If this is possible, are there ways for me to simulate many users or requests without breaking the bank in something like AWS?Some suggestions:1. Deliberately give your app very small amounts of cpu/mem, and/or deliberately add in sleep statements and such into your app to forcibly handicap your app so it can handle only 3 QPS or something. This means even modest amounts of traffic will cause a naive app to start becoming overloaded, which in turn gives you multiple opportunities to practice building support for horizontally scaling.2. Look into setting up automatic horizontal autoscaling of some sort, to automate downsizing your application when you're not currently stress-testing it.3. Alternatively, if your app is inherently expensive to run, just completely tear it down every time you're finished for the day. To reduce tedium, look into using terraform or something to automate the setup and teardown.4. Eventually, consider using something like Kubernetes to run everything. This will obviously take a lot more effort -- but doing it does mean you can test locally by setting up Kubernetes on your local machine, using VMs to simulate running on a fleet of machines. Aside from simulating traffic, also be sure to do chaos testing of some sort, where you randomly kill your machines to simulate unexpected hardware failures and/or temporarily network blackhole them to confirm your application as a whole can tolerate it, not lose user data, not enter an inconsistent state, etc.> Lastly, I know that Kafka is a little bit of an overkill for a toy project but I kinda wanna simulate this for learning purposes.Yeah -- I'd say it's overkill in general. In production, state is the enemy: the moment something is stateful, you have to worry about keeping it backed up/replicated in some way so you can tolerate unexpected hardware/network failure, which in turn often places constraints on how you can scale, etc...This is why DDIA spends so much time talking about databases and such -- figuring out how to manage state is by far the hardest part of designing and maintaining a distributed system.So for a prod system, it behooves us to go out of our way to design our architecture to keep as many of our components stateless as possible. (Stateless == they may maintain a local cache, but it'd be perfectly fine and safe to abruptly nuke a replica at any time.)But for a toy project, I think your instinct is correct. Now is the best time to play around with different technologies, even when they're not needed. This may end up causing your overall architecture to be more complex then needed, but I think that's perfectly acceptable if your goal is to become comfortable with different cloud/distributed-systems building blocks.",

Do you have a sort of mental checklist that a project needs to qualify for before doing so, or is it more just a second nature kind of thing?I know you may never need a microservice as it might introduce more complexity than it's worth, for example, but I'm wondering when you are like \"yeah okay, we need a microservice here\".Example from my experience of when to decouple was, and I know this super small fry, I added a lambda to run some puppeteer code to generate PDFs on AWS as we ran into some strange IIS worker processor quirk where the chrome process was executed twice when running this on Node/Nest. Spent about 2 days trying to figure it out until I went the AWS option instead. This came with the benefit of not having a heavy dependency like puppeteer in our bundle, although it does come with the cost of vendor lock-in to a feature, which I'm okay with in this case since there's a daily S3 cleanup and the function is used 10 times a day most, so cost is non existent.Also thanks again, this really has been invaluable feedback/input, I wish I could upvote you more than once!",

Because where a student goes to school isn't 100% about what is the best school rankings-wise that they could get into. There are geographic and family-based restrictions that some kids are limited by.For example - one of the smartest people I've worked at had to go to some no-name, podunk town public university because it was the only school near his family's home, and he needed to live at home so he could help his family and younger siblings. He could have 1000% gotten into a better school (and in fact, did so for grad school), but at that point he couldn't just peace out and move out of his small town - let alone move to fucking Boston or Palo Alto.So I think when you're talking about top 20 schools, you're going to find some really, really smart people in every one of them, and which one is smartest might be splitting hairs.The other thing worth highlighting: the 90th percentile student at Michigan is going to be fundamentally a better candidate than the median MIT student. I would venture a guess that the 90th percentile student at maybe any top 50 program will be better than the median MIT student - and maybe it's not 90th, maybe it's 95th, but the point is that there is a point of the distribution at which the best kids at any reasonable program are going to be really, really smart , where the median MIT/Stanford/etc. student is going to be really smart, but it's actually very possible that them getting into those schools had as much to do with opportunities as it did with intelligence.",

They had mass layoffs within 2 years where they laid off all the highest earners, which of course meant everyone who knew the most about how all their systems worked. Their FMV hasn't recovered and my stock is almost worth less than when I bought it. It went from a place where we would avoid hiring someone if they're an asshole to asshole behavior being tolerated everywhere under the guise of \"making better software\". ICs were ignored in favor of leaders making decisions who didn't know what the fuck was going on.

It kills your ability to problem solve and find a way out of your situation. I know you don't want to leave the bay, but you're competing with the greatest concentration of CS talent in the country. Yes, there are more opportunities here but it's not surprising to me that you're having difficulty being considered for them. I think you'd do yourself a significant favor by being open to relocating, even if it's out to somewhere you'd rather not live. What you need right now is experience and you need to be open to whatever you need to do to get it. That might mean living in Boise for a few years or something.If you have to stay in the bay, then you need to network hard. You're not likely to get a job by spamming your resume at automated filters. You need someone to take a chance on you, and that's more likely to happen if they know you, not just your resume. Go to meet ups, see if you can find a start up founder or something who just needs warm bodies willing to work for less than market rate and just get some years of experience under your belt. The more experience you have the easier all this gets, but you may have to eat shit for a while to get it.",

Learning how to code changed EVERYTHING for me but I can tell you this right now, no one cares if you win or lose. Stop looking for external validation. Sit down. Think of what the most perfect Junior Developer looks like. What skills do they have? What does their resume look like? What do their projects look like? How are they networking with others?

My most recent layoff was this most recent spring and I started a new, better job 3 months later.The thing I've learned is that worrying doesn't do you any good. Always stay sharp on your skills and build confidence that you can be resilient to whatever life throws at you. You don't have to keep your head in the sand, just learn to build yourself up so you can land somewhere if you need to.I also highly recommend therapy as a way to work through stress and identify ways you can find agency a chaotic career.

I got my second internship by winning a hackathon and talking to the sponsor of the prize I won.I got my first job by posting my app on LinkedIn and getting featured by 9to5Mac.Advice: Unfortunately, you are behind the curve. Not entirely your fault, the economy is rough, don’t beat yourself up about it. My advice is to hustle as much as possible and think about all the ways you can say “I’m a good engineer, I’ll provide value to a company.”",

The trick with personal projects is to make them using relevent skills e.g. study the job descriptions youre looking to apply to and decide which frameworks/libraries/languages to use based off what theyre looking for, and make sure to put those keywords in the bullet points for those projects. Hot take but it matters less what the project actually is meant to do rather than what you used to build it—as long as its at least a little interesting and not super generic (weather app, todo app, etc) , your idea is fine. This will increase your chances of getting interviews.When it comes to interviewing, its a separate skill, I dont think having internship/work experience necessarily helps with interviewing skills. Technical Interviews are either leetcode style (practice by doing leetcode), conceptual questions (easy to prep for via google/chatgpt or through your school notes), or system design (not usually asked for new grads, but I had one for the offer I landed and I genuinely think my experience working on personal projects are what made me not completely bomb it, and I highly doubt interns are learning system design skills well if at all).For behavioral interviews, when they ask about working on a team you can just talk about group projects you did at school. The literal thing/impact that the project did is irrelevant outside of giving context for a story. Passing behavioral interviews are all about framing yourself as a good teammate that the interviewer would enjoy working with.",

And obviously a huge risk if a job never came to fruition. The neutral, moving here didn't suddenly bring in a bunch more opportunities. It wasn't like I had a bunch of recruiters suddenly knocking on my doors once I put Bay Area in my location. I was still cold applying and everything like that. The biggest upside came once I passed the interview and moved on to team matching. At the time, I was reading a bunch of discussion boards where people were sitting in team matching for upwards of 8 months. Some people even needing to reapply because their time expired before getting a match. I had my first call with a hiring manager 3 days after being told I passed the interview. And the two days in between were the weekend. I had a job offer in hand by the end of that day. I have zero doubts in my mind they pulled my resume first, because I was already in the area and can start working more quickly for them. Truly, I also think being an American citizen helped in that too, because it again meant quicker to writing code for them. They didn't need to do any Visa sponsorship or anything like that.",

If you report this to his next level or HR, he will get fired. So this can mean one of the following: 1. If you are a good performer, and expecting a salary raise, your manager want to give you that raise, but he feels unable to negotiate with upper management, so he is nudging you to get an offer and then use that as a leverage for your own sake. 2. Your manager has insights into upcoming downsizing and he is okay if you go. He is pretending to \"match\" your offer but giving you a chance to secure a good position. 3. Your manager for some dark reason is working against the interest of the company. He is either disgruntled. 4. Perhaps he is really concerned for his future, and sees that you have become relaxed at work place and not growing your skills, so this is his clever way of making you realise that you are still not good enough as an all rounded engineer. 5. Perhaps he is really concerned about your future, and general nature of the industry and the need to be in the habit of interviewing. 6. Your manager is just plain stupid and doesn't know how to do his job properly. I think it is a combination of 1 and 6. However there are better ways to do his job than nudging an employee to get an offer so that he can give you a raise.",

This may not be the case across all companies, but it was the case in FANG when I worked there.From a performance perspective, “lack of ownership” let’s call it, will lead to the SWE act defensive towards bugs and user feedback. Sure the AC might have not required this or there is scope creep, but ultimately the company pays you to own the end user experience end to end.

Maybe 1-2 will get a green card before they’re 50 if they’re exceptional. AI has made these margins just smaller. Fewer jobs, lower pay, especially at the entry level.

Compared to the peers of same / similar experience and intellectual ability, these people would be paid 5-10x. I am not judging them. They chose a field, made right connections and stayed loyal to their jobs. these jobs will go away or shrink. But people who are studying to get deep into the topic don't have to worry. Through the curriculum and the environment you will learn about AI and using AI in software, and using AI tools to build software. And there will be complex enough software projects outside the realm of AI that you can work on a human. All in all, if you signed up and invested in Ms for easy money and an H1B, you are screwed. If you are genuinely interested in software and building high quality software, you will do just fine.",

For the real time chat interface did you implement it via REST, websockets? Did you persist the conversation history client side via local storage or backend in a database?

Anyway - You need to apply to 1k+ jobs if that's what it takes and you need to be willing to relocate. I'd only focus on roles that are in your old tech stack, that are in office, and require 0-3 years of experience.I'd also highly recommend the OMSCS at Georgia tech. It costs 8k and has a great course catalog. It'll give you a hard reset and gives you an opportunity to apply to internships alongside applying to full-time roles. As for your resume, you need to look at Jake's resume, it's a standardized template. Have gemini distill your experience and format it to fit in Jake's resume. I feel like gemini has the best creative and visual model so it'd be the best for this use case. There are other standardized resume templates, I'm not positive Jake's resume is still the most recommended so do your research. I remember his resume template being referenced all the time a few years ago.Use a mock interview platform to find where your weaknesses are (idk what they are, I think pramp is one?). Pay for it and utilize it as much as necessary. Once you fine-tune your ability to conduct interviews, grind leetcode for 3-4 months, 30 to 60 mins a day with one day off a week. Use neetcode.io. No excuses. Stretch it to 6 months if you want to target highly paid roles at tech companies. Take whatever salary you can get, even if it's 60k it doesn't matter. You need to get back into the market, rebuild your marketability. After a year or two you can focus on more desirable roles. Seriously you can do this, I don't care how bad the market is 2.5 years is unacceptable. You're unfocused and undisciplined. No offense. Be hungry and tenacious. Good luck man, I believe in you.",

You really need do everything in your power to stand out nowadays. I’m sure you’re applying to jobs frequently like many others and I’m sorry to take the tough love approach, but you need to try harder.Some advice I can share however is looking for production support(L2 or L3) roles. These roles have a lower barrier of entry and you work adjacent to software engineers to resolve production issues. Not the most exciting job, but can lead to something better with time by having some dialogue with managers about your skillset if openings become available internally.Also as some others have said, your resume could definitely use some refactoring.

If you’re in a good market area like Bay Area, CA or NY or what not you should get interviews fast. Get on LinkedIn, hit that open to work, contact recruiters. You don’t really mention if/how you’ve been searching so far. So hard to give advice.I would recommend trying to establish at least a low cadency therapy series.

These roles tend to be way less competitive than the traditional new grad full stack jobs. The company I interned for had roughly the same ratio of developers to testers+sys admins+qa but the latter got less applicants and thus the bar was lower. Build some projects that demonstrate your knowledge (i.e, a web app with unit + integration tests that are triggered by a cicd pipeline) and see where that gets you. Do not target big tech/known startups. go for older, established companies that aren’t directly in the tech space.",

Rejection emails were my daily bread and i am not sure if it was my luck after completing studies on November end, I was already on final round interviews for two companies.Do not stop applying and also refine your resume throughout every rejection, I tried new formats, new keywords, placements and everything also I did few certifications too that might help depending on your tech stack. Polish your LinkedIn every now and then I recently only figured out that recruiters do care about these things, make a repo display some of your work high chance recruiter won't check it but displaying shows professional in this sour market.Its not you its the market, alot of L1 jobs are being merged with L2-L3 and its just competitive, you're likely competing with people with several years of experience there are thousands of grads unemployed (both of offers were from full time position and not grad positions or openings) also apply jobs out of your radar be open to relocating for first few years.",

And then run with it as far as you can, doing the best possible you can at that job. Is it a minimum wage job slinging PHP spaghetti code in a WordPress sweatshop? Doesn't matter! ***Take it***. Heck, even a non-coding job like a Website Admin where you're just updating the website's content and managing the social media accounts you should gladly take!

One of the other orgs also reached out since she accepted the offer. This was an easier job search than her last one post-layoff in 2023, much harder than the one in 2020 when everything was going crazy, and easier than her new grad search in 2017-2018, though at the time she was looking at a pretty narrow set of cities where I could continue my unrelated career, too.Some relevant factoids:* She was employed (albeit at a pathetic pay rate after a 2023 layoff) beforehand.* 4.5yoe as a SWE with 3yoe as an SDET or QA prior.* MS in CS from a so-so state school. Unrelated BS.* After a handful of general applications that didn't produce even a \"no,\" she hyper-focused on job postings involving GIS experience as either a \"must\" or \"nice\" to have. She had this experience first from a previous career as a wildlife tech and more recently has 3yoe doing something similar as a SWE in her current soon-to-end job.* The pay in her new job is by no means silicon valley, but she's very much interested in quality of life and stability vs the brass ring. She wants the Lenovo and not the Macbook, so to speak.* She will be building flood prediction and mitigation software for a huge civil engineering company. Her current role is for an environmental consulting company building a land use planning and ecological footprint reduction app for corporate clients.* 80% increase in monetary compensation, drastically better benefits, fully remote.",

Some people say that having a conversation about the weather or your favorite soda or how Metroid Prime 4 is kind of cheeks is superficial, but what those people don't get is that it's all part of the social dance where you're feeling people out, implicitly saying you're open to friendship, sharing a laugh, etc. Like it or not, you are correct that avoiding this can make somebody come off as a bit cold. *What* is being said is relatively unimportant, assuming you don't say anything offensive (so table politics, religion, social issues, etc).I struggled socially a bit in my late teens, I just worried too much about what other people would think of me if I said something wrong or stupid.

You're not the only one with no replies, even if you are senior level.Third: Isn't engineering what you love? Are you as good and passionate about anything else than this? If your financial situation isn't super tight, you should really pour your heart and soul into your next startup, whether it's something you've tried before or something brand new. It might take months, maybe years, but if this is what you want to do, you have to approach it as something you love and not something you're nervous it will fail. If your financial situation is tight, then you make ends meet with jobs perhaps unrelated to software, but you keep working on a product you have in mind on the side. If coding, programming and software development is what makes you happy, you should do it regardless of income potential.You seem confused about one important thing: you meld successful career/income with engineering. I think you should shift your mindset - if development is truly what you enjoy, do it regardless of success and income. Nowadays, those who succeed as engineers are both talented and lucky. So the most important thing to do is to continue developing software while networking, applying for jobs and/or trying a new startup. I know the latter might not seem very appealing to you, but it's the only way to sustain income while continuing to do what you love.",

If taking that position is attractive and wouldn’t hurt your home life then why not take it? It shows growth at your current company which can set you apart from others. Basically you getting “promoted” at your current job is a better indicator than you getting that same position elsewhere. In a few years you can hit the job market at a higher level when things are a bit better is what I am thinking.EDIT: I don’t know your qualifications but I am at a little under 20YoE IC on the software side.

We could easily do exactly the same. We don't even have to make them insanely high, follow a protectionist strategy or trade wars. Just a \"small\" reciprocal DST on revenue is all you need. For example, take the France DST, 3%, if your gross ad, digital or e-commerce revenue is 100M, even if you made 0 profit, even if you made a loss, you owe France 3M. They did set a high 25M threshold to avoid hitting small companies but no tech giant with a large French audience can scape it. UK does something similar but 2%. India's one is even higher at 6% of gross revenue but it's limited to ads and their related services.Do that same thing on the gross cost of offshoring and the problem solves itself overnight.

I did all of my interviews remotely except for two. No one asked any leetcode style questions which couldn't be answered using first principles. Some companies asked C++ and low level questions which required knowing the language and how computers work based on extensive practical experience.The market is the worst I've seen it in 30 years, with a much lower hit rate and companies taking up to 6 weeks to respond.I have 32 years YoE doing system software and back end work. I have worked at Amazon (SDEIII), Facebook (E6) and Google (L7).

It’s too risky to hire you.​The Better Strategy:Instead of lowering your title, lower the company tier temporarily.​Avoid Big Tech/Startups for now. Their interview loops are brutal on 'rusty' candidates.​Target 'Boring' Industries. Look for Mid/Senior Data Engineer roles at insurance firms, hospitals, regional banks, or manufacturing companies.​The interview bar is often lower (less LeetCode, more practical SQL/Python).​The pace is slower, allowing you to re-learn on the job.​Rust ≠ Junior. You still know how data pipelines work; you just forgot the syntax. That comes back in 2 weeks. Do not reset your career clock because of a temporary confidence dip.",

Another thing, people like accountability, they won’t “swap you with AI” because of AI fails they cannot threaten it or assert they power on it, people want to deal with people especially in banking. Most probably they would ask you to use AI but if you also partecipate in business meetings as well no way they are shooting themself in the foot by firing you.

My advice would be to dip you toes in backend. Be full stack. If you're getting blocked by backend bs, build some solutions to those problems. If they're good, you become the product owner/go to and then you really can't get replaced. I have a friend who had similar issues working for a large real estate company and left. within a couple months of leaving, he was offered nearly triple his TC to work as a contactor and maintain the systems he built. I'm trying to do something at my current company; large healthcare servicer, so we're probably dealing with a lot of the same issues you are.If that's not your thing, build stuff you're interested in. Doesn't matter what it is or if it's related to your current role at all. Just build something interesting to you so you're motivated to dive deep and and really learn the low level nitty gritty. When that gets boring, try building something else. If it doesn't get boring, maybe you can build something really high quality and useful, and now you run your own company, definitely not replaceable.",

How are you going to convince hiring managers to move forward with you, and not them?If a while passes after you graduate and you've still got nothing in hand, I'd seriously consider going to grad school, but for a non-CS field. Some fields others here have mentioned include nursing, teaching, business (MBA), law, medicine, or some form of engineering. Some of these are harder than CS, but offer stronger career outlooks and better job security. The trades could be yet another option, but know that a lot of their hype is even more inflated than that of CS, and they're genuinely not for everyone.Don't wait around hoping for the economy to improve, either, because it genuinely might never. Did the automobile jobs ever come back to Detroit? Did factory workers ever get their jobs back? Exactly. And don't expect AI to \"create new tech jobs\" either, they're not going to be junior jobs.I'm sorry, I know I'm sounding pretty negative right now, but I don't want to give anyone a false sense of hope or security. It really is that bad, and we're all in the same boat. Just prepare for a rough next couple of years.",

Make a list of your teammates, and rank them from 1-3 on trust, higher is better. 3 means you both banter about your personal life and support each other when management does dramatic things. **Note: If you have none of these people, stop here and start building those relationships.**2. Grab some time to shoot the shit with your high trust buddies one on one. Tactfully ask how the company promotes, evolves people, and grows. Get specific, examples, resumes, etc.3. Use this information to make a case for why you should be paid more. **Note: Typically management cares about outcomes (customer satisfaction, revenue, cost, logos), not inputs (time, energy) or outputs (code, features, etc). If you don't have outcomes, you almost certainly don't \"deserve\" a raise.**4. Apply to other companies in the area and start working with recruiters. This is your reality check. **Note: If you aren't getting in the door, you now know you _can't_ earn more elsewhere. If you aren't getting past the interviews you now know where your weaknesses are.**5. Get decently far into the interviews (interviews are between 3 and 5 rounds long, once you're getting to finals (and not necessarily passing them) you should feel pretty high conviction you can land a new job.6. Tell your manager, in writing, at least 24 hours before your next 1:1, that you'd like some feedback on how to improve here. Mention your most impactful project and your least impactful project. This will signal to your manager that you're highly coachable (asking for feedback).7. At this 1:1, listen, ask non-defensive clarifying questions (e.g. \"Oh, so that wasn't as impactful as I thought. I'd like to do better next time around, how would you prefer I approach that situation when it comes up again?\").8. After the 1:1 take notes, reflect, and integrate all the knowledge you now have (peer's input on how promotions are handled, your performance in interviews, your manager's perception of you, your manager's ability to guide/help you grow)9. 24 hours before the next 1:1, tell your manager, in writing, that you'd like to discuss what growth at the company would look like in their eyes. **Note: This is the start of the negotiation. If there is a formal performance review process your manager will almost certainly shunt you to it. In that case this meeting is about learning the rules of that game and how to play it well. If there isn't a formal review process and your manager is good they will lay out a path, if they're bad, they'll wander around the subject.**10. Take notes, reflect, integrate. Your goal here is to answer this question: Do I leave, play the promo game, or wield power (threaten to leave) to get more money?At this point you should know what you want and need to do.Good luck kiddo!",

        "body": "They likely don't know. The way most companies set salaries is using market reference points - the market is roughly geographic and industry tied, though companies can kinda pick and choose who they think is competing for the same workers (software engineer at a FAANG and programmer in the IT department of a paper company are probably not in the same survey).So, junior dev in some industry group and city has a median of $X. A new grad offer might be 80% * $X and the company might say that the salary band for junior is 80%-120% of the market reference. Each year they get a new market reference and also adjust target points - performance based. So if the market reference is at $110k and you're at $91k, they might bump you up 2-5% on the target. If the market reference goes up, you might get a juicier raise. If it goes down, you get less of a raise. You'll have a target point and an effective point - they won't cut pay if you're target is lower than your effective, but your raises will be smaller.If you start getting above 100%, the raises are often lower. At that point they're thinking \"get promoted to get more money\" - part of the reason for the wider bands is to be able to make offers to people being hired away from other jobs.If your friend got 5 years of really good raises, I'd bet on a rapidly climbing reference point (2010-2022 were pretty good years) along with being below the midpoint target, then some pullbacks in reference point and being above target.Managers don't typically know what the reference points will be and also don't really know how you'll perform relative to expectations.",

Only you can decide that for yourself though, and it’s always worth remembering that start up equity could easily be worthless especially if you leave before fully vested or a liquidity event. The best early career advice that I received and often pass on is to be very clear, focused, and intentional about communicating your career growth goals with your manager. At this stage in your career, you should be hoping to level up every 2-3yrs. Sometimes faster depending on the company. A high growth startup is the type of environment I would expect to progress quicker assuming I’m contributing at a high level. If you aren’t promoted in the first 2yrs of being there, seek employment elsewhere unless you really strongly believe your equity is worth sticking around for (it often isn’t but there’s always exceptions)",

Telling them you really want to do SWE signals that you will be unhappy in the role they are hiring for.​The Role itself (Red Flag): You mentioned 'hardware troubleshooting.' Be very careful here. True SRE is software engineering applied to infrastructure (coding in Python/Go, writing Terraform, managing scale). It is a great foundation for becoming a Backend Engineer or System Architect later.​The Risk: If the role is actually just IT Support/SysAdmin disguised with an SRE title (which the 'hardware' part suggests), it will be hard to pivot back to SWE later because you won't be pushing code.​Strategy: Apply for the SRE role as is. In the interview, ask: 'What percentage of my time will be spent writing code vs. manual troubleshooting?' If the coding is <30%, keep looking.",

Within comparable companies, the SWE offers were still as a senior, and in smaller companies they offered staff. Hiring managers also seemed to value the SRE experience a lot.I think there's a huge demand for people who can run production systems and understand lower level things. Sure, there will be some people who think that SRE is just an ops monkey (which, TBF, is true in some companies), but you can just filter them out during your job search.",

Now I do fully agree with your parents; that you should use it because it will be the future. I think with that in mind, you should use it but FULLY understand what it is the AI is giving back to you as a response. Like \"why does this work?\", and \"why would this answer be better?\" should cross your mind. That's the approach I have taken when using AI for my personal projects. It helps too, because if you complete something one way, there will almost certainly be a more faster and elegant way to complete said task.

Doing a neuroscience phd not only allowed me to explore a new field, but I still got to code every single day.So pick a field that you want to apply your coding skills to. What interests you?

        "body": "Yes. This is why when I’ve worked in developer productivity - speed has always been a secondary measure. Long term health of the developers and the code base is the primary measure. The idea is you can sugar rush yourself very quickly to a work implementation - but something you can support long term is more difficult. There are a lot of ways to do this besides LLMs. For example removing code review would deliver software faster but it’s also just stupid. LLMs are not the first time I’ve seen someone try to push speed as the primary metric (hi management) but I’m guessing it will end just as badly. I don’t think LLMs will go away, you certainly can’t ban them, but we’re going to need to renegotiate our relationship with them.I’m hearing about developers putting out slop right now, and it’s getting caught, but there is no movement from management to PIP or fire those people who keep slopping. They feel like they’re discouraging AI use if they punish someone for creating garbage with LLMs. That’s going to have to change.",

Well, maybe if you develop a new programming language or a framework, like the author of the book seems to have done in his career, this is true. Programmers are your customers and you have to serve them well.I don't think a lot of people are vibe-coding programming infrastructure though. Coding agents are much more popular in product software development where you have to ship maximum value to your customer in shortest time possible. You are definitely expected to cut technical corners and, like others pointed out, create a minimum viable design for it to be maintainable and extendable. Agentic coding proved to be a suitable tool for this type of task. It has its downsides and no one can stop you from reviewing and refactoring the code it generated - at least, it's what I always do.",

In my experience, even the most clamped-down and rigorous code base requires some amount of effort to ramp up and extend. A 400k salary does well to incentivize source code spelunking whether it's stacked with bricks or spaghetti2. You are not your code. You are not your company. Code is an orchestrator and software are tools that automate or pave some new process to enable business. The end goal is not maintainability, it's money. I think you should focus on writing the minimally maintainable code to generate the most amount of business impact - potentially this could lead to extremely disciplined design before you type a single line, but it could also just as well lead to hacking something together -> ship it -> collect your merit -> get a comp bump and switch context.",

It's similar to Dev Associate. As I understand, Dev Associate is harder (deeper, vs wider). I couldn't tell you if SAA is impressive on it's own, or if both are worth it. Many people do SAA then do Dev. I felt that just getting Dev, the harder, more important one, done on it's own was enough. SAA is still tough too I imagine (2 vs 3 months basically?). I can only speak to my own experience and say I went from 0 interviews to weekly with the Dev Associate. Did I get more interviews because I had Dev over SAA? I don't know.SAA and Dev Associate are both good. Which, or both, I couldn't tell you 100%, but I went with Dev because I've heard it's more relevant to a web dev/full stack/SWE role.Couldn't speak on IT but I know IT is hard to break into too these days.I had very basic AWS experience before hand, basically deploying a couple websites on EC2 and some user permissions for a company. The stuff these certs go over are solutions for very large scale applications, thing basic simple websites don't usually need. It helped but wasn't huge.I'd say just pass the test to get the cert, you won't fully understand the material yet, but the first step of learning is just get the basic knowledge down.

I just like getting shit done, but unfortunately this “meh” attitude of not really caring what I use sometimes comes across as not passionate.As for what I enjoy, I really just enjoy being left alone and turning my work in. Whether it’s building a QA test case or building out some new app feature, I equally enjoy both. I settled on cybersecurity because it seems to scratch my itch to solve problems, investigate, and not have to be on endless phone calls (being left alone).

Maybe it won't.The best plan/approach, is the one that moves you closer to your actual goal, that you will ACTUALLY follow..A bit unrelated. But it's like a diet. Many of us problem solvers get bogged down on planning out most optimal solutions and paths, because it's fun. But when it comes to executing on that plan, day after day, you really have to stop thinking of yourself like a machine that can deterministically follow whatever oober optimized plan you make. Remember, whatever you decide to do, has to be realistically doable for you.. day after day.",

I recruited for new grad 2026 as I didn't think I was going to be on internship this year and I got 3 interviews that's it. Sure this extra 12 months will help along with perfecting my resume but its all up in the air.Will defiantly work on growing the app this year and I'll try to get those metrics but most will either be estimations or slightly made up because I don't know.Will 100% applying broadly as some employment is better than no employment but tier 1 tech is just a goal. I'm assuming the prep for tier 1 tech applies to other companies as well? Base goal is to get a job but tier 1 tech is what I'm shooting for.Also what does \"network like crazy\" really mean? Am I just sending requests to a bunch of recruiters on LinkedIn? And what am I doing at these tech events? Most of the time it's just basic information and they tell you to apply online. When it comes referrals, what's more important getting a referral or applying soon as the posting goes live? Like say I know a person who will give me the referral but it will be a day after the job posting has gone live, should I wait for the referral or prioritize applying quick as possible?Also will tier 1 tech even care about my experience since I haven't worked at a tech company?Appreciate the detailed response :)",
