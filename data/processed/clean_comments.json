They can explain tradeoffs clearly, like why they would choose one storage or processing pattern over another given scale, cost, or failure modes. Strong candidates also communicate their thinking out loud and course correct when they realize an assumption is wrong. A common gap is treating pipelines like coding exercises instead of production systems with monitoring, data quality, and consumers. Big tech interviews care less about memorized syntax and more about whether you understand how data actually behaves over time.

How did you use both business and data engineering expertise to design, propose, modify, and execute a solution? How did you ensure your proposed solution *actually* addressed the business problem?I'm consulting with a company that used a large vendor to design their data solutions. None of those original solutions actually solved the business problems at hand, despite the fact that they handled all of the data, did transformations, designed and scheduled pipelines, and all of the other data engineering fun stuff.Too many technical and data folk will specify and build something very technical and impressive looking just enough to get greenlit by managers. Then they go and build said thing and deliver the equivalent to a car whose wheels are on the roof. They met all the expectations: an engine, uses gasoline, produces torque through wheels, has seats, etc., but ultimately built something useless to the business.Reviewing that previous group's work, I've found that their stakeholder presentations are full of technical diagrams outlining the tools and technologies they will use, and how cool said tools are, but overall they contain little about how they will help. Using cars as an analogy (again), it's as if one advertised how great the metallurgy is in the car, what electrical connectors it uses, etc.; that kind of detail is ultimately important, the engineers are interested in it and stakeholders are impressed by it, but what *actually* matters is how the car works. Is the car safe, can it accelerate well, does it have good enough mileage, can it accommodate everybody in it, does it do what you need, and can you explain why and how it achieves all of this?How do *you* avoid doing the above and ensure your work fulfills business problems? Can you work both domains simultaneously: both understanding the business *and* having the technical expertise to construct data solutions that solve the problem? Can you show your technical expertise while explaining the business problem, and then show your understanding of the business problem while discussing your technical expertise? Can you keep all of this together in a cohesive story?Lastly, can you demonstrate the ability to learn and adapt? Can you learn new business environments/problems and then describe how you would approach finding a technical solution? Can you show that you're not a one-trick pony and have found proper solutions to things? The way my manager framed it: can you be left alone with a client such that your manager can sleep easy, knowing you will properly present and harvest information correctly?Being able to speak both \"languages\", business and technical, puts you far ahead of other candidates. In interviews, I often find myself interviewing the interviewer, asking about the characteristics of the project, discussing their current solutions, and where they're trying to go. Then from there, I describe technical solutions, the needed labor/resources, and how the outcomes of said solutions will solve their business problems. I interweave past experience into this to demonstrate familiarity and competency. Also, don't be a know it all - when you encounter something you don't know, say so and provide your approach to developing understanding - people can tell when you're bullshitting, and dishonesty is always a major liability.Anyway, that's my two (hundred) cents.",

Snowflake/Databricks mainly give you less platform wrangling in exchange for cost and lock-in.

This is why most teams cannot afford to maintain it. It's working because our team is very mature. I don't think you can expect it for a team that has been stable for less than 5 years and is still overloaded with requests and production issues.

Yes, it is a dependency, but point to point isn't bad as long as there aren't too many; at which point you start looking at a central repository for these cross-group objects in place of point-to-point. dbt for all, I agree is not a good ideal and fortunately not one I've come across in the wild.",

This could be a Kimball Star model but does not have to. Could be a flat table (IMHO most common)Data scientist I would explain the data vault concept so they can search the data for themself, only require that they have something that describes for them what they need.I need that for the data lineage.

You generate the code to download the historical weather and air quality data (backfilling) into feature groups (tables) and write an incremental pipeline to download weather forecasts, weather observations, and air quality observations. The 1st challenge you will encounter is how to perform a temporal join to join air quality observations with weather observations. This requires an ASOF LEFT JOIN between the tables. Only a few data warehouses support it it (and Hopsworks feature store). You want that data back in Python (e.g., Pandas DataFrames) to train the model. Hopsworks provides that data via Arrow from the Lakehouse tables. If you go via JDBC/ODBC to your data warehouse, performance will be vile - Arrow (ADBC or ArrowFlight) is best for Python clients.My book (referenced in the thread) covers these fundamental skills of backfilling vs incremental pipelines and data models - star schema, snowflake schema data model and OBT (don't use this for ML!).",

So either bronze if bronze has 100% of source (usually they never do) or you build into staging an extra layer for de duplicating row data with hashing, from vetted sources. If data from higher levels is required, either a view or make some new tables in silver for the ML data process. Make sure it is repeatable at different times or days with the same filter. Then what the ML spits out, that is information, store that in Dim/Fact gold layer. Like a Customer Rating. The fact is the rating calculated by the ML based on history available at the time the CR was calculated. The Dims would be DimCustomer, DimCustomerRating, DimDates, FKs into a new FactCustomerRating table. So the ML the Python code reads the datawarehouse repeatable data, and sends into staging the output, that then gets processed. Unless you build APIs and have the ML process running continuously so that a new customer is processed in near real-time.",

Remote is often misunderstood as \"work anywhere at any time\". Remote more accurately is rephrased as \"work from anywhere within the country you have working rights during specific hours which have been stipulated in a contract\".You also have the situation where if you work in the evening and there's nobody there with you, there's a strong possibility you're doing fuck all/maverick shit which is about to murder production tomorrow and there's nobody there to help.That being said, no harm in asking.

The entire company is remote.I can generally work \"U.S. business hours\" but might work East Coast hours one day and West Coast hours the next day depending on what works for my schedule. If I need to be gone for an hour in the middle of the day, I block it off on my calendar. If I need to go to a longer appointment, I'll book it either at the beginning or end of the day, block it off on my work calendar, then let people know in Slack the day before. If I need to flex more than two hours like that, I usually just take half a sick day--I think I get 9 sick days a year? \"Unlimited\" vacation days, though. The assumption is that sick days are short-notice while vacation days are approved in advance.I usually have two 1-hour meetings on Mondays, then no meetings the rest of the week; every 4-6 weeks, I have a 30-minute meeting with my manager. There is a monthly Engineering \"meeting\", but it's recorded, so you only need to join the Zoom if you feel like watching live or want to ask questions in the Q\\&A; the agenda is provided in advance. Everything else is asynchronous, including the daily standups, Product updates, etc., unless you want to ask someone questions \"live\" to debug a project you're working on. Then, a meeting is scheduled. \"Just hopping on a call\" isn't really a thing in my team, because if you need to ask detailed questions on how to do something, that means the documentation needs to be improved, which means someone needs to write more down for the next person. So again: the call should have an agenda prepared and sent in advance.I am on-call 24/7 a week at a time, every 6ish weeks. There are rarely pages outside of business hours, though. Only a few times per year.I would say all the flexibility on my team is because everyone is senior+, so no one really requires close \"supervision\" per se. We also have tight delivery deadlines, so regardless of schedule flexibility, you won't last long if you don't get your work done.",

Complete toolFor example Qlik has everything you need or more. It costs about $200 month. Relatively simple to setup and develop, large userbase for questions and help.2. Set of different toolsYou need place to store your data, some database or S3 bucket or something, it costs something but not much. Then you need move your data to your chosen storage, for example Python and some orchestration tool. Lastly some tool to show your KPI's, like PowerBI, Astrato, etc. Those cost something too. Starting from zero can be difficult to decide what you need and what to use, solutions have lots of users, help and examples are easy to find.3. Build everything yourselfThis depends about your skill set, how much time you want to spend with this, how large your userbase etc. Doable but I don't recommend, others have already solved all the problems you have to solve in this, takes much time and security is always worrying. No other users, help can be difficult to find.",

A lot of the workarounds requires airflow or similar but that doesn't help us dbt cloud folk.Also, to be clear, parse is likely a misnomer here, dbt doesn't have to touch the db on a parse normally. Compile is what is probably eating OPs compute and time. Even then it's kinda crazy how much time it's taking for them. We have 5000+ models (with thousands of tests too) and it doesn't take that long for a full compile. Like 3-5 minutes. And that's including a lot of introspective adapter calls.I've also seen other folks manipulate the hash that dbt checks so it doesn't think it needs the full parse as an alternative workaround. It does need something like airflow to do it, given I'm on dbt cloud I can't.",

It spends more time shuffling the index tree than actually storing your data.Try using \"rewriteBatchedStatements=true\" in your JDBC Connection String and let us knw if it solves the performance issue.Also, if it is one time thing or full reload, you would be better off dropping the indexes, the non-primary ones at least, before you begin with the load/reload.Hope this helps.",

If you're doing everything incrementally there's little cost impact of that vs daily. But if you're doing a bit that's full refresh at the same time consider different frequencies based on day of week & hour of day. Ex: weekdays are every 15 minutes, but night & weekends are hourly. * Consider using aggregate tables for common dashboard pages. * Pay attention to database optimizations for files and tables. Ex: for athena used compressed parquet files of the appropriate size. * etc, etc, etc",

Scalability -- build templated scripts of processes that only require inputs to run. For example, the name of a source, its connection, the name of the tables, and so on.Pros: scalable, easy to add new sources (just add a config)Cons: Harder to understand than \\[2\\] as there is an extra layer of abstraction (the \"metadata\" layer)2. Ease of understanding -- simply have processes for each source that move and/or process the data. It's a bit easier to understand for other people and new joiners since there's just one thing to look at which could be a bit more scalable in the future since other people can chime instead of you bottlenecking your data teamI've seen 2 work well when there isn't loads of data but a big need for data in the company. \\[1\\] works well in say traditionalindustries like manufacturing where realistically it will always be a central data or IT team trying to process probably quite a lot of data, so it depends but the key always is design first then modularity IMO",

        "body": "At my last job I built out a bunch of different ETL pipelines over about 4 years. At different layers of the stack there's different approaches.For custom API extractor's, I wrote the first two as completely separate. Then when I was working on the third, I started by copy-pasting stuff from the first two, looked at where things were identical and put as much of the overlapping code as I could into a library. Then I made all of our future extractors use that library. We were writing them in go so this took the form of an interface which extended `io.reader` that the custom extractor would implement.For loading, using the aforementioned library produced data in a standard format along with a schema file that could be used to generate a snowflake load statement. Then we had a single snowflake load component defined in our task orchestrator which we re-used everywhere, changing only the configuration. (We used argo-workflows as our task orchestrator instead of Airflow. I... don't recommend doing that)And then for transform jobs, I'd conceptually sort them into two categories. 1) Transforms which you can determine programmatically from some sort of metadata. This could be standard transformations you perform on every table like an upsert, or it could be parsing fields out of a JSON document based on a schema. You should generate these SQL statements with code. You can have that code be DBT macros, use code-gen to generate DBT statements, or just generate and run the SQL statements from your application. I'm not a huge fan of abusing DBT macros for stuff like this because I find JINJA to be kind of messy, but a lot of people swear by it. Probably comes down to personal preference. As for having the code that generates the SQL statements also run it, you should avoid this unless you directly benefit from detecting and implementing schema change on-the-fly. Otherwise just having a daily/weekly pull request that you generate with a script is probably fine.2) Custom business logic transformations. I wouldn't do anything special here. If it's in DBT that's enough standardizaiton.Then once you're writing custom transformations you can kind of do whatever you want. DBT forcing everything to be SQL select statements is a pretty high level of standardization.",

It sounds like you could use some re-structuring of your tables if I'm interpreting this quote correctly. You shouldn't need every single column of your table to know what to join on. How many columns do your tables have?>I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persistedThat's because that's not how that works. A count statement materializes your dataframe, but it doesn't magically make that dataframe available downstream. That's what caching is for. If you have `myDF.count` and then use do `myDF.join(other, ...)`, Spark will either re-calculate `myDF` entirely (which means your `.count` statement is actually making your code SLOWER by doubling the amount of processing you're doing), or it will intelligently cache the results on its own after seeing that the Dataframe is being re-used, in which case the `.count` still didn't do anything that a cache wouldn't do.TL;DR - don't use `.count` unless you're trying to get the count. Any other use of it is a hack that can be done better in different ways.>I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impactThis makes sense. With only 50-100 records, I guarantee that Spark is already broadcasting those anyway. None of your tables are large unless you have an enormous number of columns in your \"main\" table. 50k records isn't very much if you have your tables designed properly, which brings me back to my original question above.>Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without?Yes, you should always use good engineering practices and write clean code. Using functions and classes has no impact on the Spark query plan, but it does have an impact on your and your coworkers' sanity.>Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?Making your code maintainable and having a large query plan are separate issues that are only loosely related at best. Again, Spark doesn't care how your code is organized. Pulling code out into a function will not impact it at all.Use good software engineering practices to make your code maintainable. Use good data engineering practices to keep your spark plans efficient.Edit:After reading the post again, I have one more question>However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error.Are you doing something other than the joins? 6 joins isn't a lot and will absolutely not create a large query plan and also absolutely would not be the cause of an OOM error. Can you post a sample of what your code looks like? Because that really doesn't add up to me.",

Depending on what table i am joining i will also need to filter the main table. I do not bring in every single column from the small table but just just a few. I then repeat this 6 times. I then save the updated main table.The way i implement the join is to get all the keys from the small table, lets say key1,2,3. then iterate 3 times and get all the key1s from the small table and join it to the main table on the left. repeat this for all the keys. And rows in the left that havent been mapped will then have a new column written as flag and map this to Yes.The errors i get when writing it as a function / loop: The cluster runs out of memory (from my understanding of your point means my execution plan is too large)So for my side question the main point i should be focusing on is how to make sure my execution plan is optimal? is there a guide on this?Edit: just saw your edit regarding looking at the code:So first I get the keys from the mapping df:     valid_keys = (         mapping_df.groupBy(\"key\")         .count()         .select(\"key\")         .distinct()         .rdd.flatMap(lambda row: row) # we want to flatten to make a list         .collect()     ) I then loop to do the joins:     # Step 2: create a dictionary that only has the join keys that we need     filtered_dict = {k: v for k, v in join_keys.items() if k in valid_keys}     final_matched_df = None     current_df = main_df     for key_name, key_cols in filtered_dict.items():         # Drop output columns from current_df BEFORE the join to give us the filtered df without the output columns         for col_name in output_columns:             if col_name in current_df.columns:                 current_df = current_df.drop(col_name)         # Get the mapping key which is the key + the output columns on the key we are joining by         mapping_key = mapping_df.select(*key_cols,*output_columns).where(col(\"key\") == key_name) # return the rows where the keys match         # display(mapping_key) will do join on key 1 then get key 2 then key 3 etc         # We join the mapping key row on the key and get the mapping key which includes key + the output columns         joined_df = current_df.join(mapping_key, on=key_cols,how=\"left\")         # get DF which only has the matched rows         matched_df = joined_df.filter(col(\"key\").isNotNull())         # Accumulate the DF with the matched data         if final_matched_df is None:             final_matched_df = matched_df         else:             final_matched_df = final_matched_df.unionByName(matched_df)         # Get the unmatched rows for next iteration         current_df = joined_df.filter(col(\"key\").isNull())Then i create a flag if a join doesnt occur:     # create the flag     if missing_flag is not None:         final_matched_df = final_matched_df.unionByName(current_df).withColumn(             missing_flag,             when(col('key').isNull(), \"Y\").otherwise(\"N\"))So this code will be called 6x (one time for each small table)",

It's a combination of:* Market temperature* You as an individual at a technical level* You as an individual at a personal level* How realistic your expectations areFrom what I read on the subreddit, people who struggle a lot tend to have very unrealistic expectations for their first role, underestimate how much work is required, as well as overestimate their own position within the job market e.g. no years experience, done one bootcamp, \"can't find a remote job paying $200k USD - job market is COOKED\".Purely anecdotal although I got into Data Engineering during the previous DE boom 5 years ago, so I had market temperature on my side. Additionally, I was unemployed so was programming, studying, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours per week as well as applying for jobs within the country I'm a citizen of, so a lot less complications in terms of borders.Based on what you have written, there is a possible issue with borders although if the subreddit is anything to go by, a lot of US work is being outsourced to your location. I'd definitely consider asking r/dataengineersindia as they're likely well positioned to answer your question.",

I was once interviewed by a company that worked primarily with Excel and they'd asked me if I had experience with excel because they needed an excel guy who'd automate the excel routine and they called it a data analyst position but these types of companies never really understand that Excel is a spreadsheet not a database. So in your case, I wouldn't give up on being an analyst, I'd just try to find a job that has a different approach to what you are supposed to do. Otherwise DE will feel the same way in a company that doesn't understand the difference between a BI analyst, an ETL developer or a DE. So it ain't really about switching to another role, it is more about your current employee. And don't underestimate SQL. It is one of the most powerful tools there is in the data world. If you feel stuck with SQL, go and learn PL/SQL or any other procedural language, marvelous things can be done with it once mastered. Like the latest \"marvel\" for me was pg\\_clickhouse extension, you basically can query clickhouse from postgresql, build dashboards using just 1 connection. I am more of an Oracle guy myself, but postgresql and clickhouse or duckdb offer a new world of possibilities and it is all just SQL that you are feeling bored by =)",

Data Vault, Kimball Star models.You work on data bases like Oracle, postgres, terraria.Or Kafka, Apache iceberg or had up to name fancy approaches.Data science is ML, fancy mathematics to get some insights from existing data.Maybe ask some data science guy.

For example here in r/dataengineering are multiple experienced engineers that are willing to share their experience. And AI also gives nice ideas on how to tackle the challenges.My advice is do not focus on tooling as the primary goal..Look into data governance ( most boring data engineering topic IMHO, and I put it here because it is about metadata)Data quality ( that's always a thing, and IMHO the most interesting part)Data modeling strategy ( that is the most difficult part. ).All of these topics you can tap in today without changing jobs and they will accompany your DE career.If you see a job that features a tooling that interests you, go for it.there is nothing wrong in that. But see it more like a car acquisition you always wanted to drive.Also when applying to position try to highlight your core data engineering skills that you already have. I think that's a better thinking approach then do tool bingo. You might also discover more interesting jobs by doing so.I hope that advice helps you and provides some motivation to you.",

So, you either will have a vendor lock or mixing different entities in one (like Hive Metastore + Hive SQL).Second option looks nice, for example, an OpenLineage standard can be used, but the existence of lineage in catalog will depend on query engine.If I would build a solution on open source technologies, I would prefer a second option. Something like DataHub that supports OpenLineage ingestion via REST API. But I would avoid heavily tighten \"all-in-one\" solutions and would keep lineage as an option.",

        "body": "That overlap you’re seeing is real, and honestly, a combined solution is becoming the standard rather than a \"nice-to-have.\" In my experience, separating them usually leads to one becoming stale because they rely on the same underlying metadata context to be useful.Here is how I’ve seen this play out in practice -1. The Platform Approach (Unity Catalog) **-** I’ve used Unity Catalog extensively for this. It essentially forces the catalog and lineage to live together. Because the governance (permissions, access controls) creates the lineage automatically as jobs run, you don't have to \"maintain\" the lineage separately. The catalog is the map of the lineage. If you treat them as separate tools, you end up doing double the work to keep them in sync.2. The Open Source Route (OpenMetadata) **-** If you are looking outside of a specific vendor ecosystem, tools like OpenMetadata are tackling this exact \"all-in-one\" problem. They treat data assets, lineage, and quality checks as a single entity. It proves that the market prefers a unified view. Data engineers don't want to tab switch between a catalog to find a table and a lineage tool to see where it came from.3. The Shift to Orchestrators (Dagster) - The most interesting shift right now is actually happening in the orchestration layer. I’ve been using Dagster, and they handle this through “software-defined Assets.\" Instead of lineage being an afterthought or a documentation task, the lineage is defined by the code itself.* Assets **-** You define the data asset, and the lineage is inherent.* Asset Checks **-** You attach quality checks directly to those assets in the graph.So, to answer your question, Yes, a combined solution is useful. In fact, things are moving even further, merging Catalog + Lineage + Execution (Orchestration) into one view so that \"accountability\" isn't just a log you look at later, but part of the pipeline run itself.Hope this helps.",

        "body": "**Yes - combined catalog + lineage is the way to go**, and it's becoming the standard rather than a \"nice-to-have.\" From working on DataHub at LinkedIn, here's what I learned: **separating them creates semantic drift at scale.** Your lineage says \"user\\_events\\_v2\", your catalog says \"user\\_events\", and nobody knows if they're the same thing. When you have 100K+ datasets, this breaks governance completely. **Why integration matters more than people realize:** • **Metadata propagation** \\- tag one source table as PII, lineage cascades it downstream to 50 derived tables automatically. Manual tagging doesn't scale.  • **Impact analysis** \\- \"this pipeline failed, who owns the upstream data?\" If you're jumping between tools, you've already lost.  • **Trust flows backwards** \\- you can't assess data quality without tracing upstream. Separate systems = manual stitching every time. Most of the modern catalogs are moving to a model of \\- out-of-the-box connectors that \"pull\" lineage into the system from external systems \\- support reporting of lineage INTO the system via standard catalog-native API-s/agents/emitters or vendor-neutral protocols like OpenLineage **The caveat the other responses touched on:** some solutions like Dagster's \"software-defined assets\" are elegant but only work for what the orchestrator controls. Your data doesn't start in the warehouse: • Production systems feeding Kafka streams  • Real-time stream processing (Flink, Spark Streaming)  • Cross-cloud data movement that never touches your orchestrator  At my previous company, \\~40% of critical lineage came from **outside** the orchestration layer. You need a catalog that can **aggregate lineage from multiple systems** (streaming, production databases, warehouses), not just generate it from one orchestrator. **The test:** can you trace a BI dashboard → warehouse → dbt → Kafka → production database in one query? That's 5-6 systems owned by different teams. The catalog is your aggregation point. Best of luck with convincing your customers and the world!",

You do have to upskill and learn data modelling. You should volunteer for those sort of project in your current job to at least say you have experience with data modelling such as Kimball. There are lots of courses on data modelling you can take. Once you got your foot in the DE door doing SQL and data modelling, you should learn Python, infrastructure etc and become a more well-rounded DE.

I had deployed my own project on AWS, set up a data pipeline and a basic streamlit front-end, spoke about docker, scheduled functions, the trade-off between different database options and why I made my decisions.My advice, unless you get a role as an apprentice where you're guaranteed a job afterwards, don't bother. Grad schemes say degree or equivalent experience a lot of the time, and jobs themselves definitely value experience more.Also, look up the apprenticeship providers in the uni league tables. If you were really serious, I'd recommend going to somewhere like Georgia Institute of Tech and paying out of pocket for a reputable course.",

We had a bunch of automated processes scraping data from different sources feeding it into our CRM and then triggering marketing automations. Seemed straightforward enough but then we started seeing weird discrepancies in our reporting and it turned out one of the integrations was pulling in data fields from an older deprecated system that hadn't been properly sanitized. It wasn't a security breach per se but it was definitely a compliance nightmare waiting to happen. Trying to trace that data flow manually was a total disaster. It felt like we were untangling spaghetti and every time we pulled on one strand three more popped up. What really helped us was implementing a virtual data platform that basically acts like an AI data engineer. It was able to map all the data connections identify the data quality issues and flag those unexpected data flows between systems we didn't even realize were happening. Like it showed us this whole chain of dependencies that would have taken weeks for us to figure out on our own. The cool thing is that it didn't require us to move any data around. It just analyzed everything in place and gave us a clear picture of what was going on. Then we used the no-code tools it offered to build agents and workflows that enforced the correct data governance policies and automated the cleanup process. We even built alerts that would fire off if any of the agents tried to access data they weren't supposed to which gave us some peace of mind. Honestly before this our data team was spending all their time firefighting data quality issues and dealing with ad-hoc requests from sales and marketing. Now they're actually working on strategic projects that move the needle. The company that helped us out has a referral program and Id be happy to connect you. I get a little kickback if you become a customer so full disclosure there but it honestly solved a huge headache for us and it sounds like you're dealing with something similar. I can drop you a link if you're interested.",

This can be suprisingly difficult, both because there are many obscure setup challenges that can arise, and because it's kind of boring and frustrating to troubleshoot the part that doesn't give you any immediate results.4. Try basic examples. Use things you research, see if you can reapply them, get an understanding of how new things work.5. Apply them to your problem. In a bigger project, and if you have more experience, you will want to keep in mind maintainability to make changes to this easier. But it's still valuable to just take a crack at it.

        "body": "A socket is provided by the OS as a means for different processes to communicate, essentially acting like a file handle. You can write to it or read from it to send or receive data. It’s like a mailbox where the OS acts as the mailman and figures out how to transport the mail. Sockets don’t necessarily need an address - e.g. you could have an anonymous socket for communicating between processes on the same computer. In this case, it’s usually held in memory by the OS kernel until the socket is closed. Sockets can also be local-only, and are often bound to a file path so other processes can also go find the socket and send mail to your program.When you’re writing an HTTP server you *do* want an address so that others can send you mail (HTTP requests), so when you bind to a socket with a specific port you’re telling the OS “if you get any letters to this address, stick them in my mailbox.” By binding your socket to a port, you’re giving it an address that is reachable over the network. Otherwise, you couldn’t have a server that just sits and waits for requests - nobody has a way to send your program any requests!Here’s a pretty good [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/D26sUZ6DHNQ) that explains sockets simply and in better detail than many developers ever know or care to learn. In practice, you usually just need to know that it’s a stream of data handled by the OS, very similar to reading/writing files, and how that data is handled beyond that is not really your application’s business. It is helpful to know that sockets usually stay open for a while after you’re done with them (in case the other side has more data to send), and you’re limited in the number of sockets you can create, so it’s prudent to reuse sockets where possible rather than open new ones regularly.",

In C it's a number referencing a file descriptor, with syscalls for the defined operations. In Java it's an object (java.net.Socket) with methods for the defined operations. The actual implementation will be via references to data structures in the system's networking stack, which will keep track of addresses and buffers, and handle the encoding and exchange of your data via the system's networking hardware.",

Usually the first file you open is file #3, the next one is #4, the one after that is #5, etc.In traditional UNIX sockets, when you say \"I want to make a network connection\" the OS says \"OK, your network connection is #3.\" Then later you can say \"I want network connection #3 to connect to server 10.234.5.67 on port 80,\" followed by \"Send the bytes 47 45 54 20 2f 0a 0a over network connection #3\".Most of today's networking systems evolved from traditional UNIX sockets and work basically the same way, even on \"non-UNIX-like\" platforms such as Windows.> Is a socket an object?The socket is the object in the OS's internal data structures that is manipulated when you tell the OS to do something with network connection #3.> Is the socket a number?For the purposes of asking the OS to do something with a socket, the socket is #3...but \"3 means the connection between this computer and 10.234.5.67\" is only valid in the context of a specific conversation your program had with the OS.> Is the socket a file?The \"numbers the OS hands out, like #3 above\" are called *file descriptors*. They were originally made for files, but were adapted for sockets. When you want to write the word \"hello\" to a file that you previously opened and the OS told you it was file #3, you tell the OS \"Write these bytes to file descriptor #3: 68 65 6c 6c 6f\".One interesting decision they made was that if #3 refers to a network connection instead of a file, then *you can still tell the OS to read or write bytes exactly the same way*.A socket isn't a file, but it sort-of acts like one.(UNIX domain sockets are a different beast. I'm not going to discuss them here.)> Is a socket an IP:port combination?No. IP:port combination is a setting you put on the socket for outgoing connections. For incoming connections you set a port; the OS only gives you connections from others requesting that port. You can also optionally set an IP address for incoming connections, sometimes called a \"bind address\". In case your machine has multiple IP addresses, the bind address tells which one you're interested in getting connections from.> when creating an HTTP server, why do we use sockets\"Why do we use sockets to make an HTTP server?\" is like asking \"Why do we use a print statement to put data on the screen?\" Because that's what the system provides.There's a lot of stuff going on under the hood! For example the humble print statement could be replaced with a syscall or a BIOS interrupt or writing pixels directly to a framebuffer or [building your own graphics card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs).But as a beginner you don't want to think too much about the underlying layers just yet; you'll just get confused and overwhelmed. \"Use a socket for network connections\" is the networking equivalent of \"Use the print() statement to put text on the screen.\"",

The best way to learn a Docker is making a project, then seeing how you can containerize it. Watch a 20 minute video, make the Dockerfile with the needed commands, build it, then run the container. You get started very quickly. If there's a genuine reason you need Docker, learning more advanced things won't be difficult, because you'll be eager to fix the problem you have. If you watch a Docker vid just to do Docker you'll be bored out of your mind",

If you can't think of one go browsing places on Reddit, Github, etc. and get a look at what others are making and see if you want to try to clone something or put your own twist on it. I usually try to ask myself what needs to be done to get the project going. Like I'd break it down into steps and go. If you're wanting to deploy something with Docker then pick something that can run in a Docker Container, figure out how to containerize it or if it's already done try to figure out what they did to get the project container ready, look into how the container is built, and then look at the steps needed to deploy the project somewhere. From there you can begin to find where your knowledge gaps are and then go search for appropriate documentation, videos, etc. as you go. If you're having attention span issues then try to train yourself to do a little at a time and then come back. (Or speak with some medical professionals about possible ways to help) I have used books, looking at open source code, videos when those came around, and talking with others to learn things. From there I try to build and stop to review materials and to brainstorm on how to get around blocks. You can use LLMs to help with learning as well, but you need a way to validate information coming from them as of now and you also need to learn how to not let it do all the work for you if your intention is to learn. If you're wanting to learn something try not to give up and keep at it. Good luck on your learning journeys.",

Healthcare is moving to the cloud rapidly.3. **Data Pipelines:** For a Data Engineering role, learn **Apache Airflow** and **Docker**.4. **Privacy:** Read up on **HIPAA** compliance. You need to know how to handle sensitive data safely.For your portfolio, try taking a messy public health dataset and building an automated pipeline to clean and visualize it. Good luck!",

MOOC Helsinki is gold so definitely stick with that.Here is a solid progression path with the specific skills you need for each stage.**Beginner Skills*** **Core Logic** You need to master `if` `else` statements and loops like `for` and `while` to control the flow.* **Data Handling** Get comfortable with `int` `double` and `String` types and using the `Scanner` class to get input from the user.* **OOP Basics** For things like a Bank Simulator you specifically need to understand Classes Objects and Constructors. You also need to learn Encapsulation which just means using `private` variables and `public` getter and setter methods to protect your data.**Beginner Project Ideas*** **Number Guessing Game** This is a classic for a reason. It forces you to use random number generation loops and conditional logic to tell the user if they guessed too high or too low.* **Console Calculator** Build a calculator that runs in the terminal. It helps you practice breaking your code into separate methods for addition subtraction multiplication and division.* **Simple Quiz** Create a multiple choice quiz. You will need to use arrays to store the questions and answers and a loop to cycle through them while keeping score.**What you need** You really just need a good IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse and you should absolutely start using Git for version control right now.

As you move up, projects that involve failure handling, like a small server that must recover from bad input or partial crashes, force you to think like an engineer instead of a syntax user. Also, not using AI for a while is a good call, but do not confuse that with avoiding documentation or reading other people’s code. Learning how systems break and how you fix them is where the real growth happens.",

What matters is that you caught it early (3rd sem is still early).A big mistake people make right now is trying to pick a “future-proof domain” instead of building fundamentals + proof of work.Here’s a simpler way to think about it:Step 1: Stop trying to predict the job market.AI noise, saturation talk, etc. mostly affects people with shallow skills. Strong fundamentals age well.Step 2: Build a core base first (3–4 months):One programming language properly (Python / Java / JS — doesn’t matter much)Data structures & basic problem-solvingGit + basic LinuxThis alone puts you ahead of many students.Step 3: Use web dev as a vehicle, not a destination.Web dev isn’t bad — generic web dev is.Build 2–3 small but real projects:CRUD appAuth + databaseSimple APINot to become a “frontend dev”, but to learn how software actually works.Step 4: Let interest emerge from doing, not thinking.Most people don’t “discover” interests — they develop them after building something.After that, you can branch:Backend / systemsData / analyticsDevOps / infraApplied AI (later, not now)Important reality check:AI won’t replace developers who understand systems, trade-offs, and can build things end-to-end. It will replace people who only copy tutorials.Your goal for the next 6–9 months isn’t mastery.It’s momentum + consistency.Pick one path, commit for 90 days, reassess. That alone puts you ahead of most.",

The first thing I did was get assigned as an extra code reviewer for an MR that was written by a developer experienced in the language. I did my review first, and I had to spend time reading through his code, cross-referencing documentation for the libraries being used, and generally just building my understanding of the code. When the other code reviewers and testers also did their passes, I read their issues to see what I had missed. (Which is a good habit that I do for everything I review, not just this).After that, I did an MR of my own and had it reviewed by the person who had done the previous MR. There was still a ton of referencing documentation but I had a fairly good idea of what I needed to do.It gets substantially easier the more experience you have under your belt. I've coded in more than a dozen languages, so at this point picking up a new one is pretty simple as I already know how to \"think like a programmer\" which is the core skill that we need.",

        "body": "A lot of people get stuck because they treat learning a language like consuming content instead of solving problems. Tutorials feel productive, but there’s nothing forcing your brain to retrieve or apply anything, so it fades fast.What usually works better is picking a very small goal and letting that goal pull the language in. Something concrete like parsing a file, building a tiny game, automating a task you already do, or reimplementing a simple tool you use. Then you learn just enough syntax to make the next thing work, look things up constantly, and accept that forgetting is part of the process. That cycle is what actually builds memory.Docs and references are great once you’re actively coding, because you approach them with a question instead of passively watching. If boredom is the problem, reduce scope, increase feedback, and write code every day even if it’s messy. Speed comes from doing, not from finding the perfect resource.",

First you can attend a community college for two years to get an associates degree in computer programming. That's not as expensive as a bachelors degree in Computer Science but it gets you half way there. Most universities will accept an associates degree as the first two years of a computer science curriculum. The advanced math comes into play if you want to get a bachelors in Computer Science. Most degree programs are either in an engineering school or a business school. Some colleges make you choose an area of concentration (mine was physics) Business curriculums do not usually require calculus while science and engineering tracks require calculus, differential equations and linear algebra. A Bachelors in computer science will serve you well and keep you employed, but an associates in computer programming will also help you get work.

The only things you really need to know are how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and maybe a little basic algebra. Many programmers go through their entire career with having to do barely any math at all.> Do note, however, that the answer is a bit different if you are interested in getting a degree in Computer Science. Many universities or colleges will have specific prerequisites you need to fulfill before you can either enter the major or graduate (calculus classes, etc). And, since Computer Science is, to a certain degree, applied mathematics, you will almost certainly end up learning about discrete math, writing proofs and other similar topics while earning your degree. You do not need to be inherently good at math in order to learn these topics (or any mathematical topic, really), but having some mathematical maturity certainly wouldn't hurt, and would probably smooth the learning process.",

I started with BASIC, PASCAL, C way before OOP became mainstream.In the beginning, I couldn't make heads nor tails of OOP and it took me quite long and many failed attempts.Maybe, moving on to Arduino with its C++ can help, or a complete, 100% cut to a different language, like Java with the MOOC [Java Programming](https://java-programming.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki might help. Another thing that might help is Python with its very easy to understand object model.OOP requires a different way of thinking - kind of a rewiring of the brain to look at things differently. In OOP it's more a dialog between the individual objects than the sequential command patterns we are used to in procedural programming. In OOP you more or less \"talk\" to the objects. You ask them to do things for you. You ask them to change their internal state if needed (yes, the \"immutability\" topic will now come up and I might anger a few people with my mutable approach).My breakthrough with OOP was when I got into my current job in Industrial Automation working with our DCS (Distributed Control System) and with our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems. There, everything was object oriented with inheritance and I started to see the advantages and how OOP works. Our SCADA even goes further in the direction of being an Entity-Component system where each Entity can have many components with many different aspects, but that leads too far (it's basically just some very extended form of composition, not inheritance).> it often takes me hours what my developer colleagues can do in minutes.This only boils down to practice, ample practice.You will feel stuck and dumbfounded for quite some time but you will eventually reach the point where things fall into place and you all of a sudden understand. It's not as complicated as it seems.Don't give up! Keep going!",

It's a natural instinct if you spend most of your time close to the machine itself, but it's actually disruptive to learning HLLs.HLLs are designed to be somewhat implementation-agnostic; they have rules, and they trust that some intermediary layer will implement a thing that makes those rules go. Getting bogged down in how that intermediary layer might work (\\*) generally will impede your understanding of the higher-level layer. This is a skill I had to learn when learning SML/NJ: the fine art of no longer worrying about how the language represents a function, trusting \"It just does,\" and learning the language independent of its implementation. The language is just rules and math; you could implement it with pencil and paper if you had the time and patience. Once you have the language under your belt, you can start caring about how it was implemented on a Von Neumann architecture with registers, RAM, and the like.(\\*) C++ might be an exception that proves this rule; there are actually quite a few features of C++ where the reason they work that way is \"It made it a lot easier to write the compiler\" or \"Look, this language is old, and older computers didn't have enough RAM to do things like lookahead compilation or multiple passes, so it is what it is.\"",

The most close synonims for an *object* is: record, structure, set of variables, and now comes the difference: with the *methods* (functions, subroutines, procedures) operating on it.If you ever worked with files on Unix-like systems or Windows, you've already familiar with OOP. You create a File \"object\" by *open()* or *creat()*, which you can refer with the *file handle*, which these function returned. The variables of File is hidden for you, we have some idea how it looks, but we don't care as far we can call *read()*, *write()* methods to do what we want with the file, then we can *drop* or *destruct* it by calling *close()*.In OOP, instead of file handle, you got a pointer (sometimes called reference), and you can \"call\" methods. Now comes the part where you'll understand the whole shit:`read(file_object, &buffer, length)`is same as`file_object.read(&buffer, lenght)`In Python, you can call a method both way, although, highly recommended to use `obj.method()` variant.And again, as elctronics, programming is not *difficult*, but *simple and* *complex*. OOP is just as *difficult* like pull-up resistor: if you know struct, function, memory, OOP is easy-peasy, and if you know current, instable state, DCC and GND, pull-up resistor is straighfoward... but try these two simple things to explain someone who knows nothing about programming and electronics.",

That's actually great!I've come across an extremely nice real world application for OOP: a Raspberry Pi or Arduino Car.The car had different types of motors - stepper motors for the wheels, servos for the steering, camera, ultrasound, etc. The programming of the car was done in Python and they made classes for the different types of motors. The classes were written in such a way that the user/programmer facing part (we call it the API) was the same, so no matter whether the actual motor was a stepper or a servo, the programmer could always address it in the same way. This is a case where OOP shines. You don't need to worry what's \"behind the scene\" and only have a standardized API to work with. Also, you only need to add the individual *instances*, the actual motors, parameterize them (left and right motors naturally had different rotation directions) and you were good to go. Add another motor? No problem. Just create another instance of the respective type, tell the object where the I/O is connected, and you're good to go.Especially in the connection with hardware (and that's why you already got Arduino suggested from another commenter), OOP is good use and fun. Takes a lot of the specific programming away and has the advantage that, no matter how many specific instances you need, you only test the class once and it works.",

For a beginner building terrain gen, gameplay systems, engine-level stuff, C++ will feel more straightforward and less “fighting the language.”Short version: start with C++ for game dev fundamentals, then Rust later if you want safety and modern design.

It's syntax is newer, and the language itself is much newer, which introduces a plenty of benefits. Firstly, it doesn't have the burden of having as much layers of backwards compatibility - C++ is filled with legacy code, and deprecated methods. Rust, on the other hand, is much fresher in that sense.Okay, I realized I am probably going on a tangent, so here's the list of the stuff I love about Rust over C++:* Beautiful error messages* Immutability by default.* Less verbose syntax (try to read the c++ std library, you'll get what I mean)* **THE ABSOLUTE BEST** tooling - `cargo` is really just a life saver. Don't even get me started on installing dependencies.One notable flaw I can point out is the borrow checker, since it can be confusing and you have to sacrifice some convenience in order to keep the code safe (but at least Rust doesn't allow unsafe behavior unless you explicitly want it)",

I dont want to discourage the idea, but you should be advised that the comparative lack of tooling and ecosystem might overshadow the other benefits of Rustby contrast C++ is native to the unreal engine and already integrates beautifully with its visual scripting language, unreal blueprints.

System topics and real-world tradeoffs mattered more than I expected.If there’s one thing I’d share: you don’t need to rush interviews, but doing a few earlier can be really useful.

However, as I've said many times to many people, programming is not about any particular language, it's about learning to think like a programmer. Methodical, structured, analytical thinking and problem solving skills. Those skills are universally applicable across all programming languages, and, frankly, throughout life as well.So you hone some skills and write a bunch of programs and learn how to program and think like a programmer.

Learning to code is a \\*\\*journey\\*\\*. But thankfully, there are loads of resources out there that can help you choose your path! So, it's okay if you're not totally committed to building a career, my advice would be to measure the amount of resource you devote until you know that.You can teach yourself to code without access to any paid content or courses. It's a long road, it takes a lot of dedication and frustration, and drive to go find the answers yourself. But I'm not sure there's ever been a skill so thoroughly documented online as software development. Software developers largely love to share what they've built, and the very fine details of how it works. Youtube is full of tutorials. There are plenty of websites that will explain different programming languages or tools to you. Github is a massive source of real code that drives real projects which you can read and download and involve yourself in the discussions of. If you're looking into a career, I recommend finding a university within your state with an accredited computer science program. The degree matters a lot when it comes to job prospects unfortunately. I also think it's a medium quick way to actually develop serious development skills. I know for me personally, I was on the self-taught path for many years and just very stuck. It was my degree program with the help of professors and peers that finally unlocked things for me and got me over the tough parts of learning development. You'll find no shortage of universities that offer remote degree programs in computer science as well. This is an expensive path, but its the most reliable path to a career.If you're not sure what you want yet, and you're just out to explore maybe try joining some community projects. Hackathons, game jams, competitions. Even if you don't feel like you're ready, just be honest about your level and express that you're there to learn and you're bound to find loads of people just like you who would be glad to learn along-side you. That's a great way to 'explore' and get a sense of what actual development is like even before you have the skills yourself. Even if it means you're joining a discord call just to watch and hear how more experienced developers are working it'll give you a sense of what its actually like once you're in the middle of things.I won't recommend any particular course or source of information personally. I've found that everyone seems to click with different materials.

Maybe do a slight expansion on it, like remembering the last result.Then iteratively add a little bit of complexity.2) a to-do list console app, that allows the user to write a to-do and saves it to a file so that the to-do exists on the next run. Also let the user mark off a to-do. Again, maybe extend it slightly, like allowing the user to view marked off to-dos.3) now maybe you want a simple console app that gets data from an API, instead of a saved file. There's APIs for everything, pick a free one that interests you (many people choose a weather API, for me, it was a football one, maybe you want a recipe one) and output some information in the terminal. This is also particularly good because you have to read the APIs documentation4) now you get to branch off what complexity you want to add. Maybe you want to figure out how to automate tasks. You could try and save data from the API above into a file at regular intervals. Maybe you want to add a graphical user interface, so you look up how to display the API data, which could mean in a web browser, or in a mobile app, or a desktop app, whatever interests you. Maybe you want to get data from multiple APIs and store it in a way that you can easily check what data you want, so you create a database that gets populated by various APIs.Start with the commonly suggested ones, expand on them slightly, iteratively add a little bit of complexity you haven't tackled before for every project.

My first job was taking design drawings for specific tools and using a touch pad and the drawing overlaying the touch pad to enter coordinates. When complete compile those coordinates into HPGL language and feed that into an HP CNC machine. I wrote that in HP PASCAL in 1981. I had known the manager of the tool department through the church I went to and he had seen my work on the CPM machine that was donated to our church. I was doing work on the CPM machine for free because I wanted to create computer games on it and I had to promise to do something productive on it while I played games. I wrote a rolodex type program for church memberships in basic. Over the years I've worked with almost every programming language known to man. What made learning a different programming language easier was learning a different spoken language to train your brain to think in that spoken language. I speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, German enough to order in a restaurant, and some basic Mandarin. This helps train your brain to easily switch between different programming languages as well. To ease your mind, when I sleep at night, I now dream in C#.",

If you want to store more geometric data than just the points this may not be the best solution, but I think it would still work well enough.Each position in the array would represent a cross point of a longitude and a latitude line.Something like```Point[][][] sphere = [[ [], [], [] ], // Latitude 0, longitude 0,1,2[ [], [], [] ], // Latitude 1, longitude 0,1,2[ [], [], [] ] // Latitude 2, longitude 0,1,2]```Of course, you would define the sphere something more like```Point[][][] sphere = Point[3][3][1]```Then if you wanted to reference a specific point, it's just an array lookup. Traversing the array can be done by storing the current lat and lon and then incrementing/decrmenting them, with wrapping logic as needed.",

You just start to get a feel for what good patterns are as well as what goes wrong when bad patterns are followed.But as for more concrete tips I'd say you want to keep your API /API layer as agnostic as possible from the implementation details - your API layer should ideally be focused on defining the contract and routing the logic to internal code to fulfill the contract. You don't want to expose internal details, raw primative implementations, or anything not relevant to the contract. This is both so external clients have a clean interface to work with as well as minimizing the blast radius of any changes to the workings of the API itself. Yeah you can implement a key value store with a dictionary but if you abstract it behind a data provider then your API layer doesn't care if you're using a dictionary or a database or a cache, and you can swap between them easily.In addition anything that's exposed to the public internet should have protection against anything that could possibly go wrong, malicious or otherwise. This includes sanitizing inputs, protection against injection attacks, rate limiting, proper status code handling etc...",

There's no fast path.Dunning-Kruger's seminal work principally has to do with how we internalize and comprehend information: known | unknown known | known ----------------- known | unknown unknown | unknownIt's not their original chart but it has all the right quadrants... Mine makes a C.You start in the bottom-right where you don't even know THAT you don't know something. There's shit rocket scientists contemplate I haven't the slightest fucking clue. I'm not a rocket scientist. I can't possibly know. Can't even fathom.Then there's shit you know you don't know. I don't know how to implement a Monte-Carlo simulation. I know I don't know that. I know Monte-Carlo is used to march approximations toward a correct result with sufficient precision. I've just never had to do it.Then there's what you know you know - this is active recall stuff. Rote memory. I know a closure is a poor mans object. I can repeat that all day. It's not very functional memory because I have to actively think about it with intent. I can write a closure, but it's not intuitive to me. I make mistakes. I can't see the forest for the trees.But I have a shitload of unknown knowns - shit I know, but don't actively think about. We're beyond active recall. This isn't rote - this is intuition. You can FORGET you know something, and yet that knowledge passively informs you. When you see me work, I can go straight to code and produce something. Hundreds, THOUSANDS of decisions are being made not because I'm considering all this stuff in the moment, but because I've considered it all over the last 37 years. I'm not making a decision, I've already made it.

When you've fully internalized and integrated your knowledge, you can speak on it as an authority. You won't be quoting a book or resource, you'll be saying it yourself, and you'll hardly think about how you're even doing it.So then how do you learn? It's not just time. You can sit on your ass for years and not learn a god damn thing - especially if you don't have compelling work or don't care. It's not JUST experience - but the quality of the experience. You don't learn from successes, but failures.

You're already gaining self-awareness, seeing more than trees, but the forest for what it is. To accelerate your experiences - you need to have more of them; finish that project. Validate inputs - that's easy as shit. Use data structures, that makes it easier to validate your inputs. Add concurrency, this will apply pressure upon you to design a more consistent architecture.You didn't do these things in your demo because you don't have the intuition to do them.

Some of it is solid foundational theory. The rest of it is the history of brilliant quirky, strange people thinking strange thoughts. They didn’t have any idea we profs would try to teach, and you students would try to learn this stuff. So take it with a grain of salt. I bit the bullet and got through it.So, young Padawan, take it with a grain of salt. Keep plugging away. Bite the bullet, dive into the cloud of unknowing. You will get it. Also, my life as a programmer has, since then, gone through lots of cycles of “WTF? This makes no sense at all” and then understanding. You would be wise to get used to your emotions when you dive into that cloud of unknowing. I’ve struggled with that all my working life. I think it’s part of the creative process of programming. I’m also a cyclist. This cloud of unknowing is like being halfway up the mountain and thinking f—-k this, I’m never going to make it. And then I make it to the summit and get to bomb downhill.

I know plenty of friends of mine who also didn't do too great in school for CS but they went on to have swe jobs at top companies. In school you don't really have a lot of time and you can't put in as much focus or effort into it as you would like. With work it's not like that; you have one thing to focus on, makes things a lot more manageable. At that point what really shines through is your persistence; persistence is the key thing in programming, at least in my eyes. I will say that it is hard to decide whether it's right for you or not. I guess the answer is, when you are doing it are you focused on it and are willing to sacrifice things for it? If yes, I think that's enough. Don't let school kill your confidence. If you are drawn to programming, that's a very good strength, you just need persistence, diligence, and curiosity to carry you further",

You should evaluate your life, what you can handle, and what you prefer. All advice will fall short and even you won't know whether staying/switching/dropping out was the best. If I had to make a similar decision now, I'd switch, but only because I lost much more time than I expected. The mental distress is really what you should sort out though. It doesn't necessarily go away if you quit your pursuit of programming, and may stay with you after you're done with education. Don't be afraid to consult a professional. Of course also don't fall for the endless therapy loop, but some people do benefit medical help (e.g me) without much side or long term effects.",

My point is university is trash. Sometimes they're phenomenal and the best places to learn on the planet but more often than not they are a waste of money. Id encourage you to find trust in yourself as you sound quite creative and intelligent from the bit I know of you. Ill also bet you just simply learn 100x better from practice and self directed discovery and curiosity than a broken theoretical course.",

Data analytics is definitely a skill that’s in demand, and you don’t need a ton of theory or expensive courses to get started.Here’s a roadmap that works for a lot of people breaking into analytics:Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera — audit for freeKhan Academy / YouTube playlists on Excel & basic statsSQLZoo for interactive SQL practiceNext step is to focus on building something that hones your skill. Try analyzing something you care about (budgeting, fitness, etc.) Document your work — even simple visuals or insights go a long way. This will lead to something called “portfolio” like a folder of all your project work Analytics folks use Excel / Google Sheet, SQL, Python with pandas, R, Tableau/PowerBI If you want something practical and project-oriented that walks you through real exercises in data analytics, this book below is designed for beginners and emphasizes hands-on work over pure theory:AI-Powered Data Analysis for Beginnershttps://a.co/d/8v7IwjKThe book offers good ground in programming, math and stats, analytics mindsets and methodologies, using AI, with lots of examples. Many of the prompts that’s discussed are fully optimized to use lowest tokens. Full disclosure: I’m the author of the book I mentioned — sharing it because it’s designed for similar use casesNo pressure — you don’t need to buy it to start. But some folks like having a structured guide as they work through exercises and build confidence.",

Or as [the \"monad tutorial fallacy\" blog post puts it](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/):> let us suppose that Joe’s metaphor is that Monads are Like Burritos. Here is where Joe badly misinterprets his own thought process: “Of course!” Joe thinks. “It’s all so simple now. The key to understanding monads is that they are Like Burritos. If only I had thought of this before!” The problem, of course, is that if Joe HAD thought of this before, it wouldn’t have helped: the week of struggling through details was a necessary and integral part of forming Joe’s Burrito intuition, not a sad consequence of his failure to hit upon the idea sooner.Learning is also a good mix of strategies that are entirely general to the human species across any domain, and tactics that will work for you specifically in some specific situation. If you find some great way for you to learn concept A, it doesn't necessarily mean that it'll work for some other learner, or that it'll work as well for concept B.What you're asking about is general enough that we can only give very general learning advice, like [Oláfur Waage's _Learning Rust the wrong way_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL9LANLg5EA) (more about learning in general with Rust as a specific example of something to learn).",

Don't expect to be done with this in minutes or hours. It will be more likely several days since you need to form memories of the critical details and memories of how they work together. I often find that sometime after a study session questions start popping in my head, as if my brain's background processes keep working on understanding the concept and notice what information is still missing. I then look that information up too, regardless of how irrelevant it seems.

Gaining some foundational knowledge about how it works3. Applying that knowledge and thereby gaining a better understanding4. Encountering problems/new information5. Asking questions about the problem/information6. Repeating steps 3 through 5 foreverThe only thing that really ever changes, aside from the specific concept, is the complexity/breadth of it, and by complexity, I really just mean the amount of information. When something is more complex, it takes longer to make sense of the individual parts and make it all make sense together, and it makes it harder to know which questions to ask to gain clarification or find information that you're missing, but it's still the same process. If you're able to memorize the information and regurgitate it on command, but don't feel like you really understand what it means, then you've most likely been skipping over steps 3 and 5, meaning you're just encountering new information and trying to commit it to memory without *using* it.If you don't understand how something works, try to write something that uses it, and as you run into issues, start Googling away to find the information that you need. If you encounter more things you don't understand while Googling up info, follow up on that as well until you feel like you actually understand what's going on. Keep doing that until you can apply that concept/knowledge effectively and can reliably predict what's going to happen.",

Sure, from one side, you'll be learning a bit less than you'd learn during your Bachelor studies as your Master studies will take less time. From the other side, you have already covered probably a lot when it comes to Databases related courses in Bachelor program. Still, a Master degree for non-CS people should teach you various topics that will be covered also in CS Bachelor program. So, you can cover that gap.I personally think that you won't get such quality from learning online. All these bootcamps and online tutorials are more like for beginners. I have checked some and they do not cover more complex topics one will learn during his university studies. They won't force you to work on your thesis project where you have to come up with something more unique than another \"X management system\" that you'd get from bootcamps. University studies will also give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects in your Github. When going by online tutorials and online bootcamps your imagination will be limited. They will tell you to make a TODO app. You will make a TODO app. Nobody will use that TODO app.If Master studies cost a lot for you then you can try some online learning and see how it works out for you. Your current career definitely will be a bonus point. But if you see that you are not landing a Junior developer or a Junior data engineer role (forget jumping into a Mid-level or into a Senior-level position) then consider going for a degree.",

I don’t see much value in inventing my own Netflix or re-implementing an HTTP library, especially when AI can do that with a single prompt.Because of this, I sometimes feel like I didn’t manage to get into the industry in time — and at the same time, that the industry itself might soon look very different from what it is now.And on top of that, there’s real life: buying a home, raising kids, all the usual responsibilities.I guess overall I’m just worried about how to live this life the right way.",

AI will be/is important and will be/is generating this stuff super easy and quick, but it’s not quite that simple…..A few months ago I decided to dive into Identity in ASP.NET (basically built in .NET authentication) and .NET does so much of the heavy lifting. It abstracts all the details away, allowing you to just focus on plugging it in, creating your policies and then focusing on your business logic instead of infrastructure.However…. I sort of quickly realised, that if you don’t understand how it works internally, the abstractions don’t really help or make it any better. You still have to call the relevant methods in the relevant order, and understand what’s going on in order to get the most from it. The abstractions, just save you having to write your implementations… it’s not a substitute for understanding how it works.I see AI as the same. It’s an abstraction. We ask it to generate code, it does. That saves us time and speeds up development, but if we’re unable to understand the inner workings, we won’t be able to get the most out of it. The best way to learn is to build. So build these solutions yourself, and understand how these work not because you’ll be building these yourself in the future but because it is imperative you understand the inner workings to get the most from AI generated code….",

If you don’t know what’s happening under the hood, you can’t really use them well — whether it’s [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Identity or AI-generated code.My struggle is more about the next step after that understanding. Even if I go deep, build things properly, and really learn how they work internally — will there actually be an employer willing to take a chance on someone without formal work experience? In many cases, resumes are filtered out automatically before a human even sees them if you don’t have 3–5 years of relevant experience.Part of me knows that building something unique, finishing a real project, and showing it publicly might be a way to bypass the traditional job search. That also takes time, just in a different way. And realistically, 6 months isn’t a long time at all — maybe even 1–2 years isn’t.So for now, I’m trying to treat programming as a serious hobby and long-term investment, and see where it leads. No matter how the industry changes, I still believe that understanding programming fundamentals will become almost mandatory, and once you have that, switching languages or technologies is much easier.I’ve also been living outside my home country for 6 years, and while things are generally fine, being a foreigner adds extra friction to everything — internships, official employment, even simple life stuff.

Excel and Libre Office Calc both use RAM to load spreadsheets, and get real squirrely when the spreadsheet is too big for RAM.You could also try Google Sheets. Another approach might be to convert your xlsx file to a csv file, which is plain text. Then use a giant-file-capable text editor like notepad++ to break the csv file into more manageable chunks. Sheets can do that conversion. If you can load the file into Calc, it probably can too.If I were involved with your org ( as a donor or whatever ) I would offer to do this for you.

In my travels I have found Microsoft with c# wants to do everything and go wants to give you the most control. There are lots of in-betweens.

It’s primarily a Dependency Injection framework with extra modules for web, databases, etc.A big idea behind dependency injection is you don’t create the objects yourself, someone else does and you simply request what you need. The reason this evolved is because when you do “new SomeClass()” within Java it’s very difficult to test it the class that contains it.Imagine you created a CreditCard service within your Controller, when you want to unit test the controller you want a FakeCredirCard service, but if you did “new” it’s very hard to swap it out.Spring lets you annotate both the real CreditCard service and the fake one, then you dynamically get the one that fits the scope (ex: test)",

They do not analyze the whole picture but have a tunnel vision.So, having said that, go for programming if you want to do that. First, learn to make stuff without AI. Then, when you can already build stuff on your own, learn to use the AI (and also how to NOT use the AI). AI should not fill a gap of knowledge, for you, but it should just speed up these tasks that you would know how to do on your own as well. Like this you'll be able to assess the output that AI gives.

As someone else suggested, maybe spend 30 mins a day on a problem until you solve it or run out of time; then learn what the solution is and note down the problem.When I study for interviews I like to keep track of all the problems I get stuck on and need to look at the solution. Then a few weeks later I come back to the same problem and retry it. If I still can't solve it then I review the solution and it stays on the list until i can solve it on my own.",

When your main function calls Pat\\_Divide with an array of exactly 1 element, you should be able to see that the `if` statement is true and then Pat\\_Divide immediately returns with only that one element.When your main function calls Pat\\_Divide with an array of exactly 3 elements, more imaginary people get involved:* Pat\\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\\_Divide and the other list to Alice\\_Divide.* Bob\\_Divide gets one element, immediately sees that the `if` statement is true, and immediately hands back that one element.* Alice\\_Divide, on the other hand, gets handed a list of 2 elements, and so is unfairly forced to do more work. * Alice\\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists (of 1 element each) and hands those lists off to Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide. * Mildred and Leroy act just like Pad\\_Divide did when Pat\\_Divide was given a list of 1 element, and each immediately hand back that 1 element. * Alice\\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) produces a sorted list of 2 elements. * Alice\\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\\_Divide.* Then Pat\\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)* Finally, Pat\\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.When your main() function calls Pat\\_Divide with a very long array, even more imaginary people get involved, but we don't really need to know all their names:* Pat\\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\\_Divide and the other list to Alice\\_Divide.* Bob\\_Divide returns a sorted list of all the items in the left list (by involving other yet-unnamed family members).* Alice\\_Divide does something similar to what she did before: * Alice\\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists and hands those lists off to Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide. * Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide divide their individual lists into even smaller pieces, and hand them off to other family members, who eventually help them produce sorted versions of those lists. * Alice\\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) combines the 2 sorted lists into a single sorted list. * Alice\\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\\_Divide.* Then Pat\\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)* Finally, Pat\\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.(Optionally, you may later learn multitaking techniques, so that Mildred, Bob's side of the family, and Leroy can each work on different parts of the problem simultaneously. ).Good luck trying to explain recursion to the next person!",

Take a selection of playing cards, and put on the table in front of you, make sure they aren't sorted, but still layed out in a nice uniform \"array\".2. Then split the array in two halves - moving them a bit towards you (down the table)3. Split the two halves in another two halves each, so you have four groups of playing cards, and move them a bit further down.4. Continue until you have a number of individual cards layed out with space between them - it still looks exactly like the original array, and feels a bit silly at this point.5. But now, merge the two cards to the left, in order from lowest to highest, and move them a bit up the table - do the same for all the rest, so you have a collection of groups of two cards, each group sorted.6. Then merge the groups two and two, moving them a bit up the table, so you end up with a collection of groups of four cards, all sorted.7. And continue doing that, until you have only a single list of cards, all sorted ...It is important that you actually do it, and not just try to imagine it in your mind!Every time you move down the table, it is another call to the \"divide\" function, and every time you move up, it is a return from the latest \"divide\" function. Note how you can't return from a divide function, before you returned from the next divide-function that was called! This is what recursion is all about, and it is mindboggling to think about - but it works :)",

Unless you're in the gaming industry, where C++ is huge.Of course, all this is a very over-simplified generalization. C++ can do most things C# can as well, and the situation really depends on the company you work for.On the other hand, C# is more general-use, just like Java.What's clear is that, in developer surveys over the past 20 years, C# consistently ranks as one of the most satisfying languages to use, while C++ usually has a poor reputation (it even has an unofficial mascot of a diseased rat with its leg blown off).

You get access to the courses for life, and the better rated ones are generally quite good. As for making is stick, building things on your own is 100% the best way to get there.

It's a concept of how to handle data at runtime by creating objects and then performing actions on those objects.A method or function are the actions that you can use on those objects.A class is a description of an object, at runtime a constructor creates that object in memory, and the instance is the runtime object that was created by the constructor.You need to think in two ways - the code as a dry written thing, and then the multiple real things created when you run that code.Like the Cake class.At runtime you pass in (as arguments) butter, flour, sugar, eggs, vanilla flavour to the Constructor, which then makes an instance of a cake - say a plainSpongeCake.You then call the methods or functions of that Cake class.So you call addIcing(), add sprinkles(), etc.For your next cake, you instantiate the same class but this time you add in chocolate instead of vanilla and then call the same methods. Voilà, you now have a richChocolateCake too.You can now call the cutSlice() method, and that works on both cakes.That's pretty much OOP in a nutshell.You could make an interface class and have the cake class call that. You just put the addIcing() etc method signatures in that class, as you only really use them to guarantee that particular methods will be available in your cake class.Lots of languages use the principles of OOP so it's very much worth learning!Once you've mastered OOP and are getting to grips with Java, then you can start looking at using patterns in the code such as MVC and Singleton.Good luck! Stick with it!",

Or I'd have an idea for something, and I'd follow different tutorials for each part of it (e.g. one tutorial on how to connect to an API, another tutorial on how to save data in a db, then put the pieces together to build a scraper). Now that I'm much more experienced... I do exactly the same thing. I built a tool recently for orchestrating restic backups in kubernetes using CRDs and it was the same process. Follow a tutorial to read/write kubernetes objects from python, follow a tutorial on installing CRDs in a cluster, etc.. put the pieces together and go.

Couldn't find a way to implement my chosen approach. I tried a couple days, but then left the exercise and kept revisiting it regularly.

In some ways, they are similar, so the choice comes down to your preference.

It's one of those (mostly) low-pressure desk jobs that you do to make a stable income while you do what you really want to do in your free time. That said, it will contribute close to nothing when it comes to helping a career in game dev. The knowledge will 100% be helpful, but it won't help you get a programming job unless it's ultra entry-level (and 99% of game dev jobs aren't entry level).It is an excellent job to have for paying bills though, and depending on the environment/level of independence, it can give you lots of time both at home and at your desk to learn programming independently. As long as I get my tasks done each day, I can pretty safely bring my laptop to the office to study/work on my own projects most of the time.I will say though, \"building a multiplayer online game\" is a very, very ambitious goal shared by many aspiring game devs who don't know what it actually takes to do something like that. To the point that it's a known red flag/meme if a dev tries to crowdfund an MMO. If you intend to make games by yourself, your scope needs to be reduced \\*drastically,\\* and you'll not only learn more but be more satisfied with the process if you focus on making small, simple games. If you want to make something bigger, then find friends/collaborators to work with-- particularly people who are willing to work on something for the fun of it instead of trying to turn it into a business. It's very, very difficult to \"start a game studio,\" so you want to start by making games for fun and learning to enjoy the process of making them before you \\*ever\\* think about monetizing. Basically don't think about monetizing/turning it into a business until you \\*have business.\\* And if you want to get into programming for an existing studio, be prepared to spend years and years doing contract work to build a reputation, and to navigate a highly competitive field where you could be let go at a drop of a hat.Make small games. Fail faster. Fall in love with actually making the games, not the idea of making games. And know that game dev, especially solo, is a very multidisciplinary endeavor where each discipline within it can take years and years to master. Pace yourself.Source: IT person of 6 years who gave up game dev because I found out I don't actually enjoy the process of programming after even more years of trying and going to school for it. What I discovered was that I actually wanted to tell stories, and I didn't need to force myself to be a programmer/artist/designer/writer/composer unicorn to do that. I could just write stories instead.",

You need basic ones, and more specialised ones for programming certain things (e.g. writing a networking protocol will require you understand networking), but they diverge very early on into generalist vs specialist. IT generally isn't really a path to (games) programming work per se, it's more a path to help desk, ops, sysadmin, database admin, infra, devOps, etc. If you want to work as a programmer, providing you can already operate a computer to do basic file admin, web browsing, text editing, etc., you should just start programming right away and focus on that. If you need to earn money right away and IT jobs are all you can get right now then it's better than starving... We very much need IT people to keep the software we write up and running.For games and multiplayer online games specifically you'll need to have good overall programming skills and pattern awareness to implement the gameplay logic. Plus OS awareness, networking, database design/implementation for the online part. Plus a good understanding of 2D or 3D graphics as applicable for the rendering part. Then there's all the art...If you use a modern game engine you can mostly get away with just doing the art and use their abstractions for most of the other stuff. Still very much need to know most of the above though, just not as much as if you were to implement it.\"multiplayer online game\" is very ambitious, so a very rough idea of what your expectations starting from zero should be: A small/toy 2D game you could build within the next few months.

As you've discovered, checking pixel-level collisions like this is a bit performance intensive.Most games don't check collisions this way. Instead, like \"You can't move through walls\" or \"If an enemy touches you, you die\" are determined by representing both the character and the object as simple shapes. Boxes and circles are the most popular (often the sides of the box are parallel to the coordinate axes which makes the math super simple). A \"capsule\" shape is also quite easy (it's just the union of a box and two circles). Triangles involve more math to program, but may be helpful if you want arbitrary rotation or more complicated shapes (any shape is approximately a polygon; any polygon can be broken into triangles).Often the hitbox really is, quite literally, a box!",

The point is not allowed to go into the square.You don't need to check 400 things to tel if the player has gone into the square.You don't need to check 80(-ish) things, either.You should be able to tell if the player is inside the square with 4 if statements and no loops.

        "body": "First off coding is work, it doesn't produce adrenaline but rather headaches, drowsiness and fatigue. Lets not 3 Mile Island the world here, C or Python, should not cause somebody to feel slow and dumb. So the first thing that comes to mind right now is to choose one, which if you are learning is C.Not to date myself but I first got interested in computers before the S100 bus debuted, so maybe 13 or 14 at the time. For years all I could do is read Byte and when I could find it Dr.Dobbs. It wasn't until the Vic-20 came out, 1980, that I could actually afford a computer and that ViC 20 was barely usable. So for a good number of years my interests where satisfied by reading what I could.It actually took me a while to get to college and that was where my first formal training started and unlearning the VIC 20. At the time the school had Sun workstations so that was like a step into the future. So what motivated me, well the place I was working for was paying the bill. Since I didn't want to go hungry anymore it was a good idea to keep working. Now that said not a programmer per say but use the knowledge almost everyday before working. So staying sharp with software was important. However that required me to keep writing code, sometimes toy programs and in a couple of cases finding bugs for an Open Source project. At work I had some focus on CNC and PLC controllers which is always a challenge, beyond spread sheets and Python code. So even if work was NOT as a programmer, I was heavily involved in automation.Now that I'm retired the motivations are different. For example to keep track of my investments, I have spread sheets of stock portfolios. Now on the surface one might laugh at spreadsheet programming because it looks to be simple but I'd have to say there is as much depth there as their is with Python. The motivation is that I need to keep this organized and understand where my next meal is coming from.If you want to stay sharp though, who doesn't and frankly at this age you work at it, yo need to do more than stock portfolio management. To that end I keep a couple of hobbies going and use those interest to drive software development there. This is the key, use it or loose it. If you want to have any usable skill at all with respect to software you need to stay in the game. Motivation is sometimes hard to come by or even keep, so you really need to integrate programming into projects that you are interested in. Programming itself can also be a motivator, simply learning about new languages can motivate some. I didn't even know that C3 existed until yesterday for example and it actually looks interesting. For most of us though we need that outside pull to start a new project.Lets say you are into bicycling and those little trip computers look to be so handy. That lust could be the motivator for a DIY trip computer for a bicycle. Going DIY means it can work exactly as you expect, in every way it is yours. The challenges are the motivator. What are those challenges (just a few):1. Embedded project.2. Battery operated (maybe solar) and thus needs to be efficient3. Small custom Printed Circuit board.4. Limited screen size and I'o possibilities.5. Case size limitations.6. Limited program and data space.7. Limited programming languages due to microprocessor.In any event the project becomes the challenge.",

Your compiler is smart enough to figure out this kind of \"strength reduction\" as an optimization.

So if you want to use the term \"functionally retarded\", you've come to the right person. Don't worry, I'm not offended.You do not need to know a lot of mathematics in order to succeed in the field. C is not significantly more math-intensive than any other language. Things like pointers are tricky for beginners, but those are tricky for beginners regardless of whether they're good at math or not.Modulus is something that will come up in any programming language. It's usually used to determine if a number is evenly divisible by another number. It's pretty easy, conceptually. Divide two numbers. Discard everything before the decimal point. That's modulo. Like, 9 % 3: That's 9/3, or 3.0. Discard the 3. You're left with 0.0. It's evenly divisible.Now do the same thing, 9 % 4. I'm pulling out my calculator for this part. That's 2.25. Discard the leading 2. You're left with 25. Not evenly divisible. In most cases, that's as far as you'll need to go with it. Some sub-disciplines within software are very math-heavy, such as graphics/games programming and AI/machine learning. But that's mostly at the very deepest, darkest fringes, and not something you will likely encounter outside of specialized roles that will highlight the need for deeper math skills.

You'll also naturally develop your math skills as you progress as a programmer.I will now offer rambling unsolicited advice on learning math based on my own experience. I believe many people that believe they are bad at math are encountering two related problems that make it difficult to identify or articulate why learning math is harder for them relative to others. The first is missing prerequisite knowledge, the second is study methods that do not work or are inappropriate for them. The exception is for some cases where neurodevelopment and learning disabilities create hard limits, however in many cases these can be managed by adjusting your study methods (as was the case for me, as I have ADHD and dyspraxia).Learning math and learning to program are very similar in that there are foundational concepts/skills you need to learn or develop in a particular order before you can learn more advanced content. When I got to university I had a lot of gaps in my knowledge; elementary stuff that compounded from my early education through to high school (which I ended up dropping out of). This conceptual debt made it harder to progress over time, while others only had to learn one new concept to solve a problem, I might need 5 or 6, which snowballs very quickly. This also made the traditional lecture -> tutorial -> homework learning pipeline ineffective because it assumes you have certain prerequisite knowledge and they cant/won't help you identify specific concepts needed to catch up.I found it much easier to learn at home following youtube videos (I highly recommend organic chemistry tutor), khan academy lessons, resources on the r/learnmath mega thread, or good textbooks with clear progression and references to related previous topics. These formats are easy to pause if something is too advanced, giving you the opportunity to go learn prerequisites as you need, before returning to the original problem. To practice I would follow videos of worked examples, print 50-100 problems to work through, then mark my own answers to find if/where I was going wrong. I'd also return to reattempt packets of questions later. Now I have the ability to not only deal with difficult math problems day to day, but when I can't I have learned how to learn to solve things. Good luck, and apologies for the wall of text!TLDR; Don't worry. You probably aren't bad at math, missing prerequisite knowledge and/or study methods that don't work for you might be falsely giving you that impression.",

Write a program to check what's going on?> I'am functionally retarded when it comes to mathematics.Nope. Stop that. Math builds upward upon foundational concepts. If you miss one of those concepts or don't fully understand it, you're screwed. The concepts taken slowly aren't that bad. Don't be afraid of taking a step back and reviewing what you thought already knew.Math is a lot like programming in this respect. There's parroting a concept and then there's applying a concept. Understanding programming ideas and actually writing a program are two very different things.> Is C a language I should keep trying to learnSure. It's fun. That said, it's one of the more primitive options. If you feel another language has something more to offer you, that's your call. However, you're learning both programming and a programming language. The language is not the hard part. Once you wrap your head around programming, the language is just an implementation detail.> or would it be wise to simply use another language that isnt as math intensive?There isn't one. The math you run into in C is to be found in any other language. Some languages will let you get away with being more sloppy, but I'm not sure if that's better or worse for you.> I don't have very little foundation with mathematics beyond basic +,-,*,/ problems.Again, you generally don't need it. Also, unlike on a math quiz, you have a computer to check your work. You might think the formula you wrote will offer a certain result, but the computer will let you know if you're right.> I'm struggling pretty hard to get through the math related portions.I'm the programmer who sucks at math, which is why I tend to respond verbosely to things like this. Programming really doesn't require math. A mathematician will say it's all math, but that's their problem. Programming requires a way of thinking and, amusingly, some folks who are very good at math kind of suck at it. I hate seeing folks with math frustration allow that to gatekeep their possible programming glory.I got a minor in computer science, where the only higher math course required was calculus 1. I took it twice, passed the second time. I also tutored people in programming. One student, a science major, had her 4.0 in jeopardy because of a basic programming class she thought would be easy. Another student I helped out was my former calc professor, trying to learn programming.Being science or math oriented doesn't equate to programming success. Some of the worst code I've ever seen comes from engineers; folks who know and use far more math than most mortals.I mayn't be great at math, but I can program and have done it professionally for decades. And, so can you. Good luck.",

Any modern phone (with NFC support) can read tag with a URL data field and prompt you to open it, so uploading videos to youtube and writing the URL to a tag is a pretty easy way to demo that with no coding required. Text will likely need an NFC reading app (I typically use NFC Tools for both writing and reading tag records.)If you want to seamlessly read a tag and either display a video and/or display character stats in a nicely styled way depending on which tag you scan or have the tag data integrate natively into some game functions, that would likely necessitate coding.

In my head that seems like it would help with integrating programming with your physics degree. One of the biggest things with being consistent I find is maintaining interest. Working on something your interested in can really help with that. So work on projects your interested in and use those to drive your exploration. For instance at one point I found out that JWST raw observations are available online. I feel like it would be such a cool project to try to convert the raw sensor data into a viewable image. I am not sure how difficult this would be or how interested you are in JWST but that could be a fun project. I am sure you can find some science data your interested in to do projects with. Bonus if you look up a data structure or algorithm and find some data that you could use that on.",

Eg use your favorite programming language for lab reports, implement formulas you might find useful for a exercise paper.

It’s not uncommon to have a pure backend as a purely internal piece with very clean, use-case agnostic API routes (the backend backend that you already have) but have another “backend of the frontend” (e.g., SvelteKit, Next, TanStack Start, etc…) that server-side renders UI routes using the true backend, exposes specialized API routes that compose elements of the true backend. It’s overkill for many personal projects, but is the standard for enterprise software in my experience. I also just think it’s nice to have a server for the UI for a million reasons, even just to have things like environment variables without rebuilding. Even if you don’t want to hide away your true backend, server-side rendering and other server features that are UI-specific are still useful.",

For this look at courses (free or paid) and also doing coding exercises like from [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/).Once you feel confident you can start to look at small projects you can build, aim for something you can build in 2-3 days which will require some core concepts or development pattern. This is practice, not designed to build things to release or for a portfolio. Repeat building more core understanding and building bigger projects.During this process try to step back and identify weak areas and focus on them.Key advice, don’t get hung up on remembering syntax and language specifics, that can be looked up while coding. But you do need to understand core concepts and patterns. Example: having to look up the syntax for a for loop is ok, not knowing when you need to use a for loop not ok.",

Look up Bob Tabor and go through his javascript course. It is as easy as it gets, but you won't be a developer when you're done. What it will do is instill concepts and maybe give you some confidence, because when you are done, you'll realize, Bob Tabor makes it look easy. But he's slow and methodical.2. Start on a free and easy platform like w3schools. They are constantly adding content and I have full access (got it on sale), so I can pretty much do anything, learn new skills as they are added, get certifications.3. Lookup roadmaps and game plan all this4. Eventually I think you need to consider paying to learn, on a platform or in college.5. You might look into Team TreehouseI have used Team Treehouse's platform and they have what's called tech degrees. Some companies have heard of them and people have gotten jobs after completing their curriculum. But it's no guarantee. Thing is, without something reputable on your resume, you won't get a job, so if you're learning for fun, great, if you're looking for a career, well, just go on indeed or elsehwhere and see how many jobs there are for inexperienced engineers and look at the requirements. Nearly all require a degree, and nearly all are using ATSs to scan resumes, so no degree means, resume is dragged to trash bin. Self-taught is alright, but you won't save yourself time, and you should think about paid school, just because that's the smart route. Employers trust Professors, not youtube instructors. I mean, it's okay to be home-schooled, but I'll tell ya, you may still be studying in 6 years on your own.So that's my recommendation for you. Have some goals. Lookup roadmaps. Game plan.Honestly, you should consider a different career, like delivering pizzas. Something that's less resourceful than building code. Dreams die when reality hits. None of this is easy. If you use Tabor and w3schools, maybe they instill the confidence for you to move onto harder learning, because that's beginning stuff, and you need to get into intermediate and advanced concepts and learn far more than HTML/CSS/JS to get a job (or to show anyone you're serious). My guess is, you'll give up like everyone else. But if you are driven and surprise us all, please check in with progress reports. Use all the doubters as your motivation.Remember, failure is not only an option, it's expected.",

They are also not designed with long-term maintainability in mind. Python does not support async, making it a poor choice for UI. They also scale terribly; every line of code will inevitably slow down the applicationUsing JS is a no-go if you intend to support mobile. WebView-based solutions like Tauri or Electron drains battery like a mf.NET is pretty much designed for exactly the kind of thing that you want to make; supported on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS and various others.I'd also recommend looking into [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/), as MAUI does not support Linux desktop (currently)Other reasonable alternatives would be Java, D, Rust or C++> Any pitfalls I should be aware of?Never use floating point to represent money Don't depend on libraries or frameworks where there's a big chance you might end up paying huge licensing fees some time in the future with no escape> Would you choose differently for a solo developer?No. The \"productivity\" of a developer is subjective and entirely reliant on how familiar the developer is in the language, rather than a language having some supposed inherent productivity benefit. Especially not when the alleged productivity is from dynamic typing which is just outright nonsenseI'm of the conviction that programming language matters a whole lot more than many people are willing to admit. Just picking something solely for the reason that it's familiar is poor reasoning for anything other than personal hobby projects that will never end up on someone elses computer. It's not subjective; languages makes different trade-offs, and specifically JS and Python trade off basically everything just to have a simple syntax which is not something that you want in a financial application or any long-term project where you expect a lot of changes and new feature requirementsI was involved in a buyout of a company where the code base was Python. They went bankrupt because their solution ended up costing way more money than they could possibly hope to make. Even just for the infrastructure. Each transaction has a set price, and if the cost per transaction is higher than what customers are willing to pay, then that's game over. A lot of companies go bankrupt this way, it's just not talked about because it's depressing",

One company we worked with had a NSFW mode on their site, so I usually worked with that toggled on whenever it was possible. Otherwise, browser extensions can also be useful to blur/black out images as-needed, and on staging sites where we did a lot of our dev work we wouldn't test with actual NSFW content, and instead use whatever bland imagery/videos we had on-hand. This actually works out better in most cases; If you're troubleshooting compression issues on UGC, it can be handy to test with specific images/videos so you can see differences in compression in a more controlled format.Now, when troubleshooting production problems? Yeah, sometimes you can't avoid seeing some.. Stuff, and even if whatever it is \\_is\\_ your kink, you're there to work, not jack off (especially if it's a production issue that's costing the business money).Given I primarily do front-end work, the hardest part for me can be focusing on the issues no matter what is being displayed front-end center..

If you can accept and find a way to keep your leverage, learning, and identity separate, you'll be far better off. When you lose one of those things, like your job, it really helps if you don't spiral and remember you still have leverage, and keeping learning.The failure mode for some many people in this field is basically: job loss -> identity collapse -> loss of continued learning -> inability to frame leverage for new jobs -> out of field. They have everything they need to keep moving forward, but the ideal of accepting the chaos and moving incrementally through without the shield of formal employment is too much. You have the skills, you have the experience, you just adopt a resilient mentality. It's okay to take a break, and of course none of this is far, but also, no one is coming to rescue you.",

His advice to interview around and get an understanding of your value in the market is great and I think he genuinely wants what's best for you.It sounds to me like either he knows your current company undervalues you or that your job may not be safe. I would take his advice and shop around a little. Either you find a much better opportunity or you learn about your own gaps. It's a no-lose proposition.",

If you report this to his next level or HR, he will get fired. So this can mean one of the following: 1. If you are a good performer, and expecting a salary raise, your manager want to give you that raise, but he feels unable to negotiate with upper management, so he is nudging you to get an offer and then use that as a leverage for your own sake. 2. Your manager has insights into upcoming downsizing and he is okay if you go. He is pretending to \"match\" your offer but giving you a chance to secure a good position. 3. Your manager for some dark reason is working against the interest of the company. He is either disgruntled. 4. Perhaps he is really concerned for his future, and sees that you have become relaxed at work place and not growing your skills, so this is his clever way of making you realise that you are still not good enough as an all rounded engineer. 5. Perhaps he is really concerned about your future, and general nature of the industry and the need to be in the habit of interviewing. 6. Your manager is just plain stupid and doesn't know how to do his job properly. I think it is a combination of 1 and 6. However there are better ways to do his job than nudging an employee to get an offer so that he can give you a raise.",

Know that it's not too late. A lot of people are JUST getting back from holiday vacation now. Now's actually a GOOD time to apply for jobs. Let's look at what you DO have! You'll have your degree, you'll have your medical data internship, you'll have some decent project experience, and your AWS certification. That's more than most people. Everything will be okay. Keep it up with the applications. Remember to apply to any and every company you can think of. Apply to med companies, tech companies, space companies, banks, insurance companies, the power company, your local city if they hire developers (many do for things like the city websites and sometimes for infrastructure).

Before AI- For every 100 people who go wrap up a degree, 50 of them are from trash diploma mills who just milk the international students for money. These guys just end up working illegally (and risk being deported, rightfully so) or paying consultancies to get minimum wage jobs to pay off their loans. 25 of the remaining 50 will end up coming back, 10 more will come back as their h1b won’t get picked, and maybe 10-15 people will be able to stay, pay off their loans and make a career there. Maybe 1-2 will get a green card before they’re 50 if they’re exceptional. AI has made these margins just smaller. Fewer jobs, lower pay, especially at the entry level. Once your foot is in the door- you’re a lot better off. Any experience in India does not matter. I had a colleague who graduated from BITS, worked in FAANG for ~2 years, helped me onboard when I joined. Then he went to the US for a masters and ended up joining the same company after 2 years. With a big loan and the same role. I am technically “more senior” now because he’s yet to get promoted. This craze needs to stop.",

I thought a lot about it and realized i didnt want to do the upskilling work necessary to be appealing in the tech job market— this led me to realize that the industry work in general may not be for me. So as a CS major— be very introspective about whether you are willing to do the work you’ll need to do to get internships and jobs rn. Even if the job market gets better, it will still be just as competitive in my opinion— from here on out just the degree won’t be nearly enough. Ask yourself if you’re afraid of doing the extra work because you’re doubting yourself *or* if it genuinely just doesn’t interest you. It was the latter for me, so I switched. Lastly, look at any data your current college puts out about career outcomes, and look on Linkedin to see how people who graduated in CS from your college recently are performing. Talk to any upperclassmen you know about their struggles or successes in finding internships, because if you dont get an internship during college, the only thing thatll help you in the postgrad job search will be luck and an immense grind on applications and a project portfolio. Ask yourself if you enjoy CS enough to do that. A lot of people are! I was not.",

Not UML diagrams or factory patterns. I work at Prepfully and from what our ML coaches tell me, companies like Meta and Google focus heavily on ML system design (think designing a recommendation system end-to-end) rather than traditional software patterns.Leetcode is still important though, especially for the coding rounds.Your time is better spent on ML-specific design (feature stores, training pipelines, A/B testing frameworks) and leetcode.

Doesn't need to be a GoF, but extensible, maintainable code doesn't just organically come about from a language's built-in features. Over the last 10 years, I've worked with multiple codebases (at FAANG and out) that were really poor at extending to new use cases. Each of the teams had this code-level blind spot: they had business requirements, they had system-level designs, but at the code-level, it was coder's choice on structure and pattern.",

I can paste stuff and get clarifications.The agentic AI is not that great and not revolutionary. I go over tickets in the morning and then I use it to convert it into engineering tasks. Then I'll give the AI agent the engineering tasks. Most of the time it's pretty high level or sometimes I'll clarify and ask for a specific function or class. Half of the time I'll write what I want and it goes off and it doesn't compile. Even when asking it to write unit tests it tells me it's done but it also doesn't compile. It goes on for one hour and eventually I realize it's faster if I do it myself. I was reviewing my git commits and saw it removed a test case that I don't remember asking it to remove. These days I'll baby sit it or write majority of the code myself. It's important I know what goes into the master branch.

It has little to do with whether or not AI is useful; it’s clear that there is a market for access to LLMs (even if the people who want to pay for them are wrong about their usefulness, which I’m not saying they are or are not.). Think about previous bubbles: the dotcom bubble did not mean the internet was useless, for goodness sake, nor did the housing bubble mean uh, houses were useless. In both cases, it rather meant investors had made foolish decisions about where to put their money in a mad rush to profits driven by hype. It is pretty clear at this point that there similarly just is not a path to investors making their money back given how much investment has gone into this now. However, the thing about any bubble is there’s no telling what it will take to pop. It may go tomorrow, or it might take another few years. There’s no way to know, usually. In the case of the housing bubble, you could look at when the higher rates of crappy ARMs kicked in and make a pretty solid bet things would fall apart at that point (see The Big Short) but that was a special case.You can look at the AI buildout and see, “okay, we’re building data centers like there’s no tomorrow, Nvidia’s accounts receivable is ballooning [ie, they’re allowing companies to take out debt to pay them], we keep inventing more 2008-style debt instruments to build these data centers, OpenAI and Anthropic and Cursor are completely unprofitable” and you can see that this cannot go on. But the bubble will only pop when investors lose faith in a major way, and there’s not really any telling when that will happen. There are some signs it might be soon, but it won’t happen until it does.",

The issue is that GenAI isn’t useless, but it’s **hard** to use correctly, and while it can boost productivity to a certain degree, it isn’t going to have the headcount reduction ROI that the bean counters want it to. Spend some time learning how to use the tech effectively, while maintaining your standards. If your company gives you the flexibility, look into spec driven workflows like speckit or BMAD. They might feel heavyweight at first, but they are 100% necessary to avoid slop at the moment. And they don’t guarantee good results - the merely increase the likelihood of a good result.",

I have deliberately constrained myself to more tech focused roles, because that is what I thrive in, but I have moved around within that space, be it as tech lead, architecture or pure senior developers.I have had the opportunity to be CTO and everything in-between, which I've declined.But to answer the concrete question: It depends. Burnout is a fickle beast. It might help just getting a new day-to-day, or it might make it worse due to pressure to perform in a new role. It ca go both ways.In my case, it helped, but there are no guarantees.> Did you feel more exposed during layoffs? I didn't, no.> How did you make your value visible when outcomes were less tangible?When I'm in a more architectur'y or tech lead'y roles it is more about mentoring and communication, so the more you're seen around the teams, helping out, answering questions and just being someone that enables those around you, then that is mostly enough.Making other teams succeed is also a success for you. Just make sure that you're actually a part of that success and not leeching of it (looking at you middle management).In higher positions you also get to start initiatives you believe brings value, and that value can be measured in some way. But again, don't be the guy that just starts stuff just to boost their resume. Do something that the others will actually like (or at least have good support from the ones that will be affected).",

        "body": "I’ve experienced various kinds of burn out, changing roles sometimes helped but also sometimes did nothing. The biggest factor, to me, was not in the role itself but the people that surrounded me. I made one switch after being burn out due to boredom and ended up in basically the corporate trash pile of non-performers that had managers who found it easier to move them to this new effort than to terminate them. I had an impossible situation of kicking something off with a bunch of people who had poor skills, poor follow through, and poor attitudes. I was heavily involved in terminating over 80% of the team, including my boss. All while trying (and obviously failing) to make forward progress and then playing catchup while onboarding the new team while dealing with an unhappy customer who just wanted results. I was very busy for a period with HR actions, customer engagements to appease an upset customer, serving the role of like 5 different positions, trying to come up with clever ways to meet impossible milestones, convincing company leadership that the project was completely screwed and we needed help, etc. I went from boring to extremely not boring. But one type of burn out to another. Having a mountain of work to get done that grows much faster than you burn it down, constantly pivoting to emergent tasks that had to be resolved immediately and had me up until 3am writing documents and building slides, dealing with nasty people on the regular… it really wears you out. I’d much rather have the burn out from boredom over that.",

This alleviates you from your current daily grind and gives you a fresh new grind and a new bought of imposter syndrome. For example, you could be the retail industry expert floater who is brought in to talk about macro industry outcomes and not just technology design. This would mean more high level executive vision discussions and more delegation of execution & architecture details — more soothing for your fried brain, but comes with a learning curve. You know, trade offs. This might set you up for a leadership role in a real industry instead of tech where you can actually own something. Or you could coast in post sales / enablement.

On days where I didn't fell like writing yet another cover letter I'd convince myself to just find 3 job ads I liked and leave the tabs open, which would turn into starting the cover letter, and eventually into applying to all 3. Also, start using an AI assistant to help, like copy+pasting the role text into it and getting a score for your profile. Networking helps a lot, I suck at it so I can't help, but you should try to expand your Linkedin friends list. Speaking of Linkedin, forget Easy Apply, I haven't heard of a single person who got hired through it. A really good advice I found was, find Linkedin Easy Apply jobs and then apply through the company website. Good luck",

That's worth... basically nothing over the course of a typical 9-5. Not exactly a CS MS, but a technical degree with some rigor nonetheless (like a CS MS).Generally speaking, degrees like EE, CS, CE, ME, etc. are all fungible. Nobody really cares which specific degree you received as long as you can pass the interview. As you get further in your career the fact that you have a degree becomes completely irrelevant, unless you need to check the box to meet requirements for a job. A CS degree might be a more natural fit for today's LC style interviews, but an EE major that takes a few electives can easily be on-par and any major that grinds LC problems will have a massive advantage.I've interviewed a large number of folks over the years. I can think of 3 personal projects out of well over 100 that were actually interesting to me. Most are obvious resume fluff and might as well just not exist. The 3 that were interesting were all related to hobbies that the individual had. For example, one was for scheduling and tracking autocross (I think? maybe some other race type) races. It was technically not very exciting in the least but demonstrated that the individual could identify business opportunities and then deliver value.",

It was a gamble that paid off after I got promoted, but it could have easily not panned out that way. Could have gotten a shit pay bump or no promo at all. Even after all this, Im still not sure if I made the right decision. I guess the takeaway is that problems with your employer may feel more immense if you had the opportunity to leave but didn’t.

We could easily do exactly the same. We don't even have to make them insanely high, follow a protectionist strategy or trade wars. Just a \"small\" reciprocal DST on revenue is all you need. For example, take the France DST, 3%, if your gross ad, digital or e-commerce revenue is 100M, even if you made 0 profit, even if you made a loss, you owe France 3M. They did set a high 25M threshold to avoid hitting small companies but no tech giant with a large French audience can scape it. UK does something similar but 2%. India's one is even higher at 6% of gross revenue but it's limited to ads and their related services.Do that same thing on the gross cost of offshoring and the problem solves itself overnight.

Picking up “slower” hobbies. For me specifically, the gateway drug into slower hobbies was painting. Having a hobby/skill that takes a long time to develop and see results from is what you need to get out of the lowest effort dopamine cycle of social media. You need to do something that delays your dopamine payoff for much longer than minutes to start training your brain to not expect it all the time.3. Diet and Exercise - this fits in the same category as #2 in that it’s a slower payoff activity, but I think it deserves its own mention because being able to physically see your progress is huge motivation and doing it just puts you mentally in a better space.",

I did all of my interviews remotely except for two. No one asked any leetcode style questions which couldn't be answered using first principles. Some companies asked C++ and low level questions which required knowing the language and how computers work.The market is the worst I've seen it in 30 years, with a much lower hit rate and companies taking up to 6 weeks to respond.I have 32 years YoE doing system software and back end work. I have worked at Amazon (SDEIII), Facebook (E6) and Google (L7). I live in Silicon Valley.Your results may be different.The SF Bay Area is great if you like outdoor activities with its temperate climate and hills/mountains although that's very inconvenient without a car. You'd want to make heavy use of an electric bicycle and/or ride share if you won't be driving. Commutes can be reasonable if you rent and don't do anything silly like living in San Francisco while working a job on the Peninsula.",

The way most companies set salaries is using market reference points - the market is roughly geographic and industry tied, though companies can kinda pick and choose who they think is competing for the same workers (software engineer at a FAANG and programmer in the IT department of a paper company are probably not in the same survey).So, junior dev in some industry group and city has a median of $X. A new grad offer might be 80% * $X and the company might say that the salary band for junior is 80%-120% of the market reference. Each year they get a new market reference and also adjust target points - performance based. So if the market reference is at $110k and you're at $91k, they might bump you up 2-5% on the target. If the market reference goes up, you might get a juicier raise. If it goes down, you get less of a raise. You'll have a target point and an effective point - they won't cut pay if you're target is lower than your effective, but your raises will be smaller.If you start getting above 100%, the raises are often lower. At that point they're thinking \"get promoted to get more money\" - part of the reason for the wider bands is to be able to make offers to people being hired away from other jobs.If your friend got 5 years of really good raises, I'd bet on a rapidly climbing reference point (2010-2022 were pretty good years) along with being below the midpoint target, then some pullbacks in reference point and being above target.Managers don't typically know what the reference points will be and also don't really know how you'll perform relative to expectations.",

But you shouldn't constrain yourself to what you're being taught in school. It is a very specific discipline which requires a lot of self-initiative, curiosity, and ability to learn on your own. The upside of this is that you don't need to spend hours in library or school. All of the knowledge is available online in a variety of forms: articles, blog posts, ebooks, crash courses on youtube, etc. Don't get discouraged by the current job market condition too. It is cyclical like the entire economy. Certain work patterns will change over time.

Sometimes, this is because the teacher does not clarify ambiguities because to them things are obvious. As a simple example, let's take variable assignments: x = 1 y = 3 y = x print x print yWhat would the output of this block of pseudo code be? Among students new to computer programming, a variety of answers are common:Some, intuit overwrite semantics and answer: 1 1Some, intuit swap semantics and answer: 3 1Some, intuit move semantics and answer: 0 1A good teacher will have a series of test questions designed to ferret out these mismatched mental models, and correct them. Once students have good mental models of how languages behave they can finally start learning.So I doubt that you are cooked. You probably just need a bit of guidance. If you're struggling with a particular concept, go talk to your teacher. Write out the different possible code snippets you're considering to achieve a particular task, and have him explain why they do or don't work.Have you tried sitting down, and just writing some simple code to see if you understand things. I would suggest using a language that offers a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) so that you can try things out interactively without getting bogged down. A google collab notebook, or a Jupyter notebook can be great for this.I got started writing software when I was in 4th grade on my Commodore 64. Started out just faffing around with loops to repeatedly print things like \"I am the greatest!\" on the screen. I played around with sorting algorithms. I created a program to display the Mandelbrot set (it took about 12 hours to calculate on the C64 when written in BASIC). I even learned to use raster-interrupts and bank-switching to create a double-resolution interlaced display (albeit at an eye-watering 30Hz).",

There was an SQL take home question that I did not get correct and I still got hired.I worked as a full stack dev for 3 years there and really busted tail. Won a few awards from the company and got promoted twice. I got laid off in October, due to my own fault, but have had some success with this experience.My advice: stay off reddit and socials, put your head down, and you will be fine. Take whatever you can get out of school. Apply to smaller companies. Message employees on LinkedIn. Maybe you can work up to FAANG one day, but I was making 6 figures working hybrid before I got laid off. Its possible.",

That started getting me a lot more responses.Another thing that helped a lot was community — finding people who had non-traditional starts, bad first jobs, consulting firms, or “training-heavy” roles, and getting help on how to position that experience instead of hiding it.Since I’ve worked at an early-stage startup for 2 years and am now in Big Tech, and I’ve seen a lot of resumes from people coming out of places like Wipro, I’ve been thinking about starting a Discord or something to share what helped me, how to reframe early experience, and how to avoid getting filtered out when your past work wasn’t ideal.For what it’s worth, I wouldn’t scrub it entirely and leave a 4-year gap — gaps tend to raise more questions than imperfect experience.

If you're the oncall engineer, you may need to wake up and fix things if shit hits the fan, but it's supposed to be a rare occurrence. If it happens every few days, the system you're supporting sucks and needs some serious re-engineering with a focus on reliability.Normally, any system with 24 hours uptime will require some level of oncall support, but they're not that bad. It teaches you a lot about building systems that are reliable and easy to support.However, if a team's oncall rotation involves frequently waking up at night, that's a red flag.",

The chill rotations I've had you'd maybe get one off hours page every six months or so, maybe.It's more of a mixed bag for the rotations I don't like, but when I see corners being cut for deadlines and product managers being okay with that I get real nervous. I had one rotation (also at Google) where I could expect to get a 2AM incident at least a few times that would take hours to address, and I held the pager every other month. It was hell. I burned out so fast.On call bonuses were normalized at Google, I wish that was more industry standard. We essentially made half pay for the 16 off-hours on-call time (double pay for two weeks).

Make a list of your teammates, and rank them from 1-3 on trust, higher is better. 3 means you both banter about your personal life and support each other when management does dramatic things. **Note: If you have none of these people, stop here and start building those relationships.**2. Grab some time to shoot the shit with your high trust buddies one on one. Tactfully ask how the company promotes, evolves people, and grows. Get specific, examples, resumes, etc.3. Use this information to make a case for why you should be paid more. **Note: Typically management cares about outcomes (customer satisfaction, revenue, cost, logos), not inputs (time, energy) or outputs (code, features, etc). If you don't have outcomes, you almost certainly don't \"deserve\" a raise.**4. Apply to other companies in the area and start working with recruiters. This is your reality check. **Note: If you aren't getting in the door, you now know you _can't_ earn more elsewhere. If you aren't getting past the interviews you now know where your weaknesses are.**5. Get decently far into the interviews (interviews are between 3 and 5 rounds long, once you're getting to finals (and not necessarily passing them) you should feel pretty high conviction you can land a new job.6. Tell your manager, in writing, at least 24 hours before your next 1:1, that you'd like some feedback on how to improve here. Mention your most impactful project and your least impactful project. This will signal to your manager that you're highly coachable (asking for feedback).7. At this 1:1, listen, ask non-defensive clarifying questions (e.g. \"Oh, so that wasn't as impactful as I thought. I'd like to do better next time around, how would you prefer I approach that situation when it comes up again?\").8. After the 1:1 take notes, reflect, and integrate all the knowledge you now have (peer's input on how promotions are handled, your performance in interviews, your manager's perception of you, your manager's ability to guide/help you grow)9. 24 hours before the next 1:1, tell your manager, in writing, that you'd like to discuss what growth at the company would look like in their eyes. **Note: This is the start of the negotiation. If there is a formal performance review process your manager will almost certainly shunt you to it. In that case this meeting is about learning the rules of that game and how to play it well. If there isn't a formal review process and your manager is good they will lay out a path, if they're bad, they'll wander around the subject.**10. Take notes, reflect, integrate. Your goal here is to answer this question: Do I leave, play the promo game, or wield power (threaten to leave) to get more money?At this point you should know what you want and need to do.Good luck kiddo!",

The best early career advice that I received and often pass on is to be very clear, focused, and intentional about communicating your career growth goals with your manager. At this stage in your career, you should be hoping to level up every 2-3yrs. Sometimes faster depending on the company. A high growth startup is the type of environment I would expect to progress quicker assuming I’m contributing at a high level. If you aren’t promoted in the first 2yrs of being there, seek employment elsewhere unless you really strongly believe your equity is worth sticking around for (it often isn’t but there’s always exceptions)",

Also every day I get handed things that aren’t outright wrong but don’t quite make sense and we work it out. Asking questions helps to resolve those things. Part of being a developer is actually validating requirements and things you’ve been assigned. It’s an ongoing dialog. You got through a CS program, you’re smart enough to figure it all out but be proud of your work but also humble and you’ll be a better developer for it. It took me 6 months to get okay at asking for help. I was used to never needing assistance in school. I never got any help from tutoring or anything in computer science classes bc it always clicked and was easy for me. I had this weird sense of pride about that. I did good work my first 6 months like that but definitely spun my wheels a bit and could have done better had I just embraced collaborating with folks.

He was still working at Netflix, but then taught our DSA class as well. Some days we wouldn’t have class cause he’d have to fly out to California.

Completely self taught myself graphics programming through The Cherno, LearnOpenGL, and Game Engine Architecture Volume 3, since my college classes did not really cover it in particular. Made the switch because I desperately needed something more fulfilling job wise than game dev, which was drying up way back in 2018 just about. Way before Ai and outsourcing has caught on. I enjoyed C++ so I did that. Then fast forward a bit more I dabbled in web dev a bit (did use Ai to initially learn, and figured it out in about a month), did that a bit longer but really did not like it. So, basically just learned I love working in C++. From there just continued building little c++ projects and am now actively working on my engine which is in a presentable state, but nowhere near complete (if it ever will be). Recently been diving into embedded for job opportunities, since even graphics development is a big challenge in my area. Been screwing around on my Nucleo board, and building circuits and what not. The job doesn't require embedded, but is definitely embedded oriented. So, I have a bunch of little nick nack projects in c++, my engine, and this sample embedded project just to show I am interested in embedded. At the end of the day, I have quite a bit to talk about in an interview. I bet they would maybe be surprised for someone to explain how they developed a fairly large project, made design decisions, and just know the full ins and outs of the project they built, especially from new grads. At least, that's just under the presumption that a lot of candidates may be going full fledge into Ai and not understand a lick of what they are doing. Regardless I feel as though I do fit the role, it is super duper entry level after all (they listed wanting someone with some form of knowledge in at least one out of every language under the sun basically), but was just concerned how fast they expect you to adapt to something more complex than you have ever worked on before. My engine is three projects, with about 100 files, but that's a drop compared to a companies code base with thousands just on one project.Edit: All of that just to say I am currently waiting to hear from them, though they are located near me in bumb-fuck nowhere. So, there may be a couple qualified candidates, but not many. On top of that, they have five roles open for the position, so just increases the odds.",

You might annoy someone mildly but that’s just bc they are focused. Come in a meeting and say you struggled for 8 hours the day before to understand something that takes 5 minutes to figure out? That kinda thing happening often will completely ruin people’s opinion of you on a team. They’ll see you as unreliable and unprofessional. You won’t have problems with this I’m sure, I’m just tryina tell you what I think you have to be conscious about. Always remember that your whole team is shipping together. You fail or succeed as a team. Helping each other is a great way to have people feel like they are part of a team and the solution you ship will be better for it",

SQL/NoSQL/event-based architecture are a few that come to mind. The OS/game engine stuff is more relevant if you’re targeting those types of jobs.

In fact my first gig I left because things were too chill, and I wasn't learning anything once project funding was gone. Everything was mismanaged and expected a team of 3 juniors to fully design test ship product ready code lolBut the domain knowledge was tough when the project was active. I had people knowledgable that were willing to help explain things for RF and physics when I needed, but all SW I was expected to figure out on my own. In a different role now working more on a real software stack with actual process and knowledgeable peers for the different domain knowledge I need to perform well. Do you have people to help you with the domain knowledge you're lacking? I'd honestly start applying for a better role if they're threatening to fire you and not even put this position on the resume.",

I find that most peoples idea of AI on this sub is still very much just \"ahh chatgpt sucks\"Tools like Claude Code have completely changed the industry and I think you'd have to be pretty ignorant to think otherwise. Most of my friends work in big tech (UWaterloo grads) and don't write much code themselves anymore. However, you must be able to understand the code, that is now the difference between a good engineer and a \"vibe coder\".

I just like getting shit done, but unfortunately this “meh” attitude of not really caring what I use sometimes comes across as not passionate.As for what I enjoy, I really just enjoy being left alone and turning my work in. Whether it’s building a QA test case or building out some new app feature, I equally enjoy both. I settled on cybersecurity because it seems to scratch my itch to solve problems, investigate, and not have to be on endless phone calls (being left alone).

        "body": "Hello, Ive been at my current job for about 1.5 years. I havent had much luck in landing interviews, but I also haven't been around as aggressively. Although I did get one phone interview from Capital One, where I talked to the recruiter but she told me that I would get rejected from the position since I didnt meet the baseline requirements of a 1.5 year minimum for the position. She gave me her number and told me to apply again in January since that is when I would meet the requirement. I am going to text her soon now, and apply to the position she tells me to apply to, but I am wondering on whether I should put this startup I had a big part in founding, and getting off the ground. Its only 3 months in and its steadily growing traction. I obviously don't get paid by it yet so need another full time job on top of it. Should i include it on my resume? I think I have done some cool things while working on it and it rounds out my skills well. My only concern is whether this would dissuade recruiters from selecting me for an interview since it may seem like I wouldn't be able to put the time commitment into the paying full time job. For the record, I've done a pretty good job on balancing both and still am able to perform well at my current job. Just concerned on whether this is a plus or a con to a recruiter. I would love some feedback on this and my resume overall. Thanks!resume: [https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu](https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu)",

What used to be a PM + 5 engineers in the future might be 2 PMs vibe coding + 1 super deep engineer supporting with human effort. There will still be a need for hardcore deep tech people to do truly novel / hard things. But there will be so much opportunity for people who actually have product / business skills to create prototypes and find PMF before that point.For you as someone who doesn't currently have those deep skills, this is a fresh slate. On the tech side you would be competing against people like me who DID spend 10 years coming up the old way, hands on. Whereas on the product side, I think a lot of the engineers are hopeless and even demonstrating luddite behavior as they see their jobs threatened. That seems like the path of least resistance for you.It does depend on your nature a bit also. Personally I have always enjoyed both the product and engineering sides. I gravitated to the tech side because it was more valuable and the limiting factor. I very much feel that shifting now the other direction for a lot of types of software products.",

Most of what I use I learned on the job. If you only care about the basics, you won't make it through interviews. Recruiters like passion.If you want to get hired in embedded, you want/need the full EE or CE degree. Half the jobs won't interview CS and the ones that will, you're a lower tier candidate. Very little of standard CS coursework involves low-level coding and none of it involves learning bare metal from the logic gate up.Your list isn't enough prep but Signal Analysis and Processing is the most fundamental to advanced EE and CE theory.

Depending on how hardware oriented you wanna get you might even manage to throw in FPGAs and some other stuff. Regarding EE/CE only for embedded? Sure they’re more inclined but CS for embedded is perfectly valid and you aren’t seen as a lower tier candidate because your degree is highly relevant. Ofc this depends on position, you have no clue about PCBs or pure electronics but for an embedded software position it’s more than enough. I’m a CS grad, and in my BS I had about a 40% overlap with the CE program. I’m in my masters now, and I have plenty of embedded, low level and hardware related courses which I take as a pure CS student. I also do research in hardware security, where the majority of my peers are ECE grads (I’d say 70%) and the rest CS. Apparently the notion that CS degrees don’t touch low level stuff and are only pure high software is quite propagated which typically doesn’t hold true. As for job prospects, a bunch of my peers work in embedded with CS degrees and I worked nearly two years part time as well in embedded.",

Next thing I know I'm doing R&D work in AI systems and AI agents. Then I'm promoted to manager. After that, I did end up leaving industry to join the military and from there academia. I have quite a few friends in management positions, and I will say a lot of times it is about the politics of it not talent. Becomes friends with the current management. Friends promote friends.

It might be the case I could do a sideways move into private and double my salary. The other aspect is, and hard for me to admit, but I’m probably at the stage where I’m growing rusty unless I move into a purely technical role.

It is a form of leadership not the definition of it. I’m a principal architect/computer scientist at one of the best companies in the world. Data science/data domain has a similar track as does electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, IT and so on. The view that the primary source of value is management is antiquated and for most companies just plain old wrong. Management is a very valuable role in a company but if you are encouraging everyone to become managers for pay, value, and recognition in many companies that is just by bad management and bad leadershipThat doesn’t mean there are zero companies for which a primarily management centric view of advancement makes sense, just with the rising role of ai, technology, global competition, and flatter organizations, self directing team, etc it is becoming less and less prevalent",
