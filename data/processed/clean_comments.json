Instead, they’ve told us after years of using this and us paying tens of thousands per year to have that service they’re not interested in keeping it going so we have to swap to using their API. Their API that generally only deals with one record at a time. Some of these tables have millions of records per day. And on top of that their API doesn’t even cover all the tables we query. Told them to fly a kite. They came back a year later with a delta lake api for all the tables…with no option to say no. So now I get to download parquet files every 5 minutes for hundreds of tables and ingest all this crap into a local database. More time/energy investment for me and my company. They probably spent tens or hundreds of thousands implementing that solution on their side. They won’t make up the difference for years vs what we and some other clients pay them, and have only added huge technical debt for themselves and us in the process of just removing a direct access data source (that’s easy to maintain). :face_with_rolling_eyes::face_with_rolling_eyes::face_with_rolling_eyes:",

You are approaching this situation as someone who is still a Senior Engineer but it sounds like you need to start thinking more like a manager. 1. Don't spend your time up front getting certifications and understanding all the of the tech. Spend your time finding the best people who already know it and ensure they are the ones leading individual pods of work. 2. Once you have that in place then spend your time figuring out what are the best aspects of your process and theirs and work on adapting both into an established best practice across both. There is a reason you all bought this company and they are probably smaller and used to a lot less red tape than you might put them through. 3. Think more about setting the vision and clearing operational blockers than learning every aspect of the tech stack. 4. Once you have this breathing room, circle back to diving in as detailed as you want and learn. Just food for thought. Congrats and good luck!!",

Learn enough AWS to know what to ask, long term getting more familiarity is good, but it seems like focus should be on snowflake. Since you mentioned acquisition lean on the people you're bringing in to get you up to speed and make sure you understand cost, moving anything to the cloud is not cheap.3. I would only learn enough snowflake to a) understand what exists, and b) understand where your existing platform may be plugged in. Again lean on the resources you've acquired.4. For CI/CD it's important, but learn whatever they're already using. It's probably not worth the effort to learn a bunch of systems and it's almost never worth the effort to move things, so you'll end up using what they've built anyways.That should set you up for coming up with a plan for migration if any. I would say be cautious on any move to cloud. You've likely invested in on-prem hardware already, and cloud isn't cheap. Make sure there's a real business gain before investing in a big move, and don't discount hybrid approaches.",

Pick what you need to build and create your own version for your company to set a vision. Get business to buy into it.2. Refer to this [GitLab Enterprise Data Platform Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/enterprise-data/). It is quite comprehensive and well maintained. It will provide the general direction, some ideas that you can adopt.3. Skip certifications and learn AWS basics based on what you decide to implement above. Deep dive on services that you think you will need to adopt.4. Attend tech / data meetups, network with speakers, other leaders in the data landscape and pick their brains. Discuss challenges.

AWS benefits greatly from being the first mover, while Azure has good synergy with companies using Microsoft products and puts a lot of effort into Enterprise relationships.Smaller organisations are more likely to use Google Workspace. Tech startups in particular tend to like Apple over Windows, and dont have some of the considerations big, established companies do. These are rough trends, but in my experience companies on GCP tend to lean more in this direction.",

Generate migrations via Flyway or Liquibase and block ad‑hoc DDL outside “migration mode”; run dry‑runs in SIT and produce plan diffs. Normalize dialects with SQLGlot, auto-inject LIMIT/time windows, cap bytes scanned, and fingerprint each query tied to commit and user. Add pre-commit SQLFluff and a small suite of canary queries; CI should run EXPLAINs and sample-result checks before merge. Keep a dataset catalog that maps queries to dataset IDs and auto-writes lightweight docs next to the SQL; emit OpenLineage or DataHub events so ops can trace breakage. I’ve used DataGrip for editing and dbt for transformations, with DreamFactory to auto-generate REST endpoints over SQL Server and Mongo so downstream tools hit curated views.

The data you feed it is the fuel and oil. If you constantly put in bad gasoline and never change the oil, the car will still run for a while but over time, performance drops, parts wear out, and things start to break. In the same way, if your AI models are trained on low-quality, inconsistent, or noisy data, it will limit how accurate and reliable their outputs can be, no matter how much tuning you do under the hood.But if you treat your car well use clean, high-quality data, keep things consistent, and regularly monitor and maintain your pipelines it will run smoother, perform better, and be far less likely to produce bad or unpredictable results. data engineering doesn’t magically solve everything, but it can massively improve what your AI capabilities",

Once teams start relying on anything ML or real time, the cracks in their pipelines show up fast and suddenly data engineering isn’t a background function anymore. The work becomes more about shaping the contract between producers and consumers and less about just moving data from A to B. That shift feels pretty fundamental.The biggest change on my side is tighter collaboration cycles. DE gets pulled in earlier when a new product idea forms since everyone knows messy upstream data will kill the project later. Ownership has improved a bit too, mostly because teams finally realized they can’t bolt governance on at the end.It still varies a lot by company, but the places that treat DE as a core layer tend to move faster and spend less time firefighting. Curious if you’re seeing that ownership gap close where you are or if it still feels like an uphill push.",

No lineage, no visibility.Credit-card example: central team gave a DS team access to sensitive data *only* for fraud modeling. They built a derived table, and because there were no permission controls, that table suddenly became visible to everyone in the company. No one caught it for weeks.Company 3 (Large mobile-gaming company): Strong central platform team + distributed product analysts.Result: Honestly the smoothest setup I’ve seen. Even less technical analysts shipped fast because the platform team handled the heavy lifting.Company 4 (Small gaming studio): 1–2 engineers built the whole thing on Prefect + dbt and enforced strict rules manually.Result: Super slow, pipelines broke constantly, everything was fragile.Company 5 (Neo-bank): Huge data team, started doing full Data Mesh during COVID. Each domain ran its own infra and pipelines.Result: Now they’re trying to re-centralize everything, and it’s incredibly painful. Every domain has different tools, different workflows, different security assumptions. They literally said they wish they had standardized the platform from day one.So yeah, from everything I’ve seen:Having a strong central platform/governance team that sets the standards and provides the tooling, and then letting domains build data products on top of that, is the only setup that doesn’t blow up over time.",

They had mainly an old school on-premise solution which was built of multiple siloed data warehouses and depended on tribal knowledge to keep it running. I believe there was one super complicated ETL pipeline that would fail, and they only knew to restart it, until it finally ran. No one bothered to debug why it failed. A combination of older technology, and not managing tech debt because all stable data solutions wander into cost-centre territory where they only care about costs management. Anyway, onto your challenge -Multiple siloed analytics systems, some on-prem, some on private cloud, mish-mash of Azure/Microsoft based solutions and generally no one had a standard approach to data.So we architected a whole new data-mesh(-istic) approach. Hub-and-Spoke architecture built off Databricks for the Hub, bring what you want for the Spoke. Hub is your managed and governed central data lake. Spokes correspond to different domains of the business (Finance, HR, Customer Experience, Investment and so on.).More lower done, we maintain Landing, Bronze, Silver, Silver Plus (meant to hold curated/canonical model, still WIP), with the respective domain spokes having the Gold Layers.Our core idea was the data platform should be a genuine platform. Not just something to build analytics on. So now we can progress to building AI based applications, ontologies and so on without the restrictive mindset of a data platform being only to build data warehouses.For us Databricks has worked like a dream, and barring reporting (Power BI), we haven't considered needing to use it for anything else. Unity Catalog especially from this year, has been a knock-out for the use cases we have. And we still have more to implement - governed tags, data masking and so on.I would say it has been a success and the struggle is to keep innovating on it, than marking it as done and stable and letting tech debt accumulate over the years till someone else comes in and says let's make a new data platform but do it right this time. :-D",

Upstream data from source systems can absolutely create tough challenges and directly impact your downstream data quality. As data engineers, you often have to design and implement your own solutions to handle these issues and stay focused on what you can control.In a perfect world, data coming from CSVs, JSON files, PDFs, and application databases would already be clean, consistent, and well-structured. If that were true, our jobs would be 50x easier and everything would feel like rainbows, unicorns, and ice cream.

        "body": "Not a consultant but I've just been brought into a medium sized org and have been working on a Fabric PoC. Mixed experiences. The bad:- There is at times a large desync when reading and writing to lakehouses and warehouses. PySpark operation will complete and show transformations applied within a session only for the data to not match at the endpoint for... A while. No hard numbers on this but seen others talking about it. Bottlenecks development and is really frustrating. - The low code solutions are terribly inefficient. My first time testing a basic Dataflow Gen2 operation ran for way too long and had a ridiculously large CU consumption, so if you want to handle ETL processes better get dug into Spark notebooks (I've been using PySpark which is considerably faster and more performant than the Dataflow seemed, not sure how other Spark modules behave) - Speaking of CU consumption, interrogation of compute is so... Opaque. Want to see how much CU your new code block uses? You're out of luck if you've ran it multiple times for debugging and testing - there's no way to get a granular report on costing. The documentation here isn't much better. - Managing a traditional Dev -> Prod pipeline feels harder than necessary. Currently I'm running a NonProd/Prod architecture where end users only have access to a workspace with models loaded into a warehouse because as far as I can tell there is no object level security available within a workspace. There's also no way that I've found to directly write across workspaces, so I'm shortcutting my endpoint data in the NonProd workspace to a lakehouse is the Prod workspace, then using cross warehouse T-SQL to create views for the end users.The good:- For an organisation with a large investment in PowerBI with multiple workspaces and satellite teams within the business, I can see how Fabric might be a good solution that slots in nicely. In it's current state I'm not sure that it pulls ahead of any other architecture solutions. - It's an interesting playground for less technical users to 'get their hands dirty'; I see the appeal. As mentioned before however, I discounted the low code options pretty quickly so it remains to be seen how this will progress. - There is native CoPilot integration in Fabric (when set up with the right licence option in workspaces). I haven't tested this out yet but I imagine this will be useful for people in the business to ask questions and interrogate data without requiring models to be built or a knowledge of SQL or PowerBI development. Overall it's not terrible and if you're already paying for a fabric capacity you're not incurring additional costs if your capacity has headroom. For users with a less technical background I'm not sure if the juice would be worth the squeeze as every end user I've spoken to has gravitated to Dataflows for ETL work as it's familiar to them (it works like an online PowerQuery interface). My background is in analytics and I have less experience with data engineering so my observations should be taken with a grain of salt.",

Helps prevent issues with bad data loading into the db, but also by loading into a staging table, you can rely on the dbms to handle inserts/upserts where such a thing is not supported through whatever connector you're using. Unless you blow away the staging tables after each run, it's also helpful for troubleshootingIm not sure what a metadata driven pipeline is. Although it sounds like youre just storing config values in a table to be used when calling the api, which is pretty standard for pipelines in general. If youre using aws, you can store metadata into something like ssm, but if you're operating in a datalake (and it's not sensitive), you want everything consolidated.

That way, we know right from the ingestion layer if the schema is breaking the contract and we can work to remediate. Then, the pipeline can always assume that schema is enforced and we don't need to worry about missing or unexpected data.If it's some sort of public API that can change at any point, then the approach would probably be a bit different. Just throwing something out there this isn't necessarily how I'd do it, but perhaps store as just raw JSON, then parse out the data we actually need from it, and store that in a known schema (i.e. a bronze layer feeding into a silver layer). Of course, all of this will depend on *how* the API changes, so the real answer is that it has to be handled case-by-case (e.g. if a field is added or removed, but we don't use that field anyway, then we do nothing because it doesn't matter, but if we do use it, then we need to figure out what to do in the particular scenario).3 is again sorta dependent on the use-case. If I have access to the full source dataset and it's only a few thousand records, I wouldn't bother with incrementally loading data. I *might* do something like tracking which rows are new/updated if that's relevant to downstreams in the pipeline, but again, depends on the use case.For 4, I generally prefer loading into a bronze layer (if that's what you mean by \"staging tables\"). If it's easy to keep the source data, I don't really see a reason not to do so and to keep it close to the rest of the data (i.e. in the same warehouse). But there are of course cases when this is not desired (for example, if the source data is enormous and is mostly thrown away anyway, then I wouldn't want to waste the cost to store it).For 5\\*, I'm not sure what you mean by a \"metadata driven pipeline\". Do you mean using things like Iceberg or Delta Lake for CDC?",

In most cases I don't expect the schema to change so I want to know when it does since it could have impacts to downstream functions.2) Answered above. You can't remove old columns from the schema since there is old data likely using them.3) Full load if possible. My main reasons are that it's quick and if your source deletes rows without a method for getting which rows are deleted, an incremental update won't pick them up. This is very much dependent on a number of factors, so quite often a full load isn't the best option.4) If you have a need for a staging table, use it. If not, don't complicate things because it fits the design pattern you saw on a YouTube video.5) First time I've heard of this, but I read your explanation in a different comment. If you can use that pattern, go right ahead, I'm all for code deduplication. I think for a lot of people though, and certainly me, it would be far more trouble than it's worth. I work with about a dozen products from various vendors each with their own API auth methods, pagination rules, and return schemas. To try and cram all that into a generic pipeline would be a nightmare of if statements and rule exceptions. It just wouldn't work in my case. Dedicated pipelines are isolated so I know I can change one without it affecting anything else. I can see a generic pipeline having to be tested against everything it calls whenever a change is made to any one of them.If you have a setup where most pipelines use a similar setup, then yeah I can see it being useful, that's not my environment.",

After ingesting data from API and assuming flattening to tabularI think these concepts are all related. With JSON, you can just insert the JSON payload into a JSONB field with whatever fields happen to be in the JSON payload. So flattening wouldn't be necessary. And since flattening isn't necessary, you don't have to worry about whether fields are included, deleted, omitted, etc. from one payload to the next. Just query it using SQL with the JSON features that the database provides.Querying raw JSON using SQL is still relatively new. Some databases (e.g. postgres) are excellent at it. But even the ones that are not yet, they will likely only get better. Demand for these features will only grow with time imo.",

For example, you present your data in proper form to facilitate analytics, you have your date-based data presented vertically, so your months go top to bottom ascending. There are some who have cognitive barriers that prevent them from comprehending those outputs... unless the dates are present horizontally left to right.So there are a myriad of reasons why users wish to export and do their own thing. This applies ro tech and non-tech people alike. It does require a certain trained skill to read reports, and everyone is different in their cognitive design and abilities, all you can do is find that balance that caters for all abilities and levels.Don't be disheartened - in this industry, it's totally the norm, just try to find a way to buiild a comprehensive solution that caters for these different types of needs.Good luck!",

What are the systems behavior and considerations involved? I don’t think it’s the most relevant topic for advancing an ML/AI career. I would think you’d be better off focusing on how to get quality data for models, which models to use for which scenarios, and in the case of agentic AI the big learning area might be systems integration via things like MCP and how to evaluate for sufficient performance/improvements, plus security.

As part of the batch process, an environment variable representing the job number can be accessed via int(os.environ\\['AWS\\_BATCH\\_JOB\\_ARRAY\\_INDEX'\\]). Use this and your mapping from step 2 to get the list of files this job should process.5. Make sure all of your jobs succeed and/or check the results bucket to see if all is good.Maybe there's a more elegant solution that a more seasoned DE would suggest, but this is what I'd do.",

The aim is to stop people editing 'data storage' spreadsheets directly (each form should also be an easy thing to set up).So what have we achieved?- added some level of control over data entry- introduced BigQuery, allowing you to start defining transformations in SQL (e.g. Views, Scheduled Queries), and setting up the foundation for the future- decoupled data analysis from data storage. Data analysis with spreadsheets reading well-managed data from BigQuery is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight pattern- prepared everyone for a future where you have data entry methods write directly to BigQuery, without spooking the horses- oh, and for free your data is ready to analyse out of the box with 'Looker Studio' (free, not to be confused with Looker 'proper'), allowing you to set up reasonably nice dashboards",

Apps Script sidebars + validation absolutely work, and it’s a common way to modernize workflows before moving to something like BigQuery later.The main thing to watch out for is long-term maintenance. Once the logic grows (sidebars, menus, validations, logs, error handling), you become the only person who can support the Scripts. That can be tough when you’re the lone “tech” person. Since you’re on Google Workspace, i suggest to look into Zenphi as an alternative to Apps Script. It covers pretty much everything people usually build in Apps Script—supplier/product workflows, validations, approvals, logging—but without writing code, which makes the system easier for others to understand and maintain.",

A snowpipe to Load into regular staging tables can be event triggered when a new file occurs in a container of a datalake, or, you use external tables with a scheduler, then do Load into staging tables. The rest after that is 99% identical to any previous Medallion / Kimball DW setup. Snowflake charges based on credits, a combo of IO ingest and CPU crunching. It’s decently priced. Security is by role and can be weird. Keep it very simple or you will be swamped. So it’s not fancy, just convenient. Everything can be done on a browser.

Ideally it would have best in class integration with Delta Lake, Iceberg, the major Catalogs. These things exist but not to the level they should. Good support here would mean we don’t have to use spark for everything, tons of enterprises would adopt it, and it would disrupt the big players compute oriented business models. But instead they lean into their proprietary storage formats. It’s their project, so work on what you like, but most development just seems aimed at making MotherDuck profitable.",

After completing it, you'll have a solid foundation in data engineering, but there's always more to learn, of course.One downside is that they used AI voices for most of the videos, and when they do have real people in the videos, you can tell that most of them are reading from a script. Another thing is that it focuses on IBM's offerings in the data engineering space, when offerings from other companies are much more popular in the job market. It is an IBM cert, though. Why wouldn't they teach you IBM stuff? Fortunately, they made a lot of the IBM-specific parts of the courses optional.If you can get past the negatives, it's a pretty solid starting point for getting into data engineering.",

Unfortunately with Glue there is not so much you can do, but next things might help a little:1. If possible remove asterix, so you can use recursive lookup and listing won’t take place on driver. Do ‘s3://../parsed-data/us/‘ instead and .option(recursiveFileLookup\", \"true\")2. Increase number of workers3. Tune up a config a little bit for working with small filesspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes\", 64 * 1024 * 1024) spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes\", 4 * 1024 * 1024) 4. Use repartition instead of coalesce, because your bottleneck is read, not write. But really, that’s not Spark use case, there is nothing “analytical” about this kind of processing. So the only valid approach - stop producing tons of little files or switch to another technology. You just wasting lot of money by trying to use not suitable technology for a quite trivial job. Databricks have ‘cloudFiles’ functionality to handle such things and it works perfectly, but unfortunately there is nothing similar to it in pure Spark or Glue.",

I work cross-cloud in Azure and GCP managing data pipelines in Databricks or Airflow. I build consumers/producers with Kafka. I work in Python mainly but occasionally run into Java. My role has always been this way for the last 5 years. As a tech lead I also do some product work like epic breakdowns, quarterly planning, sprint planning for my team. I also manage a team of 6 devs and do performance reviews etc. My job isn’t stressful because I push back if a request isn’t reasonable, and if the PM insists on making my team pivot then I insist on dropping an epic to make room for the new work. The only thing that ever gets stressful to me sometimes is dealing with people who either don’t do their job or do their job very badly, and I end up compensating. Otherwise I love being a data engineer!",

Roles of DE’s vary quite a bit so it’s going to depend on the position you switch to… With that being said, in DE you don’t have to worry about the 1,000 ways an end user can misuse and crash your site, or covering every edge case for security vulnerabilities… you probably won’t need to learn 5+ languages and frameworks for one project. These are things I didn’t consider stress wise when making the switch to ‘SWE’, however I enjoy the struggle of this. With DE you’re extracting data, transforming and loading it into a space where DA’s and DS can easily retrieve accurate data. The way I think about it is the DB serves as your UI and this simplifies worrying about security and misuse. Not to say these concerns don’t exist, but I don’t feel like they’re as complex to resolve. The real complexity/stress comes in taking disparate data from various systems in various formats, that’s available in disjunct timeframes and making it fit into a cohesive/canonical model that represents how the business/analysts thinks about operations. Applying and understanding business rules can be very difficult/stressful. Inherently I don’t think one or the other is less stressful, it depends on the job and your interests… good luck :)",

Deadlines are everywhere. Hard-to-diagnose problems are probably everywhere, too, especially when you inherit things. Sometimes specific tools are worse for it (I've heard comments in this regard about Spark, for example).I've done this transition, albeit kind of unconsciously. It's been good. Having software background is definitely valuable, I think. It probably depends some on your stack, but I also think there is *a lot* of crossover. Especially if you consider that often it's the soft-skills that count, too.I started in general development, primarily working on an internal web-based system using .NET Core. That job started having more and more \"reporting\" work, using the same backend database, but SSRS was the frontend instead. From there, into an analyst type role, which rapidly became a catch-all ETL-developer-report-builder-platform-admin role. Last few years it has become more about \"engineering\", admin, and architecture. I'm very much enjoying it. Early on, I did miss working in code that wasn't primarily SQL (and especially wasn't DAX), and the ways in which we did it - like devops processes and dev tools. I've seen that shift where I am now, partly because team, partly because tool set with us jumping into Databricks. The inner software dev has much more cause to come back to the surface. I've been in a position to bring devops practices in. I'm thinking again about things like encapsulation and DRY. I was not the whizz-bang top-dog developer, but I picked up some good fundamentals and experience. It's helpful as a data-focused engineer. Is DE a good fit for you? Probably if you have an analytical mind, enjoy the problem-solving, and sometimes having to help discover what that problem really is. I would also say that it's all just input-to-output.",

Depending on your use case, you may also want to leverage created/updated ts columns to additionally narrow down the range of records that need to be scanned for the merge operation - only update if the incoming data is newer than the timestamp columns.",

        "body": "The correct number of partitions depends on the size of the data. Spoiler alert: unless you are truly working with billions and billions of rows, the right number of partitions is often small. (For example, suppose your data set is a few gigabytes/MB in size, with a few hundred thousand rows and a few hundred columns, and those columns are mostly numeric. In that case, the correct number of partitions might be as little as 4 or 5.) You can experiment with the best number. anyway, you mentioned re-partitioning the data, but you don’t mention the default number of partitions for your session. This is an important configuration parameter that you can set at the beginning of the script. I have seen Spark read in a tiny Excel file and spread it out across 15 partitions and then half of those partitions are completely empty. Obviously this is ludicrous, and slow, but Spark can do it if you don’t stop it.Also when it comes to joins, sometimes the big data set can stay put, and only the small data set needs to be reshuffled. Assuming one of your data sets is smaller. So the type of joint, balanced, or imbalanced, equijoin or non-equijoin, also matters a lot for performance tuning.",

But maybe the filters overlap, so you end up shuffling more data by doing it separately and you could have saved time by shuffling once at the outset.If it is just a repartition helping, it would be some niche circumstance the optimiser doesn't handle on its own.",

For example we recently had it include a shuffle step to rebalance files, but we were rewriting 50TB of data and it just flooded the spill space and crashed.The old 200 default is almost never a good number. It ends up spending more time finalising tasks and spinning up new ones than it does actually processing things (may be slight exaggeration). The ideal number on a fixed-worker-count cluster is 2x the number of cores on the workers, and then higher multiples of that if you have significantly skewed data in large amounts.Even with AQE you might be able to guide it to a better plan by lining up data nicely for it. But I wouldn't necessarily worry about it until something is taking longer than it seems it should and is taking long enough that it is worth optimising.There are other approaches that can help as well. Saving intermediate results somewhere so that it can be reused without relying on cache memory being available as well as truncating the query plan. You can also focus on dropping the descriptive data and just moving keys and filter-by columns for all the major join work, create a unique composite key for each row, then send that back to the original descriptive data then re-join everything on the new unique row key. That minimises shuffles if you have multiple different keys to join on, because you're only reshuffling the keys, and you shuffle all the extra data just once.",

I use duckdb’s read_blob with hive partitioning against s3 to load blob assets without needing a database for metadata. Only problem is that the read_blob fetch mechanism loads all data at once instead of just the batch being fetched. The incremental fetch loading works fine for read_parquet though. For now I have a workaround where I load all the metadata by not reading the content and then incrementally calling read_blob with a batch of filenames from the metadata at a time, but would be nice to just natively support incremental result loading to make the experience more seamless and approachable. https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-python/discussions/92",

        "body": "Disclaimer: I work in the data platform space (founder of Bruin), so take this as general guidance, not a pitch. The best option really depends on your company size, how your teams are structured, and what your current stack looks like (MSSQL 2016, lake, warehouse, etc.). Also helpful to know how you orchestrate things today; Airflow, SSIS, cron, notebooks, whatever.One thing I’d definitely think about is choosing asset-based orchestration instead of task-based. Task-based tools like Airflow or SSIS focus on tasks, not data, so lineage ends up shallow, incomplete, or manually maintained. You also get a lot of glue code that makes governance harder. Asset-based tools like Dagster, dbt, or Bruin treat data assets as the core unit, which gives you proper lineage, clear dependencies, and a cleaner way to centralize metadata and governance. If your goal is a single referential for governance, this approach saves a lot of pain later.Regarding OpenMetadata: it’s a good open-source option, but it’s not light. You’ll spend time maintaining connectors, and lineage quality depends on how your SQL is written. Glossary, business rules, RACI, etc., also take time to set up. It works well in mature teams that can own it.You can also look at metadata-first platforms like DataHub if your priority is lineage and visibility over heavy enterprise governance. Sometimes that’s enough depending on your size.Just keep in mind that no tool magically creates governance. You still need a central team, standards, ownership, and a gradual rollout. The tool only reinforces the process you already put in place.",

If you eventually want to move into those roles, starting with cloud data engineering will give you an advantage because you’ll understand the systems, the infrastructure, and the production side of data far better. Since you’re already studying ML and ethical/technical subjects, a Cloud Data Engineering path can blend well with your background. You don’t have to choose today but you can start by building data foundations and then transition into ML/Data workflows once you’re comfortable with the cloud and data pipelines.Here’s a short piece that I came across which breaks down a practical path to getting started in data engineering: [“How to Start a Data Engineering Career With 5 No-Nonsense Moves”](https://medium.com/@khushbu.shah_661/how-to-start-a-data-engineering-career-with-5-no-nonsense-moves-1bd9d2e1248c) Hope this gives you some clarity.

I value experience with designing a pipeline, setting up monitoring and alerting, experience optimizing a pipeline for cost and performance, experience with handling production issues, data quality control, testing hierarchy, CI/CD, etc. I don’t have time to train people on the job in Spark, Python, SQL, GitHub, fundamental dev skills like clean code - everyone has to be proficient in those areas on day one. Things I can and do teach on the job are working on a specific cloud platform (GCP, Azure) or using specific pipeline tooling (airflow, databricks, azure data factory), etc. Databricks has a lot of nice tutorials and free cloud compute that you could take advantage of for a portfolio piece. If you aren’t aware, the founders of Databricks are the founders of Spark, and Databricks is pretty hot right now so it would give you relevant experience for the current job market. I get hit up by recruiters all the time looking for people with Databricks experience. Check out DBX free https://www.databricks.com/learn/free-edition",

I think hiring managers will definitely consider you, but I get that sometimes with AE roles, they do actually want specific tools, which makes things hard, but you should be able to find job postings that partially fit your skillset and you should at least get interviews.It's pretty rare to find a job description where you're in expert in 100% of the \"required\" tools. Partial matches are usually good enough.",

Id become an expert in SQL first and foremost. In my company us DE's do not do any analytics or dashboard development whatsoever. That is the Data Analysts job. Data Engineers sit at the top of the data hierarchy. I just started at a new company and came in with another guy who is a Data Analyst. He started at 90k, I started at 130k. Getting into the job now and doing the work, I see that Data Engineering work is much more robust and complicated than most average Data Analyst tasks.",

If you must keep SSIS, point it to ADLS via the Azure Feature Pack; otherwise use ADF with a self-hosted IR from on-prem. Enable SQL Server CDC and push changes to ADLS (via ADF or Event Hubs) to avoid nightly fulls. Lock down with Private Link, Managed VNet IR, Key Vault–backed secrets, and service principals.Pitfalls I’ve seen:smiling_face_with_tear:modeling twice (MI then lakehouse), duplicate security policies, lineage gaps, and schema drift when multiple tools write to the same tables. Pick one orchestrator (ADF is fine), version pipelines, and test backfills early. A measured skip-to-DB approach works: run a 2-week spike for one domain using Autoloader + Photon and keep MI only for legacy apps.With Azure Data Factory and MuleSoft, DreamFactory helped us expose legacy SQL Server as secure REST endpoints so Databricks jobs could ingest without custom middleware.So, keep Phase 1, but aim everything at ADLS/Delta and Databricks from day one so almost nothing gets thrown away.",

Once everything clears all checks and is running properly in production, then make the official switch/decommission the old workflows once the source data itself is redirected to the same storage locations to bypass the SSIS packages.IMO, it's going to take just as long either way to do it, but if the team focuses mostly on building a great foundation for the new workflow, there's ultimately a lot less temporary overhead required.",

Set one changelog per DB, small ordered changesets, and enforce a mainline flow (feature branches rebase to avoid merge conflicts). Always dry-run and generate SQL for review; treat rollbacks as forward fixes, not “undo,” especially on prod.Bytebase shines when you want review workflows, SQL lint, environment pipelines, and permission guardrails without building your own. It also logs who approved what, which kept auditors off our backs. For near-zero downtime: MySQL via gh-ost/pt-osc; MSSQL with online index rebuilds, adding columns with defaults that are metadata-only, and pre/post scripts to backfill.Use a deploy service account per env with least privilege. Gate releases with tSQLt or SQLFluff, and wire CI in GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps. We used Redgate SQL Compare for drift checks and GitHub Actions for pipelines; DreamFactory gave us quick REST APIs over MSSQL/MySQL so app teams didn’t need direct DB perms.So I’d go Liquibase by default; choose Bytebase only if you need built-in approvals, SQL review, and audit trails your auditors will actually use.",

E.g: denormalized data are normalized to store quality data (center of star), then denormalized (dimensions) for reporting for example. 2. Generally, it's a combination of the data management stage where we decide sources to use (maybe reliable ones) and define \"rules\", and the data architecture stage where we structure data. For examples, from three sources S1, S2, and S3, maybe we keep only S1 and S3 because data from S2 are not reliable (bad quality). Then data shapes and values from S1 and S3 which may differ at multiple points but generally unique identifier is used (like email), here is where \"rules\" are applied, for example use the email as identifier, set data with no value to NULL, if two other addresses have different values, keep the one which match the phone number, ... 3. An example is where instead of creating dimensions which is a transformation, we directly serve the data, and then flexible queries will retrieve them on demand. I hope it helps :)",

Denormalized only means attributes are combined, not that the structure matches the grain or logic needed for reporting. If the current shape works, you can keep it. If it doesn’t, you transform it into whatever structure performs well-normalize first, remodel into facts/dims, or rebuild a wider table. The model itself isn’t the goal; usability and query performance are. So denormalized is different with ready for analytics. Adjust the structure when needed to make it clean, fast, and reliable.2. Multiple customer sources with different IDs and attributes usually lead to a conformed customer dimension. The goal is to unify identity across systems using a surrogate key, then merge records via deterministic or fuzzy matching rules. You track history using SCD when attributes change over time. From the conformed dimension, you can also generate shrunken dimensions when a specific process only needs a subset of attributes - reducing complexity and improving performance while keeping consistency. The key idea is: one enterprise-wide definition of customer, multiple shapes depending on analytical needs. For more details, you can read the chapter \"Integrate via conformed dimension\" of The Data Warehouse Toolkit.3. A star schema is part of dimensional modeling and works great for data warehousing because it’s simple, performant, and easy for business users to query. But it isn’t the only modeling approach. Data Vault focuses on flexibility and historical tracking when dealing with many changing data sources, while the Inmon approach builds a 3NF enterprise warehouse before data marts, or One Big Table stores data in wide-tables,... Each method has strengths and trade-offs, so the right choice depends on requirements - speed to deliver, data complexity, volume, regulatory needs.",

Reuse the same cleaned staging models so you’re not doing the work twice. Materialize dims/facts as tables and use incremental loads where it helps.2) For customer, create a surrogate-keyed dimcustomer and a customerxref (sourcesystem, sourceid, customersk, matchconfidence, matched\\_on, rule). Do deterministic matches first (tax ID, email+dob), then fuzzy for names/addresses. Store survivorship rules for attributes, run SCD2, and route low-confidence cases to a review queue so ops can merge/split and you can replay history. I’ve used Fivetran for ingestion and dbt for modeling, Great Expectations for tests, and DreamFactory to expose a lightweight approval API for those manual merges without giving warehouse write access.3) Skip strict star when you need event streams with nested arrays, high-card time series, graphy relationships, or an ODS/Data Vault layer feeding multiple marts.Main point: keep raw raw, standardize once into conformed models, denormalize only where it serves the queries, and treat customer identity as a first-class process :)",

        "body": "Your response for number 2 sounds a lot like thinking through the ERD for normalization: from the raw sources you develop a Kimball inspired normalized star schema using the higher quality inputs (which makes you wonder why you even bothered with ingesting and storing source 2 to begin with). In the case of primary keys, which join to the foreign keys of the desired tables, you have to figure out if each is a one-to-one, one-to-many, or a many-to-many relationship. If it's not one-to-one, are there any other tables that need to be joined? If so, you may find it more useful to create a set of compound keys (which could also be expressed in a singular column as a hashkey, which is my preference) - which contain all identifier columns that make each record unique. Then there's a question of data consistency - are we dealing with slowly changing dimensions or static facts? You don't want to create a key with nulls in it, but equally so you don't want to establish a new record each time a customer updates their info. So much of these considerations are determined by both the business logic at the point of collection (data source) and the desired update pattern for your tables.Getting this all diagrammed out alongside mapping out the business rules ahead of the engineering process will make everyone's work much easier, as at that point it's mostly plug-and-play to build your DDL and DML pieces.As much as I personally bristled at Medallion architecture when I was first introduced to it, I realized you can think of your raw sources as the bronze layer, the normalized star schema as the silver layer, and all downstream transformations as your gold layer. Alternatively, you can stick with the classic approach of a raw dataset, staging tables, production tables, and data marts for specific user groups if your governance plan allows for it/business needs require it. You can also mix and match with materialized views substituting for tables if they fit your needs and your platform supports them.This doesn't work for all types of data or use cases, but hopefully gives you something to work with and learn from.",

This simplifies migrations a lot.* Bruin supports start and end dates natively instead of requiring you to use custom variables.* dbt uses `ref` functions in Jinja, Bruin parses SQL directly and requires explicit dependencies.* Both supports different environments, Bruin also supports [developer environments](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/devenv.html#schema-based-environments) where it rewrites your queries transparently on the fly.* Bruin allows running Python transformations anywhere within the pipeline and runs it natively. This means you can run Python anywhere, and not limited by what Snowpark or similar platforms allow you to do with dbt Python models. * Bruin uses `uv` in the background, meaning that your pipelines will work even if you don't have Python installed, and each task runs separately in isolated environments.* Native column-level lineage in open-source and open-source [VSCode/Cursor extension](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/vscode-extension/overview.html).* Bruin allows [defining policies](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/policies.html) in code to apply your SQL statements, e.g. \"this SQL model must have an owner\" or \"it must follow these rules\". You can enforce these in your ci/cd pipelines.* `bruin validate` validates all your queries via dry-run to check if they are valid, this means invalid code never lands. * Bruin contains embedded sqlfluff for linting with your existing rules.* Bruin has an open-source MCP server to let agents build/help with your T layer.* dbt has \\`doc\\` macro, Bruin contains a built-in [glossary](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/glossary.html) instead.Both tools are useful in their own ways, and share different approaches, hope this comparison is helpful.",

I naturally fell into becoming a synapse SME through a series of projects, logical next step is for me to evolve into a Fabric sme.Situation; I'm currently looking for a new roll, seems like there's not much in the way of opportunities on the market at the moment for fabric specialists, it's all databricks and snowflake... that might just be \"grass is greener on the other side\" mentality and I hope it will pick up soon as MS are pushing hard on Fabric and as more companies will be nudged that way from Synapse they will naturally consider Fabric as a strong contender.Advice; it's a gamble what ever you choose to specialise in, I'd hedge your bets and make sure you're picking up plenty of transferrable skills along the way (modelling, dq, mdm etc).Aside; I always remember my aunty telling me to specialize in adabas when I first started in IT, I was young and she was nearing retirement age so thought she was nuts. In 2020 we hired a adabas specialist for an eye watering day rate, he was only there 6 weeks, pretty sure he earned enough to take the rest of the year off in that time though... That was a gamble that definitely would have paid off!",

I'm working with a younger analyst right now who makes constant mistakes in his queries, and yet he's always trying to give Data Engineering suggestions on how our pipeline should work. It's just.... not good. \"stay within your lane\" is something that sounds really harsh to say, but some tough love is what's missing in the workplace nowadays. This doesn't mean don't learn new skills, but it does mean you gotta make sure you're doing your current job well before you start branching out too far.

For Protobuf, if you have a descriptor set (.desc), protoc --decode or grpcurl (with reflection or -protoset) gets you readable output; with Confluent’s Protobuf support, the same schema‑id header flow applies. Redpanda Console or Conduktor are nice when you want a UI that decodes messages against the registry. Confluent Schema Registry and Redpanda Console do the heavy lifting day‑to‑day; DreamFactory has been handy when I need a quick REST shim around decoded records plus schema lookup.If you build a visual inspector, make it registry‑aware (Confluent/Karapace), handle Avro/Protobuf wire headers, accept .desc files, and show schema diffs; otherwise quick scripts will still win.",

OLTP databases have a lot more functionality than OLAP (more constraints, lower latency, faster updates/deletes, etc.) and will work as long as your data isn't huge, so go for something like Postgres for storage.Use custom python scripts to request data from the API, and minimally transform it before loading into Postgres. Then you can use dbt models to restructure the data into fact/dim tables. Power BI has a native connector for Postgres, so setting it up to read from the clean dimensional tables should be simple.At your data scale, everything downstream of the API requests will be very fast to update. The main bottleneck will be how fast the API is, how much data you can pull with each request, and the request quotas you currently have with your subscription.",

If you have a meaningful data size, trying to run updates very frequently could get very expensive. If your data is small, you might be able to set everything up as views, but you'll still be limited by the frequency of your ingestion process.Instant updates are generally in the realm of transactional software, not analytical dashboards. When I've needed to set up real-time dashboards in the past, I found it to be much simpler to use OLTP as the backend, with queries that pull relatively small amounts of recent data from tables that have purpose-made indexes.",

Either there’s some skill set mismatch or things are dying by committee before anything gets going. Beyond that the approach is somewhat similar for most text data, but the details and quality of output show up based on what you’re actually trying to read. Using legal docs as an example I’ve seen arbitration transcripts that have wild formatting differences simply based on which transcription vendor was used. Can’t do much about that other than adapt to what you’ve got. IMO just pick a set of tools and start playing with it. You can spend months trying to over plan at the beginning just to find out at implementation none of that planning caught something that would have been obvious on day one had you just gone for it.Pick some arbitrary fixed chunk size to start, add a reranking step, then test with a cheap model so you don’t rack up a bunch of costs. Once you start playing with it (with a real user involved) the next steps start to become apparent. You’ll start to see deficiencies that give some intuition on what meta data might be helpful. Also, the more traditional filter that can be used without becoming a pain to the user, the better. I’ve seen some absolutely crazy amounts of effort put into mapping infinite possibilities of classification that could have been solved with a dropdown. (Don’t have an LLM try to figure out which of 15 cases the user is referring to based on a vague query when it’s no big deal to have them select it themselves and massively narrow down the documents being parsed).",

Ensure idempotency of the pipeline, have test cases for the transformations. The list is infinite. So just validate, test and log against the things that you feel are most pressing. Handling data pipelines is mostly firefighting. You cannot plug all gaps. So follow the usual pipeline conventions and build a simple solution and add on things as and when there is a issue/need. Do not add features for the sake of features.There is no one true guide, since architecture mostly depends upon the issue in hand and a person's experience.You are already on the right track with the questions you have asked.

Use doc and chunk hashes so you only re-embed on change. For verification, skip a heavy UI at first: store JSON in Git, validate with JSON Schema + SQLFluff, compile with SQLGlot, run dry-run and unit tests (golden answers) in CI, and require PR approval from a data lead; you can add a thin reviewer page later. Guardrails: allowlist schemas/views, read-only, auto-apply LIMIT/time windows, cap bytes scanned, and normalize dialects; cache successful NL→SQL pairs and invalidate by lineage. Error handling: map common engine errors and retry with fixes; keep a timeout. I’ve used dbt and Cube for the semantic layer, with DreamFactory to auto-generate RBAC’d REST APIs over Snowflake/SQL Server so the agent only hits curated endpoints.

It seems more likely to me that he had an internally consistent idea like that in his head, and named the two measures a little oddly, than that he'd have confused a semi-additive fact for a fully-additive one. I do totally agree that if that's the case, these column names aren't very clear.At the end of the day, though, remember this is just an example to clarify the principles being communicated. If you get to the correct understanding of principles, that's all that really matters.

They were recently purchased by a VC firm and it seems like they're milking them until they lose all customers and die a quiet death. But aside from that, yes Talend acts weird. I had to delete and re-add modules regularly. I believe it's due to the code it generates being out of order when you make too many changes.",

There are a bunch including some open source offerings. It’s Java, so you’re crossing a boundary when passing data around,  remember things like encoding and all the transformations are Java functions.It’s a piece of piss but I haven’t touched it for about 10 years. I think you had to combine a workflow with mappings to get it to do useful (multi threaded) stuff but I can’t remember the nomenclature. One thing I remember was you could export your mapping to a Java package and therefore just edit the code, which sounds nice but rather defeats the point of low code tooling! Informatica I always found to be a disgusting pile of obfuscated horror but maybe that’s me.Most likely you had out of date metadata, I’d guess.

Do this, while learning to leverage AI in enhancing your productivity in your coding work + embedding agents into your platform frameworks, and you’ll set yourself up for success and lots of learning fun :-))",

If you want I can pm you and show you the project. I'm really excited about it and have been obsessively working on it on the past days and I am dying to talk about it with someone hahahah But the idea is: the scripts collect some really interesting alternative data from the game that couldn't really be gathered manually and do creative stuff with it. For example: by analyzing 5 days of scraped chat data I found out players that play past midnight are willing to pay a huge premium on some of the items on the game since there are less active players past midnight that could sell them the item. So I bought some of those items before going to sleep, woke up early the next day (5am), Opened a jupyter notebook to analyze my \"chat\\_history\" database, and contacted the players that were still online to sell them the items at a premium.",

It all comes down to your needs, if you have only a couple of standard sources / destinations, you can use a pre-built no code tool, even though i do not like tools that have a vendor lock-in with no open source option. But i am a developer, so for a DE team that has no dedicated software engineers, they may be an option, but keep in mind that those tools usually are hardly extendable, so if in the future you come across an exotic datasource that you cannot read with them, you have to build bridges (like python scripts as an intermediary step) that write the data into a database from which the tool then can read and so on...My recommendation: If you have dedicated software engineers, use something like dlthub, if not, you may consider something like windsor. If you have someone that manages your infra, but do not develop your own software, you have other options like Airbyte, which is open source, extendable and has a graphical interface, but i never used it in production, so take that with a pinch of salt.Best regards",

To me this isn’t about blocking marketing or “never letting them make technical decisions.” That’s gatekeeping, and it usually creates more tension than it solves.Marketing people are adults. They can understand trade-offs and deal with consequences just like everyone else. The real problem is usually not who suggested a tool, but who actually owns the process and the outcomes.If ingestion is owned by the data team, then the data team should make the final call. If marketing owns the workload and carries the operational risk, then they can make the decision. Just make ownership explicit and you avoid the “how could you allow this?” gaslighting scenario entirely.Also, you don’t want to become the “no person” who rejects every tool non-engineers propose. That kills collaboration. Better approach is:1. define the owner 2. list the requirements 3. evaluate trade-offs together 4. let the owner decideSometimes a no-code tool is the right choice. Sometimes it isn’t. But shutting non-technical teams out of the decision entirely almost always backfires.",

Agree on an exit path upfront: how to export raw data, how to rehydrate if you leave, and who funds the switch.Pressure-test vendor lock-in: do they support CDC or at least webhooks, raw landing in object storage, and schema-change handling? Add simple data contracts for key tables so ownership survives tool swaps.Stack-wise, Windsor could handle common marketing connectors; keep dlt for oddball sources; Airbyte is a nice middle when you need open-source and extendable. I’ve paired Fivetran for paid connectors, Airbyte for customs, and DreamFactory to expose curated tables as REST for downstream tools without new microservices.Bottom line: pick the owner, set SLOs and costs, time-box a pilot, and keep a clear exit plan.",

A job doesn't need to be something you're passionate about, a job needs to be something you can tolerate doing every day, even on days you're feeling uninspired, even on days you kinda feel like shit. Having at least mild interest in the job helps with that, but it's not the focus. Interest and passion is something that better comes from your *life*. A job is how you pay for it.My direction after art school was getting a phd in math and working in machine learning, and that's something I never would have thought I would find fun until I did it. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone else, it was just something I resonated with when exploring, and my interest in it is unique to me. What I would recommend is not being afraid to change direction if you realize the path you're on is making you miserable. If you really can't stand compsci, don't power through the degree, all that does is set you up to do something every day that you hate. But if you pivot, don't look for passion, look for stability, for contentment with the day to day. A good sign is if something seems *kinda fun*. Not amazing, not cool, not noble, not virtuous. Kinda fun. Kinda fun is where it's at.",

It's disappointing but usually the point of degrees is to get a good source of income, what the current state of degrees in your country's economy is matters too. Edit; but take my advice with a grain of salt. Because if you are ready to face any economic hardship, or living in shitty apartments or not having any stable career, if you have enough passion (not just interest eg '\" I really like this but I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it either but true burning passion & dedication)) you know what you want with it and if you're ready to face anything for it, who knows there is always a possibility it'll work out",

        "body": "My background:I graduated with a master's in CS about a year ago. I'm still looking for work, but part of this was my own doing for not doing a technical internship while I was in school and not doing more personal projects (I want to teach as a 2nd career, so I tutored/did teaching jobs for CS during my summers. At the time tech was still stable, so I did not think I had to do a technical internship. You live, make choices, and you learn). I'd think about first why you hate CS and why you have negative feelings about it. For people I've tutored, usually their hatred for CS was resentment for not pursuing their passions, feelings of frustration for not understanding the material (often trying to do the work alone), math phobias, not connecting with the material, or a mixture of those reasons. All extremely valid reasons and reasons often reliant on your environment (bad profs, depression, lack of community, etc). Before you decide to jump ship from CS, be extremely honest with yourself. Did you give CS your full effort? This means if you had the time, did you attend Office hours, talk to your professors, try to talk to peers, go to tutoring (if you could afford/uni offered it), join CS clubs, etc? If the answer is no, then something was holding you back from giving it a full shot, so you need to figure out what that is and if it's within your control to get past it. Some people, even with the best tutors, need more time to learn STEM subjects than the 4 years expected out of uni- this is completely normal, but may not be a financial option for all students (which is an unfortunate position to be during later years of uni and will require some tough decisions).If you have managed to stay in your CS program this far without acidemic probation, then you likely understand *some* aspects of code, but too many knowledge gaps are there to make you see the big picture (which in CS is important, its when everything begins to click). With enough hustle, I think you can salvage the rest of your degree and make it through- but this will require complete humility to get there. You making this reddit post in full honesty about your knowledge gaps makes me think you might be able to do it. Next steps would be scheduling meetings with your profs, get a tutor if possible, talk to your GTAs, joining study groups, etc. The key part of wanting anyone to support you in your success is to take the initiative (with humility) and be consistent (show up, do the work). I've had students reach out to me with failing grades halfway through the course with humility, and it was that act of bravery that lead to them passing the class (if they put the work in).My best advice is to find a prof you like/trust in your CS department and have an honest convo with them. I'd also schedule an appointment with career services and talk to them too (you pay a ton of money to be in uni- use your resources!!!). Ask them if there is a realistic way for you to finish your degree with the knowledge gaps or if it's for the best you switch. I know plenty of people that made CS a minor and switched to business with a technical component- there could be options you aren't aware of, but you need to have those conversations with people who have that knowledge.Even if you do switch- get that internship! It's extremely important in this job market, and the easiest way to get and prove you have experience.Good Luck! Always happy to chat further. I have personally supported many CS students to find the acidemic path right for them (even if it meant a different major) and also helped many find the fun in CS to get through it (a lot actually went from hating to loving CS). I will say in learning anything, community is extremely important to help you get over hurdles and where you need to go, so don't take any resources you have for granted :)",

All of those just cause you to use a wrong variable or one that is in the wrong state.* No state checks all over that try to silently recover from state being messed up. Deliberately code in a way that crashes asap if something is in the wrong state.",

Just like it is really, really easy to keep a language active, while mainly using another. If you are really worried to loose progress in C++, start a side project. It only needs to be 2-3 hours a month to be enough, just to remind yourself of the language once in a while. All in all, I don't think it's worth fighting the college over language choice. It's always easier and less friction to just use what they want you to, because all the help you can get from TAs and material is made for that language. And you are either learning a non-language-specific skill, or it's reasily transferrable anyways.",

You get to focus on the concepts they're teaching you rather than waste time on the C++ syntax and errors, and 2. It's easier for those who come into uni with little to no experience in programming. If I were you, I'd learn Python as part of my courses, and do projects with C++ in personal projects. Personal projects are amazing when you lack experience by the way, employers always asked me about the personal projects I have in my resume in interviews when I was a student. Also, being good at more languages is ALWAYS a plus, it increases opportunities you can apply for AND makes it so much easier to learn other languages cuz you'd see a pattern of common things between languages. It's true that Python is getting more and more popular, some of my projects would have been brutal without the Python libraries, but there's always jobs that require C++. Finally, remember, you're not cheating on C++ if you learn Python (no judgement, I felt like I was too).Good luck and enjoy programming!",

If the decision is dependent on your major take a step back to think about why you're in college. Also python and c++ are kinda in different realms so again what are YOU planning to do? (Pls don't come at me like I have 10+ years in the industry I am a college student with 3 years of IT experience, just trying to help someone who is in the same point I was in at one point.)",

You're just dealing with impostor syndrome as most of us did at one point or another.What killed it for me was being assigned a complicated task where I was allowed to \"fail safely\". I designed a security library for a backend system I was working on where I consulted a senior dev for opinions on what the tokens should look like, etc, but the implementation was all up to me, and the deadline for it was loose to give me the time to hash through things that worked and things that didn't work and try out different ways of writing the thing. I had no experience at all in this domain, but once I got it to finally start working, I felt like I could do *anything*, and that mentality has carried me forward to where I am now.

I also buy lower spec systems because it performs faster even with lower end hardware. Windows 10 broke something with my PC almost every time I updated it, I have less issues even with Arch.

Windows is designed to be easy to use even if you don’t know what you’re doing but that comes at a cost to flexibility. Linux is much more flexible in part because it’s designed by many people over time and in part because it was always meant to be, it’s open source meaning if you need a smaller or faster version you could just build one (which people have done eg Alpine which is a minimum computer with none of the fluff perfect for a server that isn’t designed for anything else — no need for mouse support on a machine that doesn’t even physically exist on its own). It’s also habit and preference. I can switch back to using Windows (and actually have to for some older software at work) but it’s annoying. Because Linux and MacOS are both built on UNIX as a base switching between them, writing into a shell window that is remotely connected to your server from your Mac machine for example, is much easier.",

There are a lot of reasons why, IMO, developing on Linux is better -- you could make solid arguments that doing development on Linux is easier, faster, and more secure -- but none of those things matter if the people who will be buying your game are on Windows.Servers, on the other hand, aren't normally run by end users, and aren't even normally run on desktop systems. Professional environments will usually buy hardware that is intended just for running a specific server, and if you're not already locked into using a specific OS, there's little reason to not pick the one that you have full control over and isn't bloated with things you don't need.To be fair, that's been shifting a lot in recent years thanks to Proton. Prior to the release of the Steam Deck in 2022, Linux desktop share had been stuck at around 1% on the Steam hardware surveys for basically forever; but it's been steadily climbing since then, and it recently crossed 3% for the first time ever. 3% still isn't a lot, but tripling Linux's desktop share in three years after decades of stagnation is pretty incredible. We're at the point now where all of the big engines are multi-platform, and Proton can run 95% of games that are Windows-only (not counting games with kernel-level anti-cheat software), so sticking with Windows for development is increasingly becoming completely optional... and why stick with it if you can get a better developer experience on Linux but still deliver a game to Windows customers?",

What the CLI app does doesnt matter a ton, maybe its a thin wrapper around git, maybe just checks the weather from some external api. The key is that you are able to talk about your experience creating the CLI app on your resume and in an interview. As for the API, I have only had experiences with a basic CRUD and REST HTTP Apis. If you want to use something newer go for that! But as others have said, it would be best to use some form of enterprise framework. If you dont know any, dont worry too much! Just get a first draft out there and start applying! Take inspiration from something you care about in life, i built a movie tracking api, pretty much a letterboxd.com clone when i was trying to beef up my resume for my first job.Being able to talk about the standard coding practices like DRY, DI, OOP would be good too. While i dont personally ask that in my interviews, i've been on the other side where the interviewer cares a lot about those textbook best practices.Adventurous-Date9971 listed out a lot of \"the other stuff\" besides the main programming language, and those would 100% help to make you stand out, but take it all in baby steps!

Tech is arguably one of the most community oriented STEM fields out there, especially evident in it's history. Lean into this strength!I guarentee you have at least 5 classmates who feel exactly like you. Next time you go to class, talk to a few classmates and ask them if they are doing any side projects, how they feel about leetcode, etc. Do not feel discouraged if you hear a few people talk about their side projects/ease with leetcode- find comfort in being aware of people more knowledgeable than you in your community- you can learn a lot from them! Once you got enough feelers, start figuring out what you want to do with that info. Is someone working on a side project that sounds interesting? Then see if you can do something similar or ask if there is any way you can join in on it. Are a lot of students struggling too? Then form a study group together and collectively figure out what projects you can work on either together (get that github practice in) or independently. Even if you are surrounded by many people who \"have it together\", ask them what got them there and how you can be more involved. Whatever you do with the feelers, make sure it's rooted in community and doing work consistently. Personal projects have really frustrating hurdles, so you need that support system to get you to keep going.Your professors are also goldmines of knowledge too, so ask them what types of personal projects you can work on or some general guidance- literally email them to schedule a meeting.If there is one thing college gives you, it's the opportunity to connect with people (your first network). One of the best lessons I took away from college is it only takes one person to get the momentum to build a community- so if you can't find community that will help you grow, then that is a sign you need to put in the work to build it. The other big lesson I learned in college is that people really admire someone who openly wears humility and accountability on their sleeve- it builds trust and leaves room for stronger connections to grow.Whenever I have feelings of imposter syndrome kicking in with thoughts like \"I could never achieve x\", I pause and ask myself \"But why not me?\". And I keep asking why until I have measurable steps I can take to improve.Hope that helps! Even with the stuff we are passionate about, it's easy to feel lost or overwhelmed when we try to tackle it alone.

The real metric of general knowledge/skill is what projects you have made. Since you say you haven't made anything, the best time to start making a project is right now, whenever you have some free time to spare. Pick something you find interesting and just start making it. The hardest thing is looking at a blank editor, but once you write the first few lines (even if it's just a bunch of comments outlining the general program flow you are going to implement), you'll naturally fall into a pipe-line of problems you have to solve, allowing you to iteratively reach a solution over time. There's no shame in using google or any other forms of documentation, everyone does it, and if they don't then they're either lying or making something trivial. The only thing I'd avoid, or at least use with extreme caution, is any form of generative A.I. Ideally, you'd use it as a tool or a tutor, asking it to explain concepts or answer some questions you might have. However, in reality most people (especially beginners/learners!) fall into the trap of having the A.I. do everything for them, and essentially \"outsource\" their thinking to the machine. By that point, you may as well not waste your time, since you will learn nothing.You should also avoid falling into the trap of \"collecting\" languages as if they are Pokemon. You should be focusing on language-agnostic concepts, which can be implemented in a variety of languages (some of which will be better suited than others to whatever you're making). Of course, it's ideal to have a basic grasp of the language you are going to use, but if you're firm in your language-agnostic concepts, it will be easy to just pick up the syntax along the way.As an answer to your question, it's definitely not over. You just need to change your approach to education. And you need to ask yourself if you really enjoy Computer Science, because if you do, then everything you do will feel a lot less arduous.",

When you look at something like mathematics, or really most subjects you take in school, you can see this level like structure where most things you learn earlier support nearly everything you learn later. Eventually you have to specialize and your field will have knowledge that is specific to it, and not applicable to other experts.I’ve found that with programming, it doesn’t really neatly fit into a nice sequence, because it’s far less sequential, and far more parallel. You learn *out* rather than you learn *up* if that makes any sense. And you advance in terms of your general maturity, rather than specific knowledge building on each other as theorems imply further theorems. The other thing is that programming sits in this place between academia and a trade, where there’s a ton of “craft” and professional knowledge that exists in the form of essentially folk wisdom transmitted via forums and blogs, not books. All that is to say, it’s harder to curate a list like you imagine, and there’s going to be way more disagreement about it when they do.Here is a list of articles about software which I think are all excellent, but decidedly mostly on the advanced side.

It’s the kind of book that starts with stuff where you’re like “Yeah, obviously” and then a couple chapters later you’re going “WHAT?!” People tend to have strong opinions about it one way or the other; I think it’s brilliant and should be on pretty much every programmer’s to-read list, but plenty of people think it’s overrated. Given that it’s free, it’s worth a try.* [*Concrete Mathematics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics) is, as the title suggests, focused on the math side of CS, but since this is where most programmers are weakest, it’s worth mentioning. One of its authors, Donald Knuth, is more famous for his advanced work, but *CM* is suitable for pretty much anyone who is confident about the bare bones of programming but wants to understand it more deeply.",

He wrote a compiler that only outputs MOV instructions but is still Turing complete. He wrote a thing that when you reverse engineer it, it displays pictures from your own hard drive, as a deterrent to reveng further. He hacked into ring -2 on an x86 processor - you don’t know what ring -2 is? Neither did anyone else until he hacked it. He wrote Cantor Dust to suggest what the next gen of reveng tools should look like. Man is a legend.

It teaches craftsmanship: naming, structure, clarity, and how to think about code quality in any language.2. **Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler:** One of the most important books if you want to write and improve maintainable code. You will learn patterns, code smells, and how to gradually improve structure without breaking things.3. **Design Patterns (Gang of Four):** The foundational book on object-oriented design patterns. It’s dense, but once you get the concepts, you’ll start seeing these patterns everywhere in real projects.These aren’t low-level, but they’re the kind of books that make you a better programmer overall, they improve how you think about code, structure, and long-term maintainability, regardless of whether you’re writing Python, C, Java, or anything else.",

Bonus: If you really want to annoy people, go take the position that soap with xsd-defined payloads is more precise, more extensible, and can be more secure than rest with json (it is) and that devs were simply too lazy to learn the spec. It’s a bit better now that swagger (open api) is more mainstream, but for a while rest was a real pain to consume.The next thing to remember is that your reaction is valid and you’re often going to have more tailored controller services for web front ends. These aren’t enterprise APIs. They’re part of the same logical application and are only services because the halves run on two different computers. Otherwise they would just be helper or data layer methods. We do this because chattiness and sequential service call latency is the death of web pages. So if a commonly used page needs a getMyStuff composite method that returns a splittable json payload in one hit, that’s not crazy. If you need that to be available generically, you can expose a graphql or composite endpoint that allows you to specify an object and specific children and fields. Try not to make something that creates security or sql injection problems.",

You don't see YouTubers doing it for the same reason TV cooking shows have \"one already made\" in the oven to skip over the step most people find tedious to witness. But in terms of actual practice: doing that gives you insight into how different patterns overlap (or are even the same pattern wearing a different moustache) and it's *great* for building your capabilities.Ideally, for maximum safety, you have tests in place before making changes like that so you can confirm that a change that was just \"saying the same thing more clearly\" doesn't actually break the program. But the importance of doing that scales with the number of people on the project, the likelihood someone who didn't write your code becomes responsible for maintaining it, and lines of code in the project; for a small, personal project, one script, one file of functions, that kind of testing might be overkill.(To put on my guy-who's-been-at-this-for-thirty-three-years philosopher's hat: programming is different from other engineering disciplines because the description of the thing we do very nearly *is* the thing we do. It's like magic... Like *old* magick. \"The name of the thing is the thing.\" If you find yourself only being able to put two hands on a problem after you've written one crack at how to solve it, that's *extremely* normal, because you describe the problem with words but also solve it with words. As you gain more experience you often can do more of that work in your head and you'll see more problems that you immediately go \"Oh I'll just solve that with X\" because you've solved a nearly-identical problem before, but looking at the code you just wrote and going \"Oh it'd be easier if I just\\~\" is extremely normal. Programmers aren't rock-stars; we're *writers*. Much like an author realizing a deeper truth about their characters after making a first draft, we often grasp our problems better one we have *one* solution for them on the table.)",

I just use google and look at the AI result. If I need more clarification, I'll read reddit/stackoverflow posts, and the documentation for the languagefor example, I was learning async/await in javascript. Sure, AI just gave me the answer, \"put this code here and it'll work\", but that isn't learning. So I took that information, put the code in, then tried messing with it. I modified it to work with different features, etc etc. Read the MDN docs on async/await, and probably spent a good few hours just messing with async/await to try and understand it. I could have just thrown the AI result into my program and moved on, because it did work how I wanted it to, but I would've been right back where I started when I initially googled the question",

The web languages are important to learn on a practical side, but alone they won’t make you a programmer. So HTML, CSS, JS can all be learnt together afterwards. You will probably also want to do some basic React after this. Node.js is easy to pick up if you already know a backend language in depth, and becomes more touch and go at this point.Networking is another box to tick.

Fundamentals of programming in C (procedural) and theory about computer systems. 2. Object oriented programming in C# or Java and theory on garbage collection, runtimes etc 3.

The company I work for uses Thinkpads exclusively for all of us and we frequently bring them to our plants where the environment is not always the best.2. *Raspberry Pi* - all you need is at least a Raspberry Pi 3B+, a keyboard, a mouse, and a TV, or, if you can grab hold, get a Raspberry Pi 400 kit with the PSU and the mouse. Then, all you need is a TV with HDMI. They are full-fledged Linux computers that can basically run anything (not very fast, though, but far sufficient for learning)3.

Don't try to come up with \"the perfect\" project. Just choose something you have at least some interest in, ideally something you can use yourself. It should also be relatively small, so that you don't feel frustrated about not being able to finish it.A couple of suggestions off the top of my head:1. Just a simple intro page about yourself. Later you can introduce your other hobby projects there2. Habit tracker. You can use it to track whether you work on hobby projects every day :)3. Language learning toolOver time, you will have a much better idea of what and how you want to build.This simple habit accomplishes many things at the same time:1. Gives a lot of learning opportunity. You need to think what tools you need to use, how to use them, etc.2. Similar to 1, but it's more about some domain knowledge. e.g. if you decide to build a language learning tool, you'd probably research some established tools and will either copy their UI/UX or even improve them. You'd understand what challenges users have while using these kinds of apps, etc3. Builds confidence. Once you have a couple of very small projects under your belt, you can gradually move to more and more complex ones. Over time, you will feel more and more confident in your skills4. Builds your portfolio that you can show to your potential employer. Trust me, most employers(at least the ones I'd like to work for) would love to see you build stuff in your free time without anybody's direction.IMO AI is only scary for junior devs who can only follow simple directions of their employers and don't show any initiative. By building your own things, you will inevitably learn how to be more proactive which I don't think AI will be able to replicate in foreseeable future.",

They were once 7 year olds that were struggling to understand but writing code none-the-less.The biggest tips I have for learning to think like a programmer early on is to learn how to speak to a machine. You gotta treat it like a petty toddler that is going to do exactly what you tell it to, to. the. letter. Take a problem you want to solve break it down into smaller problems, then worry about combining them later. While you're doing that discard any features that aren't critical to accomplish the primary goal, this gets you a minimum viable product. Worry about bells and whistles after you got and MVP.Search Stack Overflow, reddit, and youtube for help and, if you really want to learn programming, ignore AI. Using AI will not make you a competent programmer it's robbing you of the headbanging frustration required to breakthrough to understanding. It can be a powerful tool used judiciously but you don't have the experience yet to know when to do that.",

Many people who are great programmers today felt the same way when they began.Using help on early projects is part of learning. What matters is that you read the code, experiment with it and start creating small pieces on your own. Begin with simple tasks, test them, and slowly build up from there. With each attempt, your confidence grows and your thinking becomes more structured.You are not behind and you are not missing anything.

Figuring out what it is he actually likes would likely show his real aptitude and can help you figure out actually get his attention. If you just want to teach “coding” principles to a 9 year old the best bet are probably puzzle or strategy games that they find engaging. It teaches them the basics of problem solving and following procedures. I think of games like Portal, Zelda, Tomb Raider, Uncharted… Games where you do You do A and B to then be able to do C. Actual coding, might as well be teaching him French or Chinese. If he’s not into language, it’s kinda school-like. Remember what we do is solve problems by writing repeatable procedures. What motivates us to actually code? Somebody with money will pay us to solve their problems, while maybe personal problems motivate us for personal projects. What motivates a 9 year old, or what personal problems could they solve through coding? If you can figure that out, you may have a better chance to get his attention earlier to more “practical” applications.",

That isn't to say getting a certification would definitely be worthless, but in my mind, if your goal is to be able to show a potential employer \"Hey, I can do X thing,\" it's actually probably more effective to just focus on talking about interesting projects you've done (don't need to be external to school, can just be school assignments or final projects) at a level that shows that you have a good conceptual grasp of what you were doing, along with some experience with the tools that are common to the industry you're interested in. Tools that you might get asked about are ones related to version control (e.g., git), debugging (e.g., gdb), and unit testing (lots of options, and you may not use anything formal for this purpose, which is also OK). It is not necessary to fully master any one tool, you're just trying to signal \"Hey, I have used these tools as part of my process, and I can fairly quickly pick up different ones that do the same job.\"As for questions 3 and 4 about what else you should be doing right now and how to stand out, I will first say that I admire your willingness to think ahead. On the other hand, I will also say that you should not feel compelled to do extra work beyond what is already being assigned to you at school. This is because, imo, the amount of hard work and effort it takes to stand out is not worth the payoff *if* your only goal with that effort is to stand out a little more. Your driving motivator should just be what you're interested in, especially because what you're interested in may change, which can lead to you going into a different field than the one you're currently considering, at which point any past hyper-specific work done for the purpose of standing out may not be very useful to you.That being said, projects are a good place to start. A project can be anything you're interested in: a website, a game, a tool, an extension of a school project. The important thing is just that there's some overlap between your project and the field you're interested in. For example, if you think you might want to work in embedded systems, then building a web app won't help you very much (it may still help a little, though). However, you want to be willing to devote some proper time to it -- probably at least 50 hours in total, spread out over the course of a summer or school year.",

Just grinding won't get you further. Your brain will just get overloaded and shut down.A little story from my experience: when Java came out, I was already programming for over a decade and was proficient in multiple procedural languages. Then, I tried Java and OOP. This was a humbling experience. I could not make heads or tails at all. The *language* was easy enough to understand, but switching from procedural to OOP didn't click at all. I tried many times and failed many times until at one point, it suddenly started to make sense. Can't even say what really did it for me.Now, my advice is to program something with it and here, I deviate from the common examples: build a *library* for card games, like Blackjack, Poker, Uno, etc. Start with modeling a single `Card`. It has a suit, a rank, a numeric value, a face, a back, it can be face up or down - the fields. The card can report its data - provided it is face up, it can draw itself (in a loose sense), it can be flipped - toggle face up/down.Then, go further: make a `Deck` that can hold a full set of cards, that can be shuffled, that can deal cards, that can tell if it is empty or not, etc.Next, a `Hand` that takes cards.And so on.Build it in such a way that you can create different `Card` types, e.g. PokerCard, UnoCard, etc. All these can use the `Deck` without modification.With such an exercise, you'll cover abstract classes, inheritance, composition, polymorphism. The benefit is that you can draw a relation between a real world object and its digital representation.",

I am not sure what university you go to or how they teach it there, but in general I don't think they teach it very well and you certainly have not had enough classes to be this hard on yourself.OOP is not just a Java thing either. You can think of it as real life and that is why it is supposed to make sense once you understand that. Classes are just descriptions of things. Objects are instances of that description.Use animals as an example. Mammals are a class that describes things with hair. So, hasHair == true. Some mammals are land animals and some are sea animals. So, where == \"land | sea\". A lion (subclass) \"Inherits\" the attributes of a mammal and adds a few more attributes like sharp teeth. So, hasTeeth == true && hasBigTeeth == true && isDangerous == true :). A pig is a mammal too and it \"inherits\" from mammal too. Some of the attributes it shares with a lion has different values. If we were to control a lion or a pig we call the \"run\" function, the lion will have a faster run implementation than the pig. \"Polymorphism\". We typically hide the implementation and field access to make code less brittle. We would not want someone binding directly to something we want to be able to change later. We make these attributes and internal functions private. \"Encapsulation\". There should be a subclass of mammal that lion inherits from named \"LandAnimal\". Now this part gets tricky because Java does not support multiple inheritance so we want to use hasA vs isA implementation. When we access the base class LandAnimal which actually has the \"run\" method which is slower in pigs than in lions \"polymorphism\" again. LandAnimal is an \"abstraction\" (or base class) of Lion (isA LandAnimal). Or we can use interfaces for this \"abstraction\" (hasA LandAnimal) interface (composition).I just wrote this from the top of my head so I hope it makes sense and is correct.I hope this helps. Relax a little, go easy, and don't give up. You will get it.",

When you sleep, all that learning and information that seems a bit of a jumble is going to be reorganized in your mind and memory. And it only happens when you are sleeping. You also need to take some time off to exercise and get some fresh air because your brain won't work at its best if it is overwhelmed with stress. You have to let some of it out.

Meet with EM's and PM's again to break down further and cut scope if needed.From here I usually have a good idea of what is needed, the requirements in terms of performance, accessibility, delivery time frames, apis, storage etc.Now I usually try and research any unknowns etc, high level data structures and apis to use. This involves prototypes and a lot of throw away code. Sometimes reading papers etc.This will usually result in some form of document, DACI etc that can be shared to gain consensus, get alignment amongst EM and PM etc.Then all of this gets thrown away and we do the actual work cause none of this stands up to reality... as deadlines loom, VPs change their mind on priorities, marketing doesn't agree with what we are delivering, teams that we rely on to deliver their features descope and no longer support what we are doing...

        "body": "Basic project management, and this is something that I fought with every day in my former job as PMO head.If your job is to manage a software project, then you need to act like a project manager, not a software developer. Project management is pretty simple (in theory), but often difficult for technically-oriented people. For example, the manufacturing department came to us (IT) and told us that they were developing a new product and putting up a new production building for it. The project was assigned to an ERP solution architect, who immediately saw that this is an ERP project - implementing a new BOM (bill of materials) and warehouse management for the new site. This was designed, built, tested, and delivered. But, because he was an ERP solution architect, and not a trained project manager, he completely ignored the whole infrastructure side of the project - it was a new building, so it needed cabling, WiFi routers, client devices, and a new conference room. This only popped up a few weeks before the \"ribbon cutting\" on the new site, when someone came around and asked when we were going to install the hardware, and no one knew what he was talking about. We were literally pulling cables inside the building while the CEO was outside talking to the local news teams announcing the start of production. So, my advice to anyone who is given a project to lead: First, stop and think. Ask yourself if you really see the ENTIRE problem that needs to be solved. THEN break it down into manageable chunks, and plan each one of those in terms of resources and efforts. Once the plan has been agreed and the necessary resources are on board, THEN you start designing the solution (either traditional/sequential project, or a series of agile sprints).",

My builds are so fast I haven't even bothered to enable pre-compiled headers.My laptop is moderately high-end, but it seems crazy to me that a personal project of a beginner programmer can be so slow that it affects workflow. But I've seen multiple questions along these lines, so it must be a common problem. Does anyone know where do these C++ build speed problems come from? Are 3rd party libraries killing people? Or is there some memory size threshold where compilation suddenly start thrashing? Or are beginners falling into some bad practice traps?",

But each time you build something new, try and apply the things you’ve read about. Read a design pattern and then pick something at random and build it with applying that pattern as the main focus. It doesn’t have to be anything complex, keep it simple. Then improve it. I felt the same way after developing in React for 2 years. I never felt like my skills were where I wanted them to be. One day I stumbled across a video from Brian Vaughn on virtualization, a design that allows data grids to “infinite scroll” as you only render what is coming into the viewport and immediately unmount those elements when they are out of view. I had used well known libraries for this prior, but watching his presentation gave me an insight into “how” he implemented this idea in his library react-virtualized.I went off and tried to build my own little library that could do the same. I dropped the “I’m not gonna re-invent the wheel” mindset, and instead just said I’m gonna sit here and get something working if it takes me all month. Instead of querying GPT for answers, I just broke it down into small bites. “How do I unmount something when it goes out of view? How do I detect when something is coming into view?” Etc.” In the end, my little library worked well enough for me to be super proud that I figured this out, and the amount I learned during the process was pretty wild. I use this example because it was the first of what would become many of these little “let me see if I can make a basic version of this” exercises. This has helped me far far more than than tutorials, countless hours reading and such. Hope this helps! TLDR; BUILD",

That sounds like you are having trouble seeing the bigger picture and you can’t get started on a bigger project. You’re getting stuck conceptually, even if you know the basics of programming.What you need to do for your C# project is use whatever resources were given to you during the class to make a working entry point into the project. If you can run the project and get the UI to pop up on screen then the first hurdle is over. After that, you’ll need to write out a big list of what needs to be completed and then order that list based on what you think needs to be done first. Don’t go back to tutorials or your textbook, just knock out each item on the list. Use google if you need to, read the C# docs if you need to, but don’t tell yourself you need to go back to the beginning and start doing something you already know how to do.",

Over time, some things will be more familiar as you do them over and over again. That is how I do it.As for a better way to get better, projects, projects, projects :)Pick small projects to start with and add the next small thing to it, then the next small thing, and so on.I am literally going to paste this from another comment I just wrote about an hour ago:Start small and keep it simple. Let the project guide what you need to learn next. I almost always suggest the often dismissed TODO exercise to start with since you already have some base knowledge.Start small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. EDIT: fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. An address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.You will get this. Best wishes.",

Using AI like this is pretty much the best way to kneecap any learning a beginner does.In the beginning stages, you are honestly *training* yourself as much as you are learning - you have to build up your mind, to be able to handle the abstractions and prolonged mental effort programming requires. I find most beginners fail not because they can't find the right knowledge, but because they never get their mind \"in shape\" enough.Coding assistants can be fine for already skilled developers, people who already have the types of habits one needs to be successful. But for a beginner it can prevent you from doing the kind of hard mental work you need to be doing in order to get your brain in shape.Think of it like you're training to go on backwoods adventures, hiking and climbing mountains and trudging through forests. When you go on your big backpacking trip, sure, you'll probably get in a truck and drive to the trailhead - that's fine. But when you're starting out training and going \"I'm going to walk a few miles every day to build up my endurance\", it wouldn't make very much sense to just drive those miles every day instead and still call it training, right?Ditch the AI until you reach the point when you're smarter than the AI. AI is kryptonite for learners when they used it to do things they can't already easily do, save it until you get to tasks where you're like \"I've done this 100 times on my own, I don't need to bore myself the 101st time, I'll get AI to generate it because this task is too easy to challenge me\".",

Arranging those makes digital logic circuits (half, full adder, flip-flops etc.). Many of those make an ALU (the bit of the CPU that does this stuff). Each instruction is N bits, of which some bits tell the circuitry which op, some tell it the operands (what to operate on, e.g. register, immediate value etc.). These instructions can be written in assembly text or directly in machine code, which your compiler will output for a given architecture when writing in a high level language (e.g. C, C++...). Instructions are composed to do useful work. The more instructions the CPU implements directly, the less work for the compiler, and vice versa.Sometimes there's an additional level of translation in between the circuitry and the machine code, called microcode, which allows CPU makers to correct bugs with firmware updates, rather than millions of people mailing back their CPUs :D I don't know if such primitive ops (shifts etc.) are microcoded or hardwired off hand, but I suspect the latter.",

But if you don't impress them with your audition, none of it will matter.So your primary focus should be to learn the skills, don't worry about the credential because it's the least important thing.The good news is that there are tons of completely free resources to learn to code online.My suggestion is rather than worrying about which one is the most likely to lead to a career, focus on which one is the best fit for you. The first course you pick won't determine your career trajectory, the goal is simply to get you from zero to coding. Once you get the hang of coding, you can pivot to different languages depending on your interests and goals.Here are three suggestions for very high-quality free courses. All three of them are a fantastic way to go from zero to coding, even though they teach very different things. They have very different styles and teach different languages, but all are valid first steps.

If you do quality work, you get more projects, but if you mess up then they stop giving you projects.The longer you build that experience, the better you will do in an interview for a more steady job.It took me 2 years of tutoring, 1 year of remote tech work, and reaching out to dozens of recruiters before I got a foot-in-the-door at a large tech company",

Week 10 of CS50x has a video in the seminars section called *'Flying the nest'* which explains how to install it, WSL, the CS50 tools, and some general tips for customising your IDE to your taste. With your own local install, you'll be well set up for all your future coding projects regardless of what course or other method you end up choosing. If you don't like watching the lectures, you could just skip the video and read the lecture notes instead. Then jump into the problem sets. It's a great introductory course that does set you up well to expand your learning in different directions. Just reading documentation would be an unnecessarily hard road considering the multitudes of resources available these days. Docs aren't really a learning resource for new programmers. They're written expecting the reader to have a certain level of knowledge already. But I'm sure a quick search would bring up loads of free and paid courses, and other resources. Any source recommending CS50 will likely recommend others too. My tip as an educator, is to pick whatever you want. It doesn't really matter as long as you're making forward progress. But really try to stick to it. Consistency, and a good sleep schedule are the keys to success in learning.",

Is able to reproduce his error and describe it. Is willing to ask for help. Has some idea where the issue is NOT. etc. He is proactive as much as he can. Yes, he struggles and is stuck. But he communicated with his team mates. Perhaps he has some ideas but does not know how to put these ideas into a code. But has a theoretical solution.Another one takes his task. During standups he says \"I'm working on it.\" Then \"I still need some more time.\" When being asked if he needs some help he goes with \"No. It is okay. I will figure it out.\" and so on. Or, if there are no morning standups but just some meeting in the end of the sprint (2 weeks or so) he just disappears for these days/weeks. In the end he has not progressed nowhere.With these two juniors it is clear that the first one is willing to learn. He is a team player and seeks help when he has done his part but still being stuck. He listens to the advice of his team mates. But the second one is a lost case. He does not function in a team and is unable to work on his tasks. He requires a constant handholding and even with handholding is unable to pick up any new knowledge. Eventually he either quits or is let go.Coding interviews are not just there to see if you can write code. How do you approach a problem. How do you analyze it. What you are trying and what you are not trying. How do you react to a stressful situation. How do you communicate with your \"team\" (your interviewers and such). etc.Either you succeeded or you failed. No point to worry over something that is out of your control. If you succeeded then well done. If you failed then ask them for a feedback in what was lacking and what you can improve in yourself before you start applying to jobs again.",

It's the only way you'll stay motivated to write code outside of class, build new things, and deal with the rapidly-changing landscape and job market (AI, new libraries, new tools, new approaches, refactors, \"breaking changes\", debugging, so on and so forth); at least that's how it is for me. I thought I hated programming, refused to even try it until I was 30, then I found out I'm good at it and I love it (I'm a little obsessive when it comes to programming now). Almost all of my friends who went to school for software engineering, thinking it'd land them a high-paying job (who never programmed outside of class) are all working in a different fields now. In a tight market, employers aren't interested in programmers who aren't interested in code.You've basically answered your own question. There's no reason to specialize in something you hate, nor in going to college if you hate it, for a degree you'll hate working in. Look into audio production and audio engineering (that's somewhat different from straight \"music technology\"). However, you're kind of giving mixed signals. If you're into music and music software, what don't you like about the music technology you were introduced to (which, presumably, uses said software)? I tried being a musician a long while back, and I loved messing with MIDI devices and all the music MIDI and editing software. I liked messing with soundboards, and I think it'd be fun to be the sound mixer/tech at concerts (for example).If the idea is: You hate college, you hate all the degrees, but you're going to get one anyways. Pick something ***you can stand***. Something adjacent to what you want to do. For example, I got a business degree with an emphasis in entrepreneurship, because I've always wanted to start a small business (and as of now, I'm building out my presence as independent contractor for full stack software engineering). Yes, the degree is kind of worthless, and no it didn't ***really*** teach me much about building and sustaining a small business, but it all starts to add up.In my mind, it'd make way more sense for you to go to a technical school for audio production. It'll be cheaper, faster, and you might actually develop a stronger interest for it. Then, if it turns out you hate it, at least you didn't waste 4 years and $30,000 getting a degree you hate.",

You talk to someone - explain the problem to them in a calm and relaxed way, tell them what you have been trying, and ask if they have any suggestions.

Even if you don't get the exact answer, perhaps you'll get some input you can work with.Remember, the expected outcome is never the actual solution, the final product, the running code. When learning, the expected outcome is always that you try something, that you experiment with, work with the theory covered in the course. Sometimes problems do require a sudden insight that you shouldn't be expected to get, but more often they actually just require you to apply the material from the latest class.Most importantly, don't sit alone with your docs and LLM machines - talk to actual people, maybe those you are studying with, maybe someone completely unrelated.",

It was pain to switch between them during a single semester, but I was young and I was hungry to learn just everything. Now I am glad that I has this experience, I have enough basic knowledge to be able to learn any new language in short termIn my career I switched over dozen of main languages - delphi, c#, all kinds of sql dialects with stored procedures, almost all of jvm, erlang, python, shellLearning languages is mostly easy, exceptions are very developed and complicated languages like scala.

Like, why did I get an engineering degree? I was tired of making $12 as a security guard. Why am I now in a second degree program for data science? Turns out I don't like factory work. Oddly enough, in relation to one part of your post, my intro to data structures course was the first time I actually enjoyed coding because I found machine learning to be really fun when I did that as extra credit on an assignment. I'm not here to be crude or rude to you. The reality is you're in the same situation as a lot of us, and even more difficult because of your location. My main suggestion is to find your \"why\" and grab onto it. A lot of self help books emphasize that as well. The fact that you actually enjoy coding puts you ahead of where I was for a long time lol. Don't give up. Keep learning, trying, honing your skills.

Backend work is a perfectly solid direction, and the fact that you enjoyed wiring APIs to databases is a good sign. You do not need to be great at front end to have a career. You also do not need to master data structures in one pass. Most people only internalize that stuff once they use it in real projects.

College does not teach you mastery, only YOU can do that over time.The best way to get good at software engineering is to build projects as others have suggested. You have a great base somewhere in your head :) to pull from. Start with something small and definitely do it full stack. If you focus on frontend only you will miss backend context. Same thing the other way around. To me, those two things go together.Start small and keep it simple. Let the project guide what you need to learn next. I almost always suggest the often dismissed TODO exercise to start with since you already have some base knowledge.Start small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, and the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. An address book, an small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from take TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skill you need to build any of these.Also, I have been doing this for over 30+ years and I pretty much only know (often remember) basic syntax. Things I have done before are familiar, but I still need to look almost everything up.Best wishes. You can do this.",

Or if there isn't, there will be people around to help typically. Plenty of people go QA -> Dev. Though actually seeing more QA -> Engineer Manager recently it seems. Have you considered that? ;). Seriously, easiest way to do it is to move within the organisation that you current work in. Depending on the company this can be either going up to one of the devs and saying, \"Hey, you know what, i'd like to move into dev here, what do you think and what should I be focusing on learning?\". Answer to that, pretty much always, is the companies codebase, which I assume is the one you opened, and go overwhelmed by so start by getting some help with that. Or, if you have a bit of a tougher gatekeep to deal with, move more towards the test automation side, do more coding day to day and again start to learn the code bases the devs are working on. For even the best recruiters, hiring from the market always has uncertainty, if I am looking for a dev, i'd pick somebody I know, who knows the codebase, the company and the people 11 times out of 10. Just put yourself in that position. Easy from there.",

I often try to find a string in the output that I can search for as a starting point (error messages if they are unique are great for this). I do a full project search and hope my string only shows up once. Then hopefully you have an IDE with \"go to definition\" and \"go to reference\" follow different function call and definitions to try to find where the logic for your bug is. If you don't have \"go to reference\" and \"go to definition\" you are stuck doing searches for function names and will be much slower. Trying to understand a .net project from the launch through all the routing is going through the hardest part with lots of magic Microsoft functions first which is really painful. Try finding something in the output or a name of something you know and work your way back to what logic creates that.",

Look at some of your old projects, try and add a new feature. It's easier to add something on to a working product, than it is to create a new product. Then, try start from the bottom. Make a simple project on your own, like a to-do list. Break the problem into smaller pieces, and then if you can't figure out those smaller pieces, Google it. As you keep working on the project you'll gain more understanding of what to use and when to use it, and you'll rely less on Google for the simpler stuff. It's important you don't try to Google the solution to your larger problem, but instead a smaller chunk of it. Splitting work down to the smallest piece possible is the best way I found to learn. If you get your to-do list done, keep adding to it. Sure, it starts simple, but you can expand it to do way more than it did before. Try and find a project to create that you're passionate about, that passion will translate to motivation to learn and create. Keep working on it, don't go too hard on yourself, and try to avoid videos that tell you exactly how to do a project if you feel you're ready to move on yourself.

You think of what it should do, come up with a plan on how to implement it, trial and error till you get the right result. Write down what you learn and what it does. Also a neat trick is ctrl clicking the class / function and locating and understanding why it works from the file. I do it all the time",

There’s a database where you save, change, fetch, or delete things.If you want a job in the field, you need to be able to build a todo list app. If you want to get paid well, you need to add things like authentication and AWS features to that same “todo list.”First step, learn how to make a basic todo list. After you build it once, try to rebuild it with minimal help.Making a todo list isn’t super easy, but it’s not very hard either.You can watch a one hour tutorial, build a todo list app, write to a database, use something simple like SQLite, and learn most of the core ideas.After that, think about what else the todo list needs. It needs authentication so other people can’t see your data. You need to host it somewhere like Vercel so you can access it online. You’ll probably need a backend, and to host that backend you can use something like Render’s free tier. Now you learn how to deploy the app to two services and connect them.While deploying, you’ll meet the great enemy: CORS errors. You’ll freak out, maybe punch a wall, but you’ll figure it out.Now you have a todo list, two codebases, deployed on two services, talking to each other, with auth in place.What’s next?Maybe fetch weather data and show it on the home screen. Maybe add Google Sign-In so people can register easily.The list goes on.But to get started, you need to learn how to make a todo list app, because 99 percent of software development is building a todo list with many different fields.",

The I just add a package.json file and boom I have a server.Ok we need a router so we need an api folder and then the route file needs like 2 lines of code. Oh yeah and we need the get and push requests boom you have an api. Actually recalling it from memory right after really solidifies it.

        "body": "This is solid advice.To basically reiterate, depending on where you’re at in your learning, take a staggered approach. At least for me it helps me to understand better.Like if you’re just starting to learn JavaScript, start with a bare naked project and get the script to say something. A simple hello world. Then build it up to be a simple, SIMPLE calculator. All just in the terminal, no ui. Then when you’re comfortable with JavaScript itself and getting things to pop up on the terminal, then you’re ready to start learning how to build a project from scratch.Take your script you made, and try and slap a React ui on top of it, moving your logic to the backend to get practice with full-stack development (if that’s a goal of yours). This is the important stepping away from the tutorial part. This is where you make a decision to NOT follow a tutorial and instead look at documentation and examples to understand what is going on in these, in this instance, React applications. Every engineer uses references. It’s okay to not know things. But the goal is to understand the process, not copying and pasting to create a finished product as fast as you can to feel impressive. I struggled with that part of the mental frame when I first started. Overall, just pick an IDE (vscode or IntelliJ community edition, whatever floats your boat), create a file, and start practicing. Don’t overthink the process. There is no fast path to learning, it’s at your own pace. Place the emphasis on understanding what you want to do and how to do it using best practices.",

Again, you get to choose what and how you learn this way.Both tough choices.Personally, I went down the AI route and I now train others in our company on how to use it.

Are you asking if the win rate is too low to be fun, or are you asking if the program is behaving incorrectly?It's straightforward to calculate the exact probability of each possible outcome of a spin, and thereby calculate the probability of a win. One way to do this is by brute force: there are 116^3 = 1560896 possible outcomes, all equally probable, and you can write a program to count them up *without* randomness.With a little work, you can calculate the same win probability more efficiently, by avoiding repeatedly considering all the duplicate ways to get the same outcome.Of course, even if the probability of a win is 1/100, that doesn't guarantee that there will be exactly one win every 100 plays. The actual outcome is very likely to be higher or lower due to random variation. If you want to check your program for correct behavior, you can do a large number of runs (say, 10000) and then use an appropriate statistical test (such as a chi-squared test) to see where the observed number of wins falls, in comparison to the statistically likely range.I'm not a gambling expert, but I believe real slot machines don't *only* pay out if all of the symbols on a line match. They have additional lower-value payouts that are more frequent, designed to keep the player engaged and addicted in hopes of a jackpot.",

It has the specific signature you described, and here are the reasons for the questions you asked about the method signature:1. All methods are supposed to either return a value, or indicate that they do NOT return a value using the keyword `void`. Java does not expect the `main` method to return a value, which is why we use the keyword `void`.2. `main(String[] args)`: This is just the name of the method that takes a string array as an argument. This does not directly result in any user input. The Java runtime receives the user input arguments from the OS, and then passes them into `main` when it invokes the `main` method.3. The method is marked public because it has to be invoked by the Java runtime. It needs to be accessible to the outside world, it wouldn't make sense for it to be private.Honestly, I don't know if any of this explanation would make sense to a beginner. When I was learning Java, I just accepted that these are lines that have to be there. It made sense only after I had learned a lot more about data types, arguments, return values, classes, etc.",

I mean if I were you I'd evaluate how competitive you can be in this space and also what college you're going to and decide whether cs is the right choice. If it is then, start with courses like cs50 to get the fundamentals down.

If you don’t really enjoy it then pick another path.Edit 2: there are other functions in cs besides coding.

It's very possible you are a logical thinker, but are overwhelmed by all the choices available to you. What's more, it can be a challenge to just dream up a project out of thin air.Add to that, it's difficult when you're too young to know what your personal strengths are. That often takes time to develop. All you can do is experiment and explore until you discover the things that you find interesting and exciting. For me it was solving technical problems. It was like solving a puzzle for me, and I enjoyed the sense of accomplishment once I found the solution. It wasn't always easy, but it was rewarding.I'd recommend picking a language and focusing on it. Find tutorials and sample code. Study them and try to understand how they work. Then take the next step and create a project of your own. It doesn't have to be complicated or flashy. It might just be a simple console application that performs some utility function like a calculator.",

You will learn features of the language (as long as you attempt harder and harder problems) and, very importantly, you will learn how to debug.Java, like python (and others) depends on a huge number of libraries to do anything real world. Learning those libraries is nearly as important as the language itself.For your test, though, most of them likely won’t matter, but there are certainly a few basic packages to be able to use, but I have no idea what an ap test expects. Just code as much Java as you can before then.Edit: spelling",

        "body": "Hey man, I’ve been exactly where you are — a few years in, feeling like my knowledge is patchy as hell even though I work hard. Here’s the honest truth from someone who finally fixed it:Do 'both', but in the right order. Don’t pick one camp and die on that hill.Month 1 – structured learning (your colleague’s way)** Do the boring “list of topics” thing first, but keep it short and focused. One good book/course on design patterns + clean architecture (Head First Design Patterns or the free Refactoring Guru site + YouTube). One proper Python refresher (Python Tricks or Fluent Python – just read and code the examples). Quick deep-dive on Kafka, Airflow, Spark, Postgres, K8s, basic AWS (official docs + one solid free course each, 1–2 weeks max per topic). Do the little exercises, rewrite them a week later, compare. This fills the holes fast and stops that “I only half-know this” feeling. You’ll feel way more confident in 30 days.Month 2-3 – big project + mini projects (your original idea)** Now pick ONE decent-sized project that forces you to use everything together (example: a data pipeline that pulls from Kafka → processes with Spark/Airflow → stores in Postgres → simple dashboard on AWS). While building it, you’ll hit walls → go back and learn exactly what you need → apply it instantly. That’s when stuff actually sticks forever.Do 2–3 tiny weekend projects too (one pure Kafka producer/consumer, one Airflow-only DAG, one Spark job). They’re quick wins and prove to yourself you can finish things.I wasted years doing only projects and still felt like a fraud because I skipped the basics. Then I wasted months doing only courses and felt zero progress because nothing was connected. Doing structured learning first, then a real project second, was the combo that finally made me feel “yeah, I actually know my shit.”You’ve got 3 months and zero other commitments — perfect window. Spend the first month closing the gaps with books/courses, then the next two building and shipping. You’ll come out the other side actually proud of what you know.You got this. Start tomorrow with design patterns or Python, whichever scares you most. Hit me in a month and tell me how it’s going.",

For me, I have to understand the why in order to remember it. I was never good at reading a book and memorizing the material. I had to put my hands on it, break it, and fix it before I could commit it to memory. The benefit for me was once I understood it, I would never forget it, but it took longer for me to go through the cycle. I think it's always best to have a problem to solve. It doesn't have to be a difficult problem, but simply something that software can help with. Often times a tutorial will provide you with a basic framework that you can leverage to build on. My programming journey started with simple projects in electronics, like solving resistor networks that required a target impedance and range of voltage offsets. I often implemented an iterative solver that started with a guesstimate and automatically adjusted itself until the solution was found. I learned a lot about iterative problem solving as well as learning the language. Those programs became utilities that I would use from time to time.Another project of mine was a Monte Carlo simulator to test various strategies for maintenance contracts. I learned a lot about Monte Carlo simulations, event queues, and the distribution of non-normal data. This was a much more ambitious project and never reached a production ready state, but still it was a useful means of analyzing my problem and learning to leverage features of the language I was working using (C++).Whatever you decide to do, you need to write code. Just stepping through a tutorial is unlikely to provide long-lasting knowledge (if you're like me). However, tutorials, videos, and course-work may be a great springboard inspiring you to solve other problems. Maybe you learn how to build a simple web application that uses a database and you decide to build your own budgeting application. Be curious and be inspired.Keep a directory of all your artifacts so you can use them as reference material - a grep utility is good way to find them for future reference.",

Like I use SDL to build games in C++ but for someone who knows absolutely nothing I think C# or python is the best option particularly because of their relative simplicity python in particular being really easy. Now to learn you really don't need any fancy courses just some random tutorial on YouTube and trust me you will almost never use most of the 'advanced' stuff they teach you. The fun part is actually using the game library (or engine) so once you get to that you will get addicted (hopefully). If you didn't understand anything just ask me.",

Here is a way to learn more deeply in the small projects you work on to get more out of them:Start small and keep it simple. Let the project guide what you need to learn next. I almost always suggest the often dismissed TODO exercise to start with since you already have some base knowledge.Start small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. EDIT: fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. An address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.",

Look at things you do not know as an opportunity to learn and as an opportunity to grow. You should get a growth mindset. Everybody who does things better than you is a \"living book\" you can use to become better. Learn what they are knowing. Pick up these skills they are having. You should only worry when you are not progressing any more and you haven't learnt anything new for quite a long time.And, talk with people. Communicate. Your team mates are there. Walk to their desk or write in the team chat. Tell what you tried, tell what does not work, tell where do you think that the issue is NOT, etc. Show that you made a realistic effort and after you did your best, you are now stuck and you ask for some advice.",

Official tutorial doc usually exists (e.g. [regex](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/) and [records](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/language/records.html)), but it's not centralized in one place and not necessarily even well SEO'd. Still, I feel that Java's doc is far from \"atrocious\". Compare Java's documentation to the documentation for most third-party libraries. It's like night and day. By starting with such a strong word, you're going to have a hard time finding an adjective for documentation that is _truly_ bad.",

Add facets (module, package, abstract/interface, annotation, sealed) and a size cutoff.- Visualize: precompute layout with sfdp or OpenOrd, render in Cytoscape.js or Sigma.js, and wire a fuzzy search index (Lucene/Elasticsearch) that highlights paths between two nodes. Click-through to the Javadoc.- Scale: store the graph in Neo4j so you can serve “subgraph by query” (e.g., everything that implements List within java.base).I’ve used Sourcegraph for code intel and Neo4j for subgraph queries; DreamFactory let me expose the graph as a quick REST API without hand-rolling a backend.If you ship a filtered, searchable graph, folks will actually use it.",

The problem: every review cycle devs forget half of what they actually did. They'll scroll through months of commits trying to piece it together. So my husband (the dev) and I built something to fix it. It’s a CLI tool that reads your Git history locally and pulls out achievement summaries (for performance reviews/1-on-1s/career docs). Built for individual developers to own their career narrative, not for team tracking.Runs locally (privacy-first), supports multiple LLM providers (including local Ollama), and it's open source. Jira integration coming soon. Still early days, looking for people to try it out and give us honest feedback. Here's the website: [https://www.bragdoc.ai](https://www.bragdoc.ai)Repo: [github.com/edspencer/bragdoc-ai](http://github.com/edspencer/bragdoc-ai)Demo: [app.bragdoc.ai/demo](http://app.bragdoc.ai/demo)",

Bolted-on type systems, like TypeScript or whatever Python has, do help, but can't compete with a language built with typing from the ground up.That said, you should check job offers in your area and make a decision based on that if pay is your deciding factor. Both are widely used, and both will have a varied pay.I find, however, the language doesn't matter as much, unless it's something obscure. What matters is the type of projects or the company itself. I've seen backend developers being paid better for PHP than Java, or TS over C#, or also other ways around, but it's all backend developers and the pay differences are generally no that great just based on language itself.",

If the job is likely to be boring indefinitely I find a new jobTo address AI directly, I am deep in it with claude code. I am finding that the normal day to day stuff is pretty boring now. Adding an api to support some new feature, along with implementing the front end is pretty easy. Previously those tasks were like 15% planning, 70% coding and 15% QA. Now it is almost entirely QA. It is legit boring but requires a smart human to make sure it works as expected and the code is maintainable. Rarely does claude code one shot things. Although I still do feature development, I have been shifting to harder problems. Finding slow memory leaks, building dev tools to address some inefficiencies, analyzing and addressing performance issues, optimizing our horrendously slow CI, devop stuff, etc. I still use ai for these harder problems but it involves a lot more human coding and intervention. These things felt a bit overwhelming before but now feel doable.... and they are fun. Learning a lot going outside of my comfort zone",

The job offer I got was two very bright engineers hiring me who didn’t leetcode but asked me questions that really allowed me to explain my deep understanding of my work. It also was one of those things where I had experience in literally every one of the requirements for the job and could speak to it. But it was two pretty easy interviews and after I can onboard they said they hired me because they “got good vibes”. We click really well and I’m sure just having a good personality was 75% of the whole thing.I also chose to accept instead of continuing to look bc the project was cool and I liked them. I feel like this is somewhat how hiring should feel.",

If you have a professional network / connections, they are your best resource for getting past all the noise created by AI resumes and all the tactics that HR / recruiting departments are using to thin them out.A friend at another company said they just fired an offshore guy who they later found out had 6 jobs at the same time. That's what you're competing against, the noise of professional job applicants using every tool at their disposal.>Also, does anyone have experience applying for a TPM or manager position after being a software engineer? Thinking of pivoting.You need to pivot in place at your next employer, rather than try to pivot between jobs. It won't work, you have no experience in the role you're applying for. My advice would be to try to be your next team's Scrum Master, if they don't have one. Get the certs for that, get some experience, then look at pivoting again to Product Owner or TPM based on your preference.FYI these \\^\\^\\^ roles are getting even worse for cold applications because all the offshore that can't code (or get their cousin who can code to do the interview for them) get scrum / PM certs instead. Every cert class I teach / attend has a disproportionate number of offshore attendees, most of whom couldn't create a dashboard in Jira to save their lives.Not to be irrationally negative about offshore but there's so much noise in the system right now that it's hard to match US workers to US jobs. I can't even get callbacks on ITAR / DoD jobs that get relisted 2-3 times, and these people were throwing all the money at me 3 years ago. The whole system is broken. Rely on your network.Edit: TPM, PO, Scrum Master, Agile Coach etc are all excellent places for former devs to go. Moving to coaching was the best thing for my career, as most of your competition won't even be close to your technical skillset. You need to like people more than the average dev does, and you'll need to learn how to navigate some of the politics. I'm paid at a Sr Mgr / Director grade (Fortune 100 tech company you've heard of), have frequent access to organizational leaders, and am basically the wizard who has the data and the dev background to tell them where their orgs are running right and where they aren't. Get a good leader or five who like you and know what you can do, and they'll take you everywhere they go.",

If you lie in such a way that you imply you are proficient in some technology or methodology that you're not, it can really bite you in the ass. Though of course puffing yourself up a little is also expected.And the hiring managers and engineers you talk to all expect this. They know they can't actually verify the minute details of your employment (and this is why you don't lie about things that can be easily verified, such as degrees and job titles), they just want to see if you can effectively sell your capabilities.",

You can try to memorize something ahead of time, but then you'll likely be caught off guard when follow up questions are asked since even if it's your own story, narrating it in the moment feels no different than reciting a fairy tale.Also this of course has no bearing on semantic memory, even if you cannot narrate the autobiographical details around an event doesn't mean you don't remember the event or its context. And since your job doesn't consist of narrating your life. about the only time it might impact you is during performance reviews when you might take a lot longer to piece together some narrative of what you worked on, but this is written anyway and you can reference artifacts.",

        "body": "It sounds like you're complaining about two separate things: 1) you don't like or understand STAR, 2) you have trouble remembering relevant past experiences on the spot when asked.For number 1, as others have mentioned, STAR is less a template you're expected to fit into (although I have seen rubrics that break down the same way) and more a communication tool as others have said. It just makes it easier to break a story down into the exposition (S and T), what you did (the A), and why it mattered (the R). Kind of like how most movies or books have a beginning, middle, and end.Number 2 is tough and that's where the studying for behavioral interviews comes from. Whenever I've gone interviewing, I've sat down and written out a Google doc outline where I try to think of all the experiences I've had that would be good in these interviews. This should include projects that meet any of these criteria:- you're proud of it / designed and implemented the whole thing even if it's small - it involved mentoring a junior- it required you to make a big design doc and/or plan and delegate tasks across a team you're leading- something went wrong along the way but you either successfully navigated around it or you minimized damage / got something useful out of the failure- you disagreed with somebody but you either convinced them or compromised and the project moved forward- you had to convince someone of something in order to proceedEtc - basically aside from stuff you're just proud of or where you led or mentored one or more people, the more uncomfortable the situation was, the better. Depending on how senior you're going for, it's ok if you don't have as much on the leadership or cross team stuff, but anything that remotely fits that bill goes in.The ideal candidate didn't actively make good contributions to an important project that successfully launched. They also had to convince two other teams who hated the idea at first, and they planned and led a team of people to get it done, and then when critical partner team x got canned halfway through they found a way to work with teams y and z to ship the project, all while some person on team y was critical of the project and trying to hamstring it the whole time until candidate met with them and got them on board with it. (to be clear this is the hyperbolic sum of all the things you try to fit into this interview and not realistically in a single story from any candidate)Last time I interviewed (last year), once I wrote this doc, I actually found ChatGPT really useful to help me digest it and fit the stories into the framework of these interviews (to be extremely clear: as a study aid leading up to interviews, not as a live tool during the interview). I literally copied and pasted / imported the whole doc and told it \"I'm interviewing for role x at level y with company z. Give me a bunch of example behavioral interview questions with answers drawn from my experiences that fit into the STAR framework.\"It was beautiful. The response ended up being a really helpful study guide to pick my best stories for questions like \"tell me about a time you had a disagreement with someone\" and how to break the story down and communicate it. Make sure you have two or three stories for any one question, since you probably have stories that are relevant to more than one question (it's ok to occasionally answer with \"story x from a minute ago fits that bill because of x, y, and z\" but you don't want to do that too much).Read back over your doc and the ChatGPT convo for a while every day and iterate a bit more with ChatGPT about it so you can internalize everything. With a week or two of this type of study, you'll be way more confident. The hardest part is just remembering all your work experiences in detail and writing the initial doc.",

Language wise it was pretty easy to learn for people and there are very few sigils involved so most code can be readily understood.",

        "body": "Interesting how the interview experience differs across companies and seniority. I just landed a mid-level FE role with a major company after working as a junior for 18 months. The process was very straight forward:- initial HR screening - interview with senior FED and senior product engineer - “cultural” interview with rest of teamI was asked to build a single page app that incorporated modern UI features using my stack of choice (I chose primarily react) and to go through it during the second interview. No live coding challenge, no technical questions outside of “do you know how to use this particular tool” and no roleplay. I had the impression, due to them mentioning modern tooling, they cared more if I fit in with the workplace rather than my capacity given the barrier to entry/capability has been lowered across the industry with Claude ect.",

This year people are finding jobs, but salaries are noticeably lower than a few years ago. So it’s both harder to land something and the pay isn’t what it used to be.Experience matters, but not always the way you’d expect. Lately a lot of companies avoid senior people because they don’t want to pay higher salaries, so candidates with 2–3 YOE sometimes get more callbacks than someone with 10+.There was a dev (post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/)) with around your level of experience who couldn’t get a job for months. He pulled hundreds of companies from Google Maps, emailed his resume to all of them, and ended up getting a couple mid-size projects that way. If normal applications aren’t working, trying something unconventional like that actually helps.Also make sure your resume is ATS-friendly and keyword-optimized. It really makes a difference. Someone recently shared an AI resume-tailor prompt here and using something like that boosts your visibility a lot in recruiter searches.",

I basically didnt get asked any leetcode and pretty much everyone said I could google stuff so I used the language i use at work instead of python which i leetcoded in.",

There's also the distinct possibility that many tools/companies will fail/enshittify, and waiting to pick the winning/remaining tooling is generally a smart decision.Additionally, many (probably most) senior devs have been an early adopter of some piece of tech and had it fail, often catastrophically. For example, I know several crypto devs who have to fuzz their resumes because their crypto experience is seen as a red flag when applying for new roles.Given that AI is ***very visibly*** a bubble, waiting to see the situation when it pops in the near future is a pretty wise position.",

A PIP, at the very least, means it’s not a good fit, and usually it means you will eventually be let go.PIPs are very often not actually about performance. They are often political, as mine was. One or more people in positions of power and influence in the org just don’t like you or don’t like working with you, for whatever reason. It doesn’t mean that’s who you are. As soon as I posted about this role not working out a former director of mine, and a former boss reached out about possibly returning to work at former companies. Sometimes who you are just doesn’t fit with the personalities who are running the team you end up on. The harsh reality is people are petty and tribalistic, and this absolutely influences decisions in the workplace.",

There is probably diminishing returns after getting a few though. Next most impactful was leet code. I had many interviews that asked these style questions. I wasn't good enough for them so I wish I had reviewed it more.Learning languages seems fruitless. Why would they want my self taught java experience when they can go higher some one with many years for the same money. I also can't ethically say i have work experience in these other languages I would get filtered out before an interview.My big break was from those recruiting emails that ask you to apply.

It often feels like, I can do the job, I want the job, don't block me for nonsense. On the flip side, it's a very low bar for job seekers to do a Spring Boot tutorial and just claim they have expertise and/or can pick it up after they start the job. And some hiring managers, when they are paying for talent, they rightfully want more than just hot air.Another point: Spring Boot is great, especially the new 4.0 release, but the other big Java platforms are great too. Jakarta 10/11, Helidon, and Quarkus are all great options too. And team leads, can't just let every dev switch to whatever tech stack they want. Often if a product is using something, the team needs everyone using the same stack.Lastly: the software job market is hard. Jobs are there. People are getting hired. But it's very competitive. If a recruiter has a thousand applicants for a single job opening, they can only hire once, and then they have to reject the other 999 applicants, which means their job offer process must be extremely selective. And that might upset the 999 candidates who don't get the offer, but what else is the recruiter supposed to do? Bottom line: expect a lot competition, a lot of rejection, cast a wide net, see what's out there, and get the best offer you reasonably can get.",

My coding speed grew by 3x to 5x in my first 3 years on the job, as did my ability to learn and comprehend repos with 2000 to 10,000 lines of code.I want to emphasize this. I was a super star in the classroom but when I hit the real job, I was a total beginner. The first day, my manager yelled at me to stop committing every 30 minutes since each commit took 40 minutes to build, run unit tests and deploy to DEV and blocked everyone's else changes from going through. I didn't know, there was no training. Better integration was to have the build run automatically once an hour that picks up all the changes.I had never seen so much shittily written and undocumented code and the project was already 6 months late.

This matters. Ask yourself whether you worked on interesting projects, did you learn some tech on your own and whether you can see yourself doing that kind of work full time. If not, maybe computer science is not the right fitDo not consider only swe roles, data analyst, data science, AI engineer, data engineer, tech consulting, and product manager positions are all paths you can exploreLC does not matter as much in the UAE. Startups care more about your backend, frontend, systems skills than your lc grind (only companies ik who are crazy about lc are dytedanxe, noon, talabat). i could be wrong hereThe market is tough for CS majors everywhere. If you are not interested in the work or feel you lack the necessary skills, switching fields could be an option (i only say this as you claim you didn’t learn much in uni, but it’s been 2 years since graduation and you could self learn more industry skills)",

I've talked to a bunch of recruiters out there and they all say the same thing - companies want people with 3-5 years minimum because they're competing globally for talent and can afford to be picky. It's not you, it's legitimately the market structure there.The masters pivot might not be the worst idea but... business degrees after CS can be weird. You'll be competing with people who did business undergrad and have that foundation already. Plus you'd be starting over in a new field while still carrying student debt (assuming you're not getting it funded). Have you thought about maybe doing a technical masters instead? Something like data science or specialized AI programs? At least then you're building on what you already know instead of completely starting fresh.One thing - that gap on your resume isn't as bad as you think. I see people come back from 2-3 year breaks all the time. The story matters more than the gap itself. \"I graduated into a terrible market and kept grinding while exploring options\" is way better than most explanations i hear. Also those unpaid internships you're applying to? Skip them. They know you're desperate and will treat you accordingly. Focus on contract work, freelance projects, or even contributing to open source stuff. At least then you're building real portfolio pieces instead of fetching coffee for free.",

Half don't even put coding in their interview process. They're more about design which is much harder to cheat on. I can't wear headphone anymore because the interviewer will aske me to remove them to prove I'm not getting piped in answers.The occasional coding I have to do for an interview is 100% practical and related to what I do on the job and had for homework projects. Not designed to be hard, just to confirm I know how to code at all.But yeah, stop using those tools. You're entry level, you got free time. Learn the hard way like everyone else who knows their crap.You could certainly switch fields although I'm not sure to what. Cybersecurity is very competitive thanks to CS being overcrowded and a Cybersecurity degree being worse to start a career in Cybersecurity with. If you can code, you can be useful immediately. Rest is largely on the job experience.If you're very good at math, you could pass an actuary exam and go that route. Honestly, I think it's a decent option in that case.",

When other teams give you work, give it a priority level with regards to existing work. Whenever you add work to your current sprint, take an equivalent amount of work out.It's common for people, especially tech leads, to feel like they need to handle something themselves because they read the message first. Sometimes the senior devs are swamped, but the juniors don't have enough work. Seniors should help refine and break down tasks so that a junior can handle them, and juniors should show initiative by taking on unfamiliar tasks and trying to learn while doing.At least in my company, if you are up at 3am fixing an issue no one expects you to be at a 9am meeting. Not to mention that if someone on my team was up at 3am, we'd make it a high priority to make sure it never happens again.Feeling peessure to constantly improve is natural when you're a junior and want to get promoted, but yeah it turns toxic when stack ranking is involved and you know that someone around you will get a PIP.When it becomes too much, you need to tell your manager your concerns during a regularly scheduled 1:1.

The company was Google, so it had CV weight, but between all the internal systems, configs, and getting passed around to different projects, I hit a point where I felt like I didn’t even know how to program. Ended up taking a year off and when I started again I got a lot of interviews but blew most of them because I had such a hard time communicating and selling myself on that kind of extremely specific, internal work. It was super frustrating. One of the few offers I got was from Meta, and now I’m doing ML infra work and feel like I’m starting to level up on those skills. One of the biggest things for me has been working on personal projects just for fun, and it’s made me so much better as an engineer. The natural progression of those projects basically forces me into more modern stacks and approaches. Like I had this idea to do network analysis on Twitter hate groups, and suddenly I’m deep into TLS fingerprinting, optimizing hundreds of concurrent workers without hitting Postgres deadlocks, building a double-buffer architecture, messing with text classification, yada yada.

But I’ve been trying to transition into a full-time role, and I’m struggling because there just aren’t many listings to apply to.I can't tell how and where you're looking, or whether that could be improved - but be that as it may - you can only apply to the jobs that are there, and that you find. Networking means you'll try to find jobs that aren't advertised; but I am not sure how much of a dent that can make. What does your current employer have to say about transitioning you to full time? Does anyone at that company has outside contacts?>I’ve tried strategies like applying only to jobs posted within the last 5 days, but the available roles dry up almost immediately. I’m open to opportunities both in the Bay Area and elsewhere, yet I still can’t find much that’s actually hiring.So.... there aren't many jobs, and your strategy is to filter that list down further? If anything at all, you should work on a process that makes you find all these jobs within the first 5 or 2 days.You cannot change the market; you cannot change how hiring works. You can adjust your own processes to make the most of the given circumstances, and see that the work you put into it has the highest ROI that's possible for you to achieve.>What are the best resources for finding real job postings from companies that are genuinely looking to hire? Any advice would help.Not from the US, but when I am looking for work, I see which job boards have good results for what I have to offer, I scan those regularly ,and apply quickly. If that ends up in too few results, I'll have to start looking at places where the good matches are less dense. (Assuming that I am happy with my CV, my application process, etc. Those I can change, I cannot change who posts how many jobs where.)",

I have a good friend who has his masters and teaches regular and advanced history / social studies for highschool students, and he's had some uncomfortable insights about AIFor the first time since we've really been recording this information, my friend has been seeing an inverse bell curve; meaning the average score is no longer in the middle ~70%, there are two polar opposites: students that care and are trying, scoring 90%+ and those who just don't give a shit at all. So to give the younger generation some credit, there is a big group of students that see what tik tok and AI are doing to their attention span and are determined to succeed in spite of that. But there just as big of a cohort that are straight up turning off their critical thinking and letting AI take the wheel.Because critical thinking, making decisions really is the skill AI threatens to take away the most. Most of these failing students just refuse to put in any effort that requires them to think beyond a surface level.So to reiterate, this is genuinely new. This is different. Previous technologies like the Internet certainly changed education, but a huge emphasis was placed on digging beyond surface level Wikipedia details. Today AI can (appear to anyway) do that digging beyond for you in a few prompts, and the skill to research and analyze information just gets thrown away by a startling number of people",

You want ideally a ticket that is low risk, well-defined and self-contained, and exposes you to an important portion of the codebase so you can get your hands dirty. You do need someone knowledgable to create this ticket for you though.At a codebase level, this might be a bit more controversial (it shouldn't be, but people can be morons), codebase walkthrough is one of the best use-cases for LLMs. Pull the repo into whatever approved AI tooling you have like Cursor, hopefully you're allowed something, then prompt it with things like \"I am a new developer, walk me through the structure of this repo\", then you can drill down like \"what endpoints are there\", or \"what technologies are used\", \"help me ramp up on \", \"how do I build this project locally\", \"what are recent commits made\", etc",

All the heavy technically benefits can be thrown around all people want but there’s a lot of finance that will offshore with Java for better or worse. I see the Scala because they can make their Java engineers into Data Engineers with little change. Go is very opinionated. And for heavy lifting mirco services or internal platforms WITHIN the fintech, it’s wonderful. But I feel like a lot of ‘micro services’ aren’t that micro and so things get entrenched in the status quo of Java.

Most people who are competent rise to the occasion, senior-level (and beyond) work isn't necessarily harder, it's just different and you may have more expectations in terms of leadership, driving initiatives, writing end to end specs rather than implementing, etc.Titles also vary by company and promo rates vary a lot by manager. My first manager was pretty keen to help me speedrun promotions, but reality is, it was a sinking ship company and even if I did, titles translated to less pay. I took a mid-level offer at my current job, and by all accounts trajectory slowed, but also that job change earned me about 2x pay at the \"same\" level.\\> I am worried that others might see me as a bit of a fraudpeople might get jealous, yes. That's their problem. Either you demonstrate that you're deserving and prove them wrong, or you prove them right but you're still paid extra. win win",

        "body": "Current SWE (SRE), former Support Engineer.In my experience, Support Engineers are great in theory but in practice the number of truly good Support Engineers is very low.The common anti-pattern with Support is 1. customer complains about something via chat/email > 2. support person copy and pastes customers problem into a dev ticket > 3. now dev has yet another ticket thats probably vague and not actionable out of the box > 4. dev asks support person questions which they relay back and forth to customer until resolution. I call this the **”Carrier Pigeon model of Support” (tm)** and it’s terrible - customers are left thinking “why am i talking to this support person instead of the dev” and devs are left thinking “why is this person making my job harder”. It’s inefficient (latency due to relay) and ultimately makes everyone frustrated. Not falling into this antipattern is hard - customers will pester you (because they want cases solved faster), sales people will pester you (because they want their customer happy), and product/dev people will ignore you (because you’re bothering them and they have More Important Things (tm) to do). What a good Support Engineers does is equal parts social engineering (how do I get this person to help me when it’s not necessarily in their interest) and technical skill (troubleshooting whatever problem the customer has). Generally, I see the following in good Support Engineers:- They learn how to ask good questions - good questions are asked to the right person, in the right way, with the right information in such a way that *makes it as easy as is possible for the answerer to give a response*. Good Support Engineers ask for help from devs in a way that makes it easy to help them.- They manage expectations effectively - sometimes the customer should not be expecting an “urgent fix” for something that is at best a P2 feature request. Good Support Engineers set proper expectations with customers and only let customer urgency bleed onto Devs when its’s warranted.- They are self sufficient and proactive - good Support Engineers leverage resources, the access they have, and their troubleshooting skills to get information. They don’t bother devs about every single question. Thats not to say they never bother devs, but they try to dig up information on their own. Ditto on the proactive - a resource doesnt exist for some issue? They create it. Some issue is happening x times with a common pattern and the org is getting y support cases? They start a thread and start investigating root cause.Great Support Engineers are considerate, thoughtful, and aggressively helpful.",

Management thinks they do the problem solving on their own which isn't the case.However, I have some sympathy for them. I have insight and meetings with the business and we are directly planning on a day to day basis. The support team doesn't get this information and all they get is maybe a 1 hour KT session to try and understand a year and some change of meeting and planning around the application. So of course, they're going to be lost and not really sure why this API is calling this or responding a certain way. Even though I provide extensive documentation, we are serving a business and they need to understand not just the technology behind it all.Overall, it's a frustrating experience though. Idk.",

        "body": "I’m just a SWE 1, but I like to think I have a healthy relationship with AI coding right now. I use it for work daily, but I originally learned and got to where I am without AI.I mentor for lots of college hackathons and I see so many students like you, who are completely reliant on AI to code, and fail spectacularly. It is an **insane power move** (HAHA) when I pull up to a mentee, immediately close ChatGPT or ask them “how do you close cursor?”, skip over all the Google AI overview when I google stuff, and debug their thing “raw” old school and fix it either in 1 glance or in half the time they’ve been stuck in an LLM prompting circle.My advice? Learn without AI. AI is a force multiplier imo, it turns say a level 1 engineer into a level 2, and a level 10 into a level 20. The moment you let things go, you stop leveling up. There is a significant difference in quality and speed between “code me an api for an app” vs “implement an API with these exact 5 routes, implementation steps, pagination, specific auth middleware, database, other layers, and other architectural and security concerns/requirements.”TLDR: better you are, the more effective it will be.“Learning without ai??? That’s impossible.”Yeah yeah, I hear you. You want to be spoon fed everything relevant now. You want it fast and customized. You’ll be better reading and learning without AI, but yeah yeah, it will take longer. Remember that programming is supposed to engage your brain. But if you really want to learn with AI, which I totally get the temptation, here’s what I’ve been advising my mentees at least.It about aligns with how I learned without AI, but adapted to this new day and age:## Use AI as a guide, not as your driver.> in the past, I learned through documentation and stack overflow. I would try copy and pasting code, but it would rarely work without me understanding how it works and modifying it to work with my code.1. Let the AI guide you, not drive for you. Get off cursor or whatever. Do not auto approve changes. Review everything it proposes. Stop copy pasting ChatGPT code. Instead, read each line it proposes, understand what it does and why it does what it does. Never ever put the code in until you know what each line does. Research the documentation, the patterns, everything OUTSIDE of asking an LLM. Too many times, I’ve been burned by incredibly convincing hallucinations I blindly trust.**My company gives me Claude 4.5. I have coded with Gemini 3 in my spare time. Even then, a near top-of-the-line coding LLM isn’t perfect enough to fully vibe-trust for work and for mildly complex projects.**## Ask AI to cite its sources or give it the sources.> I learned everything by reading documentation2. If you ever let an LLM drive (rather, think) for you, ask it for QUOTED sources and links, OR plug in the relevant documentation yourself and then ask for direct quotes that inform its implementation. Then, go back and read that relevant section yourself. Only then, can you hit yes on the code. You’ll learn something, at least, while keeping some momentum and enhancing accuracy. Still—better to learn yourself and feed it what it needs rather than trust it.## Debug without an LLM> Debugging and making effective hypothesis and knowing how to test them is the best skill I’ve learned, and it’s helped me both with and without AI. Trial and error have helped build my intuition and propose ideas on why things aren’t working, and that’s built on a solid debugging strategy, tons of experience, and exploration. 3. Learn effective debugging skills. I’ve had so many situations where students debug via LLM by saying “it doesn’t work, fix it” or “it’s not smooth, fix it”. Instead, when you tell it “I identify a race condition, I’d like to refactor the code by XYZ” the LLM works actually pretty well. But to figure this out, you gotta know how to debug outside of an LLM. Sometimes, it may involve a big or novel switch in approach that an AI in its little rabbit hole cannot suggest. Also, being a code detective is the best part of programming imo, why would you offload the best part to an AI?TLDR: don’t turn off your brain and don’t trust anything the LLM says. Pretend it’s a con artist or scammer and double check everything yourself OUTSIDE of the LLM “scammer ring” scheme.",

Every single one of them was very resistant to the idea that the project might need to be cancelled. One of them pitched to me \"let's just juke the stats and get a good project in, and figure this out in the next review period\". Another one, after the exec made the decision to re-allocate us, presented a plan to keep the project going. He just didn't get that \"move to keep the lights on in two weeks (ktlo)\" meant that we are moving on.I just see a massive amount of resistance to change, even at a big tech company where our execs tell us: \"we need you to be world class engineers\". I definitely get it, people want to keep things the way they are, but the moment you realize something isn't going to work, you need to pivot quickly. That's very hard to do, even by otherwise good developers, who just want to ship new code and worry less about if things make sense for the business.",

Of the many questions I ask, I like to ask engineering managers / directors: \"What was the hardest conversation you've ever had with a stakeholder\". What I'm listening for in the manager's/director's response is:1. Have they ever told a stakeholder \"no\" or \"[yes, and](https://galenemanuele.com/blog/power-of-yes-and)\" (which is really just fancy \"no\"). Unless they've been in leadership like ... 2-3 years ... an answer of \"huh, nothing comes to mind\" is a red flag for me. My read on that is they're very likely avoiding difficult conversations to the detriment of their team, because leadership is almost never sunshine and butterflies for everyone. Business is hard.2. What inputs lead to that difficult conversation? The team? A Jira board? An existential threat? Customer feedback? Data? Hopefully something more tangible than intuition alone.3. How did they tailor the conversation to this specific stakeholder's behaviors, values, and goals?And I often ask clarifying questions, or for them to elaborate, if I don't get 1, 2, and 3 covered in their initial response. Covering all 3 in the initial response is a big old green flag for me. I need to work with leaders who know how to \"go to bat\" for their people and advocate for what they believe is best for the business -- maybe that isn't as important to you. A big, big part of having a healthy engineering practice is telling important people \"no\" sometimes, even if they might fire you or advocate for your firing because you said \"no\". But they probably won't fire me, because I've already established through a different line of questioning that this leader values [psychological safety](https://psychsafety.com/psychological-safety-72-personal-user-manuals/).",

You can ask all sorts of questions, like:* When the the last Production issue they had? What was it (roughly), how did they resolve it, did anything change afterwards?* What kind of hours to people work?* Talk about a time a deadline wasn't going to be reached. What was done to in response? * How are technical disagreements resolved?But the problem is that people will sometimes lie, omit things, or stretch the truth. Something else to consider is that companies can change. Maybe they lost a big client, maybe they gained a big client. I've had the best times working for people who were empathetic (treated you like a human and adult), showed attention to detail (cared and understood about the work, could ask intelligent questions and talk to other teams about it), and could say \"no\" to people (external stakeholders and the internal team), including, \"we are not releasing this in its current state.\" I've worked for people who thought they were better than me, and their time was more valuable. Those people are awful to work for. There are people who don't take responsibility, try to blame others. \"Hey, I screwed this up, can you work extra to fix it all?\" It might be a weird thing to say, but having a mix of professional pride, caring about the work, and respecting the people doing the work. Oh, and I always appreciated people who were honest. I've worked with people who intentionally hold information from you. In some cases, it might be a good thing. Shielding the team, maybe hiding that we have some ways to extend a deadline, but pushing the team. Those can suck, but I liked that manager. I worked for someone else who would intentionally withhold information from the team. I got the impression they did this to always feels smarter than everyone. It was a very irritating experience and extremely hard to work with someone like that.",

The job itself was fine.I think the red flags to watch out for are:is the unpaid project kind of generic? Or is it incredibly specific and seems like it is new functionallity for an existing app?If the project they are asking for is very generic, IE: heres a user login and password, create a page to authenticate to our app services then build a page to accept a userID and submit it to retrieve user details and display it tto the screen and allow someone to edit. Thats fine with me. Its just shhowing I understand how auth / REST works and that I can build a web app that communicates with a backend.If instead they ask me to create a hyper specific page that requires multiple rest calls and data analysis maybe with business logic, thats when the red line is crossed IMO. To get an idea if you can do the job shouldnt require you to understand their business logic when coding, that stuff should be taught on the job. In the interview rounds the project assigned needs to be generic and just demonstrating you have the skills you say you do.",

The money and flexibility have been great, but after 14 years of working as a SWE the overpaid gravy train may be over for me. Laid off 11 months ago, been actively searching the past 7 months. Dozens and dozens of interviews, no offers.Like you, I always received decent performance reviews. I even survived 4 rounds of layoffs at my previous company. I didn't learn anything above that which was required to move tickets across the board, really coming back to bite me. I've got enough saved up to live comfortably for a decade, but not enough to retire. I'll get a job at the local grocery store, but not being able to work remotely on occasion will be missed. Really hope to avoid working for a big corporation if I can avoid it. Maybe a coffee shop or a bike rental stall in the park?Best of luck to you!",

There are so many devs that yearn for a long stretch of time to just \"go build\" and be left alone to get it done, but I straight up loathe it. I don't want to be left alone to build some future-scrap code. I want to talk to people, I want to fix problems for people, I don't want it to take weeks or more, and I can't stand the forced overtime/on-call crap that is \"just normal\" for these jobsIt's subjectively awful. I spent 6 years on a CS degree, 10 years in engineering, I'm great at getting quality work done and I can bring creativity when it's time to come up with a new solution or solve a problem - but the moment I'm required to work on something big that takes more than a week and doesn't require conversations with others, I generally hit a burnout vicious cycle and it all falls apartAdd in the insanity that we're seeing with AI being used to judge the effectiveness of development, along with major companies \"leading the way\" into a digital wood chipper of approximate solutions and interviews that range from 4 to 10 rounds of incresingly dehumanizing bullshit from 40-hour takehomes to literal video recordings to prove you're not coding with AI when your whole job is fully reliant on the speed AI provides you, and maaaan... I got into this industry to help people, what the fuck happened. I worked tech support and tutored through college and thought that somehow, that level of direct support to others and mentoring would be something I could continue to do at future roles and throughout my career - and I did to some extent, despite the fact that I had to force it, and only in hindsight am I actually seeing that I had to force itI'm starting to understand that the general role of a dev is to quietly crank out text for a computer that does the same thing all of their employer's competitors are doing but microscopically differently - and maybe just a little too late, I'm realizing it's just not good for me. I wish I'd known that before I committed to 15 years of it, back when I still qualified for student aid and could still pursue psychology or education, but worst case the trades are hiring, and being an electrician is a damn good worst case for meMight still have to code for a while, depending on how the current interviews I'm going through work out, but if I somehow score a support role I'm never writing code for someone else's vision again. Maybe I can finally find the energy to build all the cool shit I've put off for so long while trying to minimize feature burnout for my employer",

Some of the technical infrastructure at big banks and major retailers is almost completely run by these people.My theory is that it's much more efficient for these \"main\" companies to hire a core staff and management, then farm out the entry level tech work to these consultancies, than it is for them to hire entry level talent directly. The cost of acquisition and retainment is high and entry level tech work is often not that unique or specialized anymore, so they'd rather leave that headache to the consulting agencies.",

On the other end of the spectrum, some people think React is a specialization, whereas a lot of seasoned web people will argue that \"it can be learned in a week\", aka there just isn't much depth.\"Web\" is a specialization, and there's not a lot of newbies that can speak intelligently about web security and accessibility and performance and/or any of dozens of advanced topics within that domain, and conversely, seniors that can are going to be in demand, precisely because learning about the domain in depth takes effort.Diversification, in the sense of a principal engineer level of scope, is more or less about having to have an opinion about how some deep aspect of the web stack might interact with some deep aspect of the networking stack or the mobile stack or the storage stack or the ML stack or whatever happens to be on fire this semester",

Over the course of your career, there are things that will die off, and there are things that live longer than you expect. When I started working, Java was consider the new sexy thing. People joked about COBOL developers. COBOL is still around, and now people make fun of Java for being boring (personally think there are plenty of jobs and opportunity for Java). Times when I've had to learn new languages, I haven't necessarily changed my thought process too much. I know how to do something in one language, so I how can I do something similar in this new language. There are obviously some languages that are different, but logic and optimizations/algorithms will always be somewhat consistent. You're also noting one reason why people go into management or leave the field. They get sick of having to keep learning things. I've had interviews with people where we discussed AI, and some people have a nuanced opinion on it. Not everyone thinks it will take over the world. And not everyone thinks it's garbage. There are people trying to understand how it can improve their jobs/careers. One thing you have to realize is no one can predict the future, and no one knows things for sure. You'll get things wrong in your career and life. What can you learn from it? How can you grow? How will you respond?",

Microcontrollers and FPGAs are essential for embedded programming, and maybe some PLCs if you'd like to program industrial machinery.AI will not take over any of these jobs and is swiftly hitting diminishing returns on the hardware and infrastructure investments. However, it is going to remain in some form as a tool for handling large volume communications; it does acceptably at auto-responding to messages, though it still needs considerable supervision for anything. So it's good to have *some* familiarity with using it. But in my opinion you'll still do best learning the basics and doing most things manually, maybe querying the AI for quick summaries of a topic so you can find relevant search terms for further, non-AI study.This field is pretty volatile while you're getting started, so make sure you have some full-time work to pay your bills when you first begin your jobseeking.",

You might be able to moonlight for a while but ultimately you don’t have much control of your fate.If the AI bubble bursts and Nvidia’s stock collapses everyone’s investments will take a hit. Their data center growth is 40% of the GDP, their stock is 8% of the NYSE. Lots of investors will be liquidating other stocks and investments to shore up their losses.So don’t over commit and if something unrelated is stable take it.",

The FAANG had the best pay and benefits but I got laid off. I enjoyed my time there as I got to work with smart people that taught me a lot. The con being it was an impact culture that always kept you pushing (Meta). The SP500 Im at now is a great WLB that pays about 20-25% less than the FAANG role. The big con is that everything is a process and leadership is largely incompetent. Lots of rest and vesters who are terrible at getting things done. Also growth opportunities are slow at my current company. Im likely going to try and find another job next year to have a chance at being promoted.",

Without AI having more foresight into what could go wrong, metacognition into what it doesn’t know, the ability to absorb deep context, and the ability to reach out and have open conversations with humans, AI is not able to take over on call. The metacognition part is the most problematic part because no LLM model is able to accurately identify when it genuinely doesn’t know something. The output layers only give probabilities for the next token, but those probabilities don’t mean anything real about the outside world. A token having 90% probability to the model doesn’t mean there’s a 90% chance that’s the right answer.",

It's a really fun city to spend your 20s in. Not sure what your goals are in austin but it is one of those cities that people seem to grow out of after a few years here. When i got here everybody i knew that had been here for 3+ years talks about leaving. I was always like \"why it's so fun\" and theyd just be like \"give it a few years\". Now i started my 4th year here and i can see why. It's really fun but it's also really young and once you outgrow the bar scenes it makes you want to just find something new.",

It’s fine to want to pivot your career but it doesn’t really sound like you know what you want? or what jobs you’re interested in? no one here can make those decisions for you? I work in data, same age and on about £70k. I only got here by being ruthless eg constantly putting myself out there out there at work, learning new things, leaving roles/environments that weren’t suitable etc. Frankly I don’t think any 3-5 month course is really going to do much for you. Many data careers want a masters in maths for example so your bootcamp just isn’t going to be competitive give how many relevant degree holders are going to be in the pool of candidates. It’s not really a career where someone that isn’t passionate about it, will do well because it is so highly saturated. The bubble has popped in that sense. If you do want to do some courses I’d recommend things like AWS certified courses or Microsoft certifications. Not free but might help you leverage some credibility. But the gold standard would be getting any role and leveraging data in that role as a stepping stone to a better job.",

The biggest thing for most people comes down to, how comfortable are you building products for the police?Axon basically has leveraged its monopoly selling stun guns (“tasers”) to police departments into selling them police body cameras and SaaS products. Those started as software for evidence management, but it’s evolving into selling police [AI](https://www.govtech.com/biz/aclu-slams-ai-police-reports-and-axon-in-particular) tools. When I visited their office, there were stun gun parts just lying around. Someone actually got accidentally shocked by one while I there. It didn’t seem like they took workplace safety seriously. That said, it seemed to be a very mission driven company. I mean, their motto is to “make the bullet obsolete” in that nobody should be shot to death again, but rather incapacitated. It’s certainly not your average software company motto like “Work Hard, Have Fun, Make History” (Amazon) or “to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more” (Microsoft).

Do you have experience with it?- docker. Some people have never used it- observability. Again, some don’t have exposure. But a lot depends on what you know going into this. I’d be curious about context. What additional interview steps are there? How much time are you being given?Also, don’t go in with the mindset if the interviews doesn’t work out, it was a waste of time. Think of it as a way of learning some new things. You might want to dig deeper on your own, and these could become talking points during future interviews. A lot will also depend on the people doing the evaluations. Some people want to understand how you think. Others just want to nitpick. Another thing to consider is that some companies also use a project like this as a personality test. Did you go the extra mile? Did you make interesting, thoughtful decisions? There’s not a perfect answer, but I assume you’ll get a decent amount of people on this sub complaining.",

You'll learn a lot.Be careful with your money, though. Ensure part of your paycheck is going to a high-yield (but still relatively liquid) savings account, like Ally. Only live off of what's going to your checking and budget aggressively. You're taking a less stable and likely less paying job now to secure better ones later. But this is exactly the time in your life that you SHOULD be doing things to set up your career for later, not trying to stay and get comfy.Also, to clarify, do you mean that in 3 months you'll be a full-time employee if they keep you on?",

        "body": "MSE-DS is not what is going to get you into a job in Cali. I'm in the MCIT and I would say that penn is very east-coast oriented. Since you have DS experience you can absolutely get a job in Cali, but it would not be because of your penn degree. Also yeah it is true that a lot of the courses will probably have overlap with your undergrad, and look at [mymcit.org](http://mymcit.org) and look at the DS reviews - they aren't great. If I were to go back, I would have applied to a West Coast school as I want to move to Cali too. This would be the optimal choice, but hey completing the MSE-DS is still going to move you forward and is not a bad decision, but just that there may be a better decision for the 3 years that you would put into completing the degree.My humble opinion: apply to an MSCS instead. Your DS undergrad combined with CS masters will make you unstoppable. It does not have to be brand name either. For example, SJSU is heavily recruited by big tech companies. So I would apply to all brand-name and non-brand name schools on west coast and see where you get in. After all, tech is not *as* elitist(unless you get into berkeley/stanford which will give you a massive advantage) as top finance/consulting. So, being on the west coast even at an average school will give you a higher chance of being hired in Cali than MSE-DS.",
