I ask chatGPT to write scripts, read logs, research solutions, etc. THIS is the new iteration of software engineering and by extension data engineering. If you’re not using AI at your job, you’re falling behind. Having said that, I’m still up to date on technology, I still read documentation, and I review every single line of code chatGPT writes without exception. If I don’t understand what it’s doing, I research it. If I’m skeptical on what the script does, it does not make it into prod. No exceptions. A word of caution, we had someone on our team write a script with AI and run it without reviewing. They deleted a bunch of data from the database without knowing. We had back ups, but there was data that went missing. When asked about the obviously ChatGPT written script they could not explain what it did or why.",

My data complexity, scale, and user base is a little higher than what you listed, but my entire backend fits easily on an F4.For my approach, I only used Spark (pyspark or spark sql) and a medallion approach. All the cdc pipelines work great, and I haven't had any issues.I have to ask, how come you can't use mirroring for your on-prem sql? Or at least spark if not mirroring.For the front end, I just approached it via segmentation of capacity. So, each business domain only throttles themselves. But that doesn't happen much since nobody uses paginated reports, and the data models are pretty clean.Honestly, I'd still rather use Databricks, but my problem is I can't justify it to my organization since I made the Fabric site work too well on its own...",

Even if they advertise exactly-once, the CAP theorem is just a basic fact of mathematics: you are trading consistency over availability. Not to mention how hard it is to tune the various timeouts and parameters both server and client side and when transactions get stuck, it's an absolute hell to debug. Every single actor and library involved has to be aware of this transactional mode or else you will see duplicates. It's not worth it.And even in at-least-once, you need to discuss beforehand the need for timeouts, heartbeat adjustments, the need for an idempotency/deduplication ID and event_time parameter... Applications tend to just be set up with default parameters without discussing any of that which is a recipe for headaches. Hell, I've seen deployments without as much as a group ID set up saying \"hey it worked without it\". And specially the thundering herd (?) problem in case of rebalancing is quite tricky to explain to people, it seems. Your apps and pipelines need to be able to handle these, and that's an architectural decision, it's not just plug and play.And that's me mostly just using it client side as a developer/engineer, having to help Ops debug server side issues occasionally. You need a lot of observability over Linux data syscalls and disks, and it seems to me that the default dashboards only have CPU, memory, at most disk usage.~~But I would be even warier of building custom stuff on NAS storage, but hey, that's why I don't work at Ops~~ EDIT: sorry, misread it as NAS storage for some reason. BTW, just to make sure, you weren't trying to use them as persistence for Kafka, were you? I've had to discourage people from doing it, very few databases would handle being persisted to network storage well",

You also understand the culture and what sort of skills are valued there better than an external candidate could. So focus on your transferable experience and do whatever you can to learn technical skills you feel you have gaps for.If you don't have any technical skills at all from the job post above then I would recommend looking for a way to network with a team doing work you're interested in and seeing if you can convince your manager to let you collaborate with them on a stretch project.

Very different to distributed cloud DB computing where PK/FK constraints cannot be enforced, which is why we need to have a landing area for new data, staging, then Medallion.

Everyone rushed pushing pipelines into production without proper models, processes, conventions and standards in place. Data Modeling is not easy skill to obtain and requires lot of effort, time and multitude skills. My current teams uses data vault and dimensional modeling frameworks, it takes time to get to final data marts and views on top but we rarely have pipeline issues (DBT, Snowflake). We spend lot of time upfront, which saves lot of money and reduce development time and effort down the line, which is the right way of doing things. When we face any ELT issues, then we go back to the data model and analyze on how to de-couple, optimize the model without breaking the grain at times. It saves lot of load times in some of those big fact tables.  The issues I also noticed and I made those mistakes as well, shove tons of metrics into a fact table and calculate them at the fact table level. Instead those metrics should be calculated at one layer up (business vault or raw vault) layer and just load them as is into fact table. Fact table should be a simple select * from xyz tables. There's so many things that can go wrong in a pipeline and data model can solve many of those. We normally do a hands off to our DE's of our data models and mapping docs, it makes their life whole lot easier and efficient at times.",

Unfortunately CTOs will lap it up because data modelling takes time and expertise, and therefore money. AI produces superficially easy results that appear reasonable enough on first glance. But AIs don’t actually know anything about your business so they will confidently tell you things that are completely wrong, or which are true but not the correct answer to your question. Data modelling is not primarily a technical discipline, it is about extracting human-understandable meaning from what is otherwise just a bunch of ones and zeroes. It requires understanding your business deeply, and understanding what the business cares about and needs to measure.  This meaning is often not directly available in your raw data. You have to translate it for a business user.Now this is where the AI grifters will tell you “oh sure the AI isn’t great at that now but it’s going to get better with better models”. And sure, it will. But even when you have better models that can more accurately translate the user’s intent into a correct answer, you will still have the problem that each individual user is having a separate conversation with an AI. Bob might ask for revenue figures for last month, the AI asks him how to define revenue and gives him a correct answer based on his definition. Jenny has a separate conversation with the AI and gives a slightly different definition and the AI gives her a correct but DIFFERENT answer. So how do you fix this situation and ensure that Bob and Jenny get the exact same answer for revenue? You have to make sure there is a source that has the correctly calculated and verified definition of revenue ready for the AI to use. And what do we call this process? Data modelling!If anything, data modelling only gets more important in the age of AI. Since in the past when you had highly technical data and BI analysts answering the questions for you, you could rely on them having enough knowledge and expertise to work around the complexities and problems of the data. But in a world where every Bob, Jenny, and Harry with no technical knowledge expects to be able to ask the AI for answers themselves, you better be damn sure that it is working off a highly curated and verified source.",

It's not just one pattern though, it's sticking with whatever pattern makes sense for your company and ensuring it doesn't end up in a pile of irreconcilable shit. I don't see a huge reason to do dimensional modeling anymore other than your downstream tools may like it and it's useful if you have a lot of cross-subject rate calculations that benefit from conformed dimensions. A lot of businesses don't need that though and are fine with stuff like OBTs and master data and those help them move faster.I am also skeptical that we are going to see a lot of usefulness with LLMs and data any time soon. I think AI is very useful as a tool to help build pipelines and tools, but not as much for accessing data right now. Data models can be massive with lots of tables, columns and semantic descriptions for the content, so you end up flooding the context window and confusing the model (most of which is irrelevant context to the problem). A lot of the definitions are weird so don't align well with the model's training and people also ask the same question 20 different ways, which can lead to inconsistent answers. The way I have seen people trying to make AI systems that work is by slowly building up the model and keeping it small (i.e. not the enterprise model you are used to). So in the end it can only answer simple questions like \"tell me how much revenue we earned from product X in the last three months\". Given how much time you spend building and tuning the model until you feel like it works most of the time, isn't it faster to just give them a dashboard with the same capability and better accuracy? Also the user community is thinking that they will be able to prompt the model to do a deep dive that an analyst would spend a week on and that's just not reality.",

Departments will build their own vision on top of the mess you supply them with. I had a discussion lately with a professor ranting how multiple versions of the truth can coexist but believe me, companies just want 1 version. In the end, you don't want to have senior level management have a discussion in a meeting about what a cost center is, what data is correct, on what date FTE stats are calculated for reports and what the source is of all of this (that, in effect, will surge your indirect costs, drop the trust in your solution and eventually have management question why in gods name they hired those engineers).",

A GCP or AWS cert is useful, not because you will be an expert in every service, but because it expands your mental map of what tools exist and what they are good at. You can always go deep and learn them properly when you actually need them.",

You're lacking that mercantalist attitude and, without realising that the market is pretty solid right now letting organisations pay you a junior level salary (yes, a junior salary for companies with a strong tech culture) with 4 YOE.This isn't always a hard skills problem. This is also a softskills problem. Sorry to break it to you but markets do not operate on merit alone. It's also who you know, who you get to know, and timing. I was working a junior salary for the longest time (40k a year junior dev) and then I went right up to 170k/year as of today. I was lucky to have the Elixir slack group back in the day sit me down and have this talk with me and make me realise I'm letting myself get hustled (or fleeced if you're a northerner like me :) ) because I lack the self confidence to apply for positions that pay a respectable income, in the UK, above what a copywriter makes. I think you need to work more towards becoming a software enigneer and less of a tooling engineer. But even with your experience I'd estimate you should be able to pull at least 30k more in more of a devops role. There are a LOT of companies with broken data pipelines. Your job is to get street wise.",

ProductSense means that you have the ability to work backwards from the product to the data pipelines. Understanding what needs to be measured, how to measure it, and then building the pipelines.Some core skills that you need to be really good at in todays modern data tech stack world are these:- Strong SQL, i.e. its like reading and writing english- DBT, don’t let a new tool intermediate you, it’s just SQL queries orchestrated in an autogenerated DAG. - Data QA, building pipelines where data quality tests are first class citizens. The moment your dashboard shows one wrong number people instantly loose trust in your data assets. Better to delay data availability then delivering and redacting later.Some tools to look into:- Airbyte for data ingestion- Superset and Metabase for BI tools- Duckdb",

        "body": "100% agree but in the past 6 months AI agents have really changed how my team and I work.As I was writing the stuff below I realized it became too long... so here's a summary.TLDR; going from first using agents to improve our data pipelines and stack, to eventually creating a more self-service system where our data consumers use AI agents to interact with the data. For some context, I'm leading the DE team of 4-5 people (1 mid/senior, 1 junior, 2-3 interns) at a company where our end product is predictions for highly specialized industries (e.g. renewables, transportation).At first it started with using our data platform's MCP with cursor to just lookup documentation, then I started asking cursor to read our data pipelines and query the dwh directly to find the specific part of a query or script that was causing some issue.But in the past couple months, after creating some extensive agent rules/instructions documentations as well as creating a md file for each pipeline that contains some business context, I have been able to fully rely on cursor to build pipelines or make major changes.A recent example is that I spent \\~1 hour creating a details requirements document that I gave as the prompt, the agent make changes to \\~10 files (mostly sql models and some yml configs and a python ingestion script). About 3-4 hours of back and forth with the agents to make some adjustments, update documentation, and runs tests and validation. The entire process was done in a single workday, whereas normally this would've been 2-3 days of work.Its not always about \"saving\" time for me but rather its about doing things the \"better\" way - a clear example of this is having the agents create/update documentation, build/run tests, perform adhoc validations, etc. which translates into time saving in the futureI know what I've said above is not related to \"AI on top of broken data stack\", but the reason why I'm talking about how AI is helping data engineers is because I think it that is the sole reason/contributor to speeding up the process of fixing and improving our data stack.By fully utilizing the combination of cursor, mcp integrations, internal rules/instructions/context documents, and access to query our data warehouse, we were able to \"slap AI on top of our data\" as in:\\- other teams (i.e. data science, software engineering, product, etc.) to also close our data engineering repos and have conversations with cursor to ask it about the logic behind data models (e.g. does table\\_xyz contain data from source\\_abc? how often does table\\_xyz get updated? what is the calculation method for kpi abc?)\\- integration of an AI Slackbot (provided by our data platform provider) that queries our dwh and returns insights - as a result, we have seen people in data science, sales, execs, etc. move away from using dashboards and instead asking the slackbot directly inside threads things like \"what was our prediction accuracy last week?\" \"how did model A perform vs model B last year?\"I think this only became possible because we were able to quickly (within 2-3 months) clean up our data pipelines and data models, create a lot of documentation and context for AI to utilize, and break down the barrier between data consumers and the data itself - this way as the data engineering team, we are no longer a bottleneck and things have finally trending towards the \"self-service\" utopia we've always dreamt about.",

It caters to both OLTP and OLAP, bringing together the best-in class OSS databases for each (Postgres and ClickHouse) and offering them in the most integrated way. We’ve seen many thousands of companies use Postgres and ClickHouse to build their data stacks, and the adoption is growing very fast. The idea behind this Postgres offering is to bring them even closer together and make that integration as effortless as possible for developers. :)With regard to integration, the vision behind our CDC capabilities is to offer a much more native experience, something you can’t get from other services and addresses problems around standard CDC. Additionally, the `pg_clickhouse` extension will be native to this service and maintained by ClickHouse, and will act as a unified query layer for both transactional and analytical workloads. We plan to invest heavily in this area to make application migration as seamless as possible.Apart from all of this, the Postgres we are offering is NVMe-backed, which is very fast and comes enterprise-grade guarantees. We are building this in partnership with a world-class Postgres team at Ubicloud who were ex-Citus, Heroku, Microsoft Postgres.This launch was a primer, stay tuned for a more very soon! :)",

The code usually doesn't run, and these people are completely closed off to constructive criticism, so nothing has improved for weeks. They do like to bitch about us, though. My manager came to me yesterday to tell me I needed to be more patient and to train one of these guys more. There is no training taking place, because they're not actually attempting to do what is asked of them. Copying and pasting things into and put of an LLM is not learning or trying, it's just creating slop. Ive gone over the changes that need made to a file three times now and have shown them the exact lines where changes need to be made. Something that I've told them is only a 3 line update turns into a 600+ line diff.Last week, I got on a call with my tech lead and one of these guys and went through every single line he had updated in a PR and asked him to explain his design decisions. He literally couldn't explain what the code did at all. So, at least on my team, it's a huge issue. We are hiring people that aren't competent because our leadership assumes that any idiot can generate code via an LLM, so they're hiring the cheapest idiots they can find.

Designing Data Intensive Applications is excellent, but it’s more of a “why things work this way” book, so it lands better once you’ve built or broken a few pipelines. Zoomcamp will honestly teach you more faster than passive reading, so I’d prioritize that and use the books as references alongside it.

Here is my advice:If you want to break into this field you need to take your studies very seriously. In the age of AI your coding skills alone are no longer enough. You need to be able to help the business architect solutions to data problems. Furthermore if you are not knowledgeable on architecture design you probably won’t land a senior role at all. Those who stand out the most to me are knowledgeable on modern tools but more specifically the value they provide. Those who standout the least cannot explain how to design a data solution. I think it’s a highly rewarding field with opportunity for growth but you have to be ready to work hard, especially when it comes to continuous learning.",

There might be other tools (BI tools, proxies, etc) that have built in support for more popular platforms that won't work with MotherDuck out the box. None of these are particularly insurmountable, just costs you should be happy to take on in exchange for the experience you like. One thing you might do to hedge is store data at rest in Iceberg on GCS and self host a catalog like \\[Lakekeeper\\](https://docs.lakekeeper.io/). Then your data is completely portable. If you for some reason determine you need to switch to Snowflake or Databricks, they can read data form this catalog and you don't have to move anything. Or you may even find out you want MotherDuck for most things but have specific use cases where another engine like Clickhouse is useful. This approach lets you separate the concerns of how the data is stored from what product(s) you use to query it.",

It is not a super complicated stack but it *is* work and creates an additional point of failure, especially with the networking and security side of it imo. My recommendation is keep it as is if you love it since Motherduck appears to be a very affordable service, if you end up having to migrate later on it should not be a very heavy lift. Best of luck on your business!",

Then after that, become familiar with at least one major cloud provider. AWS, Azure, GCP. Be strategic here. I’ve noticed specific industries prefer one vs the others. Your data analyst background should have given you ample knowledge on how to create tables (ideally in sql, but I think understanding excel tables and pivot tables help too). Data exploration is an important skill, but understanding schemas and how they fit together is the crucial part. Your data analyst background should help with data modeling as well. Try to focus on roles that highlight these things in the job description. Also be aware that there are different flavors of data engineers. Being analytics focused means you’re more on the business intelligence and dashboarding side. Highlight your storytelling and data vis exp. If you’re on the ML side, highlight how you productionize ML models and maintain workflows.",

Best-practice in terms of this kind of thing is to know the trade-offs), implement observability from day 1 (that can be writing logs and checking them daily in cloudwatch at the start).Note that MANY of your trade-offs and architectural decisions will depend on what kind of requirements are required downstream. In fact, the very first thing you need to map is who are the data consumers and what are their needs - mind you that more often than not the end-users have very vague requirements (it is often a big part of the job to translate vague business requirements into technical choices - also, often what they want is different than what they need). If applicable to your case: also talk to upstream stakeholders (feks, in my company, the data is generated by services written by developers, so I have to sync with them to understand what is doable or not in terms of data serving/latency)EDIT: also, if you are not super familiar with AWS, dont underestimate how much time you'll spend implementing things there :D(I'm in a similar position, where I wear the architect, tech lead and engineer hat at the same time - and oh, Iam also brazilian ;) )",

As long as everything was simple with a single region and incoming product, and a few people had been working on it and had direct experience with how everything was done, then the 'quirks' were kept to a minimum and everyone knew them.Then as new team members got onboarded things got harder. People had to be taught all the quirks of which role to use when creating a glue job vs an interactive notebook, they had to be shown the magic command boilerplate to get glue catalog and iceberg tables working, they needed to know the bucket that was set up for output for Athena queries. With more people working not everyone could be across everyone else's work, so people weren't familiar with how various custom jobs and scripts had been made, and because each job was its own mini vertical stack there was a lot of repeated components in infrastructure, policies, ci/cd scripts.As new use cases came on that didn't fit the mould new ways of doing things had to be added. Kinesis and firehose come in, airflow orchestration gets tasked for some small transforms while others go to glue jobs. Someone wants a warehouse/database to query, so redshift is added. Exports to third party processors are needed as are imports, so more buckets, more permissions. API ingestions are needed so in come lambda functions, with each one coded and deployed differently because nobody can see what everyone else is doing.Then finally users need access to data, and the team just isn't set up for it. There is no central catalog with everything, it is spread out across half a dozen services, and the only way to know where anything is or goes is to dig through the code. That 'worked' for the DE team, since they were the ones doing the digging, but there was no effective way to give access to everything. Every request for data took days or weeks to finalise, and often required more pipelines to move it to where it could be accessed.We're moving to Databricks soon. It gives a unified UI for DE and other teams to access the data, you get sql endpoints, you can run basic compute on single-node 'clusters', it has orchestration built in, it gives you a somewhat easier way to manage permissions, and it works for both running your own compute and giving data access. Instead of a mishmash of technologies that don't make a unified platform, you get a consistent experience.You'll just have to pay extra since it is doing a good portion of that unification work for you.If you had a hundred DE type roles it might be more cost effective to stick with base aws services, and have a dedicated team focused on dx, standards, and productivity, to cut out the managed compute cost. But if you're just 3 people, you're probably not there.",

I have experience with spark, orchestration, A.I. Agents, etc. Databricks can do everything you listed. It is not the best in each category. Airflow is a superior orchestration tool than Databricks Workflows, for example. However Databricks provides tools in all categories that are more than good enough.I find myself surprised how easy most things are. I usually do a POC with a G.U.I. first. Then reimplement with code, checking against the G.U.I. POC as I go. There is a G.U I. for Databricks Workflows and A.I. Agents. In general, everything seems to be as easy as possible, with good default settings. The advantage of having good enough tools in broad categories that all integrate well with each other makes life easy.Measured against AWS, Databricks is more expensive. Your company can either pay more for compute ( go with Databricks) or pay more to expand the team with specialized people (AWS). Expensive compute is cheaper than expensive specialists.Plus Databricks is moving to everything runs on serverless. In practice, I would say 80% to 90% of prod code runs on serverless. I see this improving with time.Closing remark. Databricks is a thought leader. They have made many open source software that everything else is compared to. (Spark, MLflow, DeltaLake,...). Databricks competitors run Databricks open source software. Agent bricks hosts 20+ LLMs out of the box. I don't know what the future holds, but I bet Databricks drives it.",

We used all of the technologies you listed except data tone and only a bit of lake formation. Then we wanted to have a business facing data catalogue with lineage and there wasn’t much available in AWS. As of 2026 I would argue that is still the case. For data catalogue we used OpenMetadata. For hosting we used EKS btw.Long story short it takes a lot of development effort to put all of these technologies together and to maintain it. It works well once done and it is scalable. But if I would do it again I would use Databricks in 2026. Gets you started quickly. Downside will be cost as you have to pay for DBUs on top off AWS cost. Arguably you would need less data developers which could pay for the additional cost. I know this is a bit off a sticking point nobody wants to think about. But if you plan to use your devs to build the AWS solution then you already covered the dev cost. If you go with Databricks you may need less data devs, assuming that some part of their time is currently used for infrastructure work. If the new AWS architecture would need more devs than the argument would be that Databricks would allow you to operate with the current number of devs.If you decide to go with databricks use an open source table format like iceberg to reduce vendor locking. Also bear in mind, databricks can support all of the requirements you listed, but is not best in class for all of them like BI, orchestration, gen ai etc. the core is around spark and related services.",

So, can you do all those things yourself? Probably. Is it worth doing those all yourself when you could be focused on delivering solutions for the business especially as a smaller team? Likely not, but that also depends on the current skill level of your team and the level of infrastructure you’ll have to maintain. It very well could be that you don’t need a lot of the bells and whistles offered by some of these platforms and it would be a big contract you don’t necessarily need",

RAG uses a vector similarity search algorithm to look up related information and graphs rely on nodes and edges to connect relationships in your data. Basically look at how Neo4j works. They have been talking about the graph approach for a while, but barriers are how your data is organized/tagged as it's less effective the fewer relationships you have. That's not easy to establish depending on what your metadata looks like. Also massive graph dbs tend to not be that performant. You can still get pretty good results with them, especially for document search use cases or something like that. But there are also people talking about how tensor based LLMs are limited and not going to get us to the promised land and the next step might be difusion models or something else. AWS also was talking about how they are maxing out what they can do with generic LLMs in training and how they could be more effective if they had access to actual business data to train on (not going to happen). Agentic systems are the current hot thing where you can create \"tools\" for the LLM to use based on the context. Like if a user asks an accounting question, the LLM can call an accounting agent that might have textual, RAG or graph resources to answer the call. It's interesting but also infuriating that there are so many approaches and the \"best\" approach changes almost weekly. It's still very early in AI development so I guess I would say don't freak out about learning one thing as it will likely change, but definitely do get into working with AI is future work will depending on it. It's not going away.",

LLMs may seem reasonable, especially for a one time match, but I guess I would want to see it in action compared to other approaches.

They just think 'but this is what everyone else is using so I should use it'.The annoying thing is, if you have good judgement and figure out the most appropriate tech to use, that can get in the way of upskilling if you settle on a simple, cheap but more mundane alternative.If you want to learn some of the things you listed:- if you're using snowflake, why not just start using dbt + git to manage your SQL?- how is data getting into snowflake in the first place? If that looks quite manual at the moment, maybe try setting up airflow to schedule data extraction / loadI think you could probably find opportunities to do things you want to - obviously not all of it but maybe have a think about what's possible",

Same with Airflow—just automating even one small pipeline can help you understand DAGs and scheduling. And if you want to broaden a bit into API stuff but aren’t getting those projects at work, there are plenty of open datasets out there you could ETL into Snowflake as a side project. Sometimes the best way to get experience is just faking a “business need” for yourself.Ultimately, don’t sweat the trend-hopping; being able to design and maintain stable, clear data products is way rarer (and more valuable) than knowing every tool under the sun.",

It's his project that he needs to answer for and all you can do is what you are told and what you know will help move it forward. Hopefully he will get fired sooner rather than later, which wasn't my experience unfortunately. You can't tell with executive priorities and relationships. But when a project like that is hyped and never appears, usually someone has to answer for that. Have documentation of your communications with him saved so if they come back to you you can lay it all out for them. The big thing though is don't let it overly stress you out as it's not under your control or your responsibility to the company.",

It’s never happening, don’t try.My advice: be practical and treat the old stuff like it’s cancer that needs to be cut out.Don’t try to document the mess you have. Instead build or fix things one piece at a time and document that as you go. Build in parallel, dual run against the old things, and when you know the old tables and batches are redundant, take them out back and shoot them in the head.Also, forget AI. It knows when I’ve forgotten to close a print statement in my shitty code, but it doesn’t know architecture or systems design.If you want to automate this, try the missing index reports. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-missing-index-groups-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17Be wary, this reflects what queries are written and run (probably by the same useless engineers that made this mess) rather than the actual logic and definitions that matters. So a badly written query moving data no one needs will be boosted in the output ranking. But it’s the clearest indication you’ll get of what the entry patterns into your tables are and what is missing and will help you prioritise.",

It's great.Where I work I use the MySQL v8 ODBC in a Windows server running MSSQL in prod, and push tables across the network truncate/load in a remote staging tables of a MySQL server (that the Wan IP addresses & ports are fixed and whitelisted for security). Once the load is completed, a stored proc is called remotely to signal the MySQL to process those staging tables.It's an annoying process though, I would rather create flat files, push them somewhere, and an event triggered at the remote end (like a datalake container/folder) processes them. I could then make JSON data and send that, also based on events.IOW, JDBC/ODBC between servers is a \"work-around\" solution, and it's slow. Like 45 mins to send 2 gigs of data.HTH",

I would be lying if I said juniors have it significantly easier overall than other countries, but I guess the overall biggest demand by far for data you will find in Berlin, it's our digital business central. Also, Berlin has the comparatively highest share of startups which will be rather favorable to young professionals. Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam is an excellent university for Data Engineering studies, propably TU Berlin as well. That said, Munich (TUM is excellent for CS), Frankfurt (finance) or Cologne/ Düsseldorf probably are also solid choices. But expect significantly higher share of enterprises/ huge corporates with accordingly longer hiring processes. At the end of the day, a \"good\" choice comes down to your field of study, preferred career field and preferred company type (startup/ corporate).",

Also from a leadership standpoint, if you leave the company, they would need to replace you with someone with enough Python capability to take over ownership of the pipeline - which is a more expensive resource than just a pure analytics/sql person.All of this is more strategic considerations vs purely technical ones, so may not be relevant, but just wanted to explain how I would think about it from a leadership perspective.",

It’s a known headache; Terraform’s support for complex Glue table definitions is still lagging, so most teams I know either maintain pretty gnarly workarounds or split things up.A pattern I’ve seen work well: Use Terraform strictly for the infra “shell” (buckets, Glue databases, IAM, etc.), but let something like dbt or custom scripts handle actual table creation and evolution. Glue jobs with bootstrapping logic (or even AWS SDK/CLI scripts) can generate and update the tables as needed, while the Terraform state stays clean and manageable. It does add an extra step to your deploys, but it’s more transparent and less prone to silent breakage than bending Terraform out of shape.For versioning, a lot of folks lean on dbt’s schema versions and migration patterns, even if it means treating Glue like more of a catalog pointer than a true source of state.Curious to see if anyone’s found a less clunky solution that keeps everything declarative—but so far, the split-responsibility model seems the most maintainable.",

Your Python service pulls data from the carpark API and publishes events as they arrive. From there, you usually want some kind of streaming or messaging layer to decouple ingestion from processing, so bursts or failures don’t break everything. Next comes processing, where you clean the data, handle duplicates or late events, and compute whatever metrics you care about (occupancy, availability trends, etc.). This can be done in near-real-time or small micro-batches depending on complexity. The processed output then lands in a store that’s optimized for querying or visualization, which your frontend reads from. The key ideas to focus on early are idempotency, schema consistency, and what “real time” actually means for your use case (seconds vs minutes). Start simple, get something end to end working, then layer in streaming frameworks, windowing, and fault tolerance once you understand the flow",

You can also look at public datasets from places like AWS Open Data or Google BigQuery public datasets and just pull subsets under 100GB.Medallion isn’t the *only* layering pattern, it’s just the most common mental model. Some teams add things like a “raw but validated” layer, or domainoriented marts instead of a single gold layer. The naming matters less than being clear about guarantees (schema stability, data quality, latency).For monitoring, beyond infra metrics, it’s worth looking into data-quality checks at the Spark/Iceberg level (row counts, freshness, null checks). Tools like Great Expectations or simple custom checks in Airflow go a long way in a POC. Scaling pain usually shows up first around small-file problems, metadata growth, and orchestration complexity rather than raw storage cost.Honestly, you’re already doing the right thing by focusing on practice and observability early that’s where most realworld lakehouses struggle.",

You should treat your SQL server as the Control Plane and a dedicated file store (like S3, Azure Blob, or a MinIO instance) as the Data Plane. Your Python script functions as a gateway that pulls data from your various sources and subjects it to a strict validation suite before it ever reaches the ML team. Instead of raw CSVs or SQL dumps, have your script convert the data into Parquet files; this format is compressed, schema-enforced, and significantly faster for ML frameworks to load than standard text files. Once the script validates and saves the file to your central storage, it should write a record to a \"Manifest\" table in your SQL server. This record includes the file path, a unique version ID, a checksum to prevent corruption, and the results of your quality tests. The ML team then simply queries this SQL table to find the URI of the latest \"Verified\" dataset, eliminating the need for email threads and manual downloads.This setup transforms your manual 70GB bottleneck into a robust, versioned data pipeline that maintains the SWE standards of your core application.",

Chunking with pandas is a solid approach for memory management, but you do have to be careful: some operations just don’t make sense chunk-by-chunk.Chunking is great for row-wise, stateless preprocessing (cleanup, type conversion, basic feature engineering). But for anything that needs a full view of the data—global normalization, deduplication, calculating rare category frequencies, finding global min/max—you’ll either need multiple passes or a clever accumulation/aggregation step.A typical workflow for your scenario:- First pass: Scan over chunks to gather global stats (means, stds, value counts, rare category thresholds).- Second pass: Use those stats to transform the data in chunks. Outlier detection, normalization, etc. can be done chunked, but with knowledge of global parameters.- Save intermediate files as Parquet if possible, for speed and compression.- Tools: Dask and Polars both handle these kinds of workflows better than vanilla pandas, especially Polars for very fast I/O and multi-threading.- For Colab: keep an eye on disk (mount Google Drive if needed), and be ready to restart if you hit session limits.If you ever need to empower less technical folks to safely interact with this data (without risking direct DB access), there are platforms nowadays that let you build internal apps over your datasets via drag-and-drop, or even AI chat interfaces. Could help with democratizing those big data insights beyond just the Python crowd.But for now: chunking + multi-pass over Parquet files + Dask/Polars is the combo I’ve seen work well in similar RAM-constrained settings.

At 30M rows, this almost always triggers an OOM (Out of Memory) crash in environments like Colab.​Serialization Overhead: Converting DuckDB’s internal format to Pandas and then to a model-ready format creates unnecessary CPU work and memory duplication.​Moving to Polars solved this because it feels like it was built for the 'Model' part of 'Data Science.' Since it uses the Apache Arrow memory format, it integrates seamlessly with XGBoost, LightGBM, and Scikit-Learn with zero-copy potential meaning the model can often read the data directly without doubling the RAM usage.​The Lazy API and Streaming mode let me handle the full 30M-row feature engineering pipeline with way more stability. I can build complex transformations (scaling, encoding, joins) and only 'collect' the data when the model is ready for it. It's definitely the move if you're looking to build a scalable, production-ready ML pipeline!",

The Dask scheduler itself consumes memory, and on a single weak machine, it often dies with Killed worker even faster than Pandas due to memory fragmentation. If we are talking about constrained resources and 30M rows, Polars (minus heavy window functions) or DuckDB will have significantly lower overhead than spinning up a full Dask task graph. Dask shines when you have a cluster, but on a single notebook, it often loses to native engines",

Store as JSON. Why? For SSoT and what if the supplier of that API goes out of business, changes their API in some way, that breaks your code? What if in your dataframe the tuple you extract as a table, you're not pulling all entites or all columns - then the business wants you to add those extra columns, retroactively from Day 1 you've been gathering. You're screwed - you don't have it anymore.So E-L-T. Extract (Python + API), Load (into storage for 100% retrieval of 100% of that data), Transform (into a Staging layer, dedupe, business rule(s) for ingestion UpSert or Rejection, into the Bronze layer.So Bronze has proper types and only valid data, Bronze can be destroyed (for a particular source) and recreated at any point in time in the future by rereading all the data in the Datalake and redoing the L & T of the ELT. Staging is usually truncate/load style, and uses Datalake functionality for ingestion - Python isn't needed here at all. Python only for reading from APIs and other distant sources, not for moving data around in the database.Python has another function - for ML - where Python does extensive transformations by reading Bronze & Silver (or even the raw Datalake data) to \"invent\" new data that is then fed back into a Staging layer. For example, a customer \"rating\" based on criteria that can span multiple source systems for that customer.",

Once the contract is up, SAP disables your company account, and boom, APIs no longer work, that SAP data that the company created is gone forever.Or, the cloud supplier doesn't use a version # in their API https url name, and they change the JSON structure enough to break existing code.When the L of ELT is done within the database layer with staging, this is an easy fix, and the Python gathering part, the E of ELT, continues to work as-is.In most cases, the SELECT statement reading the JSON data through the Datalake and putting the result of that Select statement into a staging table will continue to work, as you never ever do SELECT \\* FROM (external table), will instead specify which columns.So fixing the SELECT into the JSON can be done without stress / alarm, and you can easily go back in time to gather the new columns since the time they were available.So Python -> DL -> Staging (Snowflake + Snowpipe with Python as the language can be used here - event driven - or simple SQL) -> Business Rules -> Bronze or Reject.You add audit columns and hashing as required in the Staging table to facilitate the UpSert logic. Remember to do Delete tracking, and other special cases, like Customer B buys out Customer A, what does the business want to do with the Customer A data? Merge or keep distinct, or both!",

Still, right now, our question is whether or not we need to run delta lake maintenance operations (optimize/vacuum) on the bronze table that we currently have.I'll make sure that we revisit the question about storing API responses as files.For context: We are migrating an existing solution, which used to be an Azure Function running C# code that wrote the data to a staging table in a SQL database, to a python notebook in Microsoft Fabric that writes the data to a delta lake table in a lakehouse.We are replacing SQL database + Analysis Services with Delta Lake + Power BI.Currently, our setup is a blueprint copy of the existing solution, which doesn't store the raw data in files.I'm unsure whether we will get the budget to rewrite that part of the process now. We have fast-tracked this project so far, and it's not clear how much work the budget will allow us. I'll also admit that I don't have years of experience as a DE.I highly appreciate the inputs, I'll use this as ammunition for budget discussions about rewriting the ingestion part.",

A few design things that usually matter more than model choicee would be like always ground generation on the actual schema + metrics layer, not just table names. Most failures come from the model guessing joins or columns, Add a validation step before execution (dry run, limits, blocked queries). Don’t let raw generated SQL hit prod blindly. Start narrow, Constrain what users can ask for (time ranges, metrics, dimensions) before going fully “chatty”. On the knowledge side, most teams I’ve seen keep it simple, Use RAG for business logic, definitions, metric semantics,Treat schema and relationships as structured input, not embeddings.GraphRAG helps when relationships are complex, but it adds a lot of operational overhead.Solr *can* work for retrieval, but it’s usually better as a search layer than a true graph store. If relationships matter a lot, a dedicated graph or just explicit schema metadata often ends up clearer and more reliable. and correctness and guardrails beat clever architecture early. If users don’t trust the numbers, they won’t use it, no matter how good the UX is",

What if my company’s fiscal year begins in March and ends on last day of Feb? That’s business knowledge that your solution needs. Full disclosure: I work at Databricks, and since you mentioned Azure in another comment.. just reminding that Azure Databricks is a first party PaaS offering in Azure. I have helped many customers with this problem and truly believe that what Databricks gives is a high quality text2sql solution with AIBI Genie. You can find lot of information on Databricks Genie and its benchmarking results.Its a hard problem to solve especially around the biggest requirement which I see from analysts or power users, which is the need for quality and deterministic SQL code. This is where traditional BI does well, whereas LLMs could hallucinate.Best practices in Genie include using well curated metadata about each dataset, column definitions, semantic understanding about the data etc. These become non negotiable with agent based solution, since that's the only context for AI.Something like Genie being a tool in your arsenal will help your overall agentic solution. And best part is that you don't need data to be in Databricks. Databricks can connect into your database via Lakehouse federation and understand the layout of data.",

You’re reacting to constraints like messy data, changing requirements, cost limits, and systems you didn’t choose. So the thinking becomes things like where this pipeline will actually break, what happens when volume doubles, what can fail safely and what cannot, and what’s expensive to recompute versus cheap to store. If you’re not on a DE project right now, the closest substitute is to simulate real pain. Take a public dataset and design ingestion, transformations, and reporting, then deliberately change assumptions like schema changes, late arriving data, backfills, or higher volume, and force yourself to optimize for cost and reliability instead of elegance. Books and blogs help with vocabulary, but most architectural thinking comes from asking what the simplest thing is that won’t hurt you later, then being wrong a few times. Reading postmortems and migration stories taught me more than polished tutorials ever did. You don’t really learn architecture in a vacuum, but you can train the mindset by constantly reasoning about constraints, failure modes, and long term impact",

While books & courses are great, practical experience will teach you better than any of those. I'd suggest just look into your current company and see how data engineering is applied there. Consume your DEs' entire docs to get ideas or get shadowing sessions. This is what I did to transition, I just reviewed what I already know from experience. If you can transfer internally, that would be better.Understand your ETL/ELT pipelines like how data moves from point A to B (from source system up to the analytics layer) in your company. Learn how & why certain tools are being used in the system, their trade-offs in terms of scalability, costs, reliability, their impact, etc. Software engineering plus systems analysis & design concepts help a lot like SDLC & Agile methodologies for example.If you're proficient with SQL and be able to explain different situations such as knowing when to use subquery vs CTE, view vs materialized view, handling duplicate records, optimizing queries etc. then you're more or less good to go. Knowledge of Python/PySpark helps a lot as well. Understand and differentiate between a data warehouse, data mart, data lake, data lakehouse, dim vs fact tables, normalization vs denormalization, file formats (csv, tsv, parquet, avro), etc. Knowledge of cloud also helps. These are the usual concepts being asked during interviews and what you do on the job regularly.",

There's some tools out there that claim to do this but i havent used them. You can probably guess what part is killing performance looking at the types of joins (broadcast joins are fast vs big fact to fact table joins will be slower, sometimes range joins can be slow if they're not optimized, etc), knowing your data and how it's being joined will be super helpful too.",

I have also been involved with several data warehouse builds in my career. You are thinking about it in the right way as this stuff is always a series of tradeoffs. What does feature X do for us, how long will it take and what value does it provide?It seems like you are vague on requirements, which is the norm, so I would focus on that as it will inform what you build (i.e. you will be rebuilding and reloading if you miss a bunch of stuff). Start with what you have today and come up with a list of columns and the concepts they related to as a starting point. I would also get with whoever does the budget modeling / FP&A work for the company as they know the KPIs and drivers of the business, which you will have to align to. At the end you should have a list of columns or metrics with a domain and column (e.g. domain is customer and columns for account number, name, address, etc).Then start with that as you talk to other stakeholders. A good meeting might involve say someone from marketing who knows the views they want to see, a data analyst who might know what columns/calculations are involved in producing that view and then you and your DA can bump that off against your model. It's easier to ask them for what's missing rather than come to them with a blank sheet of paper. Also get a sign off from the department because they will inevitably come back with 20 more requests on the week you drop the finished product. The DA should be able to work from that artifact.The data model is important because ideally you want one data source that feeds 80% or more of your data requests. This ensures that data is consistent across all reporting and dashboards as it uses the same core data and calculations. If there is an error in a calculation, you can change it in one place and it propagates across all the dependencies. If you build custom data models for each dashboard or request, then you can have inconsistencies where the developer used the wrong formula, or when you need to make a change you have to find it and change it dozens to hundreds of times.In terms of important things I would say requirements is first (though you can often do this incrementally), then figuring out your infrastructure. Like what is your approach to building pipelines and does it provide velocity to develop, is it maintainable, observable, etc. Does your data platform align well with the likely use cases you know about? You sort of need this initial planning in place to get going, but afterward you can build incrementally as MVPs or by data subject to show off progress.You need to balance delivering value and insight to the business with the necessary things to support a robust platform. Things like automations should be considered, but it's a question of prioritization. How much time does the automation save vs time to build right now? Can we defer it without major consequences? Which ones are the priority? Can we produce demoable work each sprint or quarter to show progress, and better if the platform can be partially used to deliver value ahead of being fully fleshed out.\\-sorry for the essay.",

You can treat them like generic work items with tasks. If you don’t have visibility into your work load there is almost no chance it will get better. If you have a visible prioritized workload it is much easier to say “Bob said this is top priority and put it at my #1 as you can see. Cindy if you want this sooner go talk with Bob or whoever is at #2”Plus the better visibility and tracking makes it easier to generate justifications for more people. It turns the conversation either your manager from “why aren’t you getting anything done and people are complaining to me” to “wow I didn’t realize you had so much work”",

That cost should be separated, since it is a different discussion than the rest of the CDC discussion, unless you design a solution that needs to be re-initialized regularly. Eg. I think Fabric's \"mirroring\" involves re-seeding every time the capacity is stopped and restarted. The \"after that\" part of your answer is probably more interesting to OP. This is where the underlying CDC magic happens. Most databases implement CDC by feeding the database transaction log to the subscriber. This can be done asynchronously, at a lower priority than anything else that is happening. In other words, the normal clients and users of the database can be given priority, and the CDC work can take place whenever there are free resources. I wouldn't necessarily agree with the \"5-10%\" increase in server usage unless the server was very small. This overhead would be based on a number of factors. If you had a TB of data and 32 cores on your DBMS and only 100 CUD operations at the source a day, then the amount of transaction log activity would be neglible and the CDC workload would be virtually zero. All things being equal the CDC workload would increase as the transaction log becomes more busy. And even then the source DBMS wouldn't prioritize CDC activities over regular database usage.",

Since you've been working as a DE for a number of years and you're trying to over-employ (?!) I'll assume somewhere at the mid-level. I'll note that I've primarily worked at startups so mid-level in my mind may have higher requirements or expectations than mid-level at MNCs.At the mid level or senior level, I'd expect a DE to get assigned a few tickets at the beginning of a sprint and, during standup, note that they're looking for a new ticket if they're done with their existing work. I'd also expect them to keep us abreast of any developments in their work so it doesn't fall behind, etc.For ad hoc requests, if there does not exist a triage system (for example: if no one picks this up in 15 minutes, it's fair game for anyone and respond to the request) then I would recommend suggesting one. If the style is \"whoever sees it first\" (like my job right now) then either the DEs must adapt to that style or communicate with one-another to enforce another style (like triage and sprint protectors or something); to ignore ad hoc requests or to require others to triage is putting extra work on the team --- and it seems like you've already been talked to about it, so it's possible that the team doesn't love that you don't pick up ad hoc stuff. The big word here is _communication_, and it's extremely important to have team-wide communication open.\"Oh, but my job is so hard, and it's impossible to do XYZ...!\" Yes, I know, there are a hundred thousand excuses for why any of us don't like our jobs and why it's impossible and why the workload is intolerable. The reality of the situation is that you either adapt or fail to thrive.---As I finished this, I saw this comment:> I had mentioned how things worked with me in the past and I thing it is really simple and clear if engineering lead or manager just informs me if they want to pick any issues up. Im thinking proactive would come eventually but not in a forced manner.I would never want to work with a mid-to-senior+ level DE who has this mindset. How do you expect being proactive would come _eventually_ if you aren't practicing it at all and making your lead / manager do all the triage _for you_ (which gives them _more work_ to do)?EDIT: Apologies for being so blunt here: I've had a few coworkers in the last year with this mindset who made my job significantly more frustrating than it needed to be. I want you to succeed in your company but it looks like you reply with a lot of excuses to well-meaning comments so I'm trying this approach.",

If my manager was like be more proactive and assign yourself work then I would have probably done that. Find a middle ground that works both for your style and your manager style. We also have rotation where if a pipeline breaks the person who is on call works on it + his tickets and everyone else just does their tickets. This keep changing every week. That way everyone in the team is exposed to different pipelines and feel comfortable when things break.",

A lot of people who get bored in senior analyst roles feel that same shift, less enjoyment from “telling the story” and more from building the systems and models that make everything work. If you enjoy data modeling, Python, and building tools that reduce friction for others, that’s already a big piece of modern DE work. Many DE roles today are less about pure infra and more about enabling analytics at scale, which fits your background well. You’re not starting from zero, you’re just moving closer to the plumbing. On the ITIL / process side yes, it’s more structured, and that can be frustrating at first. The upside is fewer fire drills and clearer ownership the downside is slower change and more ceremony. People coming from “fast and loose” teams usually struggle with pace more than the work itself, but most adapt once they see the stability benefits. As for frustrations, you’ve already named most of them unclear requirements, data quality issues, tribal knowledge, and legacy decisions you inherit. The flip side is that fixing those things is often exactly what makes the job satisfying. If building and improving systems is what energises you right now, the secondment sounds like a low-risk way to test whether DE clicks long term",

We had this sprawling CRM system that had been customized over the years by like 5 different consultants none of whom seemed to talk to each other. Marketing was using one set of IDs for customers sales had another and finance was just throwing their hands up in the air. Trying to get a single reliable customer view was a nightmare. We spent weeks just trying to map out the different entities and how they related to each other. It felt like unraveling a giant knotted ball of yarn. And then of course once we thought we had it figured out someone would drop a bomb like Oh yeah that table We stopped using that three years ago but nobody told anyone. The worst part was the constant requests for data pulls. Sales would want a list of customers with X Y and Z marketing needed a segment with A B and C and the data team was stuck writing custom SQL queries all day long. It was completely unsustainable and we never got to work on anything strategic. What finally saved us was this virtual data platform we implemented. The thing that impressed us most was its ability to automatically discover all these hidden relationships between entities that would have taken us weeks to untangle manually. The AI engine identified and resolved data quality issues too duplicate entries mismatched data types the whole nine yards. We didnt have to move or duplicate any data either which was a huge plus for security and compliance. Then once the data was unified we started building no-code ETL processes to push cleansed data to the different systems and to our data warehouse. That part really freed up our data team. Instead of constantly fulfilling ad-hoc requests we could focus on building actual data products and analytics. Seriously the reduction in headaches alone was worth the cost. I know it sounds like Im selling you something here and I kinda am. The company that makes the platform has a referral program and yeah Id get a kickback if you ended up using them.

Great culture and exactly what you want from your data team right? Right? I'm dying for business to wake up and realize why we took time to build data warehouse that actually follow the rules. Those \"let's just do x for now\" always bite you in the ass. It seems today's strategy is to limp things along until the business is fed up enough to wait for an entire redesign. Then the tech team and manager are replaced and you don't even fix all the tech debt because the people aware of it left! Tech debt NEEDS to be tracked and talked about regularly. Where I'm at they pushed anyone technical out of those discussions and it's only been band and worse. The consulting team they brought in pointed the finger at the data/tech team, promoted mid level managers with no tech background into those leadership positions (now they have to lean on the consultants for EVERYTHING AND EVERY DECISION! So much wasted money and time but theres no one technical to explain anything, even WHY things are as messy as they are. I saw this happening and tried to get my boss to understand what was happening. Instead he fought her about design differences instead of division of responsibilities. The consultant got 2 years to work with the analysts (who from my outside perspective were much further behind the engineers) while pointing fingers at the engineers/data. He needed to be bringing up all of the things the analysts and the business side need to do to make teams like this successful.",

It’s not in demand for the freshers. But it’s a good earning field though. No one was placed from my university( it’s a good uni btw) for data science cause companies aren’t preferring freshers at all. And we need to be more involved and advance in all kinds of subjects like AI, Deep Learning and all. Mere Machine learning is not all useful these days.

When you're on the cutting edge, there is nothing to fall back on. Everything I could copy was just very basic stuff and I only ever really copied it from myself 1000 lines ago. It is only at this point that code really started to click and docs became incredibly useful. I've since tried and tried teaching students to not use AI but use docs instead and too many of them can't. When we ask them about their code they have no idea, because they didn't write it. While all of them have this idea that they're using AI \"as a tool\" that is \"no different than a calculator\" or \"no different than using stackoverflow\" it is fundamentally different and they don't have the knowledge to realize it. Even more, they will use AI to solve the basic questions, the ones that are DESIGNED TO BE EASY so that they can learn to work with these technologies, and then complain that the later exercises are too hard.

All the information is technically accurate, but you have a dozen questions and clarifications you can ask, meaning a dozen forks into other topics. And each of those generates new questions, and you spend all your time in a frustrating cycle that generates facts but no wisdom until you get discouraged and quit.Imagine trying to learn how to program by reading [the Wikipedia page for Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) and just following all the links to related articles. *\"Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp tradition\". It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.\"* Holy cow, there's five links to click on just there, **none** of them useful for someone who wants to start learning Python.That's from the second section after the intro. How's a beginner supposed to know what parts are important and what aren't? The output from AI is the same.Really, what I've found LLMs to be useful for (coding and otherwise) is \"tip of the tongue\" kind of stuff.

        "body": "LeetCode has a huge bias towards procedural coding. I have done lots of functional programming, and I simply tend to solve problems differently, without mutation. This of course won't fly for many leet code problems, and some platforms don't even allow one to use many functional languages and set hard time requirements for execution time of the solutions. Parallelism and code cleanliness is given no thought. You can write all shit code with single letter variable names mutating shit everywhere, and it will accept your solution more likely than a very clean functional solution, that is trivially parallelizable and would scale (if ever needed).Looking at LC mastery mostly selects for people, who have ground that stuff hard and memorized that stuff (which won't be of too much use on the job for actual real world problems) or people, who think that this kind of procedural mutating way of programming and the typically associated languages are the end all be all, and have limited experience with other things.I much prefer advent of code (AoC) style puzzles, where you can use any language you want, and you just need a number as the solution.I feel like solving AoC puzzles has improved my ability to solve problems the functional way, even, if they at first seem to not lend themselves well to the functional paradigm. I found some pretty neat functional solutions at times. Like for example using bitboards represented by numbers as an underlying data structure and boosting performance of my previously too slow solution by a factor of more than 1000. I had to sometimes write functional versions of well known procedural algorithms. Things like A-star algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm, depth-first-search, breadth-first search. I've had to interpret how they work and how I can replace data structures they rely on with functional versions, and how I represent a graph or create it in a functional way.",

If someone hasn’t fully committed yet, I’d strongly recommend first looking into more structured or targeted approaches, instead of just grinding volume.Personally, I feel a better balance would’ve been spending less time on pure LeetCode and more time building projects — especially ones aligned with my own interests. Whether for job hunting or just learning, those projects tend to compound better and don’t feel like wasted time afterward.LeetCode helped to a point, but for me it had diminishing returns much sooner than I expected.",

I haven't seen a single one that's like \"C++ 101 and nothing else lmao.\"Secondly, you had to pass those classes to be going into your third year. So you passed a C++ class. You certainly had to build basic programs. You were able to follow guidelines, design by the prescribed principles, and received a passing grade. You also took an OOP class and passed it. Now you can't make your own basic programs at home. This does not make sense.Thirdly, you're just figuring this out after 2 years. You paid money to be bullied and ridiculed for 2 years. You didn't go to your counselor or program director to ask if this was normal. You just dealt with the abuse, passed your classes, then immediately forgot what you learned.

        "body": "I can't really relate. I started programming at age nine with BASIC and never stopped. I'm 48 now. The work has become more enjoyable over time - not because of obsession, but because I've gotten better at it and avoided stagnation.The key has been continuous variation. Initially, I learned the essentials: variables, conditionals, loops, and basic control flow. When BASIC felt too restrictive, I moved to Pascal and C++, which introduced new challenges like pointers and object-oriented programming. After a brief period with Perl (which I didn't enjoy), I transitioned into web development with PHP and JavaScript. JS proved interesting because of its prototype-based inheritance model - a completely different approach from classical OOP.The pattern isn't obsession - it's sustained engagement through novelty. Each language shift brought fresh problems to solve and different paradigms to master. I didn't chase the same dopamine hit of early discovery; instead, I built deeper expertise while regularly introducing new complexity. The \"addiction\" you remember might have been beginner's excitement from rapid skill acquisition. That specific feeling doesn't return, but it's replaced by something more durable: the satisfaction of solving increasingly sophisticated problems with accumulated knowledge. You don't need to recapture obsession - you need new challenges that match your current skill level.",

Language is just a tool. Programming is a skill and process you do using the programming language of your choice. People aren't paid to know a specific programming language. They are paid to use that basic knowledge to design and implement non-basic software using programming skills. So start practising those programming skills now.So pick a project. Any project. Design and implement it from start to finish. Then rinse and repeat indefinitely.",

Don't do this.Learn the absolute basics - variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. There are plenty of good YouTube videos for this. If you want a structured course, pick ONE course and finish it in 2 weeks maximum. Then stop consuming content.Immediately start building 5 real projects. A calculator, a todo list, a basic website, a script that automates something annoying on your computer, or a very simple game. Doesn't matter if they're simple as long as you BUILD something. You'll hit walls constantly. Good. That's where real learning happens - when you're furiously googling how to fix YOUR problem in YOUR code. Each project should be slightly harder than the last.Stick to one language until you've built those 5 projects. Jumping between languages early just resets your progress.After those 5 projects, you'll have actual skills. Then you can take advanced courses if needed, but you'll learn much faster because you have context for what problems they're solving.The bottom line: imho, learning programming is 80% about BUILDING, that's where the real learning happens.",

What makes them qualified to do the job is the wisdom and experience they've gathered that helps them figure out the right way. My day job is working around a group of technicians. I've never seen them pull a tool from their tool box that I don't know how to use. When something on their unit is broken their experience tells them what tool they need and why they should start there. I think the same basic concept can be applied to programming professionally. I can write multi threaded code. How do I know when I should write multi-threaded code?Learning to use the tool is different from applying the tool to the trade. One is easy. The other can only be gained through time. A willingness to change, take criticism, and improve plus persistence is the only \"correct\" part that matters to me.",

Go is great, but most Go teams expect you to already understand backend basics like HTTP, databases, concurrency, deployment, and system design. Junior Go roles do exist, but they are noticeably fewer and more competitive than junior Java or general backend roles. Since you already have Java experience through Selenium, learning Java backend first is often the more pragmatic move. You can reuse the language, focus on Spring Boot, REST APIs, databases, and production concepts, and become employable faster. Once you understand backend fundamentals, picking up Go later becomes much easier and much more attractive to employers. Many people successfully transition from Java backend into Go, but far fewer do it the other way around as their first backend job.",

Mid-levels and Seniors are trying to stick to their current place. But even then having sometimes be put on hold (e.g. an unpaid leave) or having be let go, completely. Because there is no job to offer to them. Non-IT companies, our clients, they are also counting their pennies and not allocating that much money into new development = less job for developers. Unemployed mid-levels are more desperate and sometimes targeting Junior roles. And companies are less willing to hire a Senior over a mid-level because that would mean higher salary expectations by the developer.Stick to your current place, if you can.

All of these systems have bugs and some of them require modifications for various reasons, like changing regulations or business conditions.Additionally, there may be companies who want to re-write their systems in something other than Cobol but still need Cobol programmers who understand the existing system in order to do this.",

Everyone feels this way at one time or another, even those who doesn't appear so.2. Also, instead of giving in, to feelings of being an imposter, actively identify and address the weaknesses you've already identified, and do something about them.3. E.g. Note down terms you don't understand and learn/clarify them for yourself. Ask here. Or research on the internet. Or start a conversation with Claude or ChatGPT and say \"I am a programmer and I ran across the concept/term of 'dependency injection' \\[for example\\] the other day. I don't know what this is. Write me a short treatise on this subject including references so I can get up to speed. Include examples and exercises.\" (for example.)4. You also observed you do nothing outside of work. Well, that's a hint/tell: Start doing something outside of work then! (\"Doctor it hurts when I do \\*this\\*\" Doctor: \"Well stop doing it then!.\" You get my drift.)5. For example, start answering questions on a programming site, or try to. Sometimes you'd have to do some research in order to answer. From doing this, you will learn.6. Try sites like: [exercism.com](http://exercism.com), [codingame.com](http://codingame.com), [codewars.com](http://codewars.com), etc7. One final point: AI is no magic bullet. The presence of AI is going to increase the demand for competent engineers that can also be AI whisperers. You can get ahead of the curve by incorporating and learning and developing the art and science of making effective use of AI in your current job context. As time goes on, I expect this skill might be more important that your naked skills, important though they remain too. (You cannot effectively use AI in anger if you cannot properly judge and evaluate an AI's output. So your human intelligence + experience is essential for the effective use of AI.)The software industry is wide and deep, give yourself time. Rome wasn't built in a day. Read Peter Norvig [here](https://norvig.com/21-days.html). I have been in industry for more than 25 years now and not a day goes by that I don't learn something. Make peace with not knowing everything, that is not where your most important skill lies.",

HTB is a bit more \"try harder\" with its labs, while THM is very beginner friendly. Offensive ctfs are typically compromising a machine going from a user/service account > to root/admin account, these could be windows machines, Active Directory machines, Linux servers, web servers, even cloud environments. Great for building the hacker mindset. Defensive ctfs are all about investigation and recreating attackers steps uncovering their moves. Understanding log sources and how to properly investigate an incident. Network security operates more on the defensive side, but I know plenty of security engineers who have a base offensive skill set. You got to remember, almost everything in tech generally is connected to each other. So even your web development project with python is incredibly relevant to web security and bug bounty. Possibilities are endless if security is where you are aiming. Join the Hack the Box community if cyber interests you.",

How? They experimented. They tried. They failed. They tried something different and eventually, they succeeded.Most tutorials don't actually \"teach\". They pre-chew and serve. They don't make the learner do the work and *think*. You won't learn much if the entire code is presented to you. You will only learn if someone *guides* you but you have to do the thinking and work. This distinguishes a top quality *course* from just another *\"how to create X\"* *tutorial*.Once one has the foundation laid, e.g. through some proper *course*, it is time to throw away the training wheels and to start trying, doing things on their own. Use the documentation, use specific targeted articles, blogs, or even tutorials - but not the \"how to create X\" ones, rather some short, narrow, targeted tutorials that only cover some aspect of your project, e.g. if you want to do something with a SQLite database in Python, check for a quick tutorial (there are excellent ones) that teach you exactly that - how to connect to a database, how to create tables, how to query fields, etc.Changing your way how you approach tutorials also can help: When a concept, part is introduced, try to do it on your own first. Do not look at the presented code. Write it yourself. Play around, experiment. Once you have done it and it works or if all else fails, look at the code. Work at *predicting* what the presented code will be.",

Some bugs are fairly trivial to detect and fix, others can take months or years.The important thing is that this does not fully hinge on a given programmers debugging skills. Bugs only become easy to detect and fix when* the programmer is somewhat good at debugging and familiar with the codebase,* the code has been written in a way that facilitates easy debugging,* the infrastructure has been set up in a way that facilitates easy debugging,* the programmer has tools available that facilitate debugging.People can have different preferences for how to go about achieving these things, but they're likely to involve stuff like* [Good error messages](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/error/index.html#common-message-styles)* Observability setups (logging, metrics, tracing)* Access to actual debuggers* Tests (both unit tests and integration tests)* Automated builds and common integration & testing infrastructure (to eliminate the \"it works on my machine\" situations)* Linters / rule engines that prevent certain code from being merged* Static typing and a [reliable type system](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) (there are some people who swear by dynamic typing, but Typescript is gaining ground over Javascript, and it's pretty common now to have type hints and typechecking for Python too, and apparently PHP)* Various code architecting styles, though preferences there _really_ vary, but see e.g. \"make illegal states unrepresentable\" and \"parse, don't validate\"I.e. a lot of the work we do is done to make debugging easier, and avoid bugs reaching production in the first place.But depending on situation and the technology involved some bugs can still be pretty hard to figure out. There's [a talk from CppCon 2017 by Louis Brandy, _Curiously recurring C++ bugs at Facebook_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkgszkPnV8g) that has a lot of examples of stuff that can stump professionals.

If you do less than that, you won't have the group project experience and advanced topic fundamentals to hit the ground running. You'll be competing with offshore code monkeys we can staff during US or EU business hours for under $20/hr loaded cost rate (salary, benefits, support staff, equipment, building, everything). And now, you'll be competing with Claude. May as well wait tables at that point. At 19 years old, the best advice anyone can give you is to go to university and do an engineering or CS program. You don't have to go to MIT or Cambridge or IIT etc. If you have a four year state technical school whose program is well respected and that has a strong internship placement office, that's fine. Hiring managers nearby probably graduated from that program and will recognize the credential. Especially with AI, your goal is to be solid enough to do the job without AI so you can manage AI as though it were a junior developer. I get customer hires and sometimes staff hires that came out of these six month bootcamps and it's tedious. I'm essentially their TA/professor for what they would have learned in their first big sophomore year project practicum to say nothing of the next two years of courses. And they'll be hamstrung because no one's going to ever make them build a simple database server or webserver or memory allocation method and they'll never really understand how that works. Go do the full program and be better.",

What I really lacked was some sort of project to put all that together and the knowledge to break that down into the necessary steps. After all sorts of tutorials on YouTube and Udemy that didn't really have any good projects to walk through, I found a great tutorial from Tim Corey that built an actual app. It was an app that you would use to track a 3v3 basketball tournament for your office. What clicked the most about his approach was going through the planning phase of what the application needed to do. It needs to register players, register teams, and assign players to teams. It needs to keep track of who paid the $10 entry fee for the current tournament, it needs to track the bracket and match ups for the current tournament, etc. The code was done in such a way that it would be platform agnostic, meaning you could build it as a desktop app that saved the data to both a text file and a database or it could run as a web app on your phone and connect to a cloud database or something like that. That's the kind of tutorial I needed, and it sounds like you need more hands on learning with the planning part. I knew the syntax for all the loops, how to create functions and call them later, etc., but I never knew how to sit down with a blank project in the text editor and start building something. That tutorial did a great job showing how to go from an idea of what you want to make to breaking that idea up into smaller steps. It also did a good job of identifying what you needed for the MVP (minimally viable product--the bare minimum features to be a functioning app) vs what were \"nice to haves\" that could be added in future phases. I ended up abandoning the whole C# thing when I got a job as a data analyst several years ago. I've gotten by with just SQL so far, but I'm getting ready to start a peer mentorship with one of the folks on my team to learn python and predictive modeling now that I have a project that would benefit from it. I still use what I learned in terms of planning for my projects now: what are the essentials the customer needs now, and what can wait until phase 2 or phase 3.",

As you say, you need to know the fundamentals of programming, but you'll acquire them during development. If you don't start at some point, you'll feel like you're in an endless learning loop: you learn the basics but never apply them to the real world. Obviously, depending on the complexity of the website, you'll need more or less knowledge, and you have to be sure that the resources and skills you possess are sufficient to reach the goal. But this part relies primarily on research and patience.Basically, what I would do if I wanted to prepare to create a project is to create a sketch. It could be a diagram, a text document, or both. I write a brief outline of the idea I have in mind, then a list of the workflow, resources, and basic knowledge I need.Once I have this, I start working on gathering resources and coding. The first thing I do in a web application is the design. I establish the typography, icons, brand colors, and that sort of thing. Functionality is what I do after I have all of that in place.Keep in mind that you can never know for sure what your project needs at the beginning. You should try to prepare to start as soon as possible; don't waste time or energy trying to have everything under control from the start, because it's pointless. You'll learn to program by programming.Establish a work plan by setting short- and medium-term goals and adjust them as you go. If something blocks you, move on to something else, and at some point, you'll find what you need to unblock what you were creating.",

Maybe you want the data sent to your email or to the cloud or stored in a Db, so maybe you need to learn Azure or SQL, but that'll get your brain thinking about a real, functional projectFor a blog, you need to get user data to print/post to the screen, but again, do you want to be able to store/archive data, if so, what tools will you use to make that happen.You can make a calculator look real with html and css, but how about accepting user input (when they push buttons) and the calculations behind the scenes to do the math and then display it.The best thing you can do to learn is to break down these projects to figure out what parts will be HTML and CSS, but knowing what else you'll need to make it functional.Check youtube for beginner html css javascript projects.",

See [Locality of Behaviour](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/)> how to keep things readable without over-engineeringYou need to set the encapsulation boundaries the right way. If your compile time hierarchy of encapsulation matches the domain model, you will have a hard time managing all the different interactions and variations. An example for that would be an inheritance hierarchy where each class implements its own behaviour (Vehicle -> Car -> Truck / Bus; Vehicle -> Train -> ...; Vehicle -> Bycicle -> ElektroBike; Vehicle -> ??? -> MotorBike; ...)Instead, start with separating your data from your logic and keep your data in simple arrays. E.g. a List of Orders, a List of Products, a List of Deliveries, A List of Customer Account. This can be an exact match to how you design your database btw.. Also, have only 1 ID across **all** types of Entities. This will allow you to combine the Components at Runtime easily.Then write functions (not methods) that operate on those lists. One function may check whether your are going to be out of stock for any product and create a new order for your supplier. Another function may go over the recent orders by your customers and create an aggregated report of what has been ordered and how much. And so on.Think about your logic as systems or laws of nature. Similar to how gravity affects the trajectory of a ball thrown up, instead of the ball gravitating itself back to earth.You will see that a lot of stuff that is challenging right now will become trivial.Good luck!",

I’m not sure what kind of abstraction you’re working with, but I always found that advice to be very actionable and easy to relate to.—You have to start somewhere.For any beginner task, keep things as clear, simple, and easy to understand as possible.The code you write will almost certainly not be optimal and that’s just fine. When you’re starting on a project, you need code that you can bring other people in on. You need to be able to talk about it, debug it, and write tests for it.Build time into your long-term plans for refactoring. There will come a time when the original code isn’t meeting your project’s needs anymore. - you’ll need to be able to read it and understand it to make it better and solve whatever problem you’re experiencing in the future.",

You can practice and learn without wanting to die, this doesnt have to always seems like homework.

Of course there's still studying/learning to be done, but the projects give you \"small wins\" that feel satisfying to achieve, as a result of learning.. at least to me thats how it is. When I first started programming i wasnt doing it to get a job or anything, so i didnt care about \"learning programming\", i just learned the bare minimum i needed to build what I wanted to build. Looking back, lot of what I made were built horribly with bad practices (I didnt take the time to learn \"good practices\"), but thats fine because I still learned a lot from them and they didnt need to be perfect.",

Moving the window one step only changes a single data point. To make the list sorted again you only need to move this specific point to the correct place. Going a bit further into potential optimizations you can also notice that if the point that's dropping out of the window (`op`) and the point that enters the window (`np`) are both larger or smaller than the current median, the median won't change and you can just replace `op` with `np` without resorting the list. Another observation is that if `op` and `np` are on different sides of the median, you don't actually have to resort everything to rebalance both sides because the balance can be easily restored by moving one element to the correct side:* `op` < median < `np`: move the smallest element to the right the median to the left of the median; this element is now also the largest element of the left. The new median lies between this element and the new smallest element on the right side.* `op` > median > `np`: Find the biggest element on the left side and move it to the right; it's now the smallest element on the right.By using those observations and moving from fully sorting the window to simply partitioning it you should be able to make updating it much cheaper because you no longer have to shift all elements between `op` and `np` to either the left of the right.",

With this you write your code once and can \"deploy\" it on iOS, Android and as a web app.Edit: it's only worth to learn Kotlin and Android development if you need high performance and deep hardware access AFAIK - please correct me if I'm wrong",

There are a LOT of shortcuts. There are a TON of Unity assets you can buy, or for RPGMaker (bajillion versions) if you want to make stuff that way. There's GameMaker, ClickTeam, GameToolkit, etc. If you know Python, there's Ren'Py for visual novels or PyGame if you want more coding. In fact, there are TONS of engines out there for almost every genre on Github or such. And there's of course, Unreal, Godot, and other 3D engines besides Unity. And you can always study classic game sourcecode as many of them have been released (Wolf3D, original Doom, etc.) if you want to learn how those work (may not apply very much to today's gamedev, but everyone starts somewhere). You can stick to making mods in the short term. The company who made Terra Invicta started as XCOM2 Mod Maker (mod was called \"Long War\"). Valve even bought a couple Half-life mods and published them back in the days. So, what are you interested in? Pick something.",

Eventually you will want to start working with a game engine like Unity or Godot but if you try this too early it will just be overwhelming, so just work on coding first.

Get some old, cheap, machines Tear them apart, put them back together, learn the ports and what they're called.

Using a concept effectively and explaining it out loud are different skills—interviews test recall, structure, and communication under pressure, not just competence.

The fix isn’t relearning fundamentals, but practicing articulation: explaining concepts in your own words, at different levels of depth, and maybe teaching them to someone else. If you can apply it correctly, your understanding is there—you just need reps turning that understanding into clear explanations.",

I eventually figured out that as a js developer, he was not familiar with strong typing or even class type definitions. Of course JS6 and TS in particular support those, but JS does a lot with anonymous functions and weakly typed, ad-hoc key value pair objects as a programming norm. Memory management is also completely under the hood and so the whole idea of a pointer or reference type was new as well.Where I'm going with this is, the basics translate, but I still maintain that C/C++ is great first language followed by an OO-first language like Java, Python, or C# because it makes you internalize these concepts and gets you ready to write scalable, non-browser code. I don't prefer JS as a first language because it's hard syntactically to keep track of exactly what each construct is and the patterns, while syntactically concise, can easily be confusing on those points.JS is great; learn something else too. At least get to a point where you understand the difference between a function that's a method, a class template, or an instance of a class, understand variable typing, and understand why you might want strongly typed code and by extension what the typescript project was going for and why it was widely adopted by large js code bases.",

So we need to break that problem down.When the program isn't doing what you expect, put a 'print (whatever\\_variable)' followed by an 'exit' and run the program again. See what the variable looks like at that point. If it is what you expect it to be, then move the 'debug' statements down one line and see if the program is doing what you expect on the next line. At what point the program's output diverges from what you think it should be doing, that is the point that is worth studying closer.Then just consider that little piece of program code and look up syntax and research what the command does until you understand it, and fix the issue, and move on to the next line.Work it out like that. You need to understand how the 'wires' connect together, so to speak, before you get to the real fun part, of connecting bigger components together like graphics and saving files and using networking and such. Just take it slow and give yourself some patience to look at the small problems.It's like math class. There is a reason that math classes spend awhile on the fundamentals. Once you got the fundamentals down, the rest will flow much more naturally.",

Try to find alternative solutions and play around with the code (it may not be \"better\", just something you have created), compare the alternatives (ie what constructions feel more natural to you and why, what works and what doesn't work, what pros and cons do you find with the different solutions).You may add some new features or change the requirements (ie adding some additional properties, only allow upper case letters, only allow some letters, add sorting,....), break the code and try fix the next day.You may also end a programming session with a short reflection of what you have accomplished (you may keep a dev diary of your progress) and start each session with a short recap of what you did last time (just to refresh your memory before you start).",

What follows is what I try to practice, but I'm sure others have had more experience...You can pass by reference, that typically indicates the callee doesn't own the object and must assume it exists whilst and only until the function returns (or if passed to a constructor, whilst the exists). It places restrictions on the object which can be used to ensure you don't do things you shouldn't with it, and can be used to refer to automatically allocated objects.You can pass a unique_ptr, the implication being that ownership is handed to the callee. Or const unique_ptr, meaning the callee can use and modify the object, but not move ownership to something else.You can pass by shared_ptr, ownership is shared and lifetime managed by the pointer. I rarely used these. There are also weak_ptrs but I've not yet had to use them.Sometimes it's perfectly valid to just pass a copy too.I try to avoid using raw pointers in c++ unless forced to, e.g. using a posix or third party C API, and if given one, I'll try and wrap them in a unique_ptr with custom deleter where and as soon as possible, so I don't forget to clean them up. But you can imply similar semantics with the constness of the raw pointer, you're just relying on other developers more than the compiler.Experts please feel free to correct me here.",

A lot of the “name vibe” you want can come from rules, phoneme patterns, and weighted randomness, and you will learn faster by building a baseline you can compare against.If you do want ML, the roadmap I would follow is: get comfortable in Python first, then learn how to prep text data, then try a simple character-level model that generates outputs conditioned on your input root. Start small with a dataset where you have pairs like (root, modern name) and ignore multi-step history at first. Once that works, you can add intermediate forms as extra training examples or as a multi-stage pipeline.The hardest part will be the dataset, not the model. Etymology data is messy and sparse, and “multiple steps through history” is basically asking for aligned sequences across languages and time. I would prototype with whatever clean pairs you can get, then iterate. If you can make a dumb version that produces plausible names, you will be 90 percent of the way there.",

Yes, one can graduate with the lowest passing grades and one can graduate cum laude, and there is a difference between a degree holder and a degree holder, but even these lowest passing grades usually show that the person at least is introduced to a number of topics relevant to the field and has passed these courses.Also, during your degree studies you will get connections from your course mates, from your professors, perhaps from the computer club you are joining, etc. Everybody of them can later on help you with finding a job. I got recommended to my first workplace by my course mate. Which connections you'll be using when studying on your own?Yes, universities/colleges differ. I have seen people telling how they learnt nothing really during their studies. I have read how in India the studies are mostly theoretical and people are unable to produce a code that compiles. But where I live, the studies were very practice heavy. We actually learnt stuff relevant for the field. We built thesis projects that were taken into an actual use by people. So, universities differ.But, assuming you will get lucky with your university then that is any times better than trying to study on your own. When you are studying on your own your picks on what to study and what not to study, these picks are subjective not objective. You do not know what you do not know. You learn what interests you and you leave what seems boring. Yet in a university professors teach you what you have to know. Even when you think it is irrelevant, too difficult, or boring.Yes, a degree alone will not get you hired. Your knowledge, skills, experience you gained during your studies, your projects you built, that gets you hired. But that is what usually comes when doing degree studies.Going back to what I told about hiring then having a degree will make you have much better chances in being called to the interview. Without a degree the HR person can just skip your application. And, from your post it is clear you do not have a clear idea about which projects to build. That does not compete with people who build hobby projects and that using these when it's done.So, if possible, go for a degree.",

This is based on your resume versus the job requirements for the job you're applying for. Without a degree and without experience in lieu of a degree, I imagine all recruiting companies will auto-trash your resume.Yes, I would highly recommend a degree. Speak with a counselor at a school you're interested in, just to find out your options, various programs, degrees. There may be faster/better ways of getting through Software Engineering curriculum than going the Computer Science route. I'm sure lots changed since I was in college.",

You may be in for a pleasant surprise.The beginner stuff is usually not that big of a deal and does not require you to have the latest and greatest hardware. And even if you get to a point where you need more processing power, you can find cloud-based solutions so you don't have to buy a new system. Worry about hardware restrictions when you encounter them, then you also will know what to look for in a solution.Again, my main advice is to just start with what you have. Edit: Typo.",

If you change one of those files (a .css file in your case) and save it, it just gets saved to the drive. Web site files get read by browsers, and the browsers do whatever the files say: show some text and images and apply css rules to make them look the way you want.But the browser doesn't fetch the web site files you just saved **unless you tell it to.** After you change your .css file, try **holding the shift key and pressing the refresh button** in Edge. It's the little circle at the upper left of the Edge window. That tells Edge to reload the HTML file it's showing and all the linked images, .css files, .js files, and other objects.Or **hold the Shift key and press F5**. That does the same thing. It's what I do.There are software solutions to make Edge (or other browsers) automatically refresh themselves when a file changes. But, with respect I suggest you do not use such a solution until you thoroughly understand how the browser works in this business of needing to re-fetch files you have changed on your drive.

        "body": "TLDR: The reality is most starting out heavily lack basic DSA or basic language functionality like stacks, heaps, and virtual space. There are countless things to learn but overall I recommend advancing in DSA and don't feel rushed to know everything. Take your time deeply understanding the simple stuff. Ask questions where things are assumed and seem obvious. If you can really feel what's going on it will stick better. If you're going to Leetcode try to stay in a particular topic for a while and avoid spreading your learning too thin across many different challenges back to back.I was in and out of university for a while and in between completed Coding Dojo Full Stack Development (don't recommend), made a bunch of projects and eventually a successful app on iOS and Android. You might already know many of these topics but this is what I find useful.What I learned is that anything.js (edit I mean most .js solutions, not literally a project called anything.js lol) React, Angular, etc. these full stack web frameworks are constantly changing and new trendy APIs are always coming. Many new APIs are made when someone has some slight problem with the existing options. The right way to use them imo is to know the good general fundamentals like CRUD, validations, DB servers and back end controllers for them, MVC structures, dynamic pages and templates and when you come across some new API you must use that's the only time to get into the specifics and spend time on it - when you need to.Leetcode is good with the right mindset. You can spend too much time on topics that don't improve your skills that much or focusing on the difficulty more than what you're actually learning. Every programmer should strive to be solid in DSA. Focus on things like arrays, binary trees, string modification and linked lists. Take your time to know the little things well. Ask AI for small learning project ideas and when you don't know something syntax or language specific don't ask AI but check the documentation because there you will be surprised at when else you come across or multiple examples of using a function. Try to solve the Skyline problem. The skill level rating shouldn't get in the way of what you want to learn. If knowing how to solve that problem advances you then just take your time on it and try to have solid knowledge in the small steps. If you learn how every little part of a single problem takes all day when you could've done a bunch of random ones to feel more comfortable in the language, it's fine because the former will stick with you.Maybe do a simple learning project in hash maps, or make a multi multi level index database with JSON files and JS and see how you can optimize it. Take a JSON file with test data and make a function that splits it to 3 files where the first is an index, and the next two is part A and B. See how you can modify the function to take number of files/splits and how to split them. For learning I try to keep my attention in the same realm for a while so don't jump around too much or do a project that spreads your attention thin.Those skills will follow you everywhere you go but a new JS API probably won't help you with much else.Know the topics that are needed but programmers starting out struggle with or are frequently missed either by curriculum or not needing it in a specific language:\\- What is a stack and heap?\\- What is a virtualized address?\\- Asymmetric vs symmetric encryption, passkey generation, basic structure of encrypting and decrypting data and how to ensure you're doing it safely.\\- When to use structured SQL data or NoSQL. What are the pros and cons? You can use both in an app so what do you want strict and what should be flexible?\\- Allocation for data types.Relating to networking I don't know what fundamental work is needed I haven't dealt with that much yet, but less low level topics are solutions that reduce data redundancy, but also latency which can fight redundancy, and the size of transfers all while keeping security which can also fight latency for users. We are producing and sharing data in a rapidly growing rate as the corporate world wants everything cloud based and as AI does what it do. Any little changes to make an app function just as fast and secure but with less data being transferred or stored is very valuable. AI companies will be considering things like Azure Cosmos DB or something equivalent/better. I won't comment much on AI I don't know where that is going.",

        "body": "Your `move_cursor` function is wrong. `\\033[%d;%d` by itself doesn't mean anything. It needs to be followed by a character that indicates which operation to do.For instance, `\\033[1;4H` moves the cursor to row 1 and column 4, but `\\033[1;4m` sets formatting modes 1 and 4 (bold and underline).Since you're only specifying the parameters and not the operation, whichever character comes next will be interpreted as part of the same escape sequence, and the terminal will try to perform that operation.So if you enter a string that begins with the letter `H` then it will be centered except for the missing first letter. If you enter a string beginning with anything else, all bets are off. The behavior depends on what letter it starts with and how your particular terminal emulator handles invalid escape sequences.See here for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Control_Sequence_Introducer_commands",

(And, if you join a pre-existing project, that you stay consistent with their conventions.)Personally, I also prefer defining my functions from the top-down -- I work best when I can start by understanding the high-level structure/model before filling in the details. But other people work differently: they like to start by understanding the basic building blocks, then seeing how they're combined.For larger projects, there's an argument to be made that it's best to have all of your helper functions living in separate files, with the main function living just by itself in a single top-level file. This does sidestep (or at least defer) the problem a little.> The first multi line script i did upon running, made it difficult to refer to a variable in the top level function.This seems unrelated to the order in which you define your functions. Maybe we can give more advice here if you give an example or describe the scenario in more detail.",

You already have the beginning and size, and here you're decrementing that in addition to incrementing the pointer. Offsetting into an array vs moving a pointer into it is a very old debate that I'm not convinced was ever *particularly* important as long as memory access happens the same (e.g. moving linearly through memory despite multidimensional subscripting, same as pinter increment).",

My code creates two variables - one an unnamed temporary, but it's entirely reasonable that they would be register values and never even see L1 cache.I'd look at the results in Compiler Explorer; if one is better, stick with that. If the two are equal, I'd error on the side of convention. Your loop takes a lot of thinking to figure out, and that's not good. Even the comment is a mile long, which is also a code smell. Novel solutions are good - clever solutions are bad. You have to be clever to write a clever solution, and you have to be MORE clever to debug a clever solution. That is to say, you are not clever enough to debug your own clever solutions. None of us are good for it.Your comment suggests an error. To read past the bounds of an array is Undefined Behavior. Even for a multi-dimensional array that is guaranteed to be contiguous, an array is a higher order type than raw machine memory, with semantics that are enforced by the COMPILER, not the machine. You violate bounds and aliasing rules, which the compiler doesn't check for you - because it correctly ASSUMES you're writing well defined behavior and you wouldn't intentionally violate the language rules you're personally responsible for. The compiler is going to optimize assuming correct code, and access past the bounds can blow up in your face in interesting ways.UB is no joke, it's how Zelda and Pokemon are famous for bricking the Nintendo DS when glitch-hacking. The ARM5 CPU has a circuit level design flaw that burns out when accessing an invalid bitfield pattern. You brick the device.",

It's often used, mist notably in K&R.This construct isn't what I'd call *good*, though.* Others are pointing out that the loop condition doesn't need to reference A because it's superfluous in a mathematical sense. It also asks for an unnecessary addition on every loop iteration. The compiler will probably optimize that out, but textually you're expressing something different from what you actually mean. Your loop should EITHER go until the pointer reaches some limiting address value, OR until some count is reached. For what you're doing, choose the count by comparing N to zero.* The variable names are unhelpful. What is N? By convention it looks like the array size, but it only means that at the start of the loop. It's actually the number of items remaining to be visited. And what is A? It's not the address of an array A, it's the address of an element of that array.* The empty initialization of the for loop means you're expressly designing this code to leave artifacts available for the rest of the block. Sometimes that's useful, but not here. Those artifacts are A, pointing just past the last element of the array, and N, which will by definition be zero. Neither has any useful meaning, so it would be better to make them local to the For loop.",

The desktop framwork landscape is very fragmented and with lots of opionated ways of doing things. The simple answer to this is Electron if all you care about is cross platform and declarative UI (would be using React). It is the most widespread, easy to get into (you're just writing JavaScript), and lots of support. The biggest downside is usually the RAM usage and then for some it will also be the requirement to write the whole app (even the non-UI parts) in JavaScript. Going deeper you could look into Tauri to circument these. In the bigger UI frameworks landscape it sounds like you might want to look at React Native if you want the more declarative approach. With not wanting XML or imperative way of specifying the UI, then things like Swing and JavaFX would be off the table.",

Yes, it is possible to use AI plugins and such, but by default the thing that we understand as an \"AI\" is not turned on. Yes, the IDE tells if you have syntax errors and code smell (bad coding practices) and is context aware in terms of indexing existing code and libraries but besides that it does not behave like a ChatGPT or such.Yes, you might have to figure it out how to use WebStorm (or any other Jetbrains tool) on your own as in the course they might tell how to do the exercises in Visual Studio Code, but other than difference between tools, the coding part is still the same.And I do recommend to switch over to Linux. As a beginner there is not much difference between Windows and Linux, but on a more advanced level Linux is more user-friendly for software developers. In Windows you have to get stuff working with WSL and not always it works. In Linux things work out of the box.",

The image is loading 2a. The correct image has been loaded 2b. The correct image couldn't be loaded 3. The image - correct or error - is displayingI would add boolean useStates for if it is currently loading, if it has completed, and if an error has occured - and then props for both the requested source, and an optional error-image, which the caller doesn't have to supply, if the component should just show a default error image.And I would add a \"loader-animation\" for when the image is currently loading - which might end up in an error, or the right image.That way the enclosing component, the SearchResult doesn't have to know anything about the problems loading images, and what happens inside the other component - because as it can't really do anything about it, it shouldn't have to know!",

What helps me is to think about one thing at a time. Thinking about \"mindset\" is too vague. I keep things practical and tangible. Here's how I think through projects:# My Project Planning Process1. **I figure out who the project is for.** Who's going to use it? Even if it's just me.2. **I figure out what the user wants or needs to do.** I write statements like \"As a User, I can do \\_\\_\\_ so that \\_\\_\\_.\" Basically I'm figuring out what the user wants to do and why.3. **From there I usually start getting ideas for pages and what will be on the page.** I write them down. I draw some rough sketches. I mean actually write with pen and paper. You don't have to but I find that stepping away from screens for this preliminary planning helps me think better.4. **I like to take those sketches and bring them to full mockups.** I don't know that it's necessary, but it helps me to not have to think about styling and layout when I'm writing code. You could also use AI tools to make these mockups.5. **Then I get to building the project.** I try to follow TDD (Test Driven Development) and scaffold things out. I try to procrastinate the implementation details as much as possible. That way I can answer those questions about how to structure the project and everything one at a time",

Once it works, replace one hardcoded piece at a time with the real component, like real input, real storage, real validation.

You had fast access and slow access memory.One example was drum memory. At the most basic, there is a [write][erase][read] head over a spinning magnetic drum track. You had to wait for your data to sweep under the read head to get it - however long that took. This was a destructive process, because then the head passed under a magnet. This data was either written a moment later at the read head, or a write was scheduled to intercede the passive loop.They then put a smaller, faster access loop over just a few degrees of the track, and had a larger, slower loop for the rest of the track, and this would take a couple sets of heads to pull off.But this tech got faster still, and this is the one you can mimic - they used coils of wire, and sent modulated signals down it. Again with the feedback loop - if you wanted a piece of data, you had to wait for it to come around. If you wanted to persist that data, you had to immediately write it back on the wire. If you wanted to change it, you had to intercede the passive loop. You could add more storage with a longer wire, you could get lower latency with a shorter wire.So that's what you can do - send data to an echo server, one on the furthest computer on the opposite, most remote destination to you on Earth or as ambitious as the DSN, and the data is stored ostensibly in the transmission itself. Want some data? You'll have to wait for that data to get back to you. Want to persist it? You'll have to send it back out. Want to change it? You get your chance as it's coming back to you and it's time to send again.Call it a time sequence data cache.---If that doesn't quite fit the bill, then google \"fountain codes\", and implement your own bit-torrent-like protocol.",

        "body": "In addition to what others have said, you need to realize that coding as a \"class\" and hobby by the nature of how it works forces every new concept and lesson to be cumulative even if your school isnt testing you that wayWhat I mean, is that during week one you learn variables and data types and have a test on those. Week 2 you may learn how functions work and be you'll be tested on functions AND variables and data types even if its not on the test because you'll be writing functions with variables in them. So when Week 20 rolls around, you are expected to have a baseline of everything that came before it because those concepts are used to do other things. It may sound stressful, but if you're struggling with new information and not knowing how to start, then like a lot of beginners you likely lack that foundation of skills. Its easy to learn something new, but if youre also only kinda comfortable with the concepts youve learned so far, you arent learning just a new thing. Youre learning a new thing AND still learning the concepts your class has moved past. You likely need practice, repetition is how experienced programmers can type code out quickly. When I need a loop, I dont think about the syntax at all, Ive just typed out a million of them incorrectly and it's muscle memory. So for me, if Im being taught something that assumes I need a loop, I wont be spending any mental energy on the syntax of a loop or any other concept, my entire brain is focused on the new concept. Coding is hard for new programmers, but if you feel you're getting overwhelmed, id implore you to consider looking backwards and not forwards, because you may not be hitting a wall due to the new concepts being tough, but rather because you're attempting to learn the new concepts while the old concepts are still being mastered. And if you feel thats the case, build things, use those things and repeat them over and over again until they're muscle memory. You're a CS student, so it probably irks you when you see people typing with their pointer finger. But if you think back, you probably were annoyed learning to properly touch type and keep your hands in the correct position. But now you dont even think twice about typing, your brain thinks of a word and your hands do the motion required. The same process happens with coding, you just dont have years of experience like you have with typing.",

Then, he slowly started alienating me. My whole team was literally having meetings without me. I remember thinking at the time that I had struck gold; a high paying job and not doing anything. Occasionally, I was giving the actual garbage no one wanted to do: fix bugs (just a few) and write unit tests. Eventually, they laid me off.My advice to you is to start interviewing asap like you are unemployed, because you will be. It's not a matter of if, but when.",

You probably would need to clarify more, as this sounds like it might not be the kinda situation most people here are familiar with. An environment with stricter regulations on changes may explain some of what you're experiencing, but will also make a lot of feedback you'd receive invalid.But really, this is much more of a conversation for your manager. Your manager should be connecting you with projects as well as backlog work for when bigger projects are stalled. My experience is that there's usually massive backlogs of work to be done, so the idea of there being nothing to do is pretty wild to me. And I've been the sole remote worker from a team of in-person folks before. Being in a different location does change things a little, but it shouldn't make you a ghost. There should still be tons of interactions with your team, such as by dialing into standups, team Slack, code reviews, etc. But I'm coming from the position of a perhaps more typical office job and this sounds like it's something different.",

If I were a barista, I’d still be writing code in my free time.That said, I really hate the direction this industry is going. Everyone keeps saying you have to post on LinkedIn, you have to network, you have to build a personal brand. I don’t like talking to people outside of work and family, and the amount of bootlicking and fake enthusiasm you’re expected to show just to impress corporate types and land a job feels insane.Most of the cracked engineers I’ve worked with or know don’t do any of that. They’re loyal at their jobs, keep their heads down, and just want to do deep, meaningful technical work. On the flip side, a lot of the fake people I’ve seen spend more time crafting LinkedIn posts than actually improving their skills or doing real engineering work, and they all seem to have some hidden agenda.I literally saw a dude interview for big tech just so he could create content and attract more juniors to pay for his coaching side hustle. Stuff like that just feels gross. Please, for the love of god, someone take this fake influencer-style job search nonsense out of our field.",

Do you even remember anything you studied? Have you been coding on the side all this time? Have you even cared about programming in 2019 in the first place?I know this sounds harsh, but the first step into a positive change is to acknowledge the reasons behind the failures. So no, it's not because of AI or the market.It's time for some self reflection. Also, drop your resume and share with us about your programming skills and what you've been doing so far.Good luck!",

The pay will be shit, but most likely better than your current job. You can do your time, grind, and then stand on your own. It comes with its own risks. Some people go through the training, never get a job, and get laid off. So this isn’t full proof and you would have to make that calculation yourself.

If you really want, have a another dev take a look at the code and let them come with you to say the same thing so that they can see that it's not just you.",

My exec has some self awareness, and know what they have built proves a concept but should not go near production.Ignore most of the advice here: do NOT go to the exec and tell them how bad what they have built is. It is true, but that's not the point. They have to learn this, they cannot be told this. They have contempt for software developers and the craft of software development. Ignore the glazing; if you tell them what they have built is a turd they will show their contempt of you. These guys are in full Dunning Kruger world now, and they have proven to their satisfaction that software development is fast and easy.They now trust AI over human experts. This is something you have to go with and accept; but you can influence it. Try to influence them towards getting an LLM to review the system they have built. Help them with some prompts; I'd suggest getting ratings across a whole load of dimensions, with a score out of 10, an exec summary, and then a final overarching recommendation. Stuff like \"You are an expert software architect with 10 years of software architecture experience backed by 10 years as a software developer building large systems. Critically review this application for adherence to best practice architectural and computer science principles....\" blah blah. Assess on SOLID, DRY, coupling, thread safe, self healing, HA, type safety etc. Then do the same for security. Then maintainability. Ask it to describe what what the software does, and how well that aligns with the specification document (which I expect does not exist, or is a couple of sentences). Etc. etc.. Get their beloved AI, which built the system, tell them how diabolical it is. You cannot tell them this. They have to learn it themselves, and they trust what AI tells them.If that success, then craft a prompt to get it to agree with what likely you want to get to. For example: You want an output along the lines of \"this application proves a concept; that the functional requirements can be met. But this is not fit for production and is irrecoverable. It needs to be started again, by software engineers, who can guide the AI on tech stack, architecture, security, maintainability etc etc\". Get agreement to build a team which will largely vibe code, but will be composed of experts. Maybe then point them to resources which illustrate how AI is a software developer tool, not a replacement. Like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1oo6dae/claude_is_a_beast_tips_from_6_months_of_hardcore/) (there's loads out there, likely you know many). You want to move them towards the view that the process has to be in the hands of software developers, but that AI will be writing the code.TLDR: you can't persuade them this is terrible, and you can't move them from AI first development, but you could try to shape it to something workable.Oh, and look out for a new job too anyway. Don't commit to only one path.Here's a lot of assumptions I have which underpin my thinking:The exec does not have career experience of actually building software. There is no CTO / VP of Development with solid Engineering skills, or they are not respected within the exec and have little sway. The exec has a long history of asking why software takes so long to build, makes unreasonable demands, does not provide clear vision and tangible objectives. They have a disdain for software engineers and have long been suspicious of them but have never had the tools to contradict them.",

YOLO (you only live once) is a saying for a reason. Assuming you are young then you have 20-30 more years of work ahead of you unless you want to retire super early. Money isn't going anywhere.",

        "body": "Listen, I'm sorry you got a bad internship manager.No, it's not usually that bad. Some intern managers are great, some are just mediocre, but this is unusually bad.That said, this is an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation, so here's my advice:First, do the work you're assigned, no matter how stupid or boring it sounds. Finish copying the data to Excel, email it to your manager and ask for more.If you get more, do it as professionally as you possibly can, even if it seems boring and stupid. Part of the experience of working at a company is that sometimes you have to do boring, stupid work. Doing it well is necessary for success.However, for the rest of your time, you should have two goals:1. Make yourself useful2. Learn as much as you canYou're in an amazing position right now. You have access to a whole company full of professionals, and almost no responsibilities.This is a fantastic opportunity, if you want to take advantage of it.Who cares what department you're in? Start meeting people in different departments. Tell them you're an intern on the Data Analytics team but you're not very busy and you'd like to help.It won't be hard to find someone who has some work for you.I don't recommend keeping it a secret! Tell your manager you did all of your Excel work, and that you met someone in another department who gave you a task. I highly doubt your manager will care.And of course, your goal is to learn something. Find people who are actually good at their jobs (unlike your manager) and are interested in teaching you how they do them.Having your manager give you a good review at the end of your internship is nice, but it isn't the only good outcome. Any other employee who ends up impressed with you at the end of the internship could end up being a great resource. When you apply to future jobs and give a reference, you don't have to give your manager - give some other senior employee who liked you. And make contacts with as many people as you can, and when you're graduating, contact all of them to ask for referrals.",

        "body": "I would say it’s about 50-50. Take a look at the comments, you’re gonna see some people saying it’s unusual… And then some people saying it’s normal.At the end of the day, I feel like it’s 50-50, and beyond that the real question is… What are you gonna do about it?If you don’t feel like you have work… The answer is the same. Ask somebody to give you something to do. But here’s the thing… The best thing you could possibly do is make the best of the opportunity you have. As long as you do that, you’ll leave on positive terms and be able to ask for letters of recommendation in the future. That’s your end goal.So here are some ideas… Ask someone what is the most important codebase for you to investigate? What are some fundamental principles that you can look up, if you’re interested doing that person’s job? What is a problem that the company currently has that could provide value for the company if it was solved?Be sure to let people know that they can answer this in a very high-level, simple way if they don’t have a lot of time. Let them know that you’re not trying to interfere with their daily work… But more so, you’re trying to find some things to dig into and research independently. After a while if you’re at a good internship position, they’re going to give you some more useful work… but if you’re at a bad place, this is going to be all you get. Either way, though, if you take this approach, everyone will know that you tried, and you would have documented evidence that you asked C questions and got Y answers. Document everything (your questions, the answers, and the research/work you did), and write up report from your internship. Save it somewhere. Memorize a 30 second breakdown of what you did. If you do this, it won’t matter if you have three bad internships. You will seem more prepared, and experienced, than 90% of all candidates for other jobs. The real skill to legitimately learn and to genuinely get jobs is to:1. Do your best, genuinely.2. Document what you did, at every place on your résumé.3. Create a logical and truthful story about what you learned..4. Always learn, at every position, even if you’re learning about what not to do (pay special attention to proactively investigating how you can provide value… and managing yourself in a way that provides value to the company).You can do all of this systematically no matter what anyone else does. You don’t have to be a genius, and you don’t have to become a rockstar. All you have to do is to provide documentation that you work hard and are willing to reasonably spend your paid time, focusing on providing value for the people that pay you (if at all possible).The worst thing you should say about the company is, “Even though I had very little guidance, I was able to spend company time improving documentation [something you were told was important] and learning about [something you proactively researched]”You should always be looking for how this internship can provide value for you. If someone helps you provide value for the company, great! But if no one is giving you work to do, make sure you get what you need from that opportunity. This could impact how much money you make (10k-20k+ a year)… or it could impact if you get a good entry-level position.I purposely did not respond in a way that had anything to do with, how to make the company act differently. Because this is something you cannot control… You should focus on how you can behave in a way that would set you up for success no matter how the company behaves. You want to optimize for the best future for yourself.",

My second internship, I did absolutely nothing. I showed up to the office, had a desk, no work. I just asked the engineer for a schematic of their network and system infra, and essentially memorized it. I’d bring questions as to what this does and why. And basically taught myself network and system design. Point is be curious and teach yourself. Take initiative. Shadow an engineer and just be like Im going to sit here and watch what you do.Most internships arent glorious like FAANG. I know some internships go hard and some dont.

Whoever this manager guy is threw you under the bus and is acting like a child lol. Do not view this guy as your friend, he is not that at all.>they both seemed genuinely sad but idk I expected my manager to say more knowing he knew but he was just tucked away quiet.He threw you under the bus lol. He is acting guilty because he knows he is in the wrong.>Its just the stage were in and if this project were to ever pick back up we would love to you have you back.If they ever call you to work for them again, make sure you just join as a contractor as a side gig and upcharge them way more than what you were paid before.

If you don’t have to money to relocate you can always take a small loan as long as you have a job lined up and know you’ll be able to pay it back. That is what I did. Also you don’t mention if you have any internships on your resume. If not I’d suggest applying for some. While they are uncommon for new grads, I have definitely seen people do it.

It was fun but I sucked so bad that they laid me off 5 months in! From July 2024 until October 2025 I worked my butt off teaching myself how to code. I worked a few small contracts, contributed to open source, and made a ton of friends in tech by going to local meetups and occasional conferences (got in for free either through volunteering or finding people who were giving away tickets). This past October I landed an offer and have been working as a full time SWE.The market absolutely sucks and it took me over a year just to find a role but the main thing I did was stay in community to help encourage me when I felt like throwing in the towel.

I see people telling you tot need to apply to 1000-1500 jobs. That’s not quite accurate. There’s some randomness to it all. The more you apply, the more you have a chance for finding something that aligns with you. But it’s not a guarantee, and some people luck out and find something sooner. - People are really bad with perspective. There’s nothing wrong with what you wrote about yourself, but there’s an issue of scale and perspective. How do you compare to all the other people currently looking? There’s no way to answer that, but it can be hard to stand out from the crowd. There will be a lot of people with similar backgrounds, better backgrounds, and worse backgrounds. You can’t control much except making yourself a better candidate and trying to give yourself as many opportunities as possible. Anyway, you have to just understand that rejection is a part of life, and it’s a part of the job search process. That’s easier said than done. Regarding false certainty, that’s just part of life. There is just a lot of uncertainty in life. If you’re a sports fan, there’s uncertainty in the outcome of a game. There’s what likely will happen, but no guarantee. Some don’t watch because of anxiety. Others watch and let the result really impact them, and others watch and move on with their lives. You could probably do fine in a lot of roles at a lot of companies. So can a lot of other people.",

If you’re actually delivering and not taking an absurd amount of resources (I.e you’ve been there for a year and need to be handheld by a senior telling you exactly what to do every step of the way) no one really cares. That’s my 2 cents.",

Unfortunately those boom days are gone, but it is still not impossible.My first recommendation is find a dev sweatshop and see if you can break in this way. You’ll get bent on the hours and make about the minimum wages, but it may open some doors for you.I also got a friend who is (hopefully) still in process of breaking in last year from working as a dev in startup, also making minimum wage in a vhcol area. His work experience was also horrid with years of wastes, but he made some very interesting projects that I believe impressed the startup folks to giving him a shot.No sugarcoating but it is a lot of hard work, grit, and luck. Be willing to do anything and move anywhere, even at a minimum wage.. personally I had gave it all a go with a hard one year deadline of make it or try something else.Good luck",

What you need is visible proof you can ship, like a real app or something, so that website idea could be cool, if you actually do it. I think realistically your best options are SWE-adjacent roles (QA automation, DevOps junior roles, support/production engineering, data analysis with SQL and dashboards), government or university tech jobs, or small freelance or contract work. As for the gap, don't hide it, just acknowledge it, explain it without drama, and then immediately talk about recent work that proves you can actually be taken seriously and be trusted, not someone literally did nothing for years. I know I'm being kind of mean, but I really do think you got this IF you start today and work seriously for a year.

Unrelated BS.* After a handful of general applications that didn't produce even a \"no,\" she hyper-focused on job postings involving GIS experience as either a \"must\" or \"nice\" to have. She had this experience first from a previous career as a wildlife tech and more recently has 3yoe doing something similar as a SWE in her current soon-to-end job.* The pay in her new job is by no means silicon valley, but she's very much interested in quality of life and stability vs the brass ring. She wants the Lenovo and not the Macbook, so to speak.* She will be building flood prediction and mitigation software for a huge civil engineering company. Her current role is for an environmental consulting company building a land use planning and ecological footprint reduction app for corporate clients.* 80% increase in monetary compensation, drastically better benefits, fully remote.",

Short stints or bank style processes may not have matched what they were looking for, even if your skills are solid. Use this as feedback to sharpen how you explain your impact, decisions, and hands-on depth. One interview doesn’t define your ability, and many people get into Apple after a few tries.",

A person in California needs a lot higher of a salary than one in Kansas to support the same standard of living. This also goes for job titles: junior software engineer roles will have a considerably higher lower limit to their salary range than an IT support role generally. I’ve known people from my undergraduate institution that have published multiple papers and done multiple internships as well as people who did basically just their coursework. This is the biggest toss up though, since I’ve seen people from both cohorts accept offers in the $50k-$60k range as well as the $100k+ range fresh after graduating. To put it plainly, a good lower limit is a bit more than what you need to live off of. I say that because your experience is what will get you a higher salary in a few years when you apply for another job, and as a fresh grad it’s not always in your best interest to be picky. YoE is your golden ticket upwards when it comes to salary generally.",

But then after reading through the lines you were just supposed to rationale how things worked. Like a type for a variable is blank but you can see the method setting it is returning Foo. And then the last blank was some class that was the only import not used yet. Some were more challenging. But it seemed more practical like when you're actually walking through code trying to mentally put together how everything works. Idk if this is more common than I'm aware of but in the past I've always had miserable overly complex live coding assements usually with some ass hat who keeps telling me to talk him through what I'm doing when I'm trying to mentally work through it.

I understand why FAANG needs it but literally no other company should use that metric. This is gonna be a hot take but after doing the whole leetcode grind doing take homes or having to solve bugs in an interview is way more aligned with day to day work and also I don't need to prepare because it's literally the job. I also realized that engineering quality and how long people stayed a job were directly proportional to how they got hired. The leetcode system is built for revolving door engineers in goes some and out goes the other constantly for YEARS.",

I am OK with technical interviews with another engineer where we can code together and I can communicate my thoughts, processes, and my knowledge while programming. However, what's the point of stupid online assessments that major companies shove down our throats? let's say we receive 50000 resumes, ATS eliminates 90% so 5000 left, HR reviews then eliminates another 90% so 500 left, the army of HRs hops on call with those 500 people and eliminates another half so 250 left, that's still too many, do you think we're going to bring in 250 engineers? of course not, so we need to send out some kind of coding challenge to at least have the confidence that interviewers won't be wasting their time and you at least know how to code >And you know that most of us cannot pass these assessments in this way. that's fine, big techs aren't hiring your group of \"most of us\" anyway, if \"most of you\" CAN'T do it that's not a problem at all, companies would simply go hire those who CAN TL;DR: interviewer's time, and HR's time are more valuable than your time",

But if I ever want a new job it has to be 100% remote and decent paying, more than anything in the closest large cities(1hr away) would pay. Also typical downsides of rural area. Surrounded by MAGA people, have to drive an hour for food shopping or 1.5hr to something like an NFL game. 7hr drive to my \"office\" or a flight 1-2x a year. Would 100% not recommend to anyone that has under ~7 years experience. I do think there is a lot of value in in-person networking.",

Pretty much the only jobs are at private non-tech companies that don't feel the need to compete for engineers with the closest tech city.This means even with 15 YOE at my last job I was making 110K, which is less than a new grad makes at an actual tech company, while being seen as a \"top employee who others are compared to\". Basically I'm just the best SWE in a sea of mediocre or poor SWEs that would never get a job at an actual tech company.So while you can say I have lots of experience and even leading teams of 20 SWEs on projects it's just not the same as somebody who has worked at multiple big tech companies over the years. I still apply to all those big tech companies hoping to get a chance, but deep down I know I won't get an offer and just do the interviews I get for shits and giggles.Frankly I would take a new grad role at a big tech company if I could, but they won't down-level you that far. The recruiters always want me to interview for Senior or Staff level and I'm just not going to be at that level. I'm probably mid-level SWE at a top tech company at best.I'm just not top tech company smart at the end of the day. It probably doesn't help that I worked on safety critical medical devices, think dialysis machines, for all those years. So my experience lies in C and C++ roles and I look for jobs working on physical products over web stuff.Also as a side note, having your name on patents sounds cool, but nobody gives a shit about them at the end of the day, lol.",

Companies are doing this thing where they'll give you a take-home that's basically a mini project, then still make you do live coding anyway. It's exhausting.Your F500 experience is actually solid though, especially the k8s/cloud stuff. Non-tech companies are weirdly respected right now because everyone assumes you know how to work with legacy systems and actual business constraints vs just burning VC money.For someone with your background I'd honestly skip the traditional job boards - they're even more of a black hole now. Platforms like Twill or Hired tend to work better for mid-level folks since you're not competing with 500 other applicants on the same posting.Start grinding leetcode again like now though. Even if the role is 90% backend architecture they're still gonna make you reverse a linked list or whatever. The bar hasn't gotten higher but the process has gotten longer and more annoying.",

BUT if you're losing your coding skills from stress/burnout, it might actually be worth it just to have structure and forced learning time. plus the internship angle is smart - some companies have way lower bars for interns than junior hires which is backwards but whatever.honestly though, skip the mass applying thing for a bit. you're burning yourself out and it's not working anyway. spend like 2 weeks just coding again - build something you actually want to use, not a todo app. then start reaching out to actual humans instead of application black holes.also try some of the referral-based platforms like Wellfound or Twill where you're not competing with 1000 other resumes in a pile. the bar is still high but at least someone looks at your stuff.the coding skills thing is real though - if you feel rusty, you probably are. fix that first before you interview anywhere good.",

Generally when you're interviewing, STAR is a format that's just meant for you to organize your thoughts, asking if that was the desired format was probably not ideal. If that's how you're going to answer it, just answer it in that format. Similar vein for the ask about a specific story around working with large teams. Instead of asking if she wanted to hear that specific story, just tell that story, it's yours to tell.",

Linux & Networking has nothing to do with engineer skills, BE is not superior work and it wont make you a better engineer.The dirty secret is that alot of backend work at most companies is just shuffling JSON between a database and an HTTP endpoint. The \"complexity\" is often infrastructure and ops stuff that's abstracted away by cloud services anyway. So you get devs whose work is \"write SQL query, wrap in endpoint, return JSON\"Meanwhile, frontend is dealing with:* An execution environment you don't control (browsers, devices, network conditions)* User unpredictability* State management that rivals distributed systems in complexity* Performance optimization with hard real-time requirements* i18n, responsive design, etc* The absolute chaos of the JS ecosystemBut sure, the guy writing `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?` and wrapping it in Express is the \"real engineer.\"",

When it comes to Front End work items on our board in DevOps, I am usually the one that gets handed these types of tickets since front end work is pretty much straightforward and self explanatory. “Self-sufficient, don’t need handholding” — I’ve noticed probably within the past 4 months that for this portion I am starting to be more self sufficient, but occasionally I do need support or guidance getting through the work item. For instance, I had to edit a table (database migration for C#) on one of our database tables for an application that we are in the midst of building and kind of got lost. I had to nudge one of our lead developers for some assistance, but I still occasionally do need help with more difficult problems that I sometimes run into. “Can own features end-to-end” — for this specific point, this is NOT true with me. If you really do own features end to end I expect these to be more front end feature work items, but not back end stuff. I struggle with back end work items immensely. Correct me if I am wrong please!!!“Collaborate with other teams on system design and write ADRs” — At my company, we really don’t have “ADRs”. Sure we understand the things we work on, but my company is so small that having things like this does not really benefit us. For bigger companies I could definitely see the benefit of this. My coworker who has been doing Software Engineering for 15 years wrote up the architecture design documents and database schema for a new application we are releasing soon about 6 months ago. He knew EXACTLY how to get it done, how long it would take, and how hard it would be. That’s something I totally expect from someone with that much experience. It also depends heavily on the work place you are at. Especially what you work on, how difficult it is, and if you are learning new things. I would say that from what you said in your post and comparing where I am at, we are probably in a similar spot. Now I don’t know how much you make, but I expect the next job you get (hopefully for me too) you will make substantially more. What I would work on for improving your knowledge is maybe look at more back end specific problems. I am currently working on a full stack application that calls a local database and uses REST to grab information from said database. I had a coworker who moved on to bigger and better things that told me back end development is where the big money is at. If you can understand that more, you will do great!",

Know who to go to ask to get information to handle some ambiguity, know when to ask team lead / senior when it's getting too big.Jr Devs seem more rare, but being able to help them or pair program and learn together to at least do the easy tickets.At least be able to take a stab at a small to medium problem and make some kind of drawing. Maybe use LLM to help and then make sure you understand what you made. Senior dev probably still modified or rejects solution.DevOps specifically just depends where you work. I found I need to know how CI/CD works and some basic to touching intermediate topics about AWS / K8 for interviews. I have only gotten the opportunity to write unit tests and update yaml files and deploy docker containers, so I can't speak there. I had dedicated DevOps teams at my other jobs.So my opinion (that may not be that accurate) is learn as you go and get your work done in a timely manner. If you have time afterwards review the work and make sure you get it.When you get to interviews though, different ball park. They want you to know (in my experience):the ability to system design large projects, solve medium LC's in 10-15 mins or a custom coding challenge, random trivia of basic to intermediate topics about your coding languages, varying levels of DevOps questions, SQL questions including asking specific syntax or make a query right now verbally or type in chat, strong behavioral stories that show impact and good team dynamics / easy to work with.. Then I got my job offer finally, and I'm potentially being bait and switched to doing lowcode despite needing to be some on paper super coder to get the job :face_with_tears_of_joy:",

You get a chance to design, build, make mistakes and own something end to end. It’s just a great experience imo.There’s no guarantee that you’ll learn anything new at a different job or be given any autonomy to work on fun stuff that actually interests you. Not saying don’t do it but I’d really think about it. I went from being at home 3-5 days a week to being in the office 3 days a week.It is miserable when you barely have anything to do because there isn’t enough work in the pipeline but it could be worse and end up being a ton of work with no chance to breathe. I’ve never found the perfect job. I’ve always been buried alive in work or hardly having anything to do most days. I’d keep the job, find some passion projects, and just enjoy the gravy train because good things don’t last forever so ride it till the end.",

This all depends on your circumstances, if you have friends and family to fall back on, you don't mind selling your home or moving, whether you have a family of your own that depends on you etc. When I was laid off a few years back I went into panic mode and landed plenty of interviews, I knew one manager who could tell I was a bit stressed. He interviewed me and offered me a position with no questions asked. I worked at that job for six months and learned it really wasn't for me and we parted ways. I took a step back and realized I had plenty of money in savings and also realized I didn't really want to work at that moment. I don't recommend just taking any job out of desperation if you can avoid it. I'm using my time off to relax, reflect, and become an even better developer.I feel for people with families and quality of life that needs to be maintained, I feel for people who go through this with a mortgage or health issues (I personally had to get on Medicaid when I lost my insurance). In those cases take whatever is on the table until something better comes along. I had interviews lined up within weeks when I was in panic mode. Now that I'm calm I can pick and choose roles that interest me. Just one thing to mention though about mental health, software development is a rapidly changing, confusing, and mentally taxing field. Going through a layoff in this field takes a toll on everyone, doesn't matter who you are. Try to stay positive and realize it's not your fault, you're just modernizing. You're not useless or undervalued, and you don't lack skill. You will make a comeback in this field. Take the high salary they'll give you in your next position and make sure to save enough for the inevitable rainy day, do this until you're six feet under or computers cease to exist.",

Instead of telling them you're 5/10 with azure skills and google your way through it, reframe it as having proficiency and experience with azure (give examples), noting that you're skilled at googling and quickly learning anything unfamiliar you come across. My coworker got hired after having an incredibly embellished resume and overselling every single one of his skills. It made him seem like he was the most qualified candidate even though he probably wasn't and he got the job. Now, 2 years later, he's still doing great at the company. I understand wanting to be completely candid, but unfortunately, interviewers aren't looking for transparency, they are looking for the most qualified and competent candidate. You are probably losing these job opportunities to people like him.Best of luck!",

In addition to it preparing you for interviews, I have the maybe unpopular opinion that studying these things can make you a better developer.

The system isn't about working harder. It's about **making the invisible workload visible** so you can manage it without burning out. It turns ambition into a sustainable action plan.

I was an Electrical Engineer bachelor's and did my Masters in CS to jump career paths during the heydey of the 2010s \"learn to code\". Doing the Masters was definitely valuable compared to self study or a boot camp then.",

It includes people with a wide variety of degrees like physics, mathematics, engineering, computer science, and data science. My company will assign tight deadlines where teams will be laid off and new people will be rehired if they are not met, so working long hours is a necessity. The mantra of the management and C-suite is basically \"If they can't meet my unrealistic expectations, we'll try someone else\". I've been lucky enough to be on a team with extremely motivated people, but we're basically racing against our management's expectations and it's exhausting.I am actually leaving corporate work and data science altogether because I've found that it isn't really for me anymore.

I billed them $500+ USD for this but not before giving them an estimate and plan. So OP, it’s criminal that your assessment is not paid. And as others have mentioned, even if you’ve done it, it’s not guaranteed that they will read, test and give feedback. And it will break you mentally after learning and building something so intensively just to get ghosted. FYI, I did pass mine and got an offer, as well as feedback after the assessment. Which is the best case scenario, paid intense work, feedback + offer. Also for context, this assessment is requested after 3 rounds of interviews.I do not recommend you taking the assessment because you’re technically not in the interview loop yet, and your worse case scenario is unpaid intense work (and not sure if you’ve done it properly since it’s your first time), no offer + no feedback. You should only do so if you’re prepared to face the worst.",

They're also the ones who can keep your name around for future consideration if you don't get hired, which _you very much want_. Most people I knew at Google failed their first hiring attempt but were contacted again later because their names were on file and passed later rounds.Not all of them are great. But the great ones are a huge ally to have. If there's any one single person you really want to like you in a process, it's them - _arguably_ more so than a single interviewer.I still keep in contact with a couple of my old recruiters from both jobs I've had and jobs I haven't. They're also amazing professional contacts.",

Has this person's actions impeded the project in an objectively measurable way?If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then you need to speak to your manager.

You're likely to get probed about it so it's best to be prepared. Technical-wise, focus on LeetCode mediums and understand the time/space complexity like the back of your hand. For implementation rounds, practice writing clean, testable code quickly; it personally helped me to time myelf while coding to sort of simulate what I'd encounter during interviews. I also recommend checking out [company-specific interview guides](https://www.interviewquery.com/companies), since some companies focus more on certain rounds like system design while others are more holistic with how they review your performance.

You should think of college as your part time job and what you do outside of it as your main job to really bolster your chances to get a job once you graduate.If it sounds like a lot it's because it is, but it's a lot easier than being unemployed for 2+ years after graduating which is what's starting to become standard.

Both for resume value and also to find what you're actually interested in doing. Me personally, I started more in more hardware-related things before realizing I wanted to go more straight software, webdev, and AI. But I wouldn't have known that if I didn't join the aerospace rockets club or the mechanical engineering club projects when I was a freshman to help with their software, and slowly explore with different kinds of projects. Even if you find one thing you like early, don't ONLY stick to that. Get a wide range of relevant experience",

        "body": "Part of my job is mentoring the Team and Tech leads that report to me. A couple of them are 15+ years my senior, and just ended up \"stuck\" at that level. Both of these guys are very smart, great developers, and good mentors to the Junior and Senior engineers on their teams. Their problem is the same thing I've seen skilled developers fall prey to over and over again throughout my career: lack of understanding of the business impact of their job.You likely have seen this as you've done Product Owner/Manager roles, so you're already ahead of the game. At the end of the day, though, lots of developers don't want to think about what they are doing in the context of the business, either because they just want to focus on the how and not the why, or because they are afraid of dealing with something that isn't as clean and clear-cut as solving a technical problem. Both of these Leads at my company have these sentiments, despite them understanding that they need to do more.The thing that helped me advance in my career and make sure never to stagnate, was to develop the business skills that helped me understand just how my work as a developer directly impacted the business. It helped me understand what to focus on, how to prioritize work that got the most impact internally and externally, and how to communicate critical needs to business stakeholders, especially in the form of long term support in favor of building tons of shiny new features as fast as possible.Those skills have proven to be transferable in a way that mastery of a specific language or framework simply haven't. I was stuck as a JavaScript dev for the first 8 years of my career, despite moving into a Team Lead role, because I wasn't focusing on the business problems as a whole and instead acted as the tool used to implement a solution someone else came up with. It was in this role that I started to be exposed to the larger discussions around what we were building, and why, which helped me realize that if I added my own voice to the conversation, I could influence what was happening and be seen as much more valuable than a simple code monkey.This helped me pivot to other languages and frameworks, including hopping from entirely Node/Vue.js as my stack to .NET/React with no real experience in either. I could understand the business reasons for why decisions were being made, which convinced my soon to be boss to hire me and take the chance that I could get up to speed on their stack in a reasonable amount of time.Now that I am in management, I use those skills constantly, but I still actively try to code in my spare time. For this, AI has been immensely helpful! I use Claude Code daily, whether its for doing the bulk of the super basic coding that I'd probably have done with snippets anyways while I handle the complex business logic, or having it explain the codebases I have access to but don't work in and still need to help make technical decisions for. I basically treat Claude as a pocket engineer who never needs to sleep, gets way too eager and excited and sometimes needs to be reigned in, but is still clever and helpful. I've used it to help me build fully custom applications specific to my company, Claude API cloud agents that help my engineers debug their work completely autonomously, and basically just manage my day to day work life.All of this is to say that you can still work on the things you are good at, enjoy doing, and still be a coveted asset companies would fight to have. Embrace AI as a way to level up the skills you already have and fill in the gaps you're missing. If you use it as a crutch while you're learning the strategic thinking required to lead a technology company, even if you have no desire to be a CTO/CEO, you'll be able to navigate this new AI powered world while still doing what you love. You don't have to go into management to influence the direction of a company either. Prove your ability to think tactically and with an understanding of the business' goals, and you'll have no problems finding a job well into the future.",

        "body": "The best way is really taking an interest in the discussions around what you and your team are building. This is obviously easier if you are part of an organization with a product team, but there are always stakeholders in every project. Instead of sitting back and being assigned work, ask why that decision was made. Play the junior card and your desire to learn, you'd be surprised just how many people get excited to explain why they have made a decision. Ask to shadow the discussion with stakeholders, then debrief with the other members of your team. Its important to remember that this is going to be extra work outside of your normal responsibilities, so you still need to get all of your work done or else you can lose peoples' trust. But the skill of learning from people more experienced and rapidly absorbing new knowledge is critical to succeeding long term as a software developer.Also, use AI as a coach. Even if you aren't allowed to use AI at work, you can still generally get away with telling it roughly the feature/functionality/application you and your team are building, the context of your company, and relevant tech stacks, then have it explain what it thinks are the likely business decisions. Then take that to the people involved in deciding the work that's been done and explain \"your thoughts\" and see how they line up. If you are allowed to use AI at work, instead of using it as a fancy auto-complete try to use it as a pair programming coach and have it explain why decisions and patterns may have been used. All this needs to be done with a healthy understanding that the AI very likely could be wrong, but at least it gives you a jumping off point to go confirm with somene who knows.",

        "body": "The most organic way is to insert yourself into discussions involving decisions made with stakeholders. At a more senior level, you should have the knowledge and skills to be able to look at an abstract problem and implement a robust solution. The key here is that often times engineers with those skills still act like more junior devs, simply taking orders and doing things how they are always done at the company. This is where you can approach these discussions from your side. Instead of simply taking orders, insert yourself into stakeholder discussions and talk through what they are looking for and give options on how to build what they want. You'll have to come prepared with the ability to explain what you want to implement at a level that less/non-technical people can understand. But if you keep showing up with good solutions on how to implement what people want, and can deliver on that implementation, you'll start to get invited to more and more of these discussions. Also, use AI to brainstorm and propose new design patterns for features. There's always the caveat that AI can very likely be wrong, but its a good jumping off point. Since you're new to it, just treat it like a conversation with another developer. Tell the agent when its wrong or has made a mistake and constantly give it new context. Ask it how you can improve the information you're giving it to help it come up with better answers. I am constantly getting better at working with AI agents, because I just throw problems at it and see what works. It seems kind of silly to think of it as a skill, but you really do get better working with them simply by putting in the time. I pay for the $100/month Claude Max plan and find it incredibly worth it, because I can have an idea and blitz my way through a rough implementation and decide if its worth pursuing, while also getting better at working with the agent, all in my personal time. At work, I am lucky enough to have the budget to spend a fairly sizable amount of money on Claude API tokens, primarily because I have proven the value of it to my boss, but I wouldn't have gotten there if I hadn't been experimenting on fun personal projects like my homelab server, custom websites and webapps for little hobby projects, and a healthy chunk of home automation.As far as resources go, one of the best books I was introduced to by a college professor of mine is called The Lean Startup by Eric Ries. It may be about building a startup, but the skills are extremely transferable to existing companies. Every single business needs to spend resources efficiently to survive, and understanding where you can deliver value the most is key to success. Also, I very recently discovered Lenny's Newsletter, which is a site with an enormous amount of content around Product development, Engineering, and how leaders in the AI space use AI to run their businesses and professional lives. I've just started digging into it, but its been really eye opening on how I have just been scratching the surface of using AI, and I already have several fully custom AI tools in use that I build explicitly to help me manage my teams at work.",
