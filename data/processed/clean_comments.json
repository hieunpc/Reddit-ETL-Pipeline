Now most teams never think about cluster management.- Analytics engineering emerged as a discipline. Beauchemin predicted DEs would need more SQL, but underestimated how much the transformation layer would specialize (dbt, semantic layers, etc.)- The 'modern data stack' hype cycle. Lots of point solutions that promised to solve specific problems, then consolidation as everyone realized 47 tools was too many.What stayed the same (unfortunately):- The gap between 'we have data' and 'we understand the business domain.' Still the hardest part.- Pipeline maintenance burden. Different failure modes now (API rate limits vs disk space), same percentage of time spent on it.- Stakeholder expectations vs data quality reality.What's genuinely better:- Getting started is 10x easier. A junior can have a working pipeline in a day instead of weeks.- The tooling for testing and observability actually exists now.- Version control for transformations is standard, not exotic.The 'Downfall' article was prescient about platform engineering eating some DE work. But the semantic layer and data modeling parts got more complex, not less. Different work, roughly same headcount.",

There are other places where a data engineer is someone who writes SQL largely for ETL purposes and maybe just manages the schema and type definitions of a particular data set and optimizes the routine queries that are run against said database, but even then that can be a stretch.

Still ml models are scary and we don't hire people who know how to do it so they all end up half arsed. No Python server as we are big into sas although some teams use r to make models. We now have ai which isn't so bad for data as you can't just write stuff as the data is a bit unknown to the AI so it can only build small functions but they are always super complicated and anyone that wants to reuse it has to try really hard to understand the over complexity of a simple task.",

Automation amplifies problems as much as it amplifies solutions. The data engineer gets the heat when the products of their automation designs don't meet expectations, and the QA inquiry too often reveals problems with the data itself, including missing values, data entry errors, mismatched or approximated semantics when bringing together variously sourced data, accuracy and precision problems, deliberate and accidental bias, agenda selectivity, etc. AI is built on big data infrastructure, so its good that we have this professional layer to review our supply chains as we procede to the next generation of decision support.",

Anyway, I don't know how much tasks or tickets you get a day/week, you should start asking project priorities or start building one yourself and propose it to the exec team. And how they impact the business for the better. This also helps you become more visible if you've been just working with other folks in the company, but not with exec team. Not sure who you report to, but asking these kinds of questions to your direct report also helps. If not, I might start looking for a new place to work for. Also, realistically what you can do is to start building infra and pipelines along with what you're doing. You satisfy the current needs and start working on things you think are important or necessary to do what they ask you to do (reporting, dashboarding). Overall, I'd try to communicate a lot more and see what they say. And depending on that, you either start looking for a new job or decide to do things differently going forward.

Are you just writing one off queries on raw data to populate them? In my experience ad hoc reports are a symptom of a lack of good models (and pipelines that build those models) going into your BI tools. If that’s the case it’s a pretty easy sell to your line manager that building a proper pipeline would mean dashboards get built faster and have way more reusability.If you’re the solo data engineer, then you’re the sole authority and the only one who can explain why it is a problem. Have you raised this with them? If you’re just complying with the requests of things they think they want to see, then they’re gunna be stuck in a loop of forcing through ad hoc things - because it’s all they know.You mention being an excel support desk too - this definitely shouldn’t be happening - spreadsheets can be avoided in almost all cases these days (with some exceptions). I LOVE it when someone requests a spreadsheet because it’s an opportunity for me to ask them “out of curiosity” what are they doing with the spreadsheet - then you almost always get given an opportunity to solve a problem that they didn’t even know existed, this can make people very happy and that’s the most satisfying part of this job, I find.Maybe I’ve got the completely wrong take here but it sounds like the company hasn’t been exposed to a modern data stack before and are doing things the old way, if you’ve already shown them how it could be better (time optimisation, data reliability, and undiscovered insights being the selling points that execs hear) - then fair enough leave - if you haven’t you’re sitting on a golden opportunity, cause it sounds like you’re the only authority. Best wishes going forward - but this sounds like you’re not doing data engineering at all and would be a red flag to me if I were to interview you for an engineering role and you spoke about this sort of setup.",

Look at each solution and figure out an architecture. Are there hooks, queues, api limits, query costs, etc. Do a true realtime and a micro batch solution based on how often the data changes. You will never find a tool that does everything. You can spend 3 more months looking at tools or define tools for different use case and start chipping away at",

We create connections declaratively using terraform and orchestrate them with airflow. We barely touch the UI, only for logs and maybe the occasional manual sync. The open source and number of different connectors are worth it. Only con for airbyte is that in our opinion the normalization step from having the data in json blob to a RDBMS table takes unnecessarily long. It stupid. Therefore, we are pivoting our RDBMS sources to ingest them with Trino. Where we use dbt to write models that serve as ingestion with no transformation. So, Trino + dbt = ingestion. With dbt incremental models you can handle all sorts of ingestion patterns. For our other sources such as sftp, API, sharepoint etc., we keep using airbyte. Around 90% of our sources are RDMS though.Additionally Trino can handle reverse etl easily to another database. Moreover, we can also write them as dbt models maintaining full lineage from ingestion all the way to Reverse ETL and other exposures.",

It can certainly ingest data from SaaS solutions as well as on-prem. It's not as nice/easy to use for ingestion as Fivetran but it does work. Fivetran can get expensive (high MAR usage) when you have cases of large datasets (SaaS or on-prem) that need to get ingested each month but also have low number of updates (meaning you cannot save MAR if rows change may times per month). I had never heard of 'Precog' before but it seems to only have been around since 2020. Not sure I would want to partner with a company this new.Hope it works out for you.",

Just be sure you're able to answer these question patterns (copy pasted from my Notion, let me know if i should clarify something):\\- Ordinal & Ranking Patterns (first, second, third, latest X per group) -> row\\_number() + dense\\_rank() + rank()\\- Rolling / Sliding Aggregations (rolling x-day average, running total etc.) -> sum/avg/count window function + \"ROWS BETWEEN N PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)\\- LAG / LEAD Window Functions (year-over-year changes)\\- Metric by Dimension (e.g. revenue by department) -> GROUP BY + join\\- Self Joins (often used in hierarchies)\\- Anti joins (find what's missing)\\- Conditional aggregation (count(case when x = y then 1 end))\\- CTEs\\- Knowing functions to manipulate dates (get month/year from timestamp, date diff, add time, ...) With this you'll be able to answer 99% of all interview questions",

I think moving onto the hard questions is good, if you've already done the easy/medium problems. You can always re-visit the Mediums again, and try to speed through them, after going through a few dozen hard problems. You just might be surprised how much faster you can go, after practicing on harder problems, and getting better at pattern recognition. Besides DataLemur, I think having a proper project to talk about is also super important for Data Engineering interviews. Hopefully, this can be sourced from a past internship – but if not, go make a real portfolio project that's end-to-end, deployed (with a live link), that's also key-word rich (so use AWS, PostgreSQL, Airflow, Python, etc.).",

I've built ETL pipelines both ways over 12+ years.Minimizing dependencies makes sense when you're building something simple and stable that won't need much maintenance. We had a batch job that ran for 8 years with zero external packages beyond requests and psycopg2. Worked great.But rebuilding ORM patterns from scratch is different from just not using one. If you're writing your own query builders, connection pooling, retry logic, and type coercion, you're now maintaining all that code forever. Every bug fix, edge case, and security patch is on you. SQLAlchemy has had hundreds of contributors finding problems you'll never think of.The return code pattern concerns me more than the dependency choice honestly. Python's exception model exists for a reason and fighting it creates code that's harder to read and debug. If your senior prefers explicit error handling, that's fine, but there are Pythonic ways to do it without making every function look like C.The real question is what's the maintenance horizon here. If this is a one time data migration that runs and gets archived, vanilla Python is fine. If this is production infrastructure your team will maintain for years, the cost of rolling your own ORM will compound. Every new team member has to learn your custom patterns instead of reaching for documentation.Worth having a direct conversation about it. Ask what specific concern drives the no dependencies stance. Sometimes it's a bad experience with a package breaking, which is valid but solvable with pinned versions and testing.",

I had nobody telling me no, I just communicated to IT what I was doing and got their blessing in email to cover my ass.Aside from that, I think I was also pretty strict about choosing libraries. I try to stick to stuff that's in the Anaconda suite since it seems to get a buttload of community and support.If a vendor has their own libraries that they actively maintain, I'll use those. If it's a real niche thing by some dude and I can't find a way to feel good about it, hell no. I've never had anything bad happen, but it only takes one time. I don't think my situation is a very good comparison. Nobody was really supporting me or looking at my work. I just packaged code where I could reference a config file like a control table. Send queries, save them as flat files, do the things like package them into this or that or upload them here or there.I was never given the greenlight for an actual database, but it got us by in the interim as we grew. Again, my situation was very specific with weird constraints.If your senior dev dude is having you basically write your own stuff instead of using a library, take that is a chance to reverse engineer a process that many might take for granted. A few years from now you'll be that much more versed in things I guess? Like, I had nobody to review my code. If anyone had to go back and look at it, it was me.

In interviews you’re expected to “compile in your head,” which is a different skill.What helped me was practicing a small set of patterns until they felt automatic. Things like group by with aggregations, joins across 2 to 3 tables, window functions for ranking or deduping, and basic subqueries. If you’ve internalized those shapes, most questions are just variations.Also practice explaining your thinking out loud while you write. Even if the query isn’t perfect, interviewers often care more about how you reason about edge cases and data shape. If you blank, start by restating the tables and columns you have, then sketch the result you want. That usually gets your brain moving again.",

So fast that it outpaces the slog it takes to get things implemented at an enterprise company. Your best bet is to find a data engineer or developer role you enjoy, and start using the AI tools to do that job better. Better put, focus on the role and supplement it with AI, don’t focus on a role that only exists to promote some x AI tool for your company. Sorry this is long but one more example: my company has “AI engineers” that spend a lot of time and energy making AI agents specific to certain areas - AI agent for M365, an AI document agent, email agent.. you get the idea. Then a few months later the outside world AI space comes out with agents that essentially work in any space, making a lot of their work extremely outdated in a matter of week/months. I can’t overstate how fast AI is progressing in comparison to how slow companies implement changes.",

You can't make up for the tech debt and disorganisation of some places.Documentation is a mess absolutely everywhere and those consolidation projects take years and fail every time, in that there will be N+1 repositories. And then they will do it again. It's the biggest boondoggle in the business. Funnily, they always go hard on permissions on that latest repository and will require multiple panel reviews and checkins for literally anything you want to put in, to the point it's impossible to use. So don't think about that anymore. Focus on building your own documentation silo wherever it is and however you want to. The goal is a foundation for your own work, not a general thing for other people. And you've got other responsibilities? That's also common. Try to see it as a good thing in that you get some extra job stability. That aside, are people complaining? Have you looked around and realised there are others who have been there for years or decades and not pulling their own weight? lol. They probably created most of these problems too!This is all extremely common. If you move on now you will likely experience the same thing and worse, so my advice: seeing as you are not fully invested in this job, try to see it as your personal playground to try some other working and thinking styles, until you find something that lets you function there without the anxiety.If anyone ever asks something you don't know, you're not the expert on that, but will try to find someone (and often, people will just forget it entirely!) If anyone calls you out on not knowing every atom in the universe, just repeat the same thing. Some people are aggressive like that but it's not you, they just have it in for easy prey. You'll do okay.",

Cool guy!It tries to improve on multiple fronts ,mostly user experience (e.g. hyperlinks to problematic files, init command, pretty output , some SE better practices and of course leverage Rust speed and binary size), which are explained here: [here](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/faq/), in the 'How does dbtective compare to similar projects' dropdown. One of the improvements I wanted required a completely different architecture and [Rust traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html) were the perfect candidate.The simplest explanation of this architectural change is by example, comparing dbt-bouncers [`CheckModelDescriptionPopulated`](https://godatadriven.github.io/dbt-bouncer/stable/checks/manifest/check_models/#manifest.check_models.CheckModelDescriptionPopulated) rule (which only applies to models) with dbtective's \\`[has\\_description](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/rules/description/)\\` rule, which can apply to all eligible dbt objects, for example \\`sources\\`, \\`seeds\\`. \\`macros\\` or anything that can be described (in the \\`applies\\_to\\` setting). So in \\`dbtective's\\` case, one rule can be used to expect descriptions on multiple objects, leaving less work for the user.With this in mind we can set defaults that make sense (e.g. it makes sense to describe a lot of things so the default \\`applies\\_to\\` setting contains literally all objects that can have a description field for the has\\_description rule), but we can also easily remove or add objects if the project requires it, using the applies\\_to configuration.These defaults I would like to eventually leave to the community or be fixed by asked the right questions in the init command. For now I've set them to what makes sense to me (this is also much of the reason to stay on v0)!Hope that clears things up!",

All good things, not really what we're concerned about with DE. 2. Since you're in SWE and looking at design patterns, keep in mind what it would be like if the only thing you had to care about was the data inside the objects. A lot of folks coming from a SWE background focus on the abstract object versus what is contained by the object. To move to DE you have to care a lot more about the latter. 3. Things that will be evergreen in DE: python, SQL, databases, warehouses, data modelling (although the meaning of this varies person to person, company to company, much to my chagrin). Focus on these. Python at an expert level (focus on the data packages. Polars, Duckdb. And DB packages. Pscyopg, etc.), at least 1 RDBMS 1 NoSQL and 1 DB system you're just interested in, SQL to an expert level which will give you passable knowledge for most Warehouses as well. 4. Tools that will be evergreen in DE: Airflow, Docker, GitHub, K8s. TOML/YAML as well. DBT is very good to know as well. 5. And that the issue is that job descriptions are very heavily implying mastery while the actual job wants a jack of all trades. Get good at probing for this information in interviews with tech staff. Take advantage of mock interviews if you have the chance.",

Those are your compounding assets for data engineering.Go “tourist mode” on: AWS basics, containers, a bit of infra-as-code, so you know what exists and can follow conversations, but you don’t need to be CKA‑ready in school.That cert roadmap you listed is… a lot. I’d pick 1, max 2, that align with jobs in your area. Use the others as “maybe later”.Also, instead of chasing every tech, build 1–2 small but realistic projects that connect them: e.g. data pipeline -> warehouse -> simple internal app to view/edit data.

Then you can do dimensional model on silver gradually as you gradually try to find the questions you want to answer. This is one of the many patterns currently practiced in big enterprises. You will learn integration patterns (conformed layer) not just modelling. Dont dimensional model just because you have data. It depends on what you want to do with it.

I work with data teams and use Claude Code daily, so let me share what actually matters.The vibe coding thing you're seeing is real for building quick demos and web apps. But for analytics engineering work, especially in niche domains with messy data like you describe, it doesn't work that way. The hard part of your job is not writing SQL, it's knowing which parameter to look at based on domain knowledge. That's exactly where AI struggles.Where AI actually helps me is the tedious stuff. Debugging weird errors, generating boilerplate tests, converting between formats. I'd say 6/10 useful is about right for debugging help. Where it falls apart is anything requiring judgment about your specific business [context. My](http://context.My) honest take after a year of heavy Claude usage for data work is that the people who are no longer doing anything technical are probably working on much simpler problems than yours. When you're eyeballing raw files to figure out which field is correct because documentation doesn't exist, there's no prompt that replaces that institutional knowledge.Try Claude for the parts of your job you already know how to do but find tedious. That's where it shines. Skip the hype about agents replacing analytics engineers, that's not happening anytime soon for anyone doing real domain-specific work.",

It's not clear to me what is the situation here, but you can use AI for both:- use AI to generate documentation of where each parameter/column is, what it describes, how to query it, etc. Review that documentation for mistakes/errors and rewrite/fix what needs to be fixed in the documentation. Then, the AI can refer back to this documentation when generating code, saving you time- ask AI to clarify requirements, or identify information gaps, and draft responses to requests that are not clearUsing AI to code is fine and useful, but you said that's not the part you struggle with. So try to think of ways to use AI for the parts that you actually struggle with. Maybe AI won't find the information for you, but once you find it, have it create documentation that will help and save you time in the future.",

It lets me get down all those bits and pieces that I know are needed, and I can tell it how to start organizing things and let it give me the first draft which I can start iterating on. Sometimes by myself, sometimes feeding it back in with my notes.At the bottom, I let it create code for me where it is well defined. I'll ask for functions or skeleton templates that I can go back and flesh out later. If I've broken it down cleanly enough, it is another round with AI to fill that part out.I also review what it puts together for me 100% and tweak it a little bit to fit my preferences and style.What I don't do is have AI do something I don't know intimately. For example, If I need to connect to a new service and I don't know how the APIs are laid out, I will figure that out before I ask for anything to be created; though I am willing to ask AI to narrow down the documentation and examples to what I am specifically interested in so it takes me less time to get that knowledge.",

It’s in use at DoD, DHS, State Dept that I know of. I moved from SSAS (which was an old version of Synapse) to Databricks once. It wasn’t trivial - converting whatever the MS language was to SQL or Python wasn’t obvious. If your Synapse is on SQL I’m sure it would be easier but you’d probably have to try it to see. Databricks/Spark SQL is currently very capable - it took a while to get there, but most things you can do on other platforms are there now. You said you need good RBAC - Databricks uses standard sql permissions and now has very good fine grained permissions including constraints and expectations for data quality assurance. Pricing model seems clear to me - pay based on compute usage (kind of a big markup) and not really much else. I’ve been in the fed gov in Databricks for 5 years now on a large data warehouse and I still think it’s a good product.",

        "body": "The way that I have ended up managing Data Infra in a couple of roles now is by being able to rapidly produce a prototype. You'll want to pick up, and use regularly, systems like Docker and Kubernetes. Even for your own small data projects. This will introduce you into that world where those things are heavily used. These are also cloud-agnostic meaning no matter what service provider your future employer(s) use you'll be squared on this front. In the same vein are things like VPCs and general networking which I spend more time debugging than anything else in DE/DataOps. After that you can get into the specifics of particular platforms. As far as practicing is concerned: Start with `docker`. Learn the ins and outs of taking arbitrary python code you have and stuffing it into a container. Learn how to find images, how Dockerfiles work, run into the issues so you can troubleshoot them. Then see what it takes to incorporate tools you may be using to develop your code into the dockerfiles. Things like `uv`. If you can have one system managing both your local dev and your container builds you have less points of failure to troubleshoot. Then grab `k3s` for local development. This is, notably, \"actual\" kubernetes. That is opposed to things like minikube which are \"kubernetes in docker\". Nothing wrong with that, but when we're talking about \"rapid\" prototyping, k3s is as close as it gets to just managing raw k8s on your local system. You'll probably immediately want to grab `helm` as well. Read up on `k8s`, `k3s`, `helm`, and `kubectl`. Play around with trying to get your docker containers that do things or expose things up onto k3s locally. See what it takes to setup `postgres` on kubernetes, and how to expose it so you can communicate with it externally.Outside of those things, which are more typical of `self host first` shops, you can likely find playgrounds around specific tech. I believe `databricks` recently opened up a playground of sorts. Snowflake may as well, but I don't honestly remember. Google on `GCP` used to give you like $300 in credits, plus they have the open BigQuery datasets you can mess around with. I think all of these things are secondary or tertiary things to focus on though, as they are mostly provisioned and managed for you from an infra standpoint. It's not bad to see what the platforms look like behind the scenes, though!I find Data infra specifically very interesting. It's got some nuance that can apply to standard web infra, but often times deviates from it. Which ends up as a nice challenge and break from the typical DE work for me!",

I have thought of studying Linux (more than your regular CLI commands) and from there jump to Docker. I am following a book on Ubuntu and as the book progresses it introduces the concept of Docker in Linux in chapter 10 I believe, that's why I had thought of it as a good path to follow. Additionally, I am reading an intro book to Networking, I think is called \"Networking for Sysadmin\", it is the only book I've found is easy to follow on that topic with practical examples. From there my idea is to start doing labs in Azure and Amazon, to start getting hands-on experience in building infrastructure with IaC and then finally visit K8, possibly get a cert on that if time allows. Of course, my day to day for the next year will be familiarising myself with Snowflake, DBT and learning how to use Claude to write more efficient code. This is a 2 year plan. Alternatively, I could go the Masters way, and enrol in one to get a better picture of CS as a whole, but I feel there are many topics that I don't need, and my best bet would be focusing on the tools that I use day to day and potentially the ones I could use in a couple of years.",

We ended up with a 'match confidence tier' approach instead of binary yes/no. High confidence matches get auto-merged, medium confidence goes into a review queue, low gets flagged but not linked. Made the downstream consumption much cleaner.3. Watch out for data entry drift over time. Someone is 'Andrew Doe' in 2019 but 'Andy Doe' in 2023 in the same system.For the global ID itself, we went with a synthetic key generated at resolution time rather than picking one source as authoritative.

In my experience, Power BI should not be treated as the primary security boundary.If a dataset is sensitive enough to restrict at the report/workspace level, it should also be restricted at the data platform level. BI governs distribution. The platform governs possibility.In your HR example, the intent is single-user access but enforcement technically allows broader query capability via AD groups. That creates a gap between intent and control.Some patterns that work well:• Use schema level isolation for restricted datasets (e.g., HR restricted schema)• Create purpose built AD groups for narrow audiences instead of reusing broad corporate groups• Introduce dataset classification tiers (Enterprise / Domain / Restricted / Confidential) and let that drive both platform and BI configuration• Avoid relying on workspace isolation alone, it won’t protect against direct query accessI usually ask one test question, If someone bypassed Power BI tomorrow and queried Databricks directly, would we still be comfortable with their access?If the answer is no, the boundary is in the wrong place.Curious how others are handling this, especially in lakehouse setups with tag driven RLS.",

The math is nontrivial. Linear algebra, especially rotation matrices and quaternions for coordinate transforms, and the Newtonian equations you'd learn in a 1st year calculus based physics class, and also a bunch of other stuff that I had to learn/relearn to work here. (I have an undergrad degree in math.) I don't have to *implement* everything, but I do need to understand what's going on conceptually and use appropriate mathematical libraries correctly.2. The folks I work with are PhDs, so a lot of building a pipeline is listening, very carefully to what the (let's say) rocket scientist wants and building exactly that. No creative metrics here. The physics is the physics. I ask a lot of questions about what is supposed to happen through a series of calculations. What does a good result and a bad result look like? Where are the best places along the way to spot-check things like an intermediate matrix becoming ill-conditioned?3. The PhD's are not hired for coding ability. I need to detangle messy MATLAB code to turn into data pipelines that I actually want to own and maintain over time.I work on the \"easy\" stuff that still fits in a Postgres database. So, I use python and other fairly standard tools. I want to upskill into rust/pyO3 which I'd hope would make some of the calculations complete faster than numpy/scipy. I suspect I do a lot more software engineering than my retail data engineer peers: There is a lot of custom code written specifically for our particular uses/devices that just isn't available in open source libraries or even as a commercial product (besides the stuff sold by my employer and our direct competitors).",

You can even kind of simulate that functionality using old fashioned SQL, but it's a huge pain.If, like most folks in our situation, you have no resources, no support, and no external understanding of the probelm, I've tackled it in Python. If your data isn't \"Big Data\" you can basically use Python to iterate over records like it's replaying an event stream. I basically have it scrutinize the identifiers on each event and ask \"Have I seen any of these identifiers in prior events I just processed? No, alright I'll give them a master, internal warehouse ID. Yes, I'll go back and find the master ID I gave some of them previously and assign it to this batch.I'm usually not a big fan of probablistic methods so I only count observations where there is some real identifier in common.",

You can use whatever for the message bus, there's plenty of easy ones.If you're asking about general design patterns though, you'll want the `onSubmit` you mentioned to probably capture the data from an input, probably on the same screen as the button, and to do an operation against notion with that information.

Is it a Postgres sidecar you run yourself, or something Snowflake runs inside a container service? That changes the Docker story a lot.For the Docker install, I’d start by confirming the exact Postgres version and extension build target, then get a minimal container running Postgres with the extension loaded before you touch Snowflake integration. Once that’s stable, you can layer in auth, network egress, and whatever connector it uses to talk to Snowflake.",

Having SparkSQL could be an argument for Spark, despite not being that easy to manage. But if you say you have complex ETL, use it as a guidance, don't expect it to migrate everything for you. It takes time to migrate if you truly have complex ETL. And make sure of any potential deadlines when it comes to your Powercenter, and what options you have. Not many organizations with complex ETL will run without support, or even community support in the longer run after migration.",

        "body": "Hey, I ended up spending the last year migrating most of our informatica jobs off of our on prem server to AWS. Most of the time consuming portions were:1. Networking tickets to try connect to the source system from AWS. Also networking tickets for AWS to connect to destination systems. 2. Finding out where all the variables for informatica were stored on the on prem server. 1. I hated this part soooooo much. 3. Understanding the complex logic of the informatica jobs since people who built them left and no one understood what they were doing. I exported the XML for the informatica jobs and used copilot to create sql queries to pull from source systems instead of manually doing this. I know this didn't really answer you question but I needed to vent as this was an exhausting project.For tools. I wasn't expecting large loads(Under 20gb). So I used Docker, python, and duckdb. I created a custom image to use on lambda and I orchestrated with AWS step function or Airflow depending on the team. I used ECS if I expected loads to take longer than 15 minutes. We might have had to keep the on prem server if we could not access the source from aws. So Docker, python, and duckdb would still have been used. Orchestration would have been some sort of cron schedule. Hope this helps and sorry for the vent.",

There will be decent private sector jobs available but considering you have BA in there, I would advise building out the scope of your current job insanely quickly to pad the ol resume and hunting pay rises or job hopping. The job is fantastic for analytical minds and formal training will make it easier if you know what technical options are available to you for the problem solving. I don't regret a thing 7 years down the line. My student debt is fully paid off, my job keeps me engaged and the pay was good to start so I never had to job hop (again, stupidly lucky) the only risk I have is I've had to dodge rounds of layoffs like a freaking ninja so if you can manage that you should be sweet long term!Tldr; you've done the ground work to make great money in an interesting field, your anxiety is valid but you've set yourself up for big wins in the future.

In practice it appears to exist to try and create a role with emphasis on domain expertise to try and improve processes but without the salary premium in an investment in technical skills that would be required of a data analyst or other professional data roles. Sort of a what if there were a halfway business admin career level and a data analyst at a professional career level, but we can pay them cheaper. As result they tend to become data specs retrievers.Where I call this a frankenstein role is because in practice when you do work the slow boring way, the technical details, that is where the pattern recognition develops. To see the insights in terms of what steps in the process can be eliminated. Where to break it into logical steps and streamline and automate. That technical work at the data analyst or more technical roles is where innovation happens, closest to the doing of the work. This is partly observation that in the industrial era it was common that those associates closest to the manufacturing lines would then observe a process improvement and go on to start a second business using those improved processes as a foundation. As we are in the tech white collar era the same principles appear to apply that those closest to the work observe pattern simplifications that innovate. In order to develop the intuition to improve processes there is no replacement for having performed that process. By doing so with time in a role a data analyst or other data positions tend to also develop domain expertise along with their technical skills.Thus from my perspective what companies want from a business analyst requires experience in more technical roles, first. And this is what you see in more mature companies. The business analyst tends to be more of a senior data professional at a salary premium. As a senior data professional they have the technical background to consult on improved business processes and speccing out those projects.There are a lot of companies staffing business analysts that are at a much more junior level. Creating oddities in data on what they should be paid and ambiguities in how to implement them within the company structure.You get to skip that ambiguity by transition to a more defined data role with development of fundamentals that transition to other roles and scale.",

I've done a lot of VBA and though I like other tools more, I know I can build high quality, durable, readable tools. I had some good, simple VBA programs that I later built into VB.NET versions. Next, when building a pipeline, pay very close attention to the input end and output end. Make sure you understand exactly what is coming in and going out. Your job is to build the bridge.You have another tool that gives you a lot of options and will serve you well in your future: PowerShell. Every Windows system has it and it exists outside the VBA/MS Office universe. You can call VBA from outside Office apps and you can use a wider range of shell commands when you call PowerShell from within VBA. You can even use .NET from PowerShell. I don't have a particular suggestion, but it's another tool within your narrow non-developer permissions.As a technique, check out whether OOP is a better approach. Some VBA developers never go there but building custom classes often solve problems that otherwise are needlessly clumsy and unintuitive. You'll look more professional and your project will be easier to move to a better platform if it is organized around sensible classes than if it is built around .com objects that aren't built around your needs.",

On the former, it's not as if some of us couldn't speak to BE work, but you're going to get less direct support for that. On the latter, and more to the point, I assume what you're saying is you want to build a portfolio centered on AI. I'm making that assumption _because_ you included LangChain specifically. LangChain is going to be much easier than... you know, learning actual Machine Learning. As far as job prospects go, my personal money would still be on ML. Be the person manufacturing the shovels type of metaphor. If I'm honest putting these two systems in a question about \"which to use to build a portfolio\" tells me you may need to ensure you're actually ready to present what you will build. The portfolio you make should present a really solid understanding of the framework you chose, allow you to speak to tradeoffs and choices, and show skills in troubleshooting and understanding limitations. Don't just vibe code this thing in an afternoon. Not saying you intended to, but more a word of caution. Good luck!",

The honest answer is instruction files help with style but won't catch logical bugs.CLAUDE.md is great for things like 'use this date format' or 'always check if table exists before dropping' but AI will still write a dbt model that uses the wrong join type or handles nulls in a way that silently drops records. The instruction files can't encode business logic deep enough to prevent that.What actually works: dbt's built-in tests get you maybe 30% there. The wins come from singular tests that encode your actual business rules, stuff like 'revenue should never be negative' or 'customer count should be within 5% of yesterday.' We run those on every PR.We also started requiring example queries with expected outputs in PR descriptions. Manual, yeah, but reviewers can run them and verify the logic. Caught more issues than any linter.The sneaky pattern with AI-generated dbt is syntactically valid code that does the wrong thing with joins or nulls. We added a TESTING.md file listing these gotchas and requiring specific test coverage for them.For open source where you can't control what people use, CI becomes the only guardrail. Require schema tests and singular tests per model before merge. If someone's AI code passes all that, honestly, good enough.",

It’s great at drafting pipelines, writing transformations from specs, and generating tests, which saves time on repetitive work. Some teams are also using it to monitor logs and suggest fixes, but that only works well if your metadata and observability are already solid. It struggles with architectural decisions, trade offs around cost and performance, and messy stakeholder requirements. The ROI depends on how disciplined your environment is.

There’s an enormous amount of money invested into AI right now, which means that these companies providing it are feeling serious pressure to make it profitable. So far, nobody really has. We all see at this point that it’s a huge bubble similar to the .com bubble, and we’ll probably see similar result - AI is likely here to stay, but it probably won’t be used very differently than how it’s being used today and the demand to put AI into every app or service will die down. In the programming world, that means that we’ll probably get used to tools like Claude Code or Copilot and adopt patterns where we let it write the boring parts for us, but skilled programmers will still be valuable when building complex software while using these tools. We’ll likely see a knock-on effect of even cheaper compute as all these data centers are built to meet a demand for AI will inevitably to drop off.In the short- to medium-term, there’s probably a pretty penny to be made by contractors who can untangle the mess of code written by companies who went overboard on writing their software with AI.So I guess TL;DR is that if you’re a total AI Luddite you should probably at least experiment with AI to get used to where it’s helpful and where it isn’t. If you’re an AI hype beast, you should probably make sure not to let your actual technical skills atrophy because the future where AI writes 100% of the code is just not coming. If you’re still programming pretty much like you always have but spotting the cases where you can use AI to save yourself some time, that’s probably where we’ll all be over the next few years",

I did kind of naturally gravitate towards levelling them gradually as you said, so for me it kinda looked like this.* Create a selenium/playwright script to test a website over and over again. You should be able to run your code, and see that a chrome browser opens up, navigates to the site you specified in code, does the things you expected, and then shuts down. Suggestion: Have it perform this 10 times, and you calculate the average times between each action. Gives you brief superficial performance data.* Read all the rules of a large international lottery, then emulate it in a script. Write a for-loop or an equivalent that prints every X amount of money spent on lottery tickets until you hit the jackpot. It'll teach you basics about for-loops, ToString(), classes and to avoid lotteries.* Create an API that you can test using Postman/Insomnia (real world valuable experience).* Create a windows service (if you are learning .net that is), that you can install, start, stop, restart in windows gui (also valuable experience).* Install Docker Desktop or the equivalent on your computer. Then create a containerized small project, doesn't matter what the project is. What matters is that it runs inside the container and you can interact with the project through the exposed port (very valuable real world experience).* Create a project where you split its component into several containers, then orchestrate them through Docker Compose or an equivalent (very valuable real world experience).",

There is some innate talent to it, sure, but I think most of becoming a successful software developer is just having the motivation to put in the thousands of hours of practice.I know \"thousands of hours of practice\" sounds unreasonable but look at how many hours some people can put into a single video game. They do it 100% unpaid. Just for fun. When you are actually interested in programming you will naturally do the same. Unfortunately university level computer science programs are more than happy to take students who have never written a single line of code in their lives and I think that gives beginners the false impression that you can just be taught to write software from a school and you don't need to actually go into it with any prior experience. But look at art or music schools. Can you imagine going to into a university music program and say \"Ok, now how do I play this instrument?\" Thats would be crazy. No respectable school would take such a student. > I keep seeing beginners (and even some experienced devs) struggle because they jump straight into writing code without fully understanding the problem. No, they struggle because they are impatient and expect to be able to do more than is reasonable for a beginner. I think I was lucky to come up in the time where I didn't have many people to compare myself to. I was just tinkering and exploring without any real demand to produce a complete, working, bug free product.",

In third grade in 1993 or so, there was a book in the school library that was about programming BASIC on the computer. Basic is such, well, a basic language that it read so much like english and i could just, as a 3rd grader without a compuer, read the book and follow the programming examples, and I picked up basic programming just by doing that, just as if one reads a book about math and learns math.I mean how simple is:10 PRINT \"What is your name?\" 20 INPUT $NAME 30 PRINT \"Hello, \" + $NAMEI didn't even know until a year later in 4th grade that the home computer we had had basic installed on it (QBasic specifically) and I could actually write these programs. By then just by reading the book i understanded it as simple as basic algebra.You really do have to start with spending some time reading code and trying to make out what it does before you jump in. It's not so much about what the code is, but 'why' the code is. What is this code trying to do? Why did they write it that was as opposed to some other way you have seen? Each time you ask yourself one of these questions youre filling in the actual foundation of 'getting it'. Actually trying to write the syntax is just applying that knowledge.",

Coding agents cut out the lower rungs of the ladder and now you need those skills from the get go. Your knowledge of software design, system design, understanding of product development and life cycle, the thinking and the vision and where your value now lies as an ai assisted software engineer. I am investing my time into getting comfortable with agentic engineering, ramping up my system design knowledge, software patterns, technology and system solutions to common problems - everything that I need to know when AI is bullshitting me, when it is heading in the wrong direction, what are viable options etc. The profession is changing, and being able to wrangle syntax alone is no longer enough.So, I would say it is not about being ai resistant, it is more about being ai effective.

For me personally, the best way to learn is to first make a prototype, with only one goal: make it work somehow. Disregard best practices, design patterns and advanced algorithms. You'll end up with a poorly performing mess, but that's okay. You have all the pieces. Now make it clean. Refactor to a solid structure that is maintainable and flexible. And finally make it fast. Optimize, profile, and optimize again. Most people burn out, trying to get everything right on the first attempt. It's important to keep the passion alive, and keep focused on one thing at a time.",

Start with core Python concepts: syntax, classes, functions. But then I’d recommend learning about SOLID/Clean architecture and use it to build an API project for practice. Separate things into application, services, domain, and repo layers. Learn how to apply abstractions with protocols and ABCs, and injecting with FastAPI depends(). Start with just a REPL app if you must while you get the core structure, then evolve into fastAPI. (You can just write to a json file until you get a DB connected) But I’d look into fastAPI, sqlalchemy for ORM, Alembic for migrations, pydantic for serialization and DTOs. Etc. You have a lot to learn with Python alone. Could also throw in unit testing with pytest, also start thinking about docker, see if you can get a dockerfile + compose to spin up your app in one container and Postgres in another (I’d recommend focus on Postgres). It’s a lot if you want to go full stack with Python. It’s also not like C# where repo and unit if work patterns are implemented for you. So start getting comfortable with repository and unit of work design patterns.",

So that you learn these technologies in that 6-8 month timeframe. Be sure to ask AI to consider your ____ degree and your skills self assessment when it builds this roadmap.

Stick to the scheduled hours, and don’t study anything else until you finish the roadmap.7.

Also, I think someone once explained to me that there are cases where you may not want to run 'git add \\*', but I don't remember what they are or why.Sometimes, if I need to pause a task and switch to something else, I'll do:`git add *` `git commit -m 'WIP pause'` `git checkout main`From there, I'll create a new branch for whatever the other task I need to work on is in the same pattern as above.

People like you do not send your CVs, LinkedIns, Githubs, etc. Or they hesitate a lot before they start applying to places.Then there are people who do send but visibly are not confident during the interview. I do not mean that one should start lying and exaggerating things but I mean, be confident in what you know and in what you do not know. \"Yeah, I do not know frontend development but I'm considering learning it.\" or \"I'm a backend developer but having to do frontend tasks seems to be a good challenge.\" I have told these. Not during interviews but during 1:1s when I was moved to a fullstack position. And my boss was fine. Because she saw that I actually show an interest in improving myself. If I would be \"I'm worried about frontend tasks. I really hope I will not get any of these. Backend tasks are much safer bet.\" then that would be bad. Lack of confidence, no wish to grow, perhaps even stagnation.Then lack of confidence when being on probation period. Cool, you got hired! You passed all these interviews. But the next 2-5 (however long time period) months are also critical. Either you pass the probation period or the company has to tell that \"Sorry. We considered it but we do not see how things will progress from here.\" Perhaps different countries have different laws and such, but where I live, a person is put on a \"test period\" of a couple of months before his contract is finalized (meanwhile the contract is temporary). So, some juniors, they are not confident. They do not ask questions. They do not share their thoughts. They do not participate in discussions over new tasks and such. They get stuck and do not voice it out. They start comparing themselves with younger colleagues who have been in the field for longer time, then get some irrational fears, and let it affect themselves even more negatively.What I'm trying to say: this field indeed is difficult. But one should be confident in himself. Have a growth mindset. When you see you are lacking in something do not see it as a weakness but see it as an opportunity to learn new things. When you see that people are more experienced and more skilled than you then do not see this as a threat but as an opportunity to learn from them.",

You need to be comfortable building the logic from first principles, slowly and methodically.One pattern I see is people practicing by consuming solutions instead of reconstructing them. If you redo those exact problems, try this approach: write out the data structures on paper first. For tic tac toe, what does state actually look like? Array of 9? Whose turn is it? How do you detect a win? Force yourself to describe it in plain language before touching the keyboard.Also, simulate the constraint. Set a timer. Disable autocomplete. No AI. No tabs. It will feel bad at first. That discomfort is the training.The fact that you knew “in theory” what to do is actually promising. It means the gap is translation under pressure, not total ignorance.

Theres no holistic understanding of how to apply it all. I was there too. Guess what helped... Build shit.A learner needs to put it all together to make something work, it involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller actionable steps. Pseudocode can come in handy here where ou focus on the flow and shape of the code without worrying about methods and built-in functions. Once you have a plan then you can go into details.For example, lets build a lasagna. Ok, how tf do i do that, break it down into smaller pieces, stuggling, then google the steps, find out, look for solutions. Ok so we need 3 parts to build this, a meat sauce, bechamel sauce, and lasagna sheets. Cool cool how do i make the fucking meat sauce bro and wtf is bechamel... Google it, search, look for answers. Ok sweet so i need the following for a simple meat sauce but how do i put it together... Google it, search for answers....its all an interative process.

        "body": "Professional software developer here, and I agree with everything you've said. Building on your post, here's an analogy from my own experience that I think supports your point:I learned to write code before I learned to cook. I was equally interested/enamored by each of these skills when I first started to learn them.One of the first things I learned to cook was [stir fried chicken with rice noodles][stir-fry]. For at least a month, I made this dish several times per week. This repetition afforded me space to observe and learn - I noticed when the color of some ingredients started to change in the cooking utensil (an observation I wasn't previously able to make). I started adding other ingredients to the dish because I had learned some intuition (which gave me confidence that even if my didn't turn out great, it wouldn't be terrible) over repeated exposure. Slowly, I was able to rely on visual cues without needing to set a timer (\"hey! the broccoli is starting to look like it's cooked\" instead of \"it's coming up on 3min, time turn down the heat\"). This is how I learned how to cook and how to understand what I was seeing on the stove. Prior to this, I had watched many cooking shows/videos and family and friends had even tried to show/teach me - all of this was \"tutorial hell\" and I never felt like I knew what I was doing. One lesson from this experience is that \"know what you're doing\" doesn't come before you build something for the first time. It's actually the other way around - you learn by doing stuff. When I say that, I am reminded of providing tech support for my grandma. She'd always be afraid that she was going to accidentally break something. This is a real concern with programming languages - you could potentially delete files or crash your OS through some bug. But starter/learning projects rarely expose you to that functionality. If you're still afraid, consider using a virtual machine. It wasn't until I read this post, OP, that I made the connection between this cooking practice and something else I did when I was learning to write code (back in 2007 - I'm old, I guess). After I first learned python, I would often (and for no real reason other than \"I like to write code\") write a decimal to binary function in python. Sometimes it would take me a long time to write (30min was not uncommon), sometimes I'd write it in a few minutes. The point was never to write it quickly to \"beat my personal record\". The point was always to practice this new skill. Sometimes I'd write it recursively, sometimes I'd try something different.But this repeated practice did for me, the same thing that repeatedly cooking the stir fry did. I was able to study different ways of solving the same problem and hone my understanding of how python works. Now, I didn't write my decimal to binary converter every day - I think the most frequently I did this was \"once a week\" for a few weeks (then, about once a month, and I eventually started to use it to test whether I liked a new keyboard). At the time for me, it was like re-reading my favorite passage out of my favorite fiction book (the was before Netflix, so that might translate today as \"rewatching my favorite episode of a TV show\").That's really the secret sauce - practice for familiarity. When I use LLMs today, the value for me is that the LLM writes the code. The time savings for me comes from not having to physically type out the code. The thinking that goes into it beforehand (what architecture to use, what algorithm to use, what data structures to use, how to model the data flow and problem solving, etc; If I haven't yet made these decisions, I have a conversation with the LLM to help me decide) - I communicate all of that to the LLM and let it do very little beyond writing the code I described.It does feel counterintuitive that learning to write code requires as much time and practice, because this learning time is often compared to learning other skills that require more time and practice to acquire and gain proficiency in. The key realization is that while learning to write code is faster than (say) learning to become a neurosurgeon, it still takes a lot (nowhere near zero) of time and effort. And while the proficiency threshold to make a meaningful contribution is lower than in many other professions, that threshold is not a plateau - the proficiency curve does go a lot higher and I think this might be one reason why beginners often get a wide range of feedback (from experienced developers with a wide range of proficiency levels)Ok I took a couple of rambling tangents (sorry, it's Sunday afternoon), but the takeaways are:1. repeated exposure and practice are the key to escaping tutorial hell1. the proficiency threshold to \"build something\" is much lower to escape tutorial hell than it is to (for example) contribute to an existing project in a professional or opensource capacity1. the probability of accidentally making a catastrophic error is very low1. the notion that repeated exposure improves proficiency is not new (my cooking story), thought that's maybe more of a \"hard truth\" than a \"comforting fact\" as I had originally intended it to be[stir-fry]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8f752SdeAI",

In my opinion the idea of “build something” makes you consider how *you* might build a thing, not follow someone else’s methodology. It’s possible the thing you want to build has never been built before or at least hasn’t been built before the way you want to. So you need to go out and find info about how to build the pieces and parts that you can, and extrapolate and experiment with the rest until it works the way you want. Along the way you have to make a myriad of decisions that will all teach you about architecture or storage or performance or what have you. For me, this is the actual work of learning programming.edit: spelling.",

The \"just build stuff\" advice sounds vague until you realize it is really about forcing your brain to confront edge cases and tradeoffs that tutorials conveniently smooth over. Watching someone explain OOP is one thing, but debugging your own messy class structure at 1am hits very different.I would add that building also exposes you to constraints. Performance, bad inputs, unclear requirements. That is where intuition starts forming because you are not just applying a pattern, you are seeing when it breaks. That feedback loop is hard to simulate with passive learning.The only caveat is some people jump into building without enough basics and just feel overwhelmed. There is probably a balance where you learn a bit, build a bit, reflect, then repeat. But overall I agree, the \"aha\" moments rarely happen while watching a video.",

Figure out the mouse works and screen regions, callbacks, etc. You’ll abandon this but you gained insight into what’s going on. All of that mouse info is tracked in real frameworks. Be aware of it and use it.Now start higher languages. Try some procedural and some functional. You’ll start to like one. Next, learn threads and asynchronous coding. Wrap your head around the different ways languages and systems handle threads and how not to shoot yourself in the foot.In parallel with learning threads, learn I/O, bottlenecks, buffering, streams, etc., combining these with threads and async code. Do extreme tests and see how quickly you can process insanely large files. How many large files in parallel? How about millions of small files?Then there is database connectivity. Combine the async IO stuff and now start getting structured. Learn file types, how to process them, filter them, project to new types, get things in and out of databases. What kind of database works for different problem sets?At this point, you can good job in most shops.To take things next level, learn AI and machine learning. Learn the problems they solve and how to implement them. This will give you insight into where the industry will be.So the chain is understanding data. Data turns into knowledge. Knowledge turns into wisdom. Turning data into knowledge means identifying patterns. These patterns are timeless, like identifying faces in a photo, or are a time series like identifying engaged customers based on purchase history. 15 years ago pattern identification was costly and hard. It has since turned into toolset. We can identify more and more patterns now. And this isn’t going to slow down any time soon.",

The use of a contiguous memory layout, as well as enforcement of homogenous contents, are both secondary aspects of what makes something an array. An array is an ordered data structure which has (close to) constant time access to its contents by index. It’s better to think of these data structures in terms of the performance guarantees they provide for different operations than to try to focus on their implementations. Implementations can involve all sorts of hairy performance optimizations which obscure the intent of the data structure.The weird thing about JS arrays, and ArrayList objects compared to something like C or Java’s primitive arrays, is that they allow the data structure’s size to efficiently dynamically grow. The other weird thing about JS arrays is that they can be sparse, but that’s something you hopefully will never have to deal with. To be pedantic, it’s pretty common for arrays to “hold” heterogenous contents in languages other than JS. I use scare quotes because arrays of objects generally don’t hold objects themselves, but rather pointers to those objects. In languages with subtyping (like Java) the pointers may indeed point to multiple different types of objects as long as they are all subclasses of the array’s declared generic argument. A typed language like Java thus allows arrays to hold heterogenous data, but requires you to access the data as though it is homogenous (unless you use an unsafe downcast). Dynamically typed languages like JS and Python are more permissive, but it’s (IMO) a difference of degree, not a difference of kind.",

The important part is the \"sequential\" part. You can look things up by index, and the items appear in predictable slots. Contrast with an \"associative array\" (no analogue in vanilla C, `Map` (and arguably `{}`) in JS, `Map` in Java). These are non-sequential. You look up by key, not by index.

And this *can* be used as an Array Data **Structure** if you want to, but it can also be used as a lot of other Abstract Data Structures, e.g. a **List**, a **Stack**, a **Queue**, and even a **Map** (or Dict) as long as you limit yourself to using integers as keys.

        "body": "> Is it more important that arrays are index-based by their definition more than it is important that they are homogeneous?Sort of, but I think you might also want to unwind your idea of homogeneity a bit. In Javascript, everything is pretty much the [Any type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_type), which in other languages may be called things like `Object` or `interface{}` or `void*`. So it's entirely expressible as a type, and as such the array is homogenously `array[Any]` or however you'd want to express the type.The other thing is that pretty much any language has some affordance for creating some sort of union, which you can then use in arrays. It will vary how ergonomic and error-prone it is, but in any case you can cook up an array of data that holds heterogenous base types.As in, you can define some union of integers and floats and put that in an array, which will be homogenous in that it only accepts that union and rejects stuff like strings, objects, etc; at the same time it'll be heterogenous in that you'll need to have some way of knowing which of the types in the union a given entry is.So the idea of homo/heterogeneity can be misleading,* because any sort of collection will always be homogenous if it's well-typed: all the elements in some collection `C[T]` are of type `T`* but may still be heterogenous in terms of base types: `T` may be a union of `T1 | T2 | …`",

Modern engines like V8 actually do optimize them into contiguous memory when you use them \"normally\" (same type, no gaps), but the language spec doesn't guarantee it.The CS definition of array is about the memory layout. JS just borrowed the name and the bracket syntax. Don't overthink the taxonomy though — what matters practically is that they're ordered, indexed, and have O(1) access by index in most engines. TypeScript helps bridge the gap by letting you enforce homogeneous arrays at the type level.",

The *class* only *describes*/*defines* the general setup, while the *object* fills it with data.There is another thing to consider: The implementation of OOP differs vastly between programming languages to the point that it is not even directly comparable (just take JavaScript, Python, and Java - completely different implementations of OOP). 1. In terms of programming an object is an instance of a class. - It's the *data/state* (fields/attributes/members) coupled with the *behavior* (methods) of a specific class (type).2. The binary data is scattered - the methods are stored in one place, and in one place only, no matter how many objects you create. The *state* (fields, attributes, members) are stored somewhere else, typically, but not necessarily, in contiguous memory blocks, individually for each object (apart from the exception of `static` members that also only exist once in memory). This is a very efficient approach as the data is usually a lot less than the methods.3. It is not actually that different. In some languages even structs can have methods - so the line blurs depending on the language. In a way, structs (as the structs in C) are the predecessor of classes.4. Methods are functions that belong to a class - it's basically just terminology. When a programmer talks about *functions* they mean *unbound functions* that exist outside the context of OO. When they talk about *methods*, they always talk about \"functions\" that are bound to classes and that only exist in the context of OO.The difference between function and method is: `len(string)` vs. `string.length()` - the former is a function that exists outside the context of classes and objects, but can accept an object, and the latter is a method that exists in the context of the `string` instance of a class.It's like \"please draw me a fish\" (\"draw\" being the function and \"fish\" being the argument) and \"fish, please draw yourself\" (\"fish\" being the object and \"draw yourself\" being the method called).",

        "body": "I don't know Rust, but I know C++, so I'll explain it in that syntax, but the concepts are universal.I warn you that if you look at objects too low level, the concept itself dissolves. Consider: class person { int weight, height, age; public: void jump(int how_high), run(int how_far); };In memory - whether it's on the stack or the heap, it going to lay out in memory per byte something like: [w][w][w][w][h][h][h][h][a][a][a][a]This is the same as if it were a structure. Objects are programming concepts - when you get down to the machine, it's all bytes - bytes for data, bytes for addresses, bytes for offsets, bytes for instructions...As for the functions, that gets compiled into the program binary, just like any other function. The syntax dissolves at the assembly level - to call the interface, you have to build a stack frame and push your parameters. One of the parameters is going to be the location of the object instance in memory - the hidden `this` pointer. So just as you have to push how high to jump, you also need to push who is doing the jumping. Again - the machine just sees program instruction sequences - bytes, and more bytes, and more bytes.Yes, you can directly replicate what the compiler is going to generate for you with a `struct` and a function that takes a pointer, but why? The syntax is there to facilitate what you already want to do in a more concise manner.But also, programming constructs are MORE than just syntax. C++, Rust, ANY language is more than just a high level assembly. The language defines the confines of what these things are, and the compiler is allowed to exploit everything else. In other words, stated more concretely - C++ has a SHITTON of Undefined Behavior, it's kind of notorious for it, but that's a GOOD thing, because everything the language doesn't say, the compiler can exploit for optimization. We want as much of that as possible, and then we can wrap those dicy corners with the standard library so you don't have to deal with it directly.The hard part is cultural - getting people to use the facilities provided and stop writing raw imperative code that gets them into trouble.> What is an object in terms of programming? An object is a user defined type, that models behavior, by encapsulating state, to protect it's invariant.So an `std::vector` is always implemented in terms of 3 pointers. The invariant is that those pointers are ALWAYS well defined. There is no intermediate state that YOU the client can ever observe. You also don't actually know how the vector is implemented, and you don't have direct access. You defer to the vector to enforce its invariant, and it's behavior is well defined through its interface. When you hand program control to the vector, it can suspend it's own invariant - say, to reallocate, but that invariant is reestablished before it returns control.So objects have a certain level of autonomy and agency. They know what to do, they don't need you to tell them how to do their job. It's why you employ classes in the first place, because that encapsulation keeps your program more correct and consistent.> How does the binary data and the methods in the class get managed at low level? Does the data get scattered in one place? Or it's just managed by pointers? Frankly it doesn't matter. No programming language gets that specific, because it's not portable.> How is an instance of a class that has no methods in it different from a struct type variable?Technically there is no different. Idiomatically, a class models behavior, and a struct is a tagged tuple. It's a conventional difference in meaning. Classes make for terrible structures. A car has some state, about the position of keys, dials, doors, etc, and the interface will open and close things, speed up and slow down... But NONE of that is dependent upon the make, model, or year. Those are variables that are independent. The same car can go by different names and makes. Is that a Subaru BRZ or a Scion FRS? Trick question, they're the exact same car made in the exact same factory as a joint project between the two companies.So if anything, you bundle your car model with it's pedantic properties in some sort of tagged tuple or relational or table structure.> How is a method different from a function that does some operations based on different values of its properties?At that low level, there isn't a difference. But any language and implementation can make the difference more significant. A free function and a public structure, you can do anything you want, and while you can do everything strict and correct, there's nothing preventing me from writing my own function that fucks everything. A class with a method? You're encapsulating state and enforcing an invariant.",

You're doing great. But keep in mind that I myself started at 13, and there are people out there who started later than me and are way, way better developers. Starting early has many benefits, but learning programming takes time (and never stops!), depending on how you spend it, you become better faster or slower. The point I want to make is, you should focus more on your skills than on your age.You're very ambitious and motivated, great, keep that and you will reach the goals you mentioned. Other than that, great work so far, keep learning!",

There are some things that you might wind up doing differently over time, especially in bigger projects. Which is to say, they can be considered overengineering for a program of this size & scope, but overengineering otherwise small programs can also be a decent way to learn about those engineering practices.*Avoiding \"magic\" numbers*: Your `else` case for the difficulty rating is meant to result in `easy` mode, but this can drift apart. If you decide to give `easy` mode 4 tries for example, then you need to update that number in two spots. There are a couple of ways around that, like storing the numbers in constants, e.g. `const int EASY_MODE_TRIES = 3;` and then using the constant rather than the literal number, and/or having an extra parsing step where you wind up doing something like an extra function that ends on `else { cout << \"Something…\"; return EASY; }`, returning something like an `enum` of the valid difficulty ratings, or even a struct. Error handling and parsing user input can be kind of big topics with lots of options.But generally, magic numbers are a hazard for code maintenance, because it very often turns into questions like \"why is it _this_ number? can I change it? what happens if I do?\" and some constants with names and rationales go a long way to alleviate that.*More functions*: Generally we break code up into what's hopefully logical chunks. Often to avoid repetition, but also sometimes just to break up long reams of code into something more like a condensed sequence of subtasks. Opinions vary on how long a function should be allowed to get. My opinion is something like trying to be able to fit the entire function on the screen (but also not trying to bend over backwards to follow the rule), which I think is a fairly common middle-of-the-road opinion.There are also a whole bunch of C++ concepts and best practices that you'll kind of have to pick up over time; one that may be good to get you to look into as soon as possible is \"[const correctness](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness)\".",

Why is `` included? Because if you didn't, the code wouldn't compile, because `time()` is missing. Right? In this way, the code speaks for itself. // Convert difficulty input to lowercase (so EASY, Easy, easy all work)See? This isn't a bad comment, though you could tighten it up. The important thing is to not tell us what the code tells us, because here's the thing - typically such comments and code disagree. So who's the authority? Which is right? The code? Or the comment?One thing your comments are doing is making up for a lack of functions. You're lacking expressiveness, and so you're trying to name what you're doing with the comment. Perhaps your next lesson will introduce functions to you, and this will dry up. std::transform(difficulty.begin(), difficulty.end(), difficulty.begin(), ::tolower);There is a bug here. It's really technical and subtle, and I don't fully understand it myself, but the [reference documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/tolower.html) warns you this is unsafe, that you need to write a function that casts your character type to `int`. random_num = rand() % max_num + 1;This is the same in every branch of your difficulty condition. Just hoist it out and write this code once, after the condition block. std::getline(std::cin, guess); // Take guess as string user_guess = std::stoi(guess); // Convert string to integerToo many steps! Streams know how to extract integers! Your problem is interleaving extraction with line grabbing.The rules of extraction are:1) Ignore leading whitespace2) Start grabbing characters3) Stop at some delimiter character. Leave the delimiting character behind, in the stream.The rules for line grabbing are:1) Grab characters one at a time2) Stop when you find the delimiter character, discarding it.So imagine first extracting an `int` - something like `\" 123\\n\"; the stream purges the leading whitespace, grabs \"123\" and leaves \"\\n\" behind. Now you line grab, and what happens? We grab \"\\n\", which is our delimiter, and we stop.So the thing to do is know when you're switching between the two, and `ignore` the newline as necessary. int x; std::string s; std::cin >> x; std::cin.ignore(); // Purge after extraction, before getline std::getline(std::cin, s); std::getline(std::cin, s); std::cin >> x; // No purge necessary after getlineAnother thing you should be doing is checking your streams. A stream is implemented as a \"user defined type\", which are made from `class`, `struct`, `enum`, and `union`. One of the things you can do is \"overload\" almost any of the language operators. That's how `operator >>` and `operator <<` - the bit shift operators, are made to work as stream extraction and insertion - they're written as functions that work with stream types. And when you learn to make your own types, you can write your own stream operators for them without having to modify the stream class itself - the pattern is extensible.Continued...",

I don't really care if I learn anything from the tutorial or not, and the application doesn't really matter, except that it has to use (some of) the same libraries that I intend to learn.Then I convert one of my old projects to this new stack - e.g. I have so many CRUD backend and frontend applications, that I know all the ins and outs of, so I try to re-implement one of them. Looking at my old code in one editor, implementing features one after another in another editor, and every time I get stuck, I look for either documentation, stack overflow answers or even tutorials for that single part. I like to learn a lot allround about the new stack at first, and then only when something strikes me as interesting or different, I might take a deep dive into that, but I don't want to learn every single detail one step at a time - as most documentations otherwise seem to suggest.I have a few \"basic\" projects that I always implement, like a \"guess which number I'm thinking of\" game, a small shoot'em up game, a simple text-adventure, and a CRUD frontend as well as backend, and pick whichever looks most like what I want to build in this new language.Once I've reimplemented the old project, I begin my new, actual project, what I intended to use the new stack for - first by planning the features required, and which ones I already know how to implement based on my reimplementation, and which ones I have to learn more about - and then I learn about those things in depth if needed!",

In the petrified entity renderer I had to use Forge’s API in order to get the model from some render buffer somewhere. It then takes the model and applies a stone texture for rendering.However I quickly discovered a burial bug that occurs. If there is an actual instance of the target entity being rendered on screen at the same time as a petrified entity of the same entity, then any animations that played on the living one played on the petrified entity model. That obviously looks a little weird.I determined the cause of this was the fact the function I was calling to get the model wasn’t new model and was a shared reference or a shallow copy of a model. Now this were a copy constructor would have been very handy, but it didn’t seem to have one nor did the model class have the copy method implemented. I ended up writing this kinda ugly piece of code using reflections to solve it. It only needs to run once as it caches the model, so it isn’t too bad performance wise, but the code is ugly. A copy constructor or similar would have been super handy.",

        "body": "First thing to know: there's no such thing as a copy constructor in the Java language. It's not a built-in concept. It's just a common pattern for doing stuff. If you have a constructor, and use it to create a new Whatever that should be just like some other Whatever, that's a copy constructor. The Java language does have a related and more built-in thing, which is called \"Cloneable,\" but you can and should mostly ignore it.What exactly is a copy constructor? It's any constructor for class Whatever that takes a parameter of another Whatever and tries to make this new Whatever exactly like the other Whatever.When should I actually use it in real code? Whenever you want there to be a new thing that is a separate thing from another thing but has the same value. \"Make a copy of this thingy\" is a very common, basic operation in a lot of situations.what problem does a copy constructor solve? It lets you make copies. There are lots of ways to solve that problem, and copy constructors are one of them. Other ways involve factory methods, cloneable, and just creating a new thing and setting all of its properties with setters() for the new thing and getters() for the old thing.",

Some objects really do need to run some code to make a valid copy, because they internally manage some resource. As a simple example, consider a list. The list object itself usually doesn't directly contain its elements. It contains some kind of reference to separate memory which stores the elements. That memory is a resource it has to manage. Stuff like allocate new memory when you insert elements, free the memory when the list itself is being destroyed, etc.If you were to just create a bitwise copy of the list object, now you'd have two list objects, which are expected to manage the same memory, probably not knowing that the other one exists. This would lead to some serious memory safety bugs. What you actually need to do, when you want to create a real copy is to run some code that allocates the new memory for the second list, and copies over the elements. That *some code* is the copy constructor.",

When you take more ownership of projects you naturally end up dealing more with non-technical people on one end and junior engineers on the other. You have to learn to architect systems and break down work such that you can take the harder problems yourself and set your juniors up for success while also being responsive to your users.Another way to look at it is that junior and mid level engineers get their work from senior engineers while senior engineers have a more active role in defining the work. You have to do that in such a way that you carve out safe rails for junior engineers to work along and good bones to respond to often chaotic business needs. Don’t discount the degree to which that will strengthen you technically.It sounds like you are an experienced mid level engineer but a pure focus on directly improving your own technical skill will hold you back. Counterintuitively, you will grow more technically at this point in your career by taking on more of an ownership/leadership role with your people and learning to apply your technical skills to power everyone up.",

Don't identify problems that aren't really problems. For instance, if the code base is full of cruft and you say \"the code is bad and I'd like to clean it up, let me lead a team for 6 months to rewrite it\" then you're just stepping on toes.Instead, be ready to show the ROI and to show you've thought through the hard parts of what you propose and already have a feasible solution.One of the first things I did when transitioning to lead was identify a problem with our database. Every day we got an automated data feed, which triggered a program that dropped a large table, did a bulk data import, reindexed it, and ran a bunch of queries. Almost like clockwork, the DBMS would fall to its knees and one or more senior people would do a little fire drill, 45 minutes wasted every day. They were just used to it and couldn't think outside the box. I did a proof of concept that did everything totally differently and placed almost no load on the DBMS, studiously avoiding any hint that the people who came up with the original system were idiots, and my project was adopted with me as the implementer. My star at that company rose significantly because they could see I could be entrusted with more than run-of-the-mill tasks.",

So my recommendation is that: stop trying to figure it out by yourself and start the Odin project or free code camp and start seeing results. You will make it.",

Or sorting the set (not really a purely mathematical thing, but needed for certain algorithm such as a binary search).I don't know if that is the issue, but your \"mathemetician\" statement stood out to me.",

And at that point basic DSA and other stuff you've learned may look like kindergarten knowledge to you but from most lectures I've attended I can tell you that the base is absolutely crucial. If you can figure out the proper data structure(s) for your system/sub-system, the algorithms will follow without you having to explicitly design anything beyond business logic operations. And one of the most important statements I've learned is that whenever you're building something - a small project, a system, a library, an api, etc. think of it as \"Everything is a __\" where the __ is basically a morphable entity that you design from scratch. And the entire system can essentially be considered a single unit of that entity, even though it's made out of the same entity in smaller scales. This is where programming paradigms help alot. For example in Java, everything is an object. What is an object? For that you must know the details of OOP - which is just another programming paradigm. I can recommend https://roadmap.sh/ for a quick progress tracker as it covers the majority of this sphere.Lastly, having a mathematical mind is crucial to programming, because getting desired results from any given problem through programming can be achievable via brute force in the worst situations. But solving a problem in an optimized manner requires a ton of math and math oriented thinking. Because taking shortcuts and cutting corners is what makes your code precise and fast. This is where your knowledge of DSA can be applied in smaller scales - competitive programming problems from sites like Leetcode are extremely helpful and will give you a good grasp of what to do in most situations.",

Like I never became particularly comfortable with Matlab, but if nobody did, it wouldn't be so common. Similarly I just get a headache from [LabVIEW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW), but someone I studied with only became comfortable with programming once they could use that.Programming is just breaking down problems until the sub-problems are of such a size that you know how to handle them, or can figure it out or even look it up. Sometimes the tooling available feels a bit like using a pair of wrong-handed scissors, some languages feel like they're full of [cow tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_tools), and that feeling will vary across people. That's part of why we have different programming languages.It is usually possible to become competent at some language that has low compatibility with the programmer, but I suspect most would rather avoid those languages and use those they feel comfortable with. In your case, that'd mean focusing on Matlab and Python and trying to avoid C and C++—and Matlab absent, that'd be a pretty common attitude among programmers.",

Outside of getting a degree in CS, that has always been the most helpful, since it both keeps me busy and gives me something to gauge my learning by.If it helps, here was my road. I didn’t have a map for my programming career initially, but I’ve learnt that adapting is the best strategy for my own path. I wasn’t familiar with computer science at all growing up, despite having a father who was a programmer. I tried to go to college but dropped out to protect my grades. Then I worked at Lowe’s for a time. While there, I bought a game on steam that taught Python. Overnight, I fell in love with coding. I took a year and taught myself how to code in Python through learnpython.org. I also gave myself the framework of making a fully-Python-based game engine (which I still haven’t finished), so that I could learn how the language worked. Now I’m back at the university learning coding. I took the required course on C++ and also researched ahead on some C++ concepts before they were taught, such as C++ classes and templating. Now I have practiced with C++ for over a year and am working on my own language. So all that to say we each have different roads and different ways of navigating through life.If you think you’re an imposter, you don’t have as much of a right to feel that way as I do, since I’m so late to the game and my life has more twists and turns than yours has. And I don’t feel that, because I’d rather give myself purpose and structure than to feel like I’m useless. If it helps you, a programmer should be able to find their own purpose when they seemingly have none. That is what is required in order for a programmer to come up with the software they make.",

That's why we have project management and software engineers/architects.So, when you wrote your code, you had no idea what you would need in a few months.Since you never defined what you needed, and when, you have no deadlines, so we tend to spend too much time doing micro-improvments that don't bring real value: balance issue.#### My solutionDo actual project management to plan what you code upfront. You can use Github Project, Trello, Notion, Jira, IceScrum or sheet of paper.Write nice-to-have and optional and keep them in mind when you code. It does not mean doing a lot of abstraction \"just in case\".This will already help a lot.Now, don't refactor until absolutely needed to add a feature. You should not have to refactor a lot if you did the first part correctly.Sometimes 1-2 workarounds are fine, everything does not need to be perfect all the time. Wait until the workaround causes more issues that it solves.Finally, from time to time, allow yourself a review of your project. List the pain points, bottlenecks, ... and plan refactors. It's better because:- you need time between the time you wrote the code and its refactor- you need to move forward. The refactor today is not the same as tomorrow's",

        "body": "\"Refactoring\" isn't a magical tool that'll fix bad code - I honestly don't get why it is being taught like that, or even why someone would think that.Refactoring is simply a set of tools that you can use to more or less automatically restructure your code, if you want it to be written in a different way, like if you have one big function you want to split up in multiple different ones, if you want to rename variables, or change the input-parameters of a function across all uses. That is what refactoring is - it isn't something you can wave around that solves your weird memory-allocation scheme into something more professional.Anyways - first you plan how the code should be structured, you probably need to diagram something for this, as you won't be able to remember. You plan which classes you need, and which methods they should contain, what those methods should receive and return, and so on. You decide if some methods should perhaps be closer together in a single class, to keep coherence high, and you decide if some should receive fewer data-structures (or objects) to keep coupling loose ...Also, you make sure that you have valid tests that can run for both the un-refactored and the refactored code - if not, you write them along the way.Also, create a new branch for all this work, as you'll without a doubt break something!Then you begin - usually the steps are somewhat like this, but there's never a perfect recipe:1. Split functions and methods up into smaller parts2. Create additional classes and connect them3. Move functions / methods to their new classes4. Change globally available variables to locally where needed5. Change method parameters and/or return values - perhaps introduce new objects to be received and returned.Between each step you test, and once the tests pass, you commit - then go on to the next step.That is basically the way. Refactoring *never* makes the code \"better\" or \"faster\" from the computer's point of view - it is usually still the exact same lines of code that runs, but they are structured better from the programmers' point of view, so that they'll have an easier time implementing new features and changing functionality!",

Yeah, your existing code is shit, it's even got bugs, but it's a known quantity. What you're suggesting is all new code, that accomplishes the same goals as the old code, and it's unproven. Remember that the customer doesn't see the code. You mean you want to take 6 months to deliver... the exact same thing as what we already have?> Like i dont know if i have some kind of RoadBlock but for me when you already have \"working\" Code but you know you can refactor it to make it better, faster, etc. it just seems like starting from Scratch feeling :(> Also i gotta be honest i really often do not know where to begin even >.> Second, the human mind is conservative. We HATE loss, so we're susceptible to things like the sunk cost fallacy. So to save some of the cost you've put into this code base, to minimize your losses, you try to make a minimal change. It's usually not robust enough to be a total solution, it's a hack or bandaid. One or two can be forgivable, but they add up quickly.> But yea anyone got any Advice for dealing with these Huge Tasks of either Refactoring or Rewriting Large Chunks of your Code >.>Third, this is the difference between juniors and seniors. I have 37 years of mistakes to inform my design decisions without having to consciously think about it - that's called intuition. This may be new code, but I've already made up my mind about it 20 years ago, when I had to learn that one thing the hard way... So refactoring is so hard because your system is too tightly coupled and does not tolerate refactoring. All software systems have their limitations, nothing is infinitely extensible or refactorable or perfectly decoupled. The difference is how far you can go before it starts looking like bandaids or hits the hard wall that you need a redesign.One form of refactoring is short-sighted, where what you have is \"over-fit\" (borrowing from my data analyst wife), too tightly coupled, not flexible or extensible, it only does exactly what it was designed to do, and how. So what you end up doing is redesigning the thing with YET ANOTHER over-fit solution.Another form of refactoring is well seasoned. You design with flexibility in mind. This can be a hard sell even in the industry, because it can seem pointless at the time if the others think this is a well understood and fixed area. So good code is actually needlessly decoupled, because you end up tripping over it eventually, and you'll be glad you have that flexibility built in. It's stupid until you end up needing it. It's extra and unnecessary complexity until you end up needing it. It's needlessly expensive (premature optimization) until you both need it and discover the performance didn't matter here, anyway.And that's a dangerous one - performance, people will die on that hill, but then you become over-dependent on the performance of that segment to makeup for the failings of other, \"justified\", sloppy and expensive code. Well now you have to break this thing, and you lose the performance, and it's not itself a big deal, but it does expose the weaknesses of other code. And rather than fixing it, there's more bias to ignore it and blame other parts, put the burden on them to make up for it.---Continued...",

Many tutors and computer science professors have already developed an algorithmic mindset, so they often dive straight into teaching specific languages and syntax. In doing so, they sometimes overlook the root of the challenge: learning how to think like a coder.In my opinion, when you're a beginner facing a programming problem, you should first grab a blank sheet of paper and ask yourself: 'How can I break this down like a cooking recipe?'For example, if I asked you to write a function that returns a boolean based on whether a number is prime, you could map it out like this:>Function isPrime(n):>If n≤1 then:>return False>If n=2 then:>return True>If n is even then:>return False>For i from 3 to SquareRoot(n) with a step of 2:>If i divides n then:>return False>EndFor>return TrueOnce you’ve done that and you’re confident in your logic, go ahead and write the code in the language you're learning. If you get stuck on the syntax, just look it up. Remember: syntax is just a matter of practice and habit. The real hurdle is training your brain to think algorithmically.It might seem a bit silly to use pen and paper for a simple function like this, but I promise you that after a few weeks, you’ll develop a real knack for deconstructing problems. After that, you'll be free to focus entirely on reading and writing the code itself.",

You cant jump straight to making the thing that requires a jig without even knowing what they are or how to make them or when you need to make themYou only learn to make those things by solving smaller things and noticing patterns between those smaller things and then trying to optimize a little by making something that helps with those smaller thingsThings build on each other and it takes time for that build up to make the smaller things easier, but it does ramp up and snowball eventually, just keep going and give yourself time and a break about how challenging this isGood luck",

If you are running the national registry of where everyone lives, you need to store all changes, if you are running a long-term research-project to keep track of young students' moving habits, you need to store all changes.So it always depends on the use case, on the specific application - does it need to log changes, or does it only need current state - there is no \"one size fits all\" answer.",

That can be implemented with interleaving on one core, or with true parallel execution on multiple cores. The key idea is that tasks overlap in time from the system’s perspective.Parallelism is about execution. It means multiple tasks are literally running at the same time on different hardware resources.So yes, parallelism is usually considered a subset of concurrency. A concurrent program may or may not run in parallel depending on the hardware and runtime. But a parallel program is inherently concurrent because multiple flows of control exist at once.You’re also right that race conditions and deadlocks show up in both cases. They are properties of shared state and coordination, not of whether the CPU is single core or multi core. Even with context switching on one core, the interleaving can expose the same hazards.One mental model that helps is: concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.",

Those tasks aren't dependent on each other and can occur on isolation. They're fire and forget. Parallelism achieved. But you might need to process multiple things and then aggregate the results. You'll need a way to track those threads and maybe even kick off more threads and then wait for everything to complete. That's concurrency.",

Parallelism is about how problems can be decomposed into multiple separate programs, and how to coordinate the execution of those programs and make use of the results.So concurrency includes topics like critical sections, reentrant code, locks, semaphores, concurrent data structures, atomic operations.Topics in Parallel computing are things like threading, coroutines, multiprocessor architectures, shared memory, SIMD instructions. Concepts from concurrency like reentrancy and semaphores are important in this domain, too.The difference is that concurrency concerns have to be understood even when there is no parallelism at all - they arise just because different computations interfere with each other even when it's guaranteed that only one task can be executed at a time.",

You have to build projects.Yet, your (like most beginners'/learners') understanding of what is a project is wrong. Every single thing *you* program is a project, even if it is just `print(\"Hello World!\")`. That's how you learn. You have to start with small and simple projects (see the [FAQ - projects by learnt subject](https://github.com/desrtfx/SkillGradedProjects)) and start there. You have to grow your projects with your skills and your skills have to grow with your projects.You don't start writing the next Photoshop, or Word. You start small and simple.Even the programs I just mentioned started way smaller than they are now. Word initially was just a better Notepad with formatting. All the features we now know of it developed over the decades that it already exists. My first version of Word was 3.0 under MS-DOS and then it was just a bit more than Notepad is today. It had formatting, it had pagination, it had already some limited spell checking. It didn't do much else at that time. Table of Contents, document fields, etc. came a bit later, over time.----Stop *watching* tutorials and start *programming*. Experiment. Play around. Try things. That's the way to learn.",

        "body": "I'm working on a Kotlin math library for higher math. I was going to post my Cayley-Dickson construction to show how I generate the complex numbers from the field of real (double) numbers and then apply CD once again to get one of the six unital quaternionic (not commutative but still associative) involution division rings by doubling the complex numbers and mapping i to one of ±i, ±j, or ±k, but I would have to post too much code (a few dozen interfaces) to make it make sense, so instead, I'll post something more self-contained that will probably be more interesting to people here, i.e. the factoradic representation of a number.Still, it's a really cool algorithm and way to generate the \"Cayley-Dickson tower\" which creates an infinite sequence of algebras starting with the reals to create the complex numbers, the quaternions, the octonions, the sedenions, etc. without needing to explicitly code any of them.The thing about Cayley-Dickson is that you lose \"nice properties\" every time you recurse:When you go from the Reals to the Complex, you lose ordering, but you do get an algebraically closed field, which is always nice. (Every polynomial has a root in the field, and thus splits.)When you go from the Complex to the Quaternions, you lose commutativity (so xy ≠ yx for all x, y).When you go from the Quaternions to the Octonions, you lose associativity (so x(yz) ≠ (xy)z for all x, y, z, but you still have alternativity, which is a weaker form where (xx)y = x(xy) and y(xx) = (yx)x for all x, y.)The Sedenions are where the shit really hits the fan: you only have power associativity and you get nonzero divisors, i.e. ab = 0 where a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson\\_construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson_construction)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4)**Instead: Factoradics**So you know how normally, we write numbers in base 10, e.g. 1234?And then we can write them in hexadecimal and binary?1234 in hex is 0x4d2 and in binary it's 0b10011010010?Well, another representation of numbers is called factoradic and is based on factorials. The rightmost digit is always 0, and the number is written: a_n * n! + a_{n-1} * (n-1)! + ... + a_1 * 1! + 0 * 0!where `0 ≤ a_i ≤ i` .Then 1234 in factoradic is: 1411200_! = 1 * 6! + 4 * 5! + 1 * 4! + 1 * 3! + 2 * 2! + 0 * 1! + 0 * 0! = 720 + 480 + 24 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 1234 (as expected in base-10)Here's my factoradic encoder / decoder and the explanation. Note that I prefer to use functional programming constructs when possible: hence why there are no loops here (tail call optimized recursion is my looping: in Kotlin, when you use the keyword val, you cannot reassign to a variable): hence why you see the `aux` function in encode. I (distastefully) use a MutableList all the same to avoid unnecessary list copies.I can't seem to paste it here (too long?) so I made a link to it:[https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS](https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS)Released under the 3-Clause BSD License, but not of much use to you unless you implement your own Factorial implementation (and there's a reasonable bit of machinery there as I represent a few dozen integer sequences and arrays).Right now I just finished polynomial rings / semirings and am working on quotient rings / semirings / fields so I can get the full gamut of finite fields for combinatorial constructions, elliptic curve cryptography (and other forms), coding theory, linear feedback shift registers, etc, as well as implementing geometric lattices nicely and naturally using rings like ℤ\\[x\\]/(x\\^2 + x + 1) for the Eisenstein integers instead of jumping through hoops to replace ω\\^2 = -ω - 1.(Not a beginner: I started programming when I was five and I'm 48 now and work in space astronomy. I have a BSc and MSc in comp sci and a PhD in math, but I have lots of holes in my math background, so this has been a great way to fill them in and learn more and program challenging, fun algorithms.)",

If anyone ever mentions the words \"b**∪**ddy\" or \"pаrtner\" in a post, you delete it because you assume someone is looking for someone to code with, which is far too much of a generalization. FIX THIS CRAP.\\----------------------------------------------------Nice. This will likely not work running it directly from Android, but a suggestion:If you're genuinely worried about songs disappearing off of YouTube (and I would be - it's happened to me so many times), I would cache the songs locally to my machine: check to see if the song exists locally, in which case, play it, and if not, download it using yt-dlp (a fork of the - I believe now dead - youtube-dl, which runs in Python):[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)I have the following alias set up on my MacBook Pro (should work on any machine). Substitute your browser in. alias yt='yt-dlp -f '\\''bv+ba'\\'' --cookies-from-browser chrome --no-check-certificate'Then if you want, say, video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w) (you don't), you just exec: yt \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w\"and it should download locally. Save it as \"XqZsoesa55w\" and search for that locally and play it if you have it, and if you don't, download it. (That actually downloads the video and the audio: you can also modify the alias to just download the audio if that's all you want.)You can also download entire playlists by putting in a playlist. (Quotes are probably necessary in that case, and optional in the case of single songs / videos.)You don't need a YouTube subscription or anything like that, but I recommend you be logged in (so the cookies will work).I have had way too many videos that I loved throughout the years get yoinked either by their creators or by YouTube, and I no longer risk that happening. Every time I find something I like or something educational that I want to check out at some point, I download the entire thing locally.The other option would be to just keep going the way you are, still cache songs locally, and keep a log of any files that are no longer accessible. Just copy those to your Android device and if a song doesn't show up on YouTube, check your \"saved files\" to get whatever has been deleted.Just a suggestion so you don't get burned like me and my \"significant other\" have multiple times over the years.",

Even then, someone working on operating systems might call C high level and exclusively refer to assembly as low level.It’s hard to tell what languages people are referring to specifically when using these terms, but the presence of a garbage collector does seem to be a fairly consistent indicator of an indisputably high level language (JS, Python, Java).

C is a high-level language in many contexts. C++ and Rust can be low-level languages in many contexts.A crucial point that I like to make is that good libraries can make a language \"higher level\" if they provide good abstractions, and the lack of good libraries can make even a very high-level language low-level in the sense that you have to roll your own abstractions.If your language doesn't have good Unicode support, and you need to deal with Unicode, it's a low-level language. OCaml's stdlib doesn't have a good regex library. That stuff matters just as much as, if not more than, the implementation details of how code gets compiled to machine code.",

        "body": "Generally, high vs low level, and interpreted vs compiled are 2 completely different aspects of a programming language. The definition of high and low level languages has shifted over the years as we have developed more and more languages. But strictly speaking, a high level language is any language that abstracts away any specific hardware details. This means that pretty much every programming language falls into the category of “high level”, with the exceptions of assembly and machine code “languages” (if you could call machine code a language). This means that even languages like C, are considered a high level language. This is because when you write C, you do not need to consider the specific characteristics of the hardware your code will be running on. As long as a compiler exists for a target system, your C code will run largely the same on any system (assuming whatever libraries you use are similarly supported). I would say that your professor is largely correct, using this historical definition of high and low level language. However I would add the asterisk that some projects, most notably Linux, have plenty of source code written by humans in assembly. In this case, the assembly is still source code, but is still a low level language since it is dependent on the hardware it will run on. (In large projects like Linux, this often looks like writing the same functionality multiple times in assembly for each target hardware system. So while C code largely only has to be written once, you may find multiple implementations of the same functionality in multiple assembly languages)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_languageHowever, this distinction has somewhat shifted over the years and people some times use more relative terms like “high*er*” and “low*er*” level programming languages. These refer to how close or far to the hardware your language is abstracted away. So this means that while C is technically a high level language, it is often perceived as “low*er*” level than something like python. You’ll even see some people say that C is generally a “low*er*” level language. However these distinctions are largely semantic and don’t have much real meaning, especially when you’re first learning. I would not get caught up on these.The difference however between an interpreted and compiled language is completely different, and also in the modern day, much more complex. Generally speaking, an interpreter is any program that takes as an input some source code, and executes it without first compiling it to machine code. (Ripped from the first line on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing))) A compiler is then any program that takes source code in one language as an input, and outputs code in another language. However, almost always, this looks like translating a higher level language, into a lower level language, typically from a strictly high level language, into a strictly low level language (like C -> assembly).So the 2 concepts are somewhat related, but there is no exact relationship between them. Modern compilers and interpreters are much more complex and have many stages that translate source code through many different levels of abstraction. And, modern programming languages have started blurring the lines between what is seen as higher level and lower level.",

You might write a `mov` statement, but which specific instruction you get is dependent on it's parameters.High level languages target abstract machines and are portable. C++, for example, targets an abstract, byte addressable stack machine, two's compliment signed integers, little-endian, etc. So byte offset and bit manipulation on up - calling conventions, etc, all that is beyond the language, and must be defined by the implementation. So if your machine is word-addressable, the compiler has to translate byte addressing into words in some way.Languages can affect architecture; C++03 is THE DEFINITION of the x64 Itanium ABI, and is standard for the hardware, which was designed around it. That doesn't some how lower the level of the language on that particular platform.So it doesn't matter if the language is compiled or interpreted. You can build an interpreter around a virtual Turing Complete stack machine that runs an assembly. Or you can JIT compile an interpreted language like Java or C#, neither execution actually affects the high level nature of either language.",

There's a lot of languages that try to give you high level features while still offering low-level flexibility and performance.You *can* also embedded C into Python if you want just like how you can embed assembly into C.Also as someone pointed out, high is relative. C is considered high-level by people working with firmware, embedded system, chip design, etc. But application developers consider it low.More formally, you would be more precise by categorizing a language based on how it approaches specific things developers want to use:Memory managementType definitions/constraintsAccess controlStatic vs dynamic definitionsAccess to Interop/embeddingImplementation of paradigm-specific features",

Second, practice, not all must have sense or be a big project, you can do a loop that iterate a list to print something, then think about change things inside it, for example to print sentences, then the same with a dictionary to concatenate results.

        "body": "I'll list some things that might make you consider using message brokers, not in order of importance and not in a mumbo jumbo scientific way.1. A message broker is a separate, usually unchanging serviceThis means that redeploying your service has no effect on receiving data and storing event data. You could argue that writing events to a database is the same - and you'd be right, however we're not done yet! 2. Let's take a topic exchange as an example, you've created your topic exchange and have many routing keys for it. One of these routing keys is lets say for messages indicating that a payment has been completed.One day, you'd like to send these payments to a fraud detection company (totally random example, I'm still having coffee), you could make the most barebones service that simply registers a new queue/binding to this exchange listening to the same routing key your main service already listens - and you'll receive a copy of all the payment events.This plug and play style once your messaging system is set up is really comfortable and doesn't require extra work apart from occasionally adding a new field to your message.3. Manual acknowledgement + outbox/inbox patterns for your messages/events is intuitive and safe to work with . Retries are handled with minimal work from your side with the correct configuration for your queue - connectivity issues and the like can be glossed over and you can define a threshold for dead letters where you'll actually have to think if messages reach there - but little connectivity issues or temporary outages don't really hurt you. 4. It's super easy to scale! Apart from being able to plug different consumers into the same routing key to get copies of messages to do different things with them you can also plug multiple (usually identical) instances of a consumer to a single queue so they can fairly share the work. It's really simply to dynamically scale this by adding or removing consumers to a queue that isn't doing the work fast enough.4.5-ish. Like you already mentioned and as it might be a bit obvious it really helps keep your system tidy(er) where each instance can just do its own thing and if you need something *else* you just make something fresh and connect it without bogging down your existing services with more responsibilities. Obviously it's not all sunshine and rainbows and you can easily make a sprawling mess of events flying all over the place and eventual consistency does have its own considerations.",

If the API actually also does stuff (goes to the kitchen and makes the stuff requested), it stops being interactive for that duration, which is its primary job. So the API delegates as much work as possible to keep being interactive, the work is done via queues and message brokers.In short, any (real) work should not be done by the API, it should get done by something else.

Depending on your messaging setup, a service can just fire and forget to the message queue, cuz the delivery guarantees are provided by the queueing system.2) similarly it allows different apps to work at their own pace3) all your queues are in one place. Like imagine there are multiple instances of your application each with their own local in memory queue, a message might be sent to both and the work is duplicated or some consistency criteria might even break. You can have this sync without queues but if you need queues anyways, just using a service for queues that can observe all the events is massively helpful.4) the queue can scale independently 5) observability, you have once central logical place where the queues report to even if internally they are all running in different physical/virtual systems. So you can then do 2nd level of adaptations based on the state of your queues. A queue suddenly having way too many events in it from normal might be signalling an issue somewhere else.",

For “metrics,” people often use it to avoid coupling request latency to logging/storage and to survive DB outages without dropping events.

        "body": "I'm not entirely sure what I should picture under \"robot sumo competition\" but I have a bit of experience in foundational robotics in my CS degree.To answer your questions: Yes, you can use a camera and a bunch of methods to recognize things. OpenCV is a widespread standard image processing library. You can do C++ but I honestly would say the adapter to Python would probably be a bit more easier to handle because you can use Python for ML stuff as well if you want to, even if Python isn't exactly the fastest.One of the problem you really need to figure out first is to determine the boundary of the problem. What do you mean when you say \"front\" and \"back\" of a robot?If the competition has defined features of a robot, you can use that to determine what constitutes front and back. Using standard or advanced image processing algorithms are going to be an option in this case.A very straight-forward case would be if the competition requires every robot to show some sort of marker for the front facing side. You can use some variant of HOG (histogram of oriented gradients) or if its more complicated SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) to get a decently robust feature detection for the front-side and then deduct that the absence of that feature plus something else like rotational tracking will be the back-side.You can also try the Generalized Hough Transform (although that one might be a bit too slow for pictures with too many pixels).All 3 algorithms are implemented in OpenCV I think (although if not, you can certainly just build them yourself using the OpenCV toolkit).But If robots can look arbitrary and you cannot say that there is some sort of fixed recognizable features, the detection is going to be tricky and OpenCV will not solve your problem. In the latter case, I would honestly consider resorting to machine learning. Retraining CNNs for classification can yield pretty decent results. You would need to have a decently sized training set of images of competition robots fronts and back. You would then do the pre-processing in OpenCV and then pass it on to the model or if you have something integrated like from Nvidia's developer suite, maybe use their stuff.The problem with the ML approach is that you need a decently powerful compute platform on your robot. Even if the majority of computation happens at training phase, processing and then prediction still takes decent amount of compute power. Small embedded systems with a good GPU to handle matrix operations are necessary while not being power hungry monsters.Your other question is a bit vague: What do you mean \"friend or foe system\" for \"recognizing yourself\"?",

        "body": "Yes, this is definitely doable, especially with an overhead camera where you control the environment. The simplest way to detect front and back is to add asymmetric markers to each robot, like a colored patch on one end or distinct shapes, so orientation can be inferred from the contour or marker positions. For friend or foe, you can give your robot a unique color pattern or fiducial marker and track that specifically, which avoids relying on pure shape detection.Since you are new to CV, I would start with basic color thresholding and contour detection in OpenCV before jumping into anything fancy. Real time performance in C++ should be fine if your frame size and processing pipeline stay reasonable. The biggest challenge will probably be lighting consistency and tuning thresholds, not the math itself.",

Which one to choose depends on everything. If you're mathy and like C, you might go for Haskell, but things like Elm or Phoenix might be easierThese are very different ways of programming and understanding them will make you a much better programmer even if you only ever do embedded C programs, or whatever your favorite is.In other words, try python. 2.

You have 4 columns for stickies: \"Backlog\" \"In progress\", \"Review,\" and \"Done.\" Everything starts in the first column, and ends in the fourth. Prioritize everything in the backlog; stuff at the bottom is more important than stuff at the top. You may now pick any of those specific functionalities. This is a confined, simple scope. Start working on making it real. You may have to look into new tools, libraries, or programming concepts to do it. Be sure to read/watch up before writing any code. Once you implement a sticky (aka tasks), review your work, note any major problems/bugs/concerns with your work, write tests (look into how to write unit tests, they save a ton of time), add new features to your batch of unstarted stickies if needed, update priorities of needed, and then grab a new sticky to start the cycle again.

The reason I say this is, because if you're new to both languages and programming, it's more important to focus on that 'how' and the 'why' than the 'what'. I did a Java module which entailed writing a small CRUD records management system for a fictional enterprise. The only requirement was that it had at least three datasets and that one of them was many-to-many. I initially tried to do a video store (one of the examples) but never having worked in one and with certain things being open-ended (film categories/genres) I simply opted for Formula 1 because it was something I knew well in it's composition. There were drivers, engines and teams and each team had two drivers and one engine. The knowledge of what the end looked like helped me focus on the syntax of the language and the logic of the code and even helped me spot wrong turns when I realised that I wouldn't be able to do what I needed to if I carried on down that path. There's no one right answer here and I know some people find the motivation to solve a problem that hasn't been solved yet is what helped them push through and stick with it, but this was helpful for me.",

At some point you might specialize, but right now you just need experience using programming to solve any problem at all. 2. Honestly C is an old language and not many working programmers today would choose it unless it was a very niche thing. The main reason is that C programs are relatively tricky for things like memory management and concurrency. C also doesn't have many features that modern languages have. That is actually why I mentioned Rust, which meant as a kind of modern C replacement. Rust is similar to C, but it has many cool features and still is very fast and runs \"close to the metal\" like C does. * The general answer to the question of \"what is good to write in C (or Rust)?\" is: anything that has to run very fast and/or in limited environments like embedded systems (eg raspberry pi) * a different answer could be a math-heavy problem. Something that uses a lot of data and does a lot of calculations on it very fast.3. Creating your own language is a great thing to try. I suggest trying it after you have learned a few different ones. After all, how will you know what kind of language you want to build if you have never experienced writing any language?4. I'm not sure I can answer the core of the creative block problem. I first got into programming because I wanted something to exist that didn't. I had a problem and the only way to solve my problem was to write a program to solve it. I'm not sure how you would come from the other direction, with a solution in search of a problem. I guess my advice to think about what you wish existed.5. Finally, I would not worry about \"knowing what you need to know.\" When I started with my problem I knew nothing at all. You will learn what you need to know as you go step by step through the problem you're trying to solve. At each step you will not know what to do, and you'll figure it out by searching, then you'll move on to the next step and repeat the process over and over until the problem is solved.",

Pull raw data with SQL, clean and transform it in pandas, then rebuild the visuals with matplotlib or seaborn. It forces you to understand what the BI tool was abstracting away.A solid starter project is a small end to end analysis on a public dataset. For example, take a sales or e commerce dataset, write SQL queries for KPIs, load the results into pandas, do some feature engineering, and produce a short narrative with visuals. Treat it like you’re presenting to a stakeholder.If you want something more exploratory, try analyzing your own habits. Track expenses, workouts, or study time in a simple database. Query it with SQL, then use pandas to find trends and seaborn to visualize patterns. Personal data makes it easier to stay motivated.The key is not just plotting charts, but practicing the full workflow: question, query, clean, analyze, explain. That’s what really builds analysis muscle.",

It's a different path than data analysis, more ML/engineering focused. Cool, but not what most analyst roles ask for.How to structure it:1. Pick a dataset you find interesting (Kaggle, Maven Analytics, or your own)2. Ask 3-5 specific questions3. Clean the data with pandas4. Analyze and visualize with matplotlib/seaborn5. Write up what you foundMake it look like a real deliverable, not a code dump. Add markdown explanations, clear charts with titles, and a summary of insights.Some good datasets to start:\\- Superstore sales (classic, easy to find)\\- Spotify tracks (fun, lots of angles)\\- E-commerce transactions (realistic business data)\\- Any public dataset from a domain you care aboutSince you already know Power BI, you could even do the same analysis in Python and compare, shows range on your resume.If you want to skip the hunting and just start building, I put together The Portfolio Shortcut — 15 ready-to-go projects with datasets and code. Covers pandas, visualization, EDA, ML basics. Might save you time figuring out what to build (DM for access).Start with one project. Finish it. Then the next. That's really all there is to it.",

If you use callbacks instead, you have to take care that if you have multiple actions: What if the callback-state is achieved multiple times? What if it is only temporarily achieved?3) If the state you're checking for is complex (i.e. you don't have a single callback-state, but instead a rather big set of states which all should result in a callback), it's cheaper to have, once per update, a single centralized call checking for it, instead of every action within an update having to check for whether the callback-state is achieved.",

Long polling is where you poll the value, but the poll operation does not succeed until the value changes. This usually blocks a thread, so there is thread overhead cost, but not a processing cost. Long polling is pretty popular for network operations where the server cannot initiate a connection back to the client to execute a callback.

This is how I personally have progressed my career at my IT job, that is, by being willing to be essentially thrown to the wolves, do the research, put in the work, and deliver. Look through the current code and functionality, and for what you can’t piece together on your own, utilize the resources available to you. Chat GPT is not great at writing code, but it can be used effectively for parsing large amounts of data (say one singular or multiple files provided as context) and giving you a somewhat accurate and human-readable breakdown/overview of functionality. You can use it to give you ideas, and even to point you to valid documentation and resources that exist on the internet for VBA and excel projects. Other than that, YouTube is a great resource, and experimentation and practice are essential for understanding. Don’t just copy and paste shit.

All i need is a button the on excelpage, which opens a window with some drop-downs and preselected inputs which can be generated as new row in the page. Plus another button to delete the inputs if their are wrong and i'd like to make them dependent on the previous input. So basically you put your name first, then the dropdown for the station becomes visible, you select the station and depending on the station, the next dropdown only shows the robots which are located in that station. You choose the robot and the next dropdown only shows part which are build onto your selected robot. So there is no chance to pick something which wouldn't make sense (we have lot of entries on our current list, which are false because the part isnt used on that robot). The other department has much more variations on stations, robots and parts so the cross-checking does make sense for them, but not for us and also with my idea of preselecting the inputs it would be obsolet aswell. Maybe i put that incorrectly and the code itself isnt confusing for an expert on that matter, but for me (and my skilllevel) it is. And again the whole cross-checking thingy isnt necessary for my/our project.Thanks for you insight and for the hit about VB net. I'll keep that in mind.",

        "body": "Advice from an industry veteran: When you have a problem, pretend you are explaining it to the most senior dev on your team, who will be upset if you waste any of their precious time. Try to think of the questions they will ask you (like \"lemme see your code\"), and get answers ready so that you don't get the stare of death.Sometimes this is known as \"rubber duck debugging\", or simply \"rubber ducking\", because if you can explain your problem clearly to a rubber duck, then chances are you will stumble upon a clue along the way that will lead you to a solution. Many bugs have been solved by developers talking to rubber ducks in their offices. I have found myself in position where not only did I waste the senior dev's time, but he was the senior dev at another company we were working with so I made my entire company look incompetent because I didn't see a basic issue. Luckily I spotted the problem before he did and we were able to laugh it off... But please learn from my mistakes.",

You don't just jump right in to full competency in a change like that, but I was fortunate that an organization needed people and I learned on the job (just like I learned networking, databases, Java, CRUD and most everything else earlier).I was probably lucky in that I worked five years for an IPTV company so I did both backend (Java) and C++ work on a proprietary client.Continuing education in the field is vital and breadth of experience is a positive, at least it has been for me.",

Some of the guys who made FoundationDB's testing framework have created a company called Antithesis which is doing some really interesting stuff in testing entire systems. Anyway those are just some examples of topics I'm trying to learn more about myself.

So I can make a variable and inside of that variable can be a number of different functions.In C you can pass data around, but you cannot pass a function (behavior, it’s not ‘data’). You can technically but it’s not a callable object which is what you’re actually asking.So I can’t make a List or an Array and inside of that array put a function… I also can’t pass them as a parameter to be the input into another totally separate function. In Dart or JS and most modern-ish languages a function are treated as an object just like any other data like a var or a const, so you can manipulate them the same exact way.So if I have a function that does something to an array of numbers, an then sends those numbers out to be updated in real time, it’ll have specifics like who’s logged in, and who’s looking at what. It’ll be a huge function. But I may want to manipulate that data in a certain way before that function executes and send those numbers out.Maybe I want the numbers converted to a different currency, or rounded, or cut off any number below X or above Y, so I make my function.CoreFunction forEachItem(nums, SpecialBehaviorFunction5) and then the rest of that function.I may have 14 different “special behavior functions” that I’m going to use, and that gets passed to this core function 5000 times a minute.So this makes writing and compositing the code way easier and way easier to think about as well because I don’t have a ton of classes or function sitting around scattered. I’ve got the core function, the special behavior function, and some function that decides what special behavior function to pass to the core function.That’s the easiest way I can explain it for now but I’ll keep thinking for a concrete example.",

I would consider something like installing Scheme and going through the first couple chapters of exercises: it'll teach you a very different way to program.If you haven't done any programming, but want to get a head start, get set up with a GitHub account and create a couple test projects on there or read up on the basic theory of source code control management. It's an extremely useful skill to have that they likely won't teach you in school and it'll help you get set up to have a portfolio by the time you're applying for jobs and show that you understand how it works. Most companies use GitHub or GitLab (pretty much interchangeable) these days, and you can learn pretty much almost all the essentials in less than two weeks.Here's also a list of genuinely free programming books:[https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/books/free-programming-books-subjects.md](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/books/free-programming-books-subjects.md)You might find a subject on there that interests you and isn't too far above your level.Here's one for git (GitHub, GitLab) beginners:[https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)",

That said, excellence in one area of programming often hints the ability to be excellent in other areas.Many of the programs in competitions (which is where leetcode gets most of its examples) are small, easy to implement, but challenging enough they are not trivial. However they rarely deal with most of the issues that companies use in programming.

If you're not that attached to Python, my standard recommendation for new developers is to complete The Odin Project, following either the Ruby or Node track (just pick Node if you aren't sure.) The Odin Project is an excellent resource, it's hard to do better. The thing I like about The Odin Project is that it teaches you the ecosystem *around* software development, such as setting up a Linux environment (Linux is an essential skill for many developers, especially entrepreneurs who have to think about Docker, AWS, etc.) If you're not interested in web development at all, still check out CS50. They have a lot of follow up courses in various topics.",

If you are sure that it won't distract you, I would suggest going a little more in the Python direction.

It just points at it, thus, the sign can change to point at anything else that’s real. But the sign will never be the thing that it’s pointing at. In C, pointers point at memory addresses. The memory houses the actual real data by (at the most basic level) cutting it into chunks where data is then housed(also called pages). Your pointer can point at the beginning of such chunk and then you can ask the pointer to move forward or backward through the memory to reveal the whole chunk.",

The pointer for the array stores the address of the very first element in the array - and here is where the \"0-based\" array indexing comes from. Since the elements are stored in a contiguous memory block and have a fixed size depending on the data type, it's easy to figure out where the elements are: `base address + (index * size)`. You know the *base address* - the pointer, you know the *index* - the element you want to access, you know the *size*, which is determined by the data type. That's it.Pointers are extremely useful, but more modern languages (or more modern implementations of languages) often *hide* them away from the user so that they don't have to deal with them. In C++, you have *smart pointers*, you have *references*, which are just extensions to pointers.",

        "body": "> Do you think AI is just a bubble that will eventually burst? It's actively bursting and this is a very hot conversation going on right now. With the new year, people are really dissecting annual reports of publicly traded companies, and after ~5 years of this bubble, no major player has reported a positive ROI on AI software integration. Not one.We're seeing ~$22 billion in technical debt created by AI, because the slop they generated can't be understood by people. This is important, because the industry is finally really coming around to understand - you can't hold AI accountable.If a corporation loses shareholder value, causes damages, or kills people, C-levels and employees can be held personally accountable. There was a time I was responsible for 60% of all option trading on Earth, can you just imagine the concrete shoes I'd be wearing at the bottom of some lake right now if I allowed AI to speak on my behalf? Where did all the money go? I dunno, Boss; I asked the AI and they don't know, either. How does this work? I dunno, Boss, the AI made it, and every time I ask, it remakes it in a different way...We're also seeing the employment pendulum swing the other way. That technical debt we've accrued so far is going to take a decade to un-fuck, and we're still going with it, so there will be work for the rest of MY career...And things lag, so there's still a feeling of uncertainty that everyone is acting on, and employers are taking advantage of that while they can by offering low wages since it's still a saturated, employer's market. As the employee market dries up, those salaries are going to pick back up. That things are actively changing isn't a secret, if you know where to look and who to ask.> Or will AI simply raise the entry-level requirement for junior engineers?I'm not quite sure how to interpret this one, yet. Businesses thought they'd replace junior level work with AI, but that means entry level positions would be essentially senior architect roles, basically what you're suggesting - and how can you do that without the experience?So AI has caused some damage, and there will be a gap in employee demographics as we took a whack at 5 years of college grads who didn't find their footing in the middle of this bungling market experiment. They'll all be off into other markets, or set back from missing 5 years critical experience. If you've invested 5 years into something else while this market figures its shit out, you're probably better off sticking to that, rather than finally kick-starting a late career.> I see that companies are mostly hiring senior engineers these days, but if there aren't enough junior engineers, who will they hire are seniors in the future? ( sorry if this sounds silly ) That's a very real question, and the answer is they're going to pay out the ear for the mistake, in the long run.Companies are hiring seniors for two reasons:1) Trump. He's a bad actor, a Russian asset; he has grifted and pilfered this government and economy, intentionally destroyed it in ways that cannot be explained by economics or incompetence alone, and he's such a wildcard, that everyone is just buckling down and hoping to survive this administration, until we can get back to \"business as usual\". And to conservatives and authoritarians of the regime who disagree - you're evil.2) Corporate interest rates went up from 0% 3 years ago, and then the massive layoffs started happening. It wasn't due to AI. Zero interest corporate loans are federal subsidies to grow the economy. You fork off a subsidiary of your conglomerate, spend the money, develop the tech, and when the money runs out, you fold the subsidiary tied to the loan - taking the debt with it. But the parent company keeps all the IP. This scheme is over for FAANG, but not for smaller corporations - so expect some underdog success stories.> how will software work envolve in the future?AI won't go anywhere. But like outsourcing to a Sally Struthers country for pennies on the dollar, you don't outsource anything actually important. It has to be able to fail to deliver, or do what it's supposed to, and that has to be OK. It can be an aid, if it can generate simple code that is faster to verify than it is to write. It'll be useful for refactoring, permuting, generating (but not implementing) protocols, other things.> What should we learn to day to avoid getting stuck in the future?Stick to the fundamentals. Get good at math. The one thing AI can never do is think, and that's on you to learn.",

I think it looks roughly the same but teams might be smaller and things that are a side effect of that. I think smaller companies now have a chance to compete, so that is good.To avoid getting stuck, learn how to develop projects on your own from scratch (just like before). You don't have to learn everything in excruciating detail, just enough to get it done. Let the project guide what you need to learn and when you need to learn it. Once you can do that, sprinkle in AI usage a little bit but only for the stuff you know so you know what it is doing. If it is something you don't understand yet, make sure you learn it.You only need to learn what you use the rest is for grades.

I don't think it will raise the entry requirement, but it might push out a bunch of older folks that refuse to get on board with the new tools. If anything, I think the difficulty in obtaining the necessary degree is being lowered so that schools can brag about how many CS grads they pushed through, but at the expense of the quality of education. The curriculum I went through at my alma mater was made probably 40% easier just two years after I graduated ('17). They dropped requirements for Computer Architecture, Assembly, and Physics of Electricity and Magnetism entirely. I think they also lowered the math reqs, and made some of the upper division work electives.",

My prediction would be that most of us will use LLMs for coding in 5 years, but not for vibe coding. Stuff like autocomplete and boilerplate. >Or will AI simply raise the entry-level requirement for junior engineers?This is actually a real issue, because junior devs have a harder time getting used to codebases and companies now that their normal tasks have been partially automated, and they are expected to start immediately with more advanced tasks. >how will software work envolve in the future? What should we learn to day to avoid getting stuck in the future? thanks in advance for your answers.basically just learn the same things we did. The skills are not really different, using an LLM as a small help in coding is not really a skill you need to learn. You need to know how software works, how to write and evaluate it etc. just as we did back before LLMs were big. AI doesn't enable you to build more complex software, it helps you do the easy things slightly faster (sometimes(TM)).",

Your team member that made the stripe branch should be able to use reflog on their own local client to find the branch they merged into main.Once they've found it, you can `git checkout` right to the reflog's hash code to make it current, `git checkout -b name` to give it a new name, and then merge it into main (the approach I'd use to that merge is probably `git rebase main` first to put stripe as the most recent change, but different teams have different approaches).As far as preventing merges straight into main: if you're using GitHub, it's possible to flag a branch as protected so that, for example, it can only be merged into with pull requests. If you're self-hosting, the bare branch on the server has a pre-receive hook that can be used to reject someone trying to push their main to server's main.",

I have some experience with robotics through FIRST, though I'm real rusty. ;)The main issue you'll run into with AprilTags is probably occlusion and speed. All AprilTag solutions I've seen are real sensitive to partial tags (i.e. the moment any bit of the tag is out of frame, they can't give you pose data anymore, and your camera has to be pretty decently high-speed to not get so much blur on a swinging sword that the tag isn't solvable).",

For me that was low-level graphics. I sincerely believe the exact technologies are not vital for internships, rather it's about showing your appetite for learning. Knowing OS fundamentals, and having practical projects with memory management, and cache-awareness in mind already knocks the majority of competitors out, especially for internships if you are targeting low-level domain (most go for latest and greatest shiny deployable frameworks). If backend is referring to servers, databases, and interfacing with web, I have no idea. For more closer to metal, I assume getting an Arduino starter kit and do some of the guided projects could be a good idea.It sounds like you simply need to do the reps with any type of project. I believe you don't really \"study\" programming. Rather, you start with something you want to create. Unless you are following a tutorial step-by-step (which I highly do not recommend), you have to be inquisitive and work your way backwards from the goal, to figuring out what's needed, and then figuring how to build those blocks. Naturally, based on problems you want to solve, you find that you want to express some computation, where you then realize that you need some language constructs to do so (just like normal language).",

Then it sends the signal to make the change.This is the simplest way to do something, and it doesn't have a lot of protections that come with more sophisticated means.

I don't condone cheating in general but you and I know very well that our interviews are fundamentally broken to begin with, even before AI.

Examining someone on whether they can solve a leetcode style question tells you nothing about a candidate's ability to write and ship software. I have met people who work at FAANG that have been able to get there purely by memorizing leetcode questions but not all of them are actually good engineers and a good amount of them have never shipped anything.The people who are using these cheating tools are just shining the light on the bigger problem here which is that our interviews are fundamentally broken and should be redesigned to actually examine someone's engineering skills and foundations. If I am hiring an engineer to work on web apps, I would want them to know skills related to that not whether they can invert a binary search tree.I expect this trend of cheating to continue growing until companies begin to realize how stupid the current interview structure is",

Since then, the tech job market has become harder and harder to get into/find new roles, as the bar for interviews keeps getting higher and higher.

Do we really think the owners of AI are just going to share all their wealth with us? And even if it all goes as well as possible, is it actually good for the future of humanity to essentially become a bunch of toddlers who have outsourced all their agency and cognitive ability to AI?

        "body": "I've been working professionally as a Software Engineer for a little over a year but have 10 years of experience in the real professional working world. And here's the truth: people don't have even have the slightest clue of what they're talking about.Originally I studied Finance and Accounting. My first job was at a Big 4 public accounting firm in 2016, they demoed an AI agent that could do our job to show they were \"cutting edge.\" Did we use it? No. We used excel workbooks that have been around longer than your grandma's fridge. Did we leverage Python, VBA, and so on to work better and faster like I knew how to do? No. Some of these people could barely move around a single sheet in Excel.Then I worked at a F500 company. In addition to regular accounting and finance work, tried as much as possible to automate. I tried to do things better, faster, more efficiently. I wrote \"shadow apps\" (not managed by the dev teams) for other financial analysts and accountants as the massive dev teams we had didn't have \"capacity\". Eventually I hit a wall and essentially there was so much I wanted to incorporate and change but was denied the tools needed to deploy and maintain them. Basically \"sorry you're not an SWE so we can't give you access.\" So I left and now I'm building financial systems and doing meaningful work as a SWE and getting my masters in CS. And making more than I did before and happier.Here's my takeaway: you will be stunned to see how SLOW companies adopt tech outside of big tech companies. Even if you TRY you'll hit resistance.If you have a desire to build a solution, you will have a job. If people on this sub or the vibe coding subs think an accountant at a F500 company will use Claude Code to vibe up a solution, I'm sorry but it will not happen about 90% of the time. If they didn't write basic Python scripts before, they are not vibe coding now. Anyone that believes that will happen are either delusional or have never actually worked outside of tech roles.And a final note: I could have automated 80% of my work as an accountant and financial analyst pre-AI. The only people to look at that career path as bulletproof are tech people who never worked in that field or tried to get a job in it.",

He also wouldn't collaborate much with anyone while doing the work, he'd just jump right into it. He said the reason was that everywhere he had worked it was like you described, the deadline was set in stone and you never ever delivered late for any reason. When we told him to slow down and take more care and collaborate more and that the deadline didn't matter, the quality of the work was more important, he didn't understand that and couldn't adjust to it.He said it caused him extreme stress to see this arbitrary deadline we had put on a task and that he had taken too long, no matter how much we assured him it didn't matter and we expected him to take more time to get familiar with the codebase and the business. It seemed like he had PTSD from working so long in environments like you're describing.",

They do not position off-shore resources in such a way that makes them plug-and-play for any arbitrary development team.Your argument more or less rests on the notion that productivity and labor costs are the only considerations when developing a successful product — rest assured theres a lot more to it.But sure, if all you bring to a development team is the ability to take tickets, and work for cheap, you may need to re-evaluate exactly what you’re bringing to the table labor-wise in the long term. Advice on how specifically you can/should upskill requires more context than fits in a Reddit post. Pick any arbitrary pile of podcasts or blogs related to product development, and when you read something which relates to a skill you haven’t mastered, learn that thing. Pay attention to what’s happening in your organization, and make sure your skillset is well aligned with the “big rocks” coming up.Frankly, not every software product demands “FAANG-level” engineers to be successful. But pretend you’re a company trying to be competitive in a market. The hypothetical skill-curve of labor isn’t flat among your competition. If literally every competitor sourced from the same off-shoring agencies, and all of those agencies were equally skilled at product development, what a fantastic opportunity for you to disrupt that market by having significantly higher performing teams right?",

Meaning your work needs to be exceptional while the team also having runway to preserve your employment I bring this up because most teams have a changing budget that goes up and down based off priorities. They may have room in budget in 2025 but that doesn’t mean 2026 will. In short, contracts are usually going to end. If you’re diligent and reach out to your manager more you can usually determine if you’ll be extended 6+ months in advance. In my experience, all of my contracts were extended 3 or 4 times until the team inevitably ran out of budget and offshored but I seen contractors let go after 6 months",

Not particularly \"hard\" questions in terms of difficulty, but there was a lot more code that had to he written (like whole classes, interfaces, etc). I think this is because it'd be much easier to cheat with AI if the question is mentally challenging but short, vs a longer more involved, but simpler question.

If a company wants to be somewhere, they'll lease property. If a company doesn't want or need to be somewhere, they'll let leases expire. And then everything else falls into line with the leases.10 years ago, every smart CFO advocated very long leases to reduce lease rates. Now that companies have been shown that they don't need people onsite, every smart CFO is recommending that the company only renew very essential leases and let the rest expire. This is a corporate finance tectonic shift on par with switching to defined-contribution retirement plans (late '90's) and switching to unlimited PTO (late '00's).If you like working there, make yourself as valuable as you can. It still might not make the difference, but it usually does. If your boss can say about you to their boss \"I can't succeed without this person\", then you are usually safe. That's your goal...if you want to stay there.And in a few years when your company's leases expire, then leadership will say that they've discovered or realized that WFH is a vital part of work life balance or whatever stupid way they have of justifying what is ultimately a financial, lease-centric decision.",

Eventually after close to 600 applications some 11-12 months after graduation I got my first offer! I too had that realization that “I was not going to give up till I had that offer”. I think after I made that decision I was applying to upwards of 10-15 jobs a day. I wish you all the luck, try to make sure your employer extends an offer to you!",

We need to start defining metrics and details BEFORE anything is calculated or reviewed.

I won’t speak to if phD holders are better or worse than staff engineers cus I only have anecdotal evidence but the staff engineers I work with are just incredible.I went on a business trip with this E6 who was very quiet. I knew they were a 6 but didn’t quite understand why, as I had never worked directly with them and they always just seemed to listen and didnt really speak. I figured they were just coding machines. As soon as we got a client in front of us it was immediately clear why they were a 6. The questions and follow up questions they were asking on a whim would take me an entire day to come up with and yet the questions seemed so obvious and simple. Then they were able to consolidate all of the information into learnings and built out an entire roadmap. It felt like they were capable of thinking in a way I will never be able to.We hired an external E6 last year as my teams tech lead. Within 3 months he had more context on every single engineers work than the engineers themselves. I thought he was just really aware and interested in what I was working on, but quickly realized he shared the interest and understanding with everything we worked on. Again, I have no idea how he processes so much context.",

A post grad researcher specialises in applying theory to the extent they may write new papers, it’s essentially a continuous studying journey after their PhD to move industry knowledge forward. Whereas being a staff engineer is going deep into the practical application, deep enough that you’re not writing papers to influence your industry or to propel your PhD knowledge. Ultimately no one person can do it all, they are distinct roles for a reason. They specialise in different aspects. And there’s nothing ruling out someone from switching between should they want to change roles. I thought this was common sense tbh.",

On the surface that means 75% of devs get laid off. But in reality, this ignores the factor of human ambition and greed. The ultimate goal of a company isn't to punch off its current TODO list. It's to maximize profits. So at least some of those 75% should end up building new features and launching new products to generate more profits through efforts that wouldn't have been justifiable at the previous cost of development.And some of them will go off and start their own companies doing things with a person or two that previously would have taken a team, startup capital, etc.And so on.I think the same thing applies to the idea of people sitting idle overall. If you look at all of the laid off people coldly as a resource pool sitting idle waiting to be exploited to generate profits, it starts to look as silly to not find a way to put them to work as it would be to not tap into an oil well sitting idle in your backyard. Not because you're trying to do a good deed by giving them a job, but because you're trying to make more money. Which is really the only reason anyone has a job today.The truly difficult part could be the relative pace of all of this - if millions of people get laid off at an unprecedented rate, it will take time to figure out how to leverage this new human resource - what happens in that time? But in the long run, I suspect that the ultimate answer to how we keep ourselves busy in the face of these new tools will be the same answer that has accompanied every productivity increasing technological development in human history: we'll just do more. That drive is pretty central to what it means to be human, IMO.",

Theres a two fold approach to why companies do this, both of them have to do with money.1. Just hire less people and cut down on time to train them as that’s lost revenue, and also lay off employees who are not absolutely essential or senior level people because they obviously just do nothing right? Makes their labor cost go down, shareholders see better numbers in the immediate, everything is smooth sailing until it’s not.2. The senior level people that stay on assume the work of their peers that got laid off, get a slight pay bump (or none sometimes) to do their work being “augmented” by ai, this basically allows the company to get more labor for paying the same price effectively.Dollar now > dollar tomorrowEveryone loses, they win, economy gets wrecked we lose jobs, they get record profits and re invest into other business ventures or just pay themselves with the “returns” :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:",

On top of that, the field is shrinking. Software jobs aren't going away, but as efficiencies improve and people continue to upskill their credentials and experience, people will be squeezed out of the job market.Why would anybody in 2026 choose a new bootcamp graduate over them?

Dream up ANYTHING and then start building it, this is not about the product topic, it is all about making software systems. Keep doing this project after project and you will learn a ton about systems, design, logging, communication, etc.I used to be a big book person myself, and they are good to get some ideas to get started, but it's better to go start building constantly, and then come back to the books when you need to reference, get unblocked, or learn how to do a specific thing. I think another aspect of this is that the building of systems/services/projects gives you more things to connect mentally when going through books on \"advanced topics\". For example, after building a bunch of projects, when you go through your next system design book, you will make mental connections to what you've already built and think up use cases and improvements with the topics they are talking about. If you just read books / take courses from the start and aren't building, nothing will stick as easily.",

A problem a lot of new grads have is they aren’t applying across the entire country. In this job market, you have to apply across the entire country and be willing to relocate anywhere. This is what people use to do several generations ago btw, move to random no-name towns for cheap housing and opportunity because life in the big cities was too competitive and expensive. Eventually, these towns became the powerhouses you see today. Military is also a terrific option. I came from the military. Joining the military was the single best decision I ever made in my life, getting out was the second best. I got out with $50k to my name at 23 and more character development than college could have ever provided for me. A lot of hiring managers are also former military and they will almost always prefer other vets that apply, for good reason too.",

Reaching out to people you know in the industry is going to be a good option. This is how I've found new jobs and helped others get jobs where I've worked. Another approach that might work for you is if you're in a tech hub city to consider moving to a location where the competition is lower. This usually comes with a lower COL and salary though. Becoming an expert in areas like manufacturing or data center management might help with this.",

Offshoring jobs to \"cheaper\" places means that those places become less cheap over time because increasing demand for actual skilled talent which is generally not too high in supply causes salaries abroad to increase and the cost of living to likewise increase from the capital being sent there. It's the reason why tech salaries in a lot of offshore locations like Eastern Europe and Latin America have jumped dramatically in recent years. Not only that, but there's nothing really to suggest that \"expensive\" countries couldn't just lower salaries domestically. This is honestly something that everyone on these subs seem to miss and I don't know why. It may be argued that nobody in such countries would be willing to work for a fair amount less if it came to that, but if push comes to shove, I think it is reasonable to assume that there would be a lot of people willing to do so because otherwise it might mean not having a job. Also:\\> Over time, those countries will develop expertise, infrastructure, and competitive companies of their own. That could eventually mean they outperform Western firms and that further weakens Western dominance in the long run.Yeah, no that's very likely not going to happen. Apart from ex-communist nations, there's a reason that the \"cheap\" places you mentioned are low paying. I'll leave you to figure that out for yourself.",

It will take a lot to overcome so much global change. I enjoy programming and solving complex logic problems so that's the reason I am in the field still. At work we are encouraged to use AI more so I do it because it's being tracked. So less manual workflow and more of an agentic or llm type of workflow at the moment. But overall just to say that even if I had the free time I still enjoy the craft and learning opportunities it provides. That is to say try and find a job that is at least tolerable and ride the wave. Try to keep the skills sharp in case the layoff hammer comes around. That's been my philosophy for the past several years been through a couple recessions so always be ready to shift if needed.",

Maybe some common setup method is used by a million tests but doing work only a handful of them need, etc.I’ve used a good process where when a test is identified as flaky you mark it ignored, then add a ticket to the backlog to fix it at some point in the future. Sure there’s technically less coverage until it gets fixed, but the impact on development when flaky tests block unrelated work is often worse than the benefit of that particular test. You’re going to have to actually prioritize these in your backlog though. Over time you have fewer and fewer builds getting blocked by flaky tests. Once you get to a point where most of your notorious flaky tests are muted or fixed, introduce a policy change where you take them more seriously and fix immediately.",

Or, come up with some good ideas of how to improve the apps that aren’t officially being rewritten yet; and just whip up a proof of concept in your free time.

But companies realized they didn’t need 2 standard deviations above the mean talent to build a CRUD app, so they started going down the bell curve. The learn to code movement increased supply and abstracted frameworks lowered the barrier to entry. Hence the situation we’re in. But top engineers still get paid a lot, it’s the normal region that’s been getting squeezed. Take that scenario, apply it to AI/ML Eng and see where the conclusion takes you.",

Desperation can drive someone to make very illogical actions.I have a job that pays more than double than my previous employer, they give me free sodas, and everyone is really nice to me (despite the fact that I suck balls as a problem solver). This job is too good for me and all my income goes straight into my chipmunk cheeks. The company itself is ancient, stable, all about technology/computers (it's neither Nvidia nor AMD). Given that it's a GPU job, I used C++ both on the role and to persuade my interviewers (I **hate** higher\\* level languages).It's fine if you don't consider it a solid career (because I'd agree).My current compensation as a junior is $200kI'm posting this in hopes that it will make an unemployed soul out there feel a little better today.Oh, and they also take us out to eat for free every once in a while and have around \\~5 company holidays (in addition to the normal holidays).

Something in your application materials is triggering an automatic rejection before human eyes ever see them. The fact that your network connections got you interviews proves you can perform when given the chance, so the barrier is purely at the screening stage.Six resume rewrites might actually be hurting you if each version strays further from ATS optimization. Consider this: get your most recent version reviewed by someone currently hiring in tech, not just resume writers. They’ll spot what’s causing the auto-rejections. Also, gaps on your resume or the layoff itself might need different framing. Some companies filter out anyone currently unemployed, which is brutal but realYour tech stack isn’t the problem since those skills are still in demand. More likely it’s resume formatting breaking ATS parsers, missing keywords that match job descriptions exactly, or your experience level falling into an awkward middle zone where you’re overqualified for junior roles but competing with seniors.Stop applying to undervalued positions immediately. That signals desperation and companies assume you’ll leave when something better appears. Focus on contract or freelance work to fill the gap while maintaining your search. Breaking the unemployment streak often unlocks opportunities faster than anything else.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I’m talking your earning potential is going to drop off quite dramatically as you approach the 5 year mark and don’t have good experience. You will be competing with more experienced seniors and younger, hungrier kids at that point. You’re basically going to get squeezed in the middle. 6) Which brings me to my next point: you’re young enough and smart enough to pivot to a different career at this point.

The right employer will look at your experience and your eagerness to do real SWE work and see someone worth investing time in. It probably won't be a big tech company, maybe not a big company period, but at this point you just need someone who is willing to take you on for your qualities beyond raw experience. I can only speak to my own experience, but I'm a mostly self taught SWE who switched from a completely unrelated field and have managed to do pretty well for myself at this point, but the thing that made my career growth possible was that I spent the first 4 years of my software career at a tiny startup that just wanted hard workers willing to learn.

So if you ask on experienced devs, you'll probably get a lot of people who are saying language doesn't matter and what not, but the good ones will say the opportunity is only good if you are willing to make the leap to learn the other language.Java is one of those languages that can feel \"old fashioned\" by todays standards because of the fact so many other languages figured out shortcuts or answers to common problems that still exist in java. So my conclusion has been it always is universally painful when anyone is trying to traverse going from something like dotnet or python to a java system. I'm living that pain right now and I'm primarily a dotnet dev that got hired into a java shop that needed a dotnet dev for a side project. And you are right Java Spring is full on magic box because people have built answers to so many problems. It's less programming and more like fitting together pieces of a puzzle, which is why I kind of dislike it. However, it got that way because raw java is the literal boards and nails of high end compiled languages because it was open source and the first one. Had this experience when going between android, iOS, and windows. It was like the windows stuff was somehow between two extremes in approach.",

I've worked the full ML development cycle E2E, from working with stakeholders on initial requirements, to building and prototyping models, to deploying them.Right now there's a huge focus on the latter because as others have said, everyone has a hard on for replacing jobs and improving efficiency. A lot of people believe LLMs are the silver bullet from that and can eventually replace human support agents. However banks also have to deal with a lot of regulation and tend to have a mountain of internal controls which hamstring their AI efforts. There's still a lot of ML being done at a bank in other areas including credit scoring, risk modeling, and fraud or anomaly detection; but it's not groundbreaking stuff and honestly it's kind of a solved problem at this point so you don't hear much about it.My personal take is if you want to actually do ML engineering you should aim higher than ML at a bank.",

Because of this belief, along with the price of LLMs (for now) everyone is just implementing the existing offering because it is seen as a \"no-brainer\".It is my belief that this will not continue.Firstly, the prices of LLMs will go up, how much by? No-one outside of those companies know definitively.Secondly, LLMs are shit and need constant monitoring and verification, which most people don't do and even fewer do well. This will cause (and probably already is causing) quite a lot of very avoidable pitfalls and designs.Thirdly, LLMs discourage you from thinking, just about anything. There has not been a single study that has proven the opposite, only this point.So I guess to answer your question, everyone is lying about ML at the moment because LLMs are a cash cow the likes of which hasn't been seen for quite a while; far wider reaching than crypto or similar fads.Things will change though one way or another.Also, any of you cock wombles who want to tell me I'm wrong, I will be ignoring you unless you can back up your claims with data.Edit: changed AI to LLMs",

The C level guy's passive aggressive attitude is well known I may get into trouble for it, but I posted to the other offices that if they're asked publicly when they're going to adopt the new platform to give a vague answer such as \"We're exploring it\".I advised my manager this morning that we do not adopt the new platform until we know it's ready and won't impact our schedule. If the C level manager wants us to, then he needs to say so and own the scheduling repercussions.I think the C level guy doesn't like me for some reason, and that's fine. The last time he visited he told my boss that I seemed unhappy.Edit:I'm playing a dangerous game of \"chicken\" with my boss's boss. Because of the storm I caused, the platform team sent out a company wide email with the C level boss on it clarifying timelines, and I responded to the email with a \"Reply to all\" thanking the platform team and acknowledging that if teams adopt the new platform now that their delivery dates may get delayed. I'm pretty sure I'm going to get called into my manager's office over it but can't stand that the C level exec wants to play both sides of the fence.

So a lot of people had a lot of options that were worthless by late 2000 and if they exercised them owed taxes on money they never saw. Its why companies switched to RSUs. A google AI can explain how the taxes work. 2000 hit and people who had been coding since the 1970s were going for $20/hour short term temp jobs. Atleast in DC. the whole market were very low paid 1099 temp jobs that last 2-3 months. This is when I got in. I was competing against people with 20+ years experience for low paid 3 month long temp jobs. I did not live in DC. 1 bedroom apartment in Tysons corner was about $1200/month. So $20-25/hour went farther, but no benefits. Pay back then relative to inflation was MUCH lower. Pay did not explode until 2010s. You got $100k, but not the $500k you got during the boom.",

First they emailed me based on a recommendation from a grad student I knew asking me to meet them at a job fair, they gave a group presentation about their company, then administered a 30 minute written test and scheduled one on one interviews with people who did well on the test. Then they flew people who did well on the interview to California for a long weekend, with the first day giving presentations on different departments in the company, then after lunch a 4 hour programming test. The next day there were interviews in the morning. Early afternoon they met with people one on one and gave some of us a job offer, put some people on a maybe list, and gave others no offer. Then an optional group activity in the afternoon, a nice dinner with the people who got offers.

The Dilbert strip stereotype of managers having no technical skills was very true. Because many businesses that previously had been ran without computers had migrated to being software based. So the people with domain experience, who were now in management, had not started their careers in a software based world. The whole CS domain felt a lot simpler back then. I only needed to know C++, a little MFC, and some SQL basics. Maybe a more senior person would be good with COM.

It’s common to see a PHD or masters as a prerequisite on job listings, let alone just a relevant bachelors. That immediately rules out the bootcamp lot.I can’t speak for other CS jobs and whether the mandatory degree requirement is present. With my employer at least, there are concerns with the wildcard nature of bootcamp/self taught hires, whereby graduates are seen as more consistently good/less risky. So the degree requirement is part of a generalised move to standardise data science and put a level of assurance to baseline expectations of skills. In addition, AI has obviously changed the hiring field and a big concern of employers is hiring someone shit that is propped up by AI. They may assume there is more risk of that with a bootcamp hire vs someone with strong degrees.",

Don’t worry about Kafka and distributed systems in general. There’s tons of projects that don’t use that at all.Your goal is to actually get a professional job and see how stuff works. I am slightly surprised you can get a senior job without ever working. My worry would be - how do you work in a team, are you familiar with code reviews, shared code bases with git, writing architecture documents, clarifying requirements etc. Especially in senior role you get a lot more responsibilities that are not just code, but you need to be able to drive architecture and communicate to management effectively, steering them in the right direction.Regarding questions and what you put into your cv, full stack vs backend - it doesn’t matter. They will hire based on what they need for the role. If the role leaning to front end they will ask more about frontend. The cv won’t change that. So just keep your cv truthful. There’s a lot of backend leaning full stack positions and you fit that, don’t apply to front end leaning positions.Blazor is definitely used and I do see some positions for it. It’s more used in enterprise applications , which I doubt you can get hired as a senior without ever working in that scale before.",

After that, they sent me an email offering me the Senior C# SQL role.I know that I'm not near to a Senior exactly because of what you say, those are the exact same feelings I have. I kept my systems up and running without issue for years but I work alone so fixing problems always has been easy because I know everything about my projects.Yet I feel like I would never be ready and I saw no offers for remote positions for Jrs, I've been looking for them in LinkedIn for weeks, and the market is really harsh for people without a degree to miss this opportunity. I have nothing left to lose, So I applied.I'm hoping the bar is not set too high and I'll just be honest in the interview, I'm not a regular Senior but their requirements didn't say anything about leadership nor complex tasks, so this may be a good fit.Anyways, thanks for answering, I'm glad a human can try to help me, I'm sick of speaking to AI and it just gives me fake hope lol, I'd stick to fullstack with Blazor then, at some point I may find a job with it.Btw, where did you saw the job offers?

I don't think it's that good, but I did get an interview and hoping for a follow up from one listing that was just there.JobGether I found later, it's similar to DailyRemote but it's free. They have a paid service for auto apply that I didn't use, but to access the job listings it doesn't cost anything.I feel like you can find a job in some more old school, small IT team project.

In most interviews I've seen, they test your ability to write clean queries that solve real business questions - things like \"find the top 5 customers by revenue last quarter\" which combines JOINs, GROUP BY, ORDER BY and LIMIT. Window functions (ROW\\_NUMBER, RANK) are nice to have but not always expected at entry level. CTEs are worth learning though since they make complex queries much more readable and interviewers appreciate clean code. One tip for practice: try converting everyday questions into SQL queries. Tools like [ai2sql.io](http://ai2sql.io) can help with this - you describe what you want in plain English and it generates the SQL, which is great for learning query patterns and syntax you might not have seen before.",

Try to get any tech job during your break between school.Something you can try is look for full time jobs in your area. When you see the posting, try to contact through the careers area of the website, email, or if you have to, through the application itself.However you are able to try to contact someone, let them know you are an older student who will be graduating in two years, you are checking out different careers, this one caught your eye, and you are wondering what the career is like, what courses might help, and any advice anyone who will talk to you has.Ask for a phone call, email, or buy them a cup of coffee or lunch. Get the advice and just listen, don't \"but what about, or I heard, or people say\", just listen and ask actually meaningful questions. Right after, and I mean right after, write everything down, whatever you can remember.This is both local advice, networking, and a sort of introduction to an interview.Keep doing this as you can. Keep your eye out for and ask about any local events where IT people meet to talk IT stuff, if you can, try to attend. The goal is to be seen.Getting the degree and being a good fit for the company and the team are what is important. Regardless of what you take, you are not going to really know what you are doing for the first five years, so when people give you free advice, listen.Ideally, you will graduate having had a few tech summer jobs, and have networked with several people. When you are close to graduating, reach out to any of them that gave you their contact info and ask them if they know if any job opportunities. Do this slowly, not all at once, you don't want to burn any bridges.Good luck",

Employer recoups legal fees ($5-20k), risk (visa denial/job loss), less bargaining power (no counteroffers mid-visa).Exceptions: MSFT/GOOG often match post-green card path. Pros for H1B: faster entry, training visas.Advice: 1. [Levels.fyi](http://Levels.fyi) \\+ Blind salary search by visa. 2. Negotiate 'visa fee reimbursement' clause. 3. Target sponsors w/ high approval (Google 95% vs startups 70%). 4. OPT/STEM gap to build leverage.At Big N, H1B L5 earned $450k vs my $520k US - gap closed year 2. What's your level/company?",

I've seen several people who still can't get a job even after doing OMSCS which really makes me question if it's worth it.OMSCS is not going to move the needle in terms of recruiting, most recruiters are aware of the program and its 90% acceptance rate after they've seen thousands of applications of people blasting through Georgia Tech MSCS (online omitted of course). Everytime I say this I get someone pointing out the rigor, which I don't find to be a working argument because any decent engineering program is going to be fairly rigorous in its own right. What recruiters actually care about is name brand and the selectivity signal that comes with prestige. Example in point: a majority of interns are completely useless and are a complete net loss for the company. Having a nice internship from a good big tech is still going to move the needle very favorably resume-wise because of the bar of what it took to be accepted, and the signal to recruiters that you were able to get in a prestigious company, even if you didn't really do anything productive.>I've heard several people say they completely blacklist WGU grads so that's why I'm concerned with just having it on my resume.No one is specifically blacklisting WGU, this seems very unlikely. The simpler and more likely reason at hand is that your resume is probably not competitive enough for the current landscape. Adding OMSCS to your resume is not going to change that either.The reality is that it's going to be very difficult for average CS grads to find work within this environment and landscape. The easier times when many people could reasonably make their way into a decent SWE job have passed, and is most likely not going to come back. SWE payroll has always been one of the biggest costs that companies look to reduce within their financials, and rampant outsourcing and AI have done a lot to cut down on available jobs.",

Also, without such significant supervision that it’s easier to write from scratch, AI screws up.

As SWEs we build products that provide value to customers. Unfortunately users don’t care how scalable a product is (unless there’s an outage), or what design patterns were used, they just want it to work. A sloppily built app with tech debt that works and a better coded app that also works at the end of the day both do the job. I definitely struggled a lot with doing it right vs getting it done at the start of my career and a big thing that helped for me was understanding “blast radius” i.e. if this breaks how bad is it going to be? Why should I care about building a perfect solution for a service only a few customers actually use/care about. Of course customer obsession is a good trait to have, but trying to minmax happiness can help with burnout and understanding what actually needs to be done right.",

You need to get your degree as quickly and as cheaply as possible. I would look at three schools. The first is Western governors University. The second is Thomas Edison State University. The third is University of Maine in presque Isle. All three of these schools take a ton of transfer credits that you have from your associate's degree and your mechanical engineering studies. They also take a ton of alternative credits like clap and other things. In terms of financing it, you probably still have a little bit of money available in terms of government student loans. You might be able to get out of this whole thing for under $10,000 and loans and that will be well worth the cost.Check out the r/WGU and r/umpi subreddits. They're a bunch of major specific subreddits for WGU here as well, but the big one is a great place to start.",

If I know I didn't have a good explanation of a detail on my resume, I can brainstorm a few and practice them until they sound natural. Or if I flubbed a coding section, practice it. Look up the questions I didn't know.I guess you can try to read between the lines of the little feedback you did get too. Like if your profile was impressive, they might have thought your performance didn't match their expectations (for that experience or title before).Or ask for very broad suggestions on places to improve. It could be near the end of the interview itself, before the decisions. Maybe even offering ideas yourself to make it easy for them to parrot it back if you're worried about bothering them. And to show where you think you could best improve.Maybe I've just gotten enough experience finally, but \"culture fit\" (and confidence) has felt really important for a lot of my previous interviews. Do you fit in. Are you like us. Can I work with you, and do I want to. Information can be learned. New tools often are like other tools (new dialect). Is your first instinct like mine (different means unique solutions, same means they'd agree with it).Or they need a Kung Fu master to come in and be the expert/owner. And if you're not that person you aren't a good candidate for them. No shame there. Just not the right shape puzzle piece. Wrong time to talk to them.",

I don’t know if HR sends generic rejections or just ghosts you if we reject.Phone round - I stopped doing this because i felt it’s pretty useless, it was useful screening tool when we didn’t do virtual interviews and instead had in person interviews. Generally I go over work experience, poke around some technical areas, see if you know what you’re talking about or if the resume was exaggerated. Also good opportunity for both parties to calibrate expectations, so we aren’t wasting eachother’s time. Then wrap up with LC easy question, my go to is a graph search algorithm.Onsite/Virtual final round - now this highly depends on the role. For IC I usually do system design round, for other EMs, I’ve done system design and roadmap planning and strategic vision. Main reason I’ve failed people who solved the system design was due to lack of depth in understanding. It’s very clear when they’re regurgitating from a video they’ve seen rather than make live trade off decisions and ask clarifying questions. Did I really say speed was necessary? Or do we care about accuracy and freshness of data? Why are you adding a cache? Did you clarify the DAU and types of requests to be confident in your cache hit rate? You get the picture. For EM side, it’s usually their examples from their previous job lacks the scope we were looking for. “How did you drive alignment across the organization? How many teams were involved? Did you come up with a proposal for leadership? How much coordination tax would this take? What is the risk if we don’t complete?”TL;DR - we’re human, your interviewer needs to like you and you need to fit their similarity bias. Most rejections are because someone better applied, more knowledgeable, better work experience, and just had a good day.",

Id combine info from all 3 and helped define project requirements and also help implement them and then present them back. Obtain feedback and repeat.My university job my boss used to have me stand in for him with certain departments because I was able to translate tech into layman's terms for most people. I became the face for that department for awhile. They'd send me out to talk to campus and gather information and then turn it into requirements as well.I think you're right though, emphasizing that is a key point.The university is in a different state than where I currently live and don't offer remote.

First was Graduate Algorithms. It used to be homework plus exams, but they switched it to basically exam-only for grading. From what I heard, that change happened after one semester where the professor/TAs flagged a bunch of students to the Office of Student Integrity, and most of them ended up winning their cases. After that, they moved to exams only.Second was AI course. They rolled out a VS Code based IDE called NOSI that tracks all of your activity. And in that class, you’re not allowed to use AI at all, or even the internet. You’re expected to rely strictly on the textbook, lectures, and write your code in that IDE. It also got two take-home exams that are like 50 pages each, and you get a week for each one, also no internet allowed.Third was Machine Learning. This one is the complete opposite, you can use as much AI as you want, even to generate all of your code. But the class is so hard that even with AI, it still took me like 20–30 hours a week (so they basically made the course almost impossible to get through without using AI). On top of that there’s also an Honorlock-proctored exam.So yeah, just from these 3 classes alone, it’s basically three totally different approaches to dealing with AI tools.",

My school had tools to find for cheating on coding assignments which were like 80% of the grade. I got caught once and got away with a 0 on the assignment (brougth my grade down from a B to B-) but i knew people who got caught for like 10 assignemnts and went from an A to an F. It was professor dependent too, i knew people who got caught for 1 assignment and failed the whole calss. SO i was terrified to even google anything. Im not sure how it is today, but imagine that tool has updated for AI as well. If there's AI to help code, im willing to bet there's AI to help find cheating and these programs/projects have millions of dollars, i don thtink they mind spending a few hundred dollars to help find cheating in the program.",

Most of the applied stuff is stuff you eventually pick up in the industry based on years of career specialization. It's fine to have an interest in many different specializations, but it's not particularly realistic to expect that schooling is gonna bridge the gaps (which are more like chasms for the breadth of things you're listing)More realistic is pick one thing and go deep in that. Pivoting professionally generally assumes you'll work your way into the relevant experience somehow, either through lateral moves in your current employer or startup experience or something along those lines, rather than starting from scratch as a new grad junior all over again.",

I disagree with comments saying going back to school for CS can't hurt, because it absolutely can hurt to study while working full time: your bank account, your relationships, your health. I had a lot of difficult life events happen almost as soon as I started the OSU program that made the whole experience really painful. Don't take the decision lightly",

The imposter syndrome is real, but tbh I think you're overthinking this.Here's the thing about those foundational gaps you mentioned. Yeah, they're important for certain roles, but for the path you're describing (backend dev, cloud infrastructure, applied ML), you can absolutely fill those gaps without going back to school. I've been learning this stuff in real time while building, and honestly some of the best engineers I know are self-taught or have non-CS degrees.The AI systems architect goal is totally doable without a formal CS degree. What matters more is understanding how to design scalable systems, knowing your way around cloud platforms, and having practical experience with ML workflows. I'm seeing this firsthand - we're building Sprout (an AI job search tool) and the technical challenges are more about system design, data pipelines, and user experience than theoretical CS concepts. The foundational stuff comes up, but you learn it when you need it.That said, if you do want structured learning, there are way more efficient options than a full degree program. MIT OpenCourseWare has excellent systems courses, Coursera has solid ML specializations, and honestly YouTube + building projects will teach you more practical skills than most university programs. The Georgia Tech OMSCS program is solid if you really want the credential later, but you could probably test into it with your existing experience and some strategic self-study.The real question is whether you need the degree for credibility or just the knowledge. For backend/cloud/systems architecture roles, your portfolio and ability to solve problems matters way more than your diploma. Plus you're already employed and gaining experience - that's honestly more valuable than classroom time right now.What specific foundational concepts are you feeling most lost on in your current work? That might help you prioritize what to tackle first without the whole degree commitment.",

Honestly, lately, i tend to prompt engineer a lot of my work, especially boiler plate tasks. Not because I can’t solve it myself but just to expedite tasks that would have otherwise been super tedious. Of course, i always make sure to double check what’s been implemented.Anyways, i came to realize that I don’t really encounter too much heavy math or really any of the foundational topics i mentioned in my post. Well, except maybe data structures and algorithms. But I know for a fact I can just revisit those topics on my own. Even then, the type of data structures and algorithms that I come across or use aren’t really all too complicated.I guess i’d like to pivot into something with a little more “job security”. I feel like ai systems management is the way to go. But, to be perfectly frank, i haven’t taken much of a deep dive with system design nor machine learning. Im just at that stage where I’m thinking about pivoting into those roles. Right now im doing mostly basic crud both fe and be. Which is why im wanting to do something that’s a little more future proof. That’s why im considering perhaps going back to school. To learn the fundamentals of cs. But, I honestly do feel that I can teach myself these things. The tricky thing is coming up with a solid structure/strategy. In fact, i asked chat gpt and it actually did lay out a pretty solid plan. Thank you for those course recommendations btw, ill make sure to look into those. Maybe it’s the confirmation bias talking (i really do try to look both sides of the equation), but your response has sort of helped put my mind at ease. Honestly, I’m fine with hearing both sides. I just like not keep all of this bottled up in my head as I tend to overthink. I generally go with my intuition, but, it’s still good to keep an open mind. Thanks again for your perspective",

I fear leaving my current company will end up being the same.
