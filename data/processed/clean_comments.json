What i am trying to say, anyone doing serious engineering even then shouldn’t rely on pandas in the first place anyway.IMO polars have less intuitive API from the perspective of an analyst but it’s much better for engineers. If your time are mostly spend on doing the mental work of wrangling data, the tools that are much user friendly is much preferable. The same reason why python is popular. Ofc there’s a factor where you can do rust/cpp bindings but in general it’s more to do with how python is much more user friend interactive scripting language. So the “faster” tool is not an end all be all, there are trade offs to be made",

I have yet to hear a good story of why an org moved onto Fabric (except C-level pushes) and ‘unification’ (marketing fluff) while all engines operate completely separate. And then I have not even mentioned the integration to broader Microsoft tooling; it is a pain to even get data to ADLS (what..) with FDF missing ADLS as sink location. Honestly, I had hoped Microsoft to push a product which commercially could challenge the big names (SF / DBX), but so far it is in a heavy compete with itself.",

I work in Norway and rather not describe the industry, as it is such a niche thing that a google search will hit us on page 1 lol - but it is a big and profitable industry :)Current project: establishing Snowflake as a data platform for enabling large-scale internal analytics on structured data. Basically involves: setting pipelines to copy data from operational databases into analytical databases (+ setting up jobs to pre-calculate tables for analysis team)Data size: a few TBs in total, but daily ingestion of < 1Gb.Stack: AWS Lambda (in Python) to write data from AWS RDS as parquet in S3 (triggered by EventBridge daily); (at the moment) Snowflake Tasks to ingest data from S3 into raw layer in Snowflake; Dynamic Tables to create tables in Snowflake from its Raw layer up to user's consumption; PowerBI as BI tool.Architecture choice was to divide our data movement in 2 main parts: \\- Part 1: From our operational databases to parquet files in S3 \\- Part 2: From parquet in S3 to Snowflake raw layer.Inside Snowflake, other pipelines to move from RAW to analytical-ready layer (under construction/consideration, but most likely will be dbt building dynamic tables) -> so a medallion architecture.The idea was to keep data movement as loosely coupled as possible. This was doable because we dont have low-latency requirements (daily jobs are more than enough for analytics)In my opinion, keeping the software developer mindset while designing architecture was the biggest leverage I had (modularity and loose coupling being the 2 main ones that came to mind). Two books that I highly recommend are \"Design Data Intensive Applications\" (for the theoretical aspects on why certain choices for modern data engineering are relevant) and \"Software Architecture: The hard parts\" (for the software engineering trade-offs that are actually applied to data architectures)",

Here are my two cents *with a twist* on it. **Type of firm** FinOps - SW Procurement and IT Cost Management**Current project brief description** Building Data Platform for Client Expenditure Reports**Data size** \\~2B records raw (source), \\~1M aggregated (target)**Stack and architecture** PySpark, SQL, Azure (Databricks and SQL Database), GitHub**Brief explanation of the flow** 0. Multiple datasources (files, DBs, APIs) -> 1. DataFactory pipelines, transferring data to Databricks (Catalogs) -> 2. Writing custom transformations (Notebooks) -> 3. Packing them in separate Jobs and scheduling execution -> 4. Transferring data to Azure SQL DB. -> 5. Data used in (PowerBI) reports.**Two cents** I'm working in a small, but very capable team - initially we were a band of three, since recently only two persons, so we get occasional helping hand from SWE Tech Lead when load becomes too big. We don't have dedicated architect nor major restraints regarding stack, other than to have pipelines running inside Azure Databricks (medallion arch ofc). We started this project from scratch, having *all the freedom* regarding implementation. Currently we are in our 8th month, approximately two more to finish this phase (creating and migrating all reports from old to new platform). Biggest lesson learned - **DO NOT** get in love with your code! If project is constantly growing, take time and effort to make sure you **still** have scalable solution. Don't be afraid to completely overhaul your solution. We refactored our complete codebase 2 times already. First time right after our very first successful production run (4 month into the project). It wasn't good for the moral because we put great effort to come up with working solution at that time, but we knew we had to re-do almost everything if we were going to add more things in near future. Felt low-on-fuel, but overall happy with what we had. Second one came just a month after all that, in order to accommodate some intra-company changes... Didn't sit right with us, especially because we were short-staffed at that moment, but went for it. And it's the best thing we could have done! Now we have highly reusable code, flexible to implement any new request and not worry of breaking any existing feature. And finally, the **Twist** If you want to learn more (quickly) about DA, kickstart some personal project! Try to solve something that's dear to you. Leverage available vibe/ai-tools if you want to come up with full-stack solution, trust me it's worth the effort! I've dived into two personal projects since summer (one NBA fantasy related, other for organizing my pick-up basketball group) and I couldn't be happier to see them up and running, and even used by some complete strangers! That way I branched out (and returned) to some other tools, services and methodologies (Airflow, Postgres, Supabase, CORS etc.) which I probably won't touch in my current company. I feel like I've expanded my horizons in more ways and topics from this experience than with any other work/company related one. You get to wear multiple technical hats, call all the shots and learn from your (and only your) mistakes.Anyhow, whichever learning path you decide to take, make sure to \\*enjoy the process! \\^\\^ ^(\\*but don't fall in love with your code/solution :D)",

Dagster orchestrates ingress, transformation and egress on various schedules (weekly, daily or hourly during operational hours). Almost all assets in dagster have proper dependencies set so all flow nicely. Snowflake us relatively recent for us but has massively improved our execution times. My main current focus for improvement is observability as it's no where near the way I want it. Then after that improving the analysts data modelling ability and tidying up the DBT sprawl. I'm pretty proud of achieving all this within 2 years as when I arrived there were just two dozen silo'd R scripts on an EC2 cron job working only on production web data on top of postgres. Being the sole engineer is great but it does mean I have to stuff I don't like. I hate AWS networking haha. Hope this helps",

What she had was the mother load of common sense and soft skills that could turn a honey badger into a kids pet.She was a listener, someone whose mantra was trust but verify. She expected you to know and do your job. She'd fight for (and mostly win) when we told her we needed resources.

Would describe themselves as a \"Thought Leader\" and clearly believed they were a 12x developer. That meant they wouldn't listen. Thought they new it all, made fundamental decisions in isolation without consultation. They turned the data estate into a data sewage farm.He wasn't evil, malicious or unpleasant as a person.

Yes they have some shared principles good CI/CD, task-management methodologies, problem solving. But row-oriented thinking applied to data-engineering will lead to a lot of inefficient, costly and terrible solutions. And you will be banging your head against a manager that thinks that way, everytime you suggest things should be done in a certain way.

To them the costs just weren't real. People across the company assume IT costs are just \"The cost of doing business\".They are interested in what they are bonussed on. This will be revenue generation, adding new features but unlikely to be cost reduction. They also assume that things automagically happen; that you are doing the 10 billion things they want AND finding time to shovel years of tech debt shit.It takes a lot of skill to design a bonus scheme that doesn't result in negative results in the medium/long term. In my experience the C Suite rarely have that skill or foresight.As an ex-DBA I tune queries and code as a matter of personal pride. It's caring because it's in my nature and what lets me sleep at night. Eventually the accumulation of unturned code and queries does catch up with you. Eventually the cost of throwing hardware at it is just too great. I notice that experienced DEs tune to. It's an uphill battle when the company just wants a magic feature pump and will reward feature pump behaviour.If you run your own datacentre there is a physical constraints on how many servers, cooling systems, power conduits and racks you can fit within 4 walls. Eventually your unturned shit will hit this limit and that's when a C Suite noticeable bill comes due.",

A company might have tons of things they can do but resources are limited and cashflow is essential for stability so sometimes you might have something that is profitable but it doesn't align with the cashflow plan and resource management (people) or even it's outside of what the company is invested on (that's a balance execs usually decide on).That's why very big companies hire tons of people to fire them afterwards (bad resource management and cashflow). For instance, they hire 100 people because the numbers of query optimisation show that they payoff but in the end they don't and even if they do query optimisation will not create cashflow which makes resource allocation in the end a tricky matter.",

If you plan to use it as an ETL tool for transformations, it is not designed for it. It is there only to ingest data and it works well for that purpose. Main advantages are it can be deployed on a container within your network(more work to configure) where it runs next to your sources will PUSH data to Snow (no need for open inbound firewalls) OR can be hosted in your account fully managed by Snow which then will PULL the data (will need to open up firewalls to allow). For most Databases, it uses the lightweight change tracking features of the host database (not the CDC which uses a lot of resources on host server) so you don't need to install agents in your network or on the DB servers. I have many customers who use it for this purpose perfectly fine. As long as you use it to replicate and use other Snow Data engineering features for Transforms, it should get the job done.",

You can't really bring a software development mindset into designing a data analytics environment (though software engineering skills and practices are certainly valuable for parts of it) The best starter kit I'd recommend that lets you start simple and lightweight and local and then grow is Dagster+dbt. Go through the Dagster+dbt tutorial and examples to set up a monorepo that contains both projects. Until you deploy a persistent server instance somewhere, they're both just python packages you can import and run locally. I like to use uv and require them both into different dependency groups within the same root `pyproject.toml`. Using Dagster as a hub you can get really close to the full stack opinionated framework feeling for analysis you can do notebooks out of that repo or use Evidence. Dagster can alert on result conditions",

Besides a managed opinionated runtime with nice ci and an \"implicit data mesh\" architecture, adds a transformation engine that enables runtime-agnostic code via python or sql.With end to end lineage, metadata etc and python native, this is also a LLM-native dev tool with some impressive results. I won't spoil it, but transformations don't need to be so time consuming either. we were experimenting with adding boring semantic layer.we are going to release the \"one man data team\" version (with limited collaboration features, think small teams) end of q1 next year.So if you're a team of 1-5, apply for our early access linked above :)",

        "body": "Few thoughts\\- How good an option moving home is depends on where you are from, what the economics are. If you're in the UAE and you feel trapped, makes me wonder if you're from a developing country where UAE is offering a good alternative.\\- People with jobs are almost always more attractive to employers than people without. Is there a reason searching for new jobs while staying in your current job is not an option? Could you search for different jobs in UAE or at home whilst still in your current one?\\- 5 hour commute is absolutely insane. Doing anything you can, even accepting worse housing options or conditions, or paying more for housing, may be worth getting back that time. Even if you had one hour back from commute, that's 1 hour you could develop your skills, or meditate and try and separate yourself from the stress of work, or search for jobs, or just relax. Giving you more personal time will multiply your effectiveness both at work, at self improvement, and at pushing your career.\\- freelance or remote work seems extremely difficult and competitive. It will probably need you to be good at optimising your offerings to clients, being a good salesman, good at negotiating more work,, etc etc. If you are struggling with stakeholder management at your UAE job, this may not be the way.\\- Real life experience >>>> bootcamps and self driven projects, unless you are very good at learning real life 2skills from self driven projects (past positive achievements in this would be a green flag).\\- Again back to the jobs thing, bootcamps, freelance, etc puts you in the desparate masses of unemployed tech. Having an actual, real data job elevates you above everyone else in the bottom of the barrel. Don't take your foot out of the door unless you are ok with it closing, or you have another door open elsewhere.\\- For your UAE job, you have to step back from your tech focus and focus on people skills, expectations management, and building alliances.1. Find smart, driven people in the org who understand you and are receptive to the problems. Recruit them as allies. Find out what they need and support them. Example from my work. Normally, cybersecurity and data have an adversarial relationship. Data wants to move data and make it accessible, cyber wants to say no, to wrap everything in paperwork. But by meeting with the cybersecurity guy, saying noone in my dept cares about cybersecurity, wants to make it happen, I want to do it, help me, we become friends. I speak up for cybersecurity in my department, he is careful with how he rolls out cybersecurity (he avoids saying \"no\" reflexively because he knows I can be trusted, and he needs to balance security vs useablity), he speaks up for my data needs as a precondition for effective security in meetings, etc.2. Your job sounds like a consultant job. Consultants have the problem all the time of being parachuted into crazy broken situations with clients who want everything fixed, but don't have much money and are defensive about change (dogwithfrisbeeinmouthmeme.jpg - only fix, no diagnose or make us look bad!). This is a huge industry so learn from consultants about how to come in, get the client on your side, help talk them around to fixes without making them look bad, change management, etc etc. Youtube, books etc might be a help here.3. Expectations management, expectations management, expectations management. You need pitch decks about what you will be doing, what might come up, and how this can help them. etc etc.",

Classifying and categorising data, re-organising or re-mapping data from one schema onto another, debugging heavy data-pipelines where expected outcomes don't match intended ones with large wait-times between executions, improving performance and knowing how to partition data sets so that complex workflows can be partitioned (without spoiling the logic) into smaller, but consistently independent sub-sets. Fuzzy matching, probabilistic matching, joining on multiple identity columns/definitions, blah blah blah - if you've soaked up some of those kinds of problems in a reconciliations environment, you'll be surprised how often they come up in different situations.As you mention, a lot of those \"garage-clearance\" problems are at the root of what stands in the way of success in any large organisation - this is the type of work that an Enterprise or Data Architect would seek to address/solve - so if you've got the stomach for trying to fix those kinds of very real problems, that might be an angle to look into - entry might be through a Solutions Architect route, where you get to design specific systems targeted at solving specific problem areas - that was my \"in\", and I found it presented a nice wide range of things to work on, while keeping a reasonable focus project per project. What you're also noticing is that there's a set of things that separate \"what looks good\" from what's been rushed or hidden due to incompetence. A good architect needs to be able to demonstrate one from the other.If you get the change to study some TOGAF that can help give you some useful language and tools to shape larger projects both at a Solutions level, or if you want to go in that direction at an Enterprise level. Data Architects are still a bit of a nebulous term, with no real solution/enterprise level distinction. (Personal gripe on my part, I often go into a role as a DA, but sometimes the expectation is to provide modelling and understanding support, and then in another project, I might be asked to spec out a data platform on some new cloud-based data platform - totally different tasks/roles, both called Data Architects! - v annoying)But best of luck, it can be frustrating to find yourself mid-career in a role/situation that doesn't stretch you, or support your development - part of that you've already overcome in identifying the problem, so compared to 70% of folks, you're already making the right moves.",

Wire lineage and tests into the run: OpenLineage for run metadata, Great Expectations or dbt tests as gates, and fail fast with alerts to Slack/PagerDuty that include run links. Lock interfaces with data contracts so schema drift breaks CI, not prod. Promotion path: infra as code for env parity, MLflow as the model registry, shadow/canary deploys, and a feature store (Feast) to keep train/serve consistent. Have one dashboard for ops with logs, metrics, and run status; Datadog or Grafana + Loki works.With Prefect and MLflow handling runs and model registry, DreamFactory helps when we need quick REST APIs over Snowflake/SQL Server so product teams can call models and tables without spinning up new services.Make failure obvious, standardize the path, and production stops taking months.",

It requires thoughtful design and a solid foundation, and most companies aren’t interested in making that investment early on. Eventually, they’re forced to care once they’ve exhausted all other options.In the end, the trade-off is obvious: if you want things delivered quickly, you sacrifice quality.

A production pipeline should never fail silently. If the issue is more on the SLA side you can use an observability tool external to Airflow that supports SLAs or a control Dag that flags if a Dag that should have run did not. Also make sure you have a good way to forward issues to the person who developed the prototype so there is a feedback loop to catch patterns that cause production issues.\\>  too many moving parts (Airflow jobs + custom scripts + cloud functions) That one is tricker, might help to have a more defined CICD workflow and if it is not the case yet having everything in version control, so no part gets changed without validating the change does not break anything. Also clear code ownership.\\> no single place to see what’s running, what failed, and whyThe budget solution here is to add Airflow Dags that check what is running and what failed (control Dag again), the fancier solution is to add lineage to your deployment and evaluate that through an observability tool.\\> models stuck because infra isn’t readyMight be helpful to orchestrate infra provisioning from within the same pipeline as the models with a setup task before the model related tasks and a teardown one afterwards.\\> engineers spending more time fixing orchestration than building featuresThere is an upfront time cost but all of the above should help with this. :)\\> business teams waiting weeks for something that “worked fine in the notebook”Same; that hopefully will get faster once the processes and best practices are in place. Which I know is always a battle to communicate to business teams why reliability and maintainability work matters. What I've done before is trying to explain it like this:The notebook is like having working prototype of a car. We can drive it around, verify that it runs great. But having the feature/model in production means we have to make many cars automatically, build a whole car factory. If we have to build all the robots that make the cars from scratch that will take a while but if we take the time to build very flexible good robots, eventually building a new car factory will be fast as well. And maybe we can even start to quickly build a bicycle factory if needed.",

        "body": "Hmm, tricky. So you're computing over long baseline rolling windows, and you're wrestling with the fact that- old records can receive long-delayed updates- that could meaningfully change your past computed values- bringing those values closer to 'the truth'- but the source system has no recorded update timestamp that you could use to decide which data to include in the batch, only a unique ID for each record?(Before I suggest something, let me just note that there's a solution space that involves talking to whomever it is that controls the upstream and persuading them about the merits of SCD fields. But assuming that's not an option:)How about this:- you have to load _all_ data into GCS every day because of the lack of update timestamps- use GCS lifecycle rules to quickly move old data into archival storage: you're not going to need it unless you need to run the entire process from the top- in your warehouse, create staging tables:1. CDC table, which persists (more on this below)2. today's batch, overwritten entirely every day, simple upload from GCS3. change table, created every day by comparing (1) with (2) to find rows that have changed (for example, using `EXCEPT DISTINCT` if supported by your warehouse)Now, the idea is to update the CDC table using the change table. It should have a couple of extra columns vs the source: `valid_from` and `valid_until`. You filter on `valid_until IS null` when constructing the change table, to get the latest version of each record. Otherwise, you ignore these columns when constructing the change table.If a row with a certain ID appears in the change table, you first need to update its latest record in the CDC table, such that `valid_until` is changed from `null` to yesterday's date. That record now tells you that the row changed in today's batch; it had those values yesterday, but not today.Finally, you insert the new version of the row (from the change table) into the CDC table, setting `valid_from` to today's date and `valid_until` to `null`: this is now the current version of the row.I think this gets you where you need to be:- the CDC table is a persistent record of all changes- it can be rebuilt from scratch in an emergency, by iterating the above process over the old data batches in GCS archival storage- you can `SELECT * FROM cdc_table WHERE valid_until IS null` to build the current version of the data; you can then compute your rolling window over _that_ table",

        "body": "Im going for simplicity:Instead of upserting as an ingestion pattern, I would instead append the full source table to your raw table in GCP. Uses the fact that storage is cheap and keeps the ingestion simple and straightforward.During ingestion, add an extracted_at timestamp column. Afterwards as a post-processing step, dedup by keeping the record with the most recent extracted_at timestamp per unique key (using row_number() over the composite key partition for example). Index/cluster on the timestamp and composite unique key for performance.If recording the exact changes (SCD2) is not part of the current requirement, I think this approach keeps the ingestion simple, produces less logic to maintain, and is flexible enough to allow for a more complex logic in the future when the need arises (you can recompute/backfill as you have all of the raw data).You always keep the most recent version of each unique entitiy in your table, thereby having an exact copy of source. This approach also handles deletes in source.Lastly the real solution here is collaboration with the upstream owners of the data. Sit with them and figure out if there is a way to add a CDC field to the source. Or ingest with cdc on logs. In any case communication and collaboration will always be the more sustainable and cheapest solution over overengineering.",

The idea being that the analysts will deal with any transformations etc once it’s there. Only other requirement being to retain historical data that the source system will eventually drop after 6 months. Initial plan was to just overwrite changed records based on our primary keys, rather than create new records with Valid To and Valid From fields.

They're doing what they should have done all along, which is copying the data to local SSD, and more of it than the token few GB they had on their previous nodes. Doing that requires keeping nodes up longer to load and make use of the larger cache.So they've now come full circle to MPP with SSD cache and shared storage, also known as Vertica Eon or maybe Redshift. But there's no sharding so enjoy the distributed shuffles (or maybe not, see below).Even after this realization they don't provision enough of it; the largest storage tier is 16TB. Even if we double that to guess the maximum, that's at least an order of magnitude smaller than a typical medium or large-scale warehouse. For example the last cluster I worked on had 450TB of SSD.It's also horrible in other ways such as requiring a full table refresh from a source table instead of updates, so the interactive data lags. There's no way to load an interactive table directly, so customers pay twice, once for a source table and once for the interactive one.They warn that warming the cache could take an hour -- that's a clue that they're using storage-intensive instance types; most i series have about that SSD-to-network bandwidth ratio. In fact it's possible that they're vertically scaling on a single node instead of a cluster to avoid their shuffle problem; the limits are similar.",

Execs were desperate for dashboards in real-time despite there being no practical application. However as technology improved and this became easier the cost to benefit was proven to be lacking and people started to realise that NRT was a niece requirement certainly in the arena of analytics. From my experience it all about what decision can be made and if you business has a process setup to make that decision. No point having any kind of MI that refreshes every second if your people who action only look at a dashboard in the morning and after lunch and cant do anything with that info anyway. Ive recently finished reversing a lot of near Realtime pipelines as they are expensive and add complication to what really is a batch BI process.

The thing I notice talking to people in complex workflows is that most of the real pain comes from understanding how data behaves across systems, how to keep things reliable, and how to reason about failures. You already have years of that.Streaming helps when the business truly needs low latency, but plenty of teams still run on well designed batch work. If you’re worried about the gap, picking up a small personal project or contributing to something internal can be enough to show you understand the concepts. I wouldn’t assume you’re stuck or that your experience doesn’t translate. Senior roles usually care more about how you think about reliability than whether you’ve used one specific tool.",

It can still help to get some hands on experience, even if it’s something small at your current job, since it shows you can reason about event driven patterns.

But the current state of the job market makes that difficult.Next best: move internally or upgrade the responsibilities of your current role. It is worth having a direct discussion about development goals with your manager (assuming they are a reasonable person). I would also ask directly how you can move into the \"real\" dev team. The answer might disappoint you but it will help you decide on next steps.The most likely situation is that you will be stuck in your current role for a period of time. You will need to make the most of it. The upside to this is that you are directly involved in customer onboarding and therefore revenue generation, so your job is likely to be safer than the developers.To do that I would push standardisation of projects as strongly as you can. Migration inputs should follow target a standardised schema with a well defined spec for all fields. That then allows you to work on building tools to automate as much of the process as possible. For example, comprehensive validation and data quality checks, with automatically generated reporting outputs.You can follow a similar approach to reporting: standardise and automate. Push back on customization. Even if it is a potential revenue stream, customised reporting is effectively low margin contract work and will be a maintenance nightmare in the long term. Focus on the business reasons and less on your personal motivations for avoiding this type of work.And of course work on your skills outside of work. Build an end to end pipeline using one of the big cloud platforms. This can be extremely simple from a data modelling perspective.

So, the question for me is always, how easy is it to customize that last little bit? Is there a framework/tool that covers the common stuff, and has a way to easily add a bit more custom behavior to meet those last few things, whatever they are. And, of course, \"how risky is it to adopt this tool?\" -- is it too new/untested? Is it too old/dying out? Or is it \"just right.\"",

After you do that go back and update the control table.There are a few finer points to this but this is a simple diy solution that can be easily coded.",

Jk, in all seriousness if you want a C level role you need to build your own personal brand image up to match. Talk at seminars, start a website, create video content, etc. But you also need leadership skills obviously you’re wasting your time otherwise. My old manager did that and it got him from Engineering manager at a F500 company to Senior Director of Engineering at another F500 within 3 years. And a director role at a FAANG company in between. I feel like I have a greater amount of technical knowledge than him as an IC, but… he has charisma, confidence, leadership skills, knowledge of best practices, and a great personal brand image. And he had my back as a manager so people like me are willing to help him succeed however we can.",

There is then a calculated measure in the view for the relevant measure (amount * measure_name)There are obvious trade offs to consider: - we reduced storage requirements on the facts by 85%- incremental update now takes 10 mins rather than 1.5 hours. - Additionally if a full financial period needs re loading it’s 20 mins as opposed to 2+ hours- The user’s report experience slightly slower query performance overall, however we mitigated by making optimisations elsewhere (removing unnecessary fields / complex calculations)",

The rest is done on the go.You can start with LinkedIn learning or YouTube to find out basics of DataBrics to be able to run some code. Then you find that the source is maybe some S3. OK let's find out how to load data from S3 with spark. Then you manipulate the data and write it.Then you find the process being slow, so you start reading about spark configuration....

Anything outside of that is an anomaly and needs excluding or, per a more enterprise context, flagging as a DQ error/problem.

It’s not meant to solve every problem, but if a company constantly brings in new data sources or its existing schemas change several times a year, and it still needs clean, consistent data to work with, Data Vault fits that situation very well.Recently I was Data Architecting in a project, where Data Vault was the solution to the client’s issues. A mid-sized company running an HR platform had thousands of clients but a small internal team, so they relied on many external tools: onboarding, contracts, bookkeeping, payments, their main app, and several new systems planned for the next year. Each tool had its own user table (some even had several users tables), and none of them matched. If you ran count(*) on each system’s user table, you got different numbers every time. Each system stored different pieces of information. Analysts didn’t know which database had the data they needed. Even when they found the right one, joining across systems caused rows to disappear, so they couldn’t trust anything.Data Vault solved this cleanly. We created a single Hub_User table that lists every user across all systems. For each subsystem, we added a satellite tables that hold the columns coming from each system. Everything is connected using the same hash key, so joins always work the same way. Analysts now start from Hub_User, and they know exactly where each system’s data lives. Nothing gets lost during joins. When the company adds another tool next year, the team will only need to add one more satellite, and none of the existing reports will break.This kind of constant change is normal in real data environments, and DV is a design pattern for that. I would say that it’s definitely not for newbies and requires discipline. But it’s true for all design patterns :)",

Using dbt, we then flatten and unnest the raw JSON into one or more structured tables based on this schema.We’ve also developed a Python utility that can generate the necessary dbt code automatically for any given data contract, streamlining the initial setup of the entire process. This process will not work if the JSON scheme is dynamic. For dynamic schema, Snowflake has a feature called INFER_SCHEMA that can read the metadata and generate the schema of the JSON.

As to your question, if you have spreadsheets that have similar or same info listed under different labels, then yes. You may have import tables where you upload your spreadsheets initially and can settle for \"NAME\" instead of Owner, Buyer, etc. But to get to 3NF, you want to get to a point where you only have one table that has the NAME column on it with other info. You don't want to have multiple tables with the same type of data.Take time to define what you want from this CRM database. Flesh out the details of reports you want to run. Keep in mind some report data is derived from facts in the database and aren't necessarily stored as underlying data. Also have a handle on the data you are importing. Iterate how you will map that data to your new data structure. Once you have a line of sight on how your raw data will map to your normalized database and that then generates your reports, create your objects.Also see [diagrams.net](http://diagrams.net), it's FOSS flowchart tool.

As a side note once you do this you could migrate off spreadsheets to cloud tool like Airtable that is a little more enterprise like for a CRM tool. It has the feel of a spreadsheet with the some of power of database tables. Back to the original question, renaming column names across spreadsheets in the theory shouldn't be a problem unless you have some wicked formulas that depend on unique column names. You could always make a copy of the excel spreadsheets and try using the FIND and REPLACE function to do renaming across the sheets. If it doesn't work or causes issues then you haven't killed your main CRM files. Happy to look at a few screen shots of what you are wanting to do and provide more targeted help.",

The engineers and analysts propose solutions, but I approve and modify them. Sometimes they have no idea, and I also come up with the architecture. All architecture decisions are documented in the Wiki in DevOps. That has become our repository of everything. We are getting in the habit of pointing people to the wiki whenever they have questions. It isn't a perfect process. We are still refining it, but this is knocking out about 80% of what caused us tech debt. Only downside is that it bottlenecks architecture.

The tech specs must be extremely lightweight, ideally literally code, since code is unambiguous, but point to a table of use cases they adhere to. They are contract driven development from the top of the vertical slice if your vision of full stack includes the operational concerns of the business too.This is not my job, I force product managers to make that table or I quit the company (fair enough if there are no PMs and we're super small). This way the documentation and solution design is in lockstep with the use cases and so is the codebase, and collaboration on changes can and **\\*must\\*** happen asynchronously. No meetings unless we really need to fight over something.

You wouldn't be reading from Athena you'd be reading from s3 wherever the glue table points to.You mention Databricks in the title and that you're writing to it, then never bring it up again. If you were writing for Databricks you'd just write to s3, not to redshift, but you actually wouldn't do anything at all because Databricks could read the glue catalog table directly. The redshift option does a delete on every row before loading the data. Some amount of time would be wasted doing these individual row deletes. If you're deleting everything just do a truncate first, or load to a staging table https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_TRUNCATE.htmlThe redshift options also hint that using glue to run spark is a waste of time - the \"tempformat\" shows it will temporarily save data as parquet then use a redshift COPY to load it in. With a four catalog table as the source redshift should be able to copy it directly and you can skip the glue job. Even it it can't, just have glue write a compatible parquet file separately first, then run the copy, so it is at least obvious which takes how long. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Loading-data-from-S3.html",

With the second approach you still get the risk of even if the AI does manage to generate syntactically valid SQL, it will probably eventually end up doing stupid stuff like dropping predicates and writing wacky expensive cross joins.Realistically in the end, users’ questions are probably going to boil down to a maybe a handful of truly distinct problems, so if you haven’t already it would be worth doing a bit of research to understand how people in different roles use the system now and what data they access (or what they ask other people for), so you can prioritise those endpoints.",

        "body": "Cron sounds like the right solution to me :-) If you already have the feedback script and are currently executing it directly through the shell, setting up a cron job to automatically handle the process is very simple.Don't worry if you haven't worked with cron before; once you dive in it's simple to use. Essentially, cron lets you schedule a script to automatically run on a schedule. For example, if you want to run the feedback loop (let's call it \\`feedback.py\\`) every 6 hours, you would simply edit the crontab. This is done directly in your shell by running \\`crontab -e\\`. Then add the following line: \\`0 \\*/6 \\* \\* \\* /path/to/your/script/feedback.py\\`.This tells your server to execute the \\`/path/to/your/script/feedback.py\\` scripts every 6 hours. How often the script should run depends a lot on how you use the feedback, and how much traffic you have.Feel free to send me a message if you need any help!",

Even with advanced AI assistance, I don't think it's feasible for companies to hire totally fresh junior devs and train them up to a senior level in a reasonable amount of time. You could try hiring a senior dev from another company but those are definitely going to be in short supply if this keeps up. Juniors can only get the experience needed for senior roles by actually working and contributing to projects. It's kind of like the same problem Japan and Korea are currently facing with the low birth rates. As the older population dwindles, if there aren't enough bodies to fill their positions everything is going to get smaller and slow down, which is the exact opposite of what basically every company wants.",

        "body": "The reason to study C is not because the language itself is interesting, or because it's especially useful for real-world programming.The reason is that C is such a simple and low-level language that it allows you to \"see\" the guts of how things actually work, instead of having them hidden from you.For instance, when you start using Java you'll immediately encounter the object-oriented programming style. You'll see things like objects, classes, methods, inheritance, etc. And from the perspective of a Java programmer, all that stuff just works \"by magic\", because the Java compiler and the JVM implement everything for you. Whereas if you think about how to implement the same thing in C, you'll be peeling back the layers of abstraction and you'll be forced to learn more about what's actually happening under the hood.The same thing applies to data structures. In Java, you can just declare an `ArrayList` that automatically resizes itself to fit the data it contains. C doesn't contain such a resizable array type, but you can implement it yourself using the lower-level primitives such as `malloc` and `realloc`. And doing that work yourself forces you to really understand what's going on. Writing something like that in C is a way to force yourself not to \"cheat\" by taking advantage of existing higher-level constructs.Even if you never plan to *use* C for any real projects, I personally believe that understanding low-level programming will help make you a better developer in the long run. (For one thing, it helps you get a better understanding of performance. In higher-level languages, the speed of a given piece of code depends largely on the behavior of many layers of abstraction that are being hidden from you. In C, what you write is much closer to what the CPU actually executes.)But having said that: as a student, I don't think you should prioritize learning C over the actual courses that you're being graded on. Just study it on your own as time allows.",

And even that obviously takes lots of practice, even for the best actors.Expecting you to know everything without looking stuff up, is expecting you to be a computer. You are not a computer. Relax. You can use the computer to look stuff up; it is fine. Now, if you have to look ... up ... every ... single ... solitary ... word ... or ... something ... like ... that ...then at a certain point, it's going to be too hard to communicate with someone. I think it's similar with working with a computer. If you have to pause at every line of code to look something else up, then it's going to feel like an eternity to write a moderately complex program. However, if you have to stop at certain points to look up how to do a certain API call, or to look up how a certain algorithm works, etc. then to me this is just like stopping to look up a good word to use in a dictionary or thesaurus, something which I regularly do when writing prose in my own mother tongue (e.g. in order to find a better word or to avoid repeating certain words too often, in order to expand my own vocabulary in my mother tongue, etc.).",

But your highest priority should be for just a small stack which aligns to your current career goal (eg. react+tailwind+mui). But eventually, you'll get there and master the whole stack given enough dedication and experience.",

I've only been working as a developer for two years, so I still lack a lot of knowledge, but I feel like languages are just tools. What's important is understanding how computer programs work and what tools are available. I'm not confident in any language, but I'm a really good problem solver and I have a good understanding on data structures, so I know how to solve the problem even though I may not know the exact syntax straight away.I think understanding that perfect knowledge isn't that important is something that comes with a bit of experience. At some point, you'll realize you think of problems from the POV of a computer and at that point you'll feel confident because you'll know you'll be able to resolve any issue even though it may not be initially apparent.",

As a *professional* or more experienced programmer using ready made solutions, like libraries and frameworks, is the way to go.There are many libraries and frameworks that help us create things we couldn't otherwise do without digging extremely deep into the matter. Could you write a 3d engine? This is a typical case. I dare say that over 95% of the programmers (including experienced ones) couldn't do it. Hence, somebody very diligent and smart has made libraries for it that others can use.Libraries and frameworks are there for convenience and to speed up development.

It feels slow, but slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.* Analysis paralysis - You feel overwhelmed by all the different starting points you could make. Again, go slower. Pick one tutorial or book and commit to working through it. Finishing one mediocre tutorial feels better than starting and not finishing a dozen great tutorials.* Perfectionism - Anxiety about getting everything absolutely perfect. Just because you've mastered a topic once doesn't mean you'll never need to review it again, or Google stuff about it.Remember that progress isn't linear: some days you move ahead ten steps, other days you move ahead two steps, some days you move back three steps.

You try to instantly create code, which is wrong. Sit down, think through the problem statement. Analyze it, break it down into smaller problems, solve each of the smaller problems **your** way, as you, the person would do. Don't even think about programming at that stage. Track down your steps. Draw flow charts, make bulleted lists, use pseudo code, whatever.Test your solutions.Then, once you have a working solution, start implementing it in code.The code is only the end product.

That is when you see the real performance bottle necks.I was recently working with an integration that could do 200 million+ for 1 day, but broke when I added a third day. The goal was to be able to process 3 years worth and the system was producing between 200 to 400 million records per day.

While that is a big part of it, in software engineering (with emphasis on engineering), development speed is also important: How fast you can create a working solution for your customer? How long does it take to get something into the market? How long does it take to make changes to existing code? How costly will it be to maintain a product over a longer time? How simple will it be for others to work with your code? These are the main drivers for having clean architecture.You don't need to worry too much about that as a junior, but it is important to understand when to take the time for creating the optimal solution and when to prioritize a \"good enough\" solution.From experience I can say it is easier to get to a working solution first, and then focus on performance, rather than having a performant solution that is missing features or does not actually do what the customer wanted.",

Create and drop databases. Configure and optimize all you like. Setting up a database from scratch is good practice. Learning about security and what different configurations like isolation levels will do to performance is good for you to understand, even if in practicality you will probably never make those decisions yourself - you will at least understand why things are the way they are and why performance suffers based on db configuration alone.It's all fake data. Do what you want with it.Edit: once you've got the basics down, performance tuning is your \"leet code style\" learning. There are no data structures in SQL - but there are data retrieval patterns, and set theory plays into how to retrieve data efficiently and for what purpose a whole lot. Learning how to read query plans is so helpful when debugging issues of performance, and learning to think like the query optimizer helps you write efficient SQL",

Rant: (just want this off my chest)(It is a struggle to do so many basic things, like sending a mail took 6 hours, 2 hours for php kn vscode, I downloaded source code.It is just an extension, and that gave some type of interpetrter esq error, so i needed to setup xampp, another 1-2 hours gone, then i installed pear, IT IS DEFUNCT so now i have defunct software on my laptop, and then a random indian tutorial just said, use this website put it in, and wow it works.End of rantSo for less pain, ur strategy is good, as long as everything you use is known to you.If someone were to ask you about what you used, could you tell them what it does, and why you chose that. If so, good job, otherwise try to understand it and see it in other projectsGl on learning code",

I've hired a bunch of engineers at all levels, and for different reasons, but what I am most looking for really is people that can, are motivated to, and will find good, solutions to problems. If you have done a few different things and I can ask you questions like, \"How did building an app in TS/RN compare to buidling it in Swift/Kotlin?\", or \"Which of the JS/TS toolchains did you prefer?\", some good answers to questions like that will get you about 95% of the way there for a hire from me. The AWS certs are useful, kind of, but immediately become much more useless if I ask somebody what they have actually done with the knowledge and they tell me \"nothing much\". I'd much rather talk to a person who has built a few different things with AWS and can talk about what worked and didn't work for them and what they might do different. I'd say just go and get the experience you can't get at work, if you are motivated to do so. It's not that \"knowing this one thing opens all doors\", it's more, \"you'll be amazed how often that thing you played with 3 years ago to solve some silly problem becomes relevant for some work thing and you look like a genius\".",

For example, you could store something like:{“2025-12-06”:[{“id”:1,“text”:“Buy milk”,“done”:false},{“id”:2,“text”:“Study Kotlin”,“done”:true}]}You read/write that object and you’re done. It’s simple and you avoid adding extra moving parts while you’re still learning React Native.SQLite starts to make more sense if you know you’ll need things like:•a lot of tasks over time•filtering/searching by date, status or text•more complex relationships later•maybe syncing with a backend in the futureSo my rule of thumb would be:•if it’s a small learning project, JSON + AsyncStorage is OK•if you’re planning to grow it into something more serious or long-term, it’s worth learning SQLite earlyThere’s no “wrong” choice here as long as you understand the trade-offs. For a first todo app, I’d personally start with JSON and only switch to SQLite when you actually feel the limitations.",

        "body": "Growing up in the 80s I had a Commodore 64. It was a home computer where everything was inside a keyboard you plugged into the TV and you could write BASIC programs and play games by loading them on a cassette tape drive. Yeah, those things that took whole minutes to load part of a game.Anyway, I was hooked. It looked so cool. You could make the computer do anything you could think of.I loved games and fancied myself a future game programmer.I didn't take any classes (there weren't really any back then, where I was from)I didn't LEARN programming, like sitting in front of a machine doing lessons. I wanted to try something, tried to research what I needed to do to accomplish it, and tried it out.I made many, many things along the way and most of the time, it was, \"for fun\".As an example, in the early 2000's the MMORPG Ragnarok became popular around the world (and in south east asia). I came across some code that could extract and view the 3D models of maps and buildings in the Ragnarok data file and decided I wanted to make a program that would let you look around the map as you wanted using WASD controls.Thus RagCam was born, and it was shared in some communities.I was also able to find some code to import 3D models into the then popular 3D software 3D Studio max. I also made a system tray Desktop Toy that let you \"Store Files\" in the \"Kafra Storage\" A Kafra is a NPC in the game that you interact with to store stuff, and I made a program that pops up the image of the anime-style girl in a kid of maid outfit where you can store notes and files.When I got into pirating (ahem, \"streaming\") TV shows I wanted to get notified if there was a new episode, so I made a local site that checked for updates. I also made a scraper that downloaded (english) subtitles based on the file name.I try to make programs that intersect or tanget my interests, which include anime, games, emulation of retro consoles, and more recently AI generated images.It's really up to you to define what programming means to you,I'm an old soul, and for me programming is more than just a way to earn money or the latest technology and cool frameworks.It's an interface between me and my inner self. A way to self-express through technology.Make programming fun. It's all about you.In the corporate world, I did some fun stuff. I'm a college undergrad (quite college due to.. things) but I was able to reach a solutions architect position in a multinational company. I always came up with novel solutions to problems.",

Much less fun for a lot of people.Learning can be fun though, but kind of depends.

Programming became more fun for me after I learned some philosophy because I prefer to argue with people not machines, BUT, now when I look at programming, a lot of things flow more easily.Come up with your own little games . Like, try to code something as fast as you can under some random time constraint under one minute. Program with swear words. It’s childish, but that’s exactly the mindset you want to be in. It’s programming, you can do whatever you want. Be juvenile. Have fun. Ask yourself “what is fun about this, or how can I make this more fun?” Trust your instincts about what you find fun. Your instincts may shift over time. Also, work on fundamentals. Musicians practice arpeggios, scales, and theory to expand their musicality. Programmers need to understand data structures, algorithms, and design patterns. If you don’t know what to do, work on getting more fluency in these fundamentals and your world will expand.",

Languages and technologies change so fast that of course you have to ingest information, otherwise you you'll be left behind - there's no way around constantly consulting docs and advice!Now there's a real problem in the tech market in terms of jobs, Then it seems to be only become getting more challenging, at least until the AI bubble bursts and we're all hired back to slay the Frankensteins it has created.But I don't think having to consult documentation will have any real effect on any of this, just don't become AI brained, really try to do it yourself as much as possible before consulting documentation or AI so you can internalize as much as you can.A tiny bit of progress each day will go a long way, good luck!",

If it is for years then you can't expect to have the same skillset and the same experience that was obtained by being in the industry for years.Compare yourself with the past you. Not with other people. Did you learn anything new last week? Did you learn anything new last month? Has your progress gone down or up? THAT you should care about not what other developers can or can't do. If you are not learning new things for a while then you should be worried. I mean, relevant new things not playing a piano or such.Also, your mindset is wrong. Instead of looking at more knowledgeable colleagues as a negative thing, use it as an opportunity to pick up new skills and learn new things. Learn what they know, pick up the same skills they have. Talk with a senior developer about your learning path, ask for advice, etc.Then your possible burnout you might be experiencing. Lower your work load in another workplace. Yes, you might be losing in some income but at the same time you'll be able to do your internship and improve in the programming side.And about your country, then try to ignore that. If it is your colleagues then raise the issue with your supervisor or with the direct manager.Listen to the feedback of your seniors. As they are trying to help you out with these hints and steps. Concentrate on that.Are you, as an intern, expected to start a new project from scratch? Or is it your hypothetical scenario you are worried about? Concentrate on your own tasks not think on \"what if\"-s. Interns and junior developers are not expected to create new microservices from scratch. It is the job of mid-level+ developers. You should concentrate on your learning. At least try to learn how to make a hobby project from scratch not a work-related project. That is what you should learn to do.",

I have no degree just alot of self taught knowledge, experience and many referrals to vouch for. My point is I knew my passion was programming adjacent because I like tech but it's not something I'm interested in in the same way as IT/SOC/GRC largely because continuous long projects bore me but short lived/high-stake/system level thinking work is exciting and feels more natural.",

There is an infinite amount of trivia that doesn't build up to anything. It's all just trivia for doing this particular thing on this version of this framework that will be end of life in long before the project is completed.Conversely, backend consist of a small stack slowly evolving technologies specifically meant for what they are used for. There's a bit of trivia for sure, but it generalizes. You can learn things that are useful knowledge while using some other backend stack years later. However, what's bad on backed is that blast radius of screwing up is far greater. Worst you can cause on frontend inconvenience that something doesn't work. Worst you can do on backend is leak sensitive data or irrecoverably ruin data.",

A: The word's next character is space, or a punctuation mark (comma, period, exclamation, question)EDIT: Slightly more detail: look for SEPARATORS between words. Then capitalize the next character. Then capitalize the first letter ever. What are separators? space, comma, priod, exclamation, question. (unless your problem specifies no punctuations, only spaces)So you capitalize the next character, if it's [a-z]. Exception: the first [a-z] is also capitalized. That should be it. >verify if a string was an isogramisogram's definition is no repeating characters. EDIT: So when I see this problem, there needs to be a way to COUNT the occurance of each letter in the word. ~~So the simplest way is~~ The way I would approach this, is have 26 buckets, one for each letter. (use an array for implementation)Loop through the word, add one to bucket as you come across the matching letter. ADD: Then we go through the whole list... If any bucket shows >1, it's not an isogram. ADD: But can we go even faster? Do we need to check the whole word? No, we can say \"not isogram\" when we discover the FIRST repeated character. We don't need to got through the whole word. ADD: So we loop through the word, +1 to bucket of matching letter. But before you add 1, check if the bucket is 1 or 0. If it's 1, this is a repeat letter, then you exit the loop and answer \"not isogram\". If you made it to the last character of the word, then obviously nothing repeated, so you have an isogram, return yes.",

Enjoy the high of starting to get a subject, but don't expect to stay there. Learning more will inevitably mean becoming less confident as you become more aware of multiple options and constraints. With experience you get biased about choosing and get more confident again (which is good only up to a point). Don't try to optimize by learning only relevant topics. Be curious and see where your interest takes you. It's going to be fine that on some topics your knowledge is more sketchy than on others. Every developer's knowledge is collection of whatever they happened to study and whatever they have happened to work on, filtered by whatever interested them.",

        "body": "## ExpositionI'm a lot like you in the sense that I want to understand the \"full stack\" of every system I run across. For years it has got me glued to books on computer science and on general programming topics, chatting with AI about the subject, googling, watching YT videos, etc. It has helped me gain a good basis for how things work but it has also been a way for me to avoid the really hard job of coding itself.## The ProblemWithout getting too much into meditation and casual research I've done on psychology, the basic problem is this: It's not the subject matter - programming or computer science - *it's the response to that internal state while learning the subject matter*. You need ways to switch off that self-referential egotalk. It won't go away before you start treating it and other internal feelings and thoughts as \"information\" rather than realities that are playing out or describing \"who you are\". They are chemical events, some helpful, some unhelpful. The system that spawns them is full of messy, contradictory responses to these internal events that don't always make sense. Your brain has neuroplasticity, and whether you like it or not even your identity is a construction. Yes, we all have some properties like IQ and EQ that determine some speed or efficiency of function but again those don't determine binary outcomes. The real hindrance is the ego butting in when the analytical parts are trying to do their job or those parts tiring out.I've wired my brain to be lazy, inattentive and identify myself as stupid. The identity itself and the thoughts surrounding it is a learned set of patterns. That wiring can change, the feelings it produces while under stress can change and my image of myself can change but they won't unless I keep allowing my brain to default to those pathways and don't offer it new experiences and responses to certain difficult stimuli.## The Realities of the FieldThe feeling of not knowing something or being confused will never change in this field. Your conscious response to that can and that will ultimately lead to your brain interpreting those signals differently. You'll even start to love the challenge of not knowing, if you can get out of your own way.## What to focus on - the narrow approach**Your real goal is learning to understand systems, syntax and data.** There are easier and harder approaches to this but generally I'd say **try to learn how memory works**. And learn it robustly. Study the virtual memory system, study file systems, study how different information - audio, text, graphics, device state - get modeled in memory. While there are millions of libraries, protocols and file formats, they have to all converge on the simple core truth of writing bytes to or reading bytes from memory. If you can nail this layer, write a few parsers that interpret file formats or networking protocols, you'll get a solid grasp of the simple fact that **software is just agreed upon patterns of bytes**. This won't trivialize learning libraries but it will trivialize a certain notion of \"newness\" from them - they aren't anything new. They may sit at several levels lower or higher on the software stack but they are all still just memory. ## On AI Resources are sometimes hard to come by but AI is actually pretty good for this. As long as you aren't copying code but rather asking questions on subjects that are stable and unlikely to change - how things in computer science, and the technologies that express it, work - you can get very good, very detailed answers. Plus you can go back and forth with it, trying to nail and refine your understanding. It's like taking notes with a tutor.## ConclusionSo don't be like me. Don't rush. Accept discomfort. Accept being stupid and having to ask. Think of the skill acquisition portion like laying bricks on a giant wall. You wish for a fast and glorious end result, you'll even settle for \"100 more bricks laid out today, look at that progress!\" but what you need and what you get by showing up and working every day is that one brick. This is a craft and the only way to learn it is by doing it. Every day.",

Previously I taught mostly pre-engineering STEM stuff at the middle school level.I have been taking a lot of CS classes from one of the state universities here thanks to a grant funded program paying for the tuition and fees. Nothing like getting a lot of credit hours at no financial cost! But those classes absolutely have kicked my tail, often leaving me feeling that \"not smart enough\" feeling you mention. I did OK with Python because I had some previous experience with it, but the Java classes were tough. But I definitely learned new things! Now I'm in my last class for this certificate, Data Structures and Algorithms. I am certainly experiencing many moments of being baffled. But I keep grinding and slowly things get clearer.For me, the purpose of doing this is to pump up my general knowledge and skills so I can better help my students and hopefully have fewer \"I dunno\" moments when they ask me something.I think one thing we forget about learning in general is that part of the point of grinding through the work isn't the specific content or items being learned, but instead it's just the flexing of our mental muscles, helping our synapses get better at seeing and making connections and patterns out of what we interact with.",

The advice that served me well when I started 20-ish years ago (I’m 40 now) was this: early in career, build broad base general skills and allow your curiosity to drive casual exploration of niche disciplines -> later in career build specialized skills in what you’re most interested in and what you can get a job in, both. The way I did this: 1. Python and C were my broad base languages. I learned them well and chose them because they’re used everywhere. Early on, I focused on design patterns and learning the abstract algebra and category theory that explains why those design patterns work. I also focused on getting really good at C and Python intending to keep them as my core language. 2. From there in 2013 I noticed functional programming was gaining traction, so I decided to learn Haskell. After that I got put on a project at my company that required Scala and I excelled at it because knowing Python, C, and Haskell gave me an edge over other engineers who didn’t have all three (especially Haskell). That set me apart and enabled me to get good at Akka, Spark, and later Cats Effect, which propelled me into Big Data. Also given the landscape at this time I was forced to learn Java :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone:, I didn’t care for it and more or less endured it. 3. At this point as a mid level engineer I’d now gotten exposure to low-level and embedded C, desktop development, server development and database programming, web development, streaming development, microservices, data science, big data engineering involving batch and mini batch processing and data ingestion, machine learning, AI, procedural OOP, and functional programming through Haskell and Scala.4. I discovered I liked the problems and wild-west style complexity of big data environments so I chose to specialize in that. That prompted me to focus on Scala FP for streaming (Cats Effect, Akka) and Spark (batch and mini batch), Python (PySpark, Pandas, Scikitlearn, Airflow, etc), and Go (Kubernetes and other distributed system type stuff). In 2025 it’s still doing really well for me. I was able to learn all of this stuff by taking about an hour a day 4-ish days a week plus 2-4 hours on Saturday a couple times a month in the first 5-10 years of my career to work on personal exploration type of stuff and choosing to stay focused on one thing long enough to really know it (when I got curious about something, I would add it to a list I kept for that to give me the feeling that I would get to it even though I knew I wouldn’t - but I did pick from that list when I finished something and wanted to pick up something new).",

Another one that allocates an array with malloc, fills it, prints it and then frees it. Nothing fancy, just repeating until it stops feeling “magical”.Since YouTube isn’t working well for you, I’d try something text-based like “C Programming: A Modern Approach” or the free tutorials on learn-c.org, and then spend most of your 2 hours actually typing and running code instead of only reading or watching.You don’t need to “fully understand C” before next semester. If you finish the break with pointers, dynamic memory and basic file I/O feeling less scary because you wrote a bunch of small programs, you’ll already be in a much better spot.",

HTML basics - create a \"recipe\"-webside using sections, headers, paragraphs, lists, images and links. (This also includes getting to know the editor, setting up a local server, using git, deploying on github, etc.)2. HTML semantics - look into `b`, `s`, `i`, `strong`, `em`, and a lot of similar tags.3. HTML tables (if you want to)4. CSS basics - colors, fonts, backgrounds5. CSS layout - understand block vs inline, then immediately move on to `grid`!6. Forms - use HTML and CSS to create nicely layed out \"interactive\" forms with input-fields and buttons, that don't really do anything.7. (optional) interactive HTML elements, `dialog`, `details`, etc.8. JS introduction - using document.queryselector to select elements and change their class.9. JS events - add event listeners and functions to add (further) interactivity to your pages10. JS variables - keep state, make counters, etc.11. JS forms - receive form submissions in JS code, read values from forms, write to console12. JS DOM manipulation - write JavaScript code to modify page content, modify form-values13. JSON and Dynamic webpages - use JS to read JSON data and build a webpage with (optional) dynamic data, just read from a (server) local file.14. REST API - write JS to access an existing REST API, make a CRUD webpage15. ???16. profit!Note how additional HTML and CSS can be sprinkled into making the webpages more interesting as you add JS to them. Depending on your interests, you could add animations and color-grading and lots of other stuff, or go more towards the data-part of the application.",

JS is what makes webpages fun, is endlessly deep and takes a while to master and css is least of the three but also key if you want stuff to looks even kinda good and modern. So yeah make sure your html foundation is strong enough, add some js wherever you need to make something fun and interactive and style everything with css in the end. This will teach you everything you need to graduate to typescript and the frameworks of your choosing",

But it really just depends on on what skills you know intuitively, or can pick up relatively quickly. So just play with stuff and see how it feels. If it all feels overwhelming then find the smallest manageable chunk and learn it deeply, so like, maybe html forms. Or JavaScript objects. Learning a small piece deeply can open up the rest of what is there, but always work towards the edge of your comfort zone. Mid you are overwhelmed, you’ve gone too far, if you feel stuck, then you need to move to something less comfortable.",

Graphics card shaders are also written in a C-like language. I guess C is most similar to Assembly, so that's helpful when you want to learn about compilers or IT security.I don't know for sure where you would use Rust. Rust is less frustrating to build than C++. It's a more clean, modern language, but the borrowing model requires some patience to learn. Maybe five years ago the ecosystem wasn't as mature as C++ but now you can build the same kind of stuff.Maybe, for personal growth, learn a programming language that requires a different way of thinking, such as Haskell. You won't get quick impressive results though.---------------I wouldn't be *too* concerned about job opportunities in your second year, when you don't know for sure what you even want to do.In my university some courses require familiarity with certain programming languages and others reward you with credit points for learning them.",

        "body": "This language jumping is pretty common, and university is a perfect time to do so.I'd say at some point you should look at Haskell. It's a language that packs a lot of Computer Science ideas in, and after going through it you'll find many of these ideas in many-many other languages. I picked it up in 2007, and it helped me understand Scala in 2009, Erlang in 2011, Rust in 2013, Raku in 2015, Rocq in 2025.Another influential language family is Lisp. Clojure is probably the easiest one of them to start with.One somewhat painful lesson you'll have to learn is that some languages are successful despite being pretty down-to-earth or somewhat awkward. Exposure to more theoretically profound languages will backfire a bit when you go back to some, let's say, primitive languages. You will be missing things like pattern matching, type classes, multiple dispatch, etc. etc. and programming in something like Python after an exposure to, say, Clojure will make you frustrated from time to time. But it's ok, and the main advice I can give you for your future career is: Don't really focus on the language, editor, tools and libraries you use. Find the motivation in what you are actually building and in the people that will surround you as you build this thing together. Good languages and tools can help you but they should not be what you build your identity around.",

And it can be really really hard at first and takes a ton if practice and repetition... but the fun part, is that it's even easier to learn new languages the better you are at a previous language because of how concepts transfer. If you know English and want to learn spanish, you arent \"starting over\" with spanish. You know what a verb is, you know what a noun is, adjective, subject, that conjugation exists, etc etc. You dont know how exactly that works in spanish, but you know that some words are \"things\" and those are called nouns and you just need to learn the rules spanish has for where to put a noun. Coding is the same. Once you learn what a loop is in Javascript, learning how to do that same concept in another language is just a quick google search for syntax and some memorization.So think about what you want to make, then google \"best coding languages for X\". Dont waste any time finding the perfect language, look for like 30 seconds and then pick the one with the coolest logo, doesnt matter. Then stick with that language for as long as you can and master it. The more you focus on that one single language and master it, the faster you'll learn more languages in the future. You dont care if Python is \"slow\", or JS is \"only for the web\", or that C++ is \"too hard\". That literally doesnt matter. The dude who made Vampire Survivors prototypes with Javascript because he knew Javascript, if you told him that JS is bad to make games with he would just laugh at you while he sits on top of his giant pile of money. Same could be said about Python, you will read about how \"slow\" it is, yet Spotify seems to work as far as I can tell. Once you do a LITTLE research, and dont get too concerned with picking \"the best\" language, start learning and building things. Importantly, when you run into an obstacle that the language struggles with, power through and get it working with your chosen \"suboptimal\" language. You will learn a massive amount by doing that, and in the future you'll learn another language might have a shortcut for the issue at hand you were having, but leave that for the future. I'm not your dad so I cant tell you what to do, but if it were me and i didnt have a specific project i wanted to make, and i just wanted to learn a bit of everything,I would unironically just google \"top 5 coding languages\" and pick the one with the coolest logo. Whatever you go with, hyper fixate on that language and forget ever switching to a different language. Then after a couple years in the dojo with your first language, you'll be able to learn another language in a fraction of the time you spent on your first.",

A true OO entity would not have methods like that, rather it would have methods designed such that external entities can inform it of things that happened and it is up to the *object* to determine what state it should be in as a response.When using a Design by Contract approach, a contract for an OO method would have no externally verifiable post-condition.",

For game dev, C++ is used the most across the industry for performance reasons because AAA games have to pay a great deal of attention to performance. Small indie games like Stardew, Terraria, Minecraft (back in the day), and famously Undertale can afford to be written terribly poorly in whatever language they chose and still run on almost any device just because they aren't rendering thousands and thousands of tris at once.If you want to just get to the \"game\" part of development, maybe just use Godot or Unreal or Unity. If you want to use game dev as an excuse to learn programming, stay the course. I learned C first and I'm one of the few who would encourage you to stick with a statically-typed language, specifically C++, instead of Python. Doing so will force you to learn core software development principles like memory management, polymorphism, and the wonderful universe of compiler errors and warnings that await you.",

You need to learn it's structure, vocabulary, grammar etc. from some sort of class or self study. But if you want to be better at it. You need to put it to use. At first you would struggle. You don't know what word to use, you tie your sentence in several grammatical error. But through repetition, tenacity and sheer amount of google translation and search. Then you will starting to be better at it.But the issue of repetition is, you need to actually enjoy doing it otherwise it will be hell for you.I suggest starting from something small. Give your self a small problem to solve. You said you want to making game so you study C++ so I guess you want to go Unreal route? Then pick unreal up and start putting your skill to work. Like making an object move but make the speed various depends on surface. That could be a great starting point?Good luck to you on your journey and don't give up!",

If you're going solo, you're having to discover everything on your own.Introductory programming materials are just that - introductory. They're teaching you grammar and syntax - enough to be dangerous, but it's only just the start. These tutorials and materials NEVER teach you how to USE the language, and they can't. There's so much nuance and detail and intuition that it can't be captured - you can't just be told.So yeah, this is the time they call \"tutorial hell\", where you learn the hard way that there ARE NO tutorials that carry you to where you want to go. You burn yourself out on that before you accept your fate, and it's hard work from here.And I hope you're over this hump already, but learning C++ won't teach you how to make a game. You need linear algebra, calculus, and physics. You need to learn concepts like collision, frustums and culling, the light equation, model hierarchies, graph theory, inverse kinematics, audio, input, networking, shaders, normal mapping, texture mapping, gameplay, then you've got design, you'll probably want some embedded scripting like Lua, you'll need to support assets and their file formats...It's best if you pick up the maths, because you can't avoid that one, and that you then use an engine that implements all the bits you're not interested in doing yourself. Building a game engine is every game developer's \"forever project\". If you actually want to MAKE GAMES, then make games, not engines.If you want to get to the end, you can't escape it. Don't give up. Project planning and management is a powerful skill you can develop right now, because organization will set you free. Don't schedule due dates, but a road map, the things you need to do. You don't need a single straight line, you can offer yourself multiple paths, even in parallel, sort of like a choose your own adventure at times. Some things you have to learn in order, some things you have a choice. But get it all written down, along with planning your game. Don't go straight to coding, figure out what you're going to do first - no code, not even pseudo code. Start with some smaller games just to get smart and make cheap mistakes. Then get more involved. No one starts off with their magnum opus and succeeds.",

We are all cognizant of time when learning as we are result expectant. (I need to know this now because I need money).Furthermore, to teach a concept like DSA 'will' require examples. Examples will need to be in a language or pseudo code(which I don't think would be proficient enough). Most of these concepts are given in example code such as C and probably doesn't exist in Zig.Although, I think there is a reasonable chance of finding teaching material in python.",

The language won't matter so much, because you're learning timeless elements of computer science.Where it will matter *a little* is that Java and C++ are statically typed languages. Understanding data structures is a bit easier under those circumstances because your structures will exactly correspond with data types. It's not essential though and it's probably better to exercise in a language you know well ... Maybe. I still think about that beginner course in pseudocode.

        "body": "Tldr: I dont understand your question or what your friend is saying... because data structures and algorithms are used in literally every programming language... below is a rant clarifying what I believe is what info you're missing. At the end of the day it doesn't matterIm assuming by DSA you are referring to Data Structures and algorithms right?Those are used in every single programming language, the only difference you may be hearing about is that some languages differences and not actually related to anything about data structures or algorithms... No shade meant by this, but that is something I think someone with an AI/ML background would be familiar with so I am going to assume it's not necessarily an AI background in the sense that you an ML engineer, and possibly what you mean is more that you use AI. I only say that to preface that I'll try and explain what I mean about languages, not to cast aspersions.Anyway, what you may be hearing i suspect, especially because of the recommended languages you've received, is more related to low and high level programming languages. You know all code eventually becomes machine language, ones and zeros is the name of the game, but we dont type out ones and zeros, we use words that them selves get converted to something, then something else, then something else, then eventually something a machine can understand. In coding terms these are layers of abstractions, something \"represents\" something else, and the magic is often that you can hide complexity by having thing X not only translated to thing Y, but also do Z as well to make the statement more concise. Low level languages (like C++) are ones that you work closer to the hardware, meaning there are fewer abstractions away from giving a computer 1s and 0s. This can be a very good thing, abstractions require effort, and that means you can write code that uses less effort on the machines end and make things go fast and use less memory. However, abstractions are done for a reason, and the flip side of a low level language is that you will write a lot more code to do the same thing that another language may be able to do in a fraction of the amount of lines of code, a big pain point being you end up handling memory yourself at this level. High level languages on the other hand are abstracted a more layers up and hide the scary bits like memory management from the developer by handling it themselves, and tend to be much closer to readable human language as a result. Python and Java are both high level languages, but keep in mind that doesnt make them better or worse, just different. So why isnt everything done with a high level language if they can take away all the annoying things that exist in programming? With abstractions come trade offs, the more that your code does \"for you\" the less control you have. You dont have to do annoying memory management and consider a lot of stuff when programming in a language like Python like when its OK for your app to \"forget\" something to free up memory. In languages at this level a feature that is built in handles it for you by occasionally checking the app, and deleting unused memory and freeing it up for later, its called a garbage collector, and this does not exist at the low level, and not having it can be a pain in the ass. But what happens if garbage day is on Monday, and you forget to bring out your trash and today is Tuesday...? You are stuck with the garbage until the garbage man comes around next week, in high level languages this happens to because its not a constant process and works kind of in cycles. Low Level languages can create memory, use it, and the second its no longer needed free it up for something else to use that memory. This allows more efficiency in your code, but requires more dev work, and opens up Pandora box and can lead to an exponentially amount of new bugs or issues. If I wrote 2 programs in Python and C++ tonight, I could do it. But I promise you that my Python will without question be faster than my C++ code. Is Python \"faster\" than C++? Nope, I just am a novice at C++, I know enough to be dangerous, but beyond that 9 times out of 10 my Python is faster due to my own lack of experience with it. And if you told me to create an app in 10 hours or I will die, Ill choose Python every time because the high level abstractions lead to increased developer speed. NOT better app, NOT faster code, less of my time as a developer being used (which in theory could be used to make more code for some other project or learn something new)As far as data structures and algorithms are concerned, they are not language specific, it makes no sense to frame it that way imo. Data structures are ways to organize data. Algorithms are sequences to process data. The programming languages are like syntax in verbal languages, DSA is kinda like forming complex sentences. So there's no correct answer to your question, because it doesnt really make sense. I suppose if you goal is to learn data structures and algorithms at a granular level and really understand how the computer really handles them, a low level language will force you to really get down to that level and put the work in to learn that stuff. If your goal is to apply data structures and algorithms more than learn the granular details, a high level language is the choice. Honestly even that dichotomy isn't a super great way to put it, its just the closest way I could think to answer your question in a way that gives you something to consider. Another way to put that is that learning DSA concepts in a lower level language will expose you more closely to how a computer really uses data structures and algorithms, giving you a better baseline. However, a high level language will allow you to learn these concepts faster and more efficiently. There's no avoiding learning them, and neither path is correct. That being said... if you truly \"know\" python... to be honest you should already be familiar with a lot of data structures and algorithms, so my recommendation would be to stick with Python and fill up those holes in your skill set without having to learn these concepts and a whole new language at the same time slowing the process. Just my opinion.",

        "body": "The problem is that Java was never intended to help teach programming - it was built for experienced programmers to \"quickly\" adapt their existing code to this new language, and write applications that could run on any system, rather than just the one they themselves used.But for some reason - probably because it was free, and worked the same on every platform - it became the standard language for teaching programming, even though it requires you to understand a bunch of concepts before you can even write your first hello world program - hence all the \"jokes\" about `public static void main(String args[])` \\- some of which even fairly intermediate programmers don't understand fully.And adding to that, the designers of the Java API made a lot of weird decisions in the beginning, some of which they later regretted, but can't remove even though it has later been found to be more troubles than help. Specifically the Exception handling and the huge risk of null-pointer exceptions everywhere.And it doesn't get any better that Java was never truly intended to run interactive text-terminal applications, but for some crazy reason almost every school thinks that their students should be forced to struggle with System.out, System.in, Exceptions and the Scanner - which is intended for \"scanning\" through text-files (hence the name) and not for receiving badly formatted input from the user ... So, sorry if I didn't answer your question fully, but every single thing that you mention are weird quirks of the Java language, and the way it is being taught, and I still cannot fathom why it is still chosen as a beginner language, especially when we've had Python for exactly as long, and that also runs on every single platform out there!",

        "body": "Learning a language focuses on grammar and syntax. Learning how to use the language is computer or software engineering. Learning how it all even makes sense is computer science or computer architecture.Learning this field is building a bridge by spanning from both sides. Well, EVERY side... Then all the sides eventually meet in the middle, and it all starts making sense. It's not a sudden ah-ha moment, but a gradual understanding unless you think about it.Learning any programming language - there is a barrier to separate the language and it's products from the system. You do this, you get a program. You send text to `System.out`, and it shows up in a little window. We can talk about the `java.lang` package, the `System` class within it, the `out` static field within that, how it implements an instance of `PrintStream`, you can look up the documentation for the interface, or on that specific instance, but it is \"implementation defined\" what happens, that under the hood, a system call is made, and the data - your text, crosses a barrier from your program to the operating system that controls the terminal window and the transfer of data between it and your program.If you want to learn about operating systems, read a book or take a class. That's going beyond Java, and your Java class has to stop somewhere, or else the conversation is going get down to electron volts and semiconductors, PN junctions, quantum tunneling...Where's it end, Sharon? Where's it end?A top-down approach isn't helpful, because look where you are; What the hell is `System.out`? Why do I have to do it? You've seen the top, now you have to work your way down, but you're so damn distracted by the question I don't think you can see the forest for the trees.We teach programming from the bottom up the same way Euclid taught geometry. First the axioms, then building blocks, because everything new is going to be a consequence of everything prior. You crawl before you walk, and your legs can take you to the fence. Beyond is another class, another subject, and yes, it's a topic worth learning at some point.But you know what? You can do a lot with Java now, without having to personally survey the whole kingdom first.> Printing text, which for some reason requires me to add \"System.out.\" beforehand [...] Creating a Scanner object to read user text input, which for some reason requires me to specify \"(System.in)\"No one is going to explain everything to you. Look it up. There's documentation. Both `System.in` and `System.out` are stream objects, and they wrap some system specific implementation details that allow data to be passed into and out of your running process. That's the fence - go take an OS class or read a book about kernel architecture, because they way this works on Windows is different than how it works on Linux, is different from how it works on NanoVM for AVR...You don't NEED a `Scanner` to get input, the input stream has a `read` method to get you bytes, the `Scanner` is just convenient for converting bytes into different types.There are more streams than `System.[in|out|err]`, you can make your own, so passing `System.in` to a `Scanner` tells it WHICH input stream to scan.> Catching all errors, which for some reason requires me to specify \"(Exception e)\"Both these things tell me you haven't gotten to or don't understand inheritance. So much for the top-down approach... Did you dirty again.> Fixing a Scanner after inputting a number so it correctly takes text input, which for some reason is as simple as executing the command \".nextLine()\"This is not a concern of teaching you Java, but of USING Java - of software engineering, architecture, and design.Presume you told the scanner you want an integer, but the data in the stream contains text, not digits. What now? You get an error - your specification cannot be satisfied.But you didn't \"fix the problem\", you just SKIPPED over the data in the stream, looking for something you CAN parse out.",

To me, it is more about encapsulating data with applicable functions (methods), polymorphism, and passing messages between objects. Ideally, a class should contain a data structure, and have methods for setting, accessing, and transforming that data.At the end of the day, a class is basically a data structure with a bunch of functions attached to it (or, in C terms, a struct with some variables and function pointers). It is also syntax sugar for passing structs to functions as paramaters. eg: if myObject is an instance of a class called MyClass, then myObject.foo(1) is syntax sugar for MyClass_foo(myObject, 1)edit: The project is somewhat irrelevant, as any project can be done in an OO way, or a procedural way, or a functional way, etc. It is more about how you organize the relationships between data (variables) and behavior (code). It is not uncommon these days to mix these paradigms, which Python somewhat excels at.OOP also plays well with a Model View Controller (MVC) app structure.",

If that board state belonged to an object and those functions were methods of that object, that design might be easier to think about and use.If I have a photo collection, those photos could be stored in any number of places. In files. Maybe in files with extra meta data files. In any kind of database. Maybe just in memory to testing. Now, imagine you have an object PhotoStore that implements all the functions related to storage and retrieval. The implementation of that object could be anything. The rest of your code need only have a valid instance of PhotoStore to function.I've just described a couple useful scenarios for OOP. Basic code organizing and perhaps security.

It prevents the code to be executed when you import the module somewhere else to use one of the classes.",

Having the event handling, the logic, formatting, etc. all it one place violates the SOLID design principles.6. NIT: The comment at line 35 doesn't really help. It seems likely this line is formatting the result for display. I'm not quite sure what the has to do with \"rounding error\".7. I think you are doing limits checking with try/except blocks. It is better to just check the limits. The line:```try: if screen[-1] in operators and input in operators: screen = screen[:-1]except: pass```Can just be:``` if screen and screen[-1] in operators and input in operators: screen = screen[:-1]```More:8. The conditions on lined 73 and 75 could be combined.9. Consider using isdigit instead of using a constant.10. buttons seems to be unused.Note that empty strings act like False in conditionals in Python. Just discarding all exceptions is a poor practice and it's best not to get in the habit.---There's likely more stuff, I just hit the stuff that jumped out at me.You should also consider running a linter like ruff over it.

        "body": "That's a lot more readable, nice.In `validate_operator` the only exception that can occur is when `self.expression` is an empty string in which case `self.expression[-1]` will fail. You can just change the if statement to check this instead: `if self.expression and self.expression[-1] in self.operators and input in self.operators:` since `bool(self.expression)` will be false, when the string is empty.In the case of `calculate`, the main two errors are `SyntaxError` (raised, for example when you try `eval(\"\")`) or `ZeroDivisionError`. Depending on what input is possible, `NameError` is possible (`eval(\"x + 1\")`). Thinking about what errors can occur forces you to think about why they happen and how to handle them. You should definitely handle the SyntaxError and ZeroDivisionError in some way. If you really want, you can catch those 2 with corresponding error messages and then catch all remaining exceptions (but I'd not catch them and let the calculator crash if something really completely unexpected happens instead of ignoring it. This would be a bug requiring a fix and not an expected exception like the other two).Alternatively, you should have a look at [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) about eval. You might want to either sanitize the input before evaluating the expression or write your own evaluation function, as eval is risky to use. This is only necessary, if there is a way to get 'unclean' input. But sanitizing input is good practice.",

Any local files, databases, etc. should be considered potentially compromised as well. In short, it's a huge mess.The alternative is to actually parse and interpret the input yourself. The topic of parsing and interpreting expressions has a long and rich tradition in computer science and is usually one of the core CS courses for an undergraduate degree. Eventually, when you have a few projects under your belt, you should probably learn about it. Many excellent books here.As for the debugging, you got it right. I meant to use the logging module.",

Database?How will i execute the logic - python or JavaScript scripts, on a server or local machine? How will i share the app - keep it local for now ? Deploy on the internet I do this for every project now, then breakdown the functionality for each area. E.g if I’m going to use a file to store data, then I need some logic to update and retrieve data from the file, so I can start coding that functionality. Then the solution can grow from there. The file can then be swapped over to a database. The local scripts can then be moved to a server to run etc. If you’re just starting out this may not be comfortable - but over time if you can start thinking like this, I think it’ll help you start projects with a lot more direction and provide guidance on how you can grow the solution",

This has been very suitable for the C# .NET Entity Framework applications Ive maintained so far, however your experience may vary. If you like reading, I would highly suggest familiarizing yourself with Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design first before delving into derivatives like Microservices, Vertical Slices or even Moduliths. There is good material on it by Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler and Eric Evans.If not, set your own standards for how you want to name classes for specific patterns (i.e.: Builders, Repositories, Controller, Services, etc.) and then decide a folder structure (like most layered: Application, Domain and infrastructure) and rules for which classes may be defined in which folder structure.Your goal should be to make your code more resilient to the \"big ball of mud\", essentially trying to keep it \"easy to change\".

This is incredibly valuable, since you will recognize old or foreign code much easier, saving time on debugging, additions, modifications, etc. If Coding Guidelines define how you write code within a method, then Architecture is everything beyond that: Methods, Classes, Dependencies of Classes, Modules and Projects. However, its distinct from System Architecture, because it really doesnt \"care\" how which system or component is talking or integrating with another outside of code.From what I understand, project codebase organization is less a \"how do you code\" but more of a \"where are the files\". Software Architecture doesnt care if you use Github or TortoiseSVN nor does it care which IDE you use (on a high level, this actually isnt quite true).MVC is Microsofts take on a 3 Layered architecture (Model View Controller), MVT presumably is djangos version of the same thing, then there is the Onion/Clean Architecture that separate layers into Domain, Application and Infrastructure, sometimes even adding Contract and Presentation...The goal with all these is the same thing. Each layer is given an access hierarchy as well as a specific type of issue to address. This is an overhead and sometimes cumbersome but it ensures that you deal with specific problems in appropriate places and dont risk needing to rewrite your whole application just because your database got an update.MVC's approach decided to disregard making your application incredibly dependent on the used technologies, meanwhile Clean Architecture is the very opposite of that. Its why their structures are different. Some other Architectures like Moduliths or Microservices try to accommodate scalability in their approach, allowing your code to be designed to be spread across multiple servers from the ground up. Monolithic Architectures meanwhile do not.",

And it will teache you a lot. Since you’re not a fan of front-end and you’re studying applied maths + CS, you can lean into areas that have long-term demand:**1. Strengthen one backend language deeply:** You could pick **Kotlin / Java, Go, or Python** depending on the direction you want**.****2. Learn devops fundamentals:** You already touched deployment and Cloudflare, so the next step is:* Docker* CI/CD* Linux fundamentals* Nginx* Basic cloud (AWS, GCP, or Azure)Even basic competency in these instantly increases employability.**3. Databases + caching:** Most backend devs don’t go deep enough here. Understanding things like:* PostgreSQL indexing* Query optimization* Redis caching patterns* Background job queues**4. System design basics:** You don’t need FAANG-level system design, but knowing how APIs, queues, caching, and services fit together puts you on a different level.**5. Keep building small production projects:** Your CRM project is already strong. If you build 1–2 more **small, useful, real-world tools**, your portfolio becomes unbeatable, especially when paired with your degree.If you do these over the next 1–2 years, you’re basically shaping yourself into a backend engineer with DevOps literacy, which is one of the safest positions in the market right now.",

Do you have a cool unique idea that you need to get in front of investors NOW before someone else does it? Well... maybe your prototype and your \"production ready\" app are very similar.. you'll have pissed off users running into bugs, but maybe you cross the finish line and get funding to refactor later (you wont, you will build on top of your garbage with more \"temporary\" garbage)Or maybe your code is handling how much radiation to blast a cancer patient with... Google Therac-25, one of the most famous software bugs dealing with exactly that.. If you are making something similar now, you better that testing, failsafes and a few more \"just in case are you sure this is the correct power to fire the laser\" screens in the final app are mandatory before release. Documentation even is considered a mandatory part of the \"code base\" in some projects Ive worked on, app works great without it, but future development is always an option. I know Rust teams that build out stuff quick and fast in Python and don't care about any bugs til they have something working, then they scrap their idea and treat it as nothing more than a proof of concept (suppose you could call it a prototype), and then rebuild it in Rust. They do this to get a proof of concept out ASAP and prove its worth pursuing in Python due to how fast you can do that compared to the much more cumbersome (but faster and safer) Rust. And on the flip side of all this.... you have companies that have 0 unit tests, use a custom build script that no one can read or understand because Bob who wrote the script in a 36 hour code binge one day used his own custom language he developed in high school that uses Tolkien characters as aliases to traditional syntax, and they fired him in 2008 when the market crashed but somehow the company survived and they have an app that they have considered production ready even before Bob showed up... Users somehow are shocked through their keyboard every 3rd time they log into this app and hate it, but they keep using it so the company marches on and pretends everything is great hoping, and management will fire you if it breaks while you're there, and will doxx users if they leave a 1 star review.Tldr; its a bunch of things, nothing specific. Hopefully the standards you set have testing, SPECIFIC mandatory features that need to exist first before new stuff is added, documentation, and have set things up in a way that it isn't a nightmare to maintain a year from now or when new coders show up. Thats another reason docs are important to move on from \"prototype\", being consistent with a style guide and practices you use, even if they arent what the language specifies. If you write Python and decide to use CamelCase, thats gross... but if the team style guide says so, and your code is consistent, you use it even if it's \"wrong\". And new devs joining the team will be able to follow the style guide and be productive without issue. Apps, like companies, grow and being ready for more users isnt the only important thing, you should be ready to add new devs and set them up to be productive and keep things consistent ideally. Wrote a lot and maybe seems like my comment is all over the place, but honestly thats kinda how it works. We are writing english words that software takes and translates to different words, which translates again through another piece of garbage bit of software into more nonsense words, until eventually those original words end up becoming 1s and 0s and through dark magic you made League of Legends appear. Its messy and a lot of what youre wondering may not even rely on the dev team, rather management and funding. There's a lot of \"shoulds\" that you should have before being production ready... but boss man wants that feature complete and we just dont have time to research the best way, unless you want to stay late on Friday, the client didnt pay for the 6 months of dev time needed to do it correct anyway, so do it mostly correct and do it fast...",

You want to erase type information, you want to hide complexity, in order to simplify how one interacts with it and to protect its internals and invariants from the client.A handle, the only thing you can do with it is hold onto it and pass it. The actual value is meaningless to you. There is no printing it, there is no modifying it, no adding or subtracting it... It is given to you from some interface that is the barrier between you and the resource, and you hand it back through the interface so when you `foo` the resource, you're `foo`-ing THIS specific resource.",

Are there specific things that you think those resources don't explain well? Or are you planning on taking a different overall approach than they do?It might sound like I'm saying that this would *only* be worthwhile if it's better than everything else, and otherwise it's pointless. That's not what I mean at all. Writing a full course on OpenGL would certainly be useful *for you*, as a way to practice your writing skills and deepen your understanding. (It would also be a lot of work!) But what I mean is that if there's nothing significant to set your work apart, then it probably won't attract very much attention. So just prepare yourself for that possibility.Rather than writing up your own complete explanation of OpenGL, it might be more productive to talk about your specific project. Like, here's how you *apply* the basic OpenGL concepts when building a universe simulator, and here are the interesting details and gotchas that a general overview wouldn't cover.> Once again, sorry if this is not the right subreddit to be posting to.This subreddit has a pretty broad scope, so I don't think there's anything *wrong* with posting here, as long as you're not aggressively or deceptively self-promoting. But you might get more useful feedback from groups such as /r/opengl or /r/graphicsprogramming, which are a lot less active, but more specialized.",

What I wanted to do however was lean into exploring more interesting concepts of OpenGL as well. Such as dynamic cube maps, compute shaders, ray marching and other interesting concepts. In the end, it will ultimately be a series going over most basic concepts and advanced concepts. However, I wanted to make it so that even if you didn't want to program yourself, you can learn and internalize the interesting concepts that underpin graphics programming. I really appreciate the feedback and will definitely reconsider how I may approach this differently to stand out against the already existing content. I will also ask other groups aswell to seek their opinions. Thank you.",

Stop doing that. Seriously. Start writing every idea down instead of killing it on the spot. Then let it “marinate”. Doesn't matter how dumb it seems. Just capture it.Then look up the \"Hedgehog Concept\". It's three overlapping circles: what you're passionate about, what you can be good at, and what's actually useful. Revisit your idea list with that framework and see what lands in the middle.Here's the key part: pick ONE and commit to finishing it. Even if it's a dumb one. Even if it's small. \"Too hard\" or \"too easy\" doesn't matter - either way you're learning something. If it fails, you learn why and carry that into the next thing.What you're waiting for - that spark of excitement - usually comes AFTER you start, not before. Once you're in it, ideas start flowing naturally. \"Oh, what if I added this feature?\" That's the excitement you're chasing, at least for me it is, and you can't get there by thinking. You have to be building. The fact that you still feel that urge to build something cool? That's not nothing. That's the spark. It just needs fuel - and fuel is action, not inspiration.",

So the mandatory methods in the class file of an interface don't have any code associated with them (just like abstract methods).The default methods \\*do\\* have code - but it's only used if the class that implements the interface \\*doesn't\\* provide its own implementation of the method - so those aren't abstract.",

But now an interface can also have `default` methods - which means that implementing an interface with some `default` methods, and some `abstract`, would be exactly the same as extending a class with some implemented methods, and some `abstract`. It used to be the general idea that an interface was a **contract** \\- which you'll see repeated in a lot of other comments here - but gradually it has changed a bit to also allow interfaces to be \"*sort-of composition-components\"* that you can add to your class to get some additional functionality. And it seems to be changing more and more in various languages, while we also move more and more away from inheritance, and into the wonderful world of composition. So things are changing.But yeah, (non-default) methods in interfaces are \"just abstract methods\".",

And then comes all the servers necessary to have such a huge user-base - it isn't something you just learn, it requires a lot of specialized research, and probably couldn't be done by a single individual, no matter how smart they were.I recommend simply get started with building the kind of application you'd like to build - follow tutorials and seek more structured guidance, then you'll figure it out as you go along.Who cares how long it will take?

My first few years covered computer architecture, databases, python and Java, data structures, and object oriented design (and design patterns in general)I started learning web dev with the basics, Javascript/css/html. After a couple months, I started learning frontend frameworks starting with Vue (easy-ish to pickup imo) and eventually moving to React because it is more widely adopted in the industry.Then I went deeper into backend and ops. Setting up auth, logging, APIs, and deploying the application. This part was absolutely the most difficult for me and I had a written step by step guide walking me through the process of setting up VMs on Digital Ocean and AWS where I'd have to ssh in and setup hosting and start the application. This process would have to be repeated (condensed a bit) whenever the backend application was updated. Nowadays, it is much easier to host fullstack applications but this is still good to know as a professional.Anyway, all of that was another 2yrs of grinding and I did a webdev bootcamp around the end 2020. I got my first job in 2021 (July/August). So 5yrs doing this basically full time lol But even then, programming is an ocean and I've spent nearly every day as a full time dev learning new things and improving the way I build applications. You might be able to build your Spotify clone after a year or two, but I promise that another year will pass and you will look back on it as complete garbage. And that's fine, that is the process of growth. Just be prepared for a very long journey, this is not something that you will master in even a couple years. It will take a lot of time, patience, and perseverance to reach your goals.",

For instance, ORM enthusiasts are far more likely to load an entire data set into memory and act on it there rather than prefilter in the database, simply because ORMs make this mistake extremely easy to make. This can result in performance issues and out of memory errors, and often what you're doing at the application level is reinventing something that SQL does naturally.This is why my general interpretation is that the only people capable of using ORMs effectively are the same people who would be better off without them.",

You can do it without, but ORMs help.Finally, it enables other utility like data transfer object (DTO) where you have to translate between db and front end or remove/clean up objects you need for backend processing but don't necessarily want users to see on the front end.In industry they're pretty common, especially on larger systems.

If there are no common rules for all nouns then I'd just go with the noun interface.Then I would create a class that handles most nouns. For the exceptions (I'm not sure if you can generalize the exceptions) create a class for each set of exceptions or worse case a custom class for each noun that just doesn't follow all of the rules of the other nouns. All these classes would either implement your noun interface or extend your abstract noun base class.You could also have your custom noun classes extend the\"common noun class but only override the necessary conversions, like if a word mostly follows the common noun rules except in a few cases.Then I would probably create a NounFactory or something that would construct the correct noun class based on the noun provided. Or maybe a static function on some class, it really depends on how much logic you need to choose the correct noun class.If you have things like exception 1 and exception 2, and IF a noun needs exception 2 and it ALWAYS needs exception 1, you can start building a hierarchy of classes to handle these exceptions. So exception 1 would extend the base noun class, exception 2 would extend exception 1. This of course breaks down if exception 2 can happen without exception 1. So this approach while keeping all the exceptions nice and reusable would not work.Hopefully that makes sense....",

        "body": "Ooh, linguistics + CS double major, and honestly, digging the idea. That said, you may run into some hiccups if you're not too familiar with Latin>Latin has a very interesting way of generating words: You have an word stem, which usually doesnt change, and then an very big number of possible suffixes that change based on the context in which the word appears.This is arguably not all that interesting on its own; well over 50% of the languages on earth have inflection on nouns. That said, that's a minor gripe. Another minor gripe:>And nouns are a comparatively easy example here. Putting aside the fact that the suffixes also change based on the declension of a word (mostly affected by grammatical gender), Verbs have even more different attributes to them, especially when it comes to the tempus.Case, Class, Gender, and Plurality are all involved in declension. Declension is the act of changing the inflection (grammatical affixes) of a noun. In talking about the different suffixes nouns have based on case, we are inherently talking about declension - not putting it aside.> I am currently trying to learn Latin by inserting the rules of the language into a Java library.Don't know how effective that'll be for learning the language, but as a programming project, it's neat!>In the nominative case, its just \"Servus\", while the genitive case has \"servi\", the dative has \"servo\" and the accusative case has \"servum\" (Cases determine the function of a Noun in the context of a sentence and therefore are extremly important for translations). But then there are also the plural forms, which are \"Servi\", \"servorum\",\"servis\" and \"servos\" respectively.If you intended to store things as stems, you might run into issues as there are 5 basic noun classes in Latin ignoring irregulars. \"Servus\" may be class II, but \"Puella\" is class I, and thus declines differently. In order to determine which class a word uses, you need both the nominative, and the genitive forms of the word - you can't always derive all forms from the one stem alone.As for how you could handle this, there's a few options.Least structurally intensive is just feeding the noun constructor an enum of the noun class, followed by the stem, and just switch-casing how the noun declines the stem based on that. Alternatively, make an abstract noun class, and create subclasses of it that each handle a different type of noun.The problem with the above is that it couples your conjugations to the noun classes/subclasses, which isn't very SOLID - bad practice. Preferred option would be to ditch the enums, and create a number of Declension Strategies (See: [The Strategy Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)) you can feed the constructor. This has the benefit of decoupling your declensions from the nouns themselves.Regardless of which of the above do the job, if you want to restrict which nouns get which declension without putting that logic in the noun class itself (again, best practice), you could also implement a Noun Factory or Builder (See: [The Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method) or [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)) which can take in the nominative / genitive forms of a noun, determine its class, and create a noun object with the appropriate strategy for you.But that's a whole lot of over engineering, so take it all with a grain of salt. All I recommend is that you read more about Latin morphology before embarking on this, as it'll help you understand what actually has to happen when declining the nouns.",

Earning as much as possible in the shortest period of time without taking any large risks (FAANG) is probably the best strategy. You could also build deep domain expertise in a target industry, and then get hired to work at these companies anyway, and this will probably yield a better result because you won't just be doing micro optimizations for them if you go this route. You can still do this in your spare time, but I would strongly suggest you prioritize your economic welfare first rather than primarily chasing a technical ideal. You have to find a balance, it's okay to experiment and learn niche things in depth, but you want there to be an eventual payoff if possible. For example, learning Rust or Elixir is a good investment of your time, and you'll naturally develop a network to draw from if you want to start a company or join one, but something like Common Lisp has a low probability of a payoff even if it's more fun (yes, I'm bitter). I followed my interest and got a very good career out of it, but I've also seen what happens when people optimize purely for skill. As a developer in any mid to large sized company you'll basically never be given the discretion needed to fully utilize tools designed around peak individual productivity, but the money will dull the pain somewhat.You have to develop a certain pragmatism about how you do things. I still actively pursue things that most would consider to be impractical, but I balance that with extracting as much money as possible from our corporate overlords and deep pocketed VCs.",

You can think of programming as artistic expression. I want beauty and elegance. I want to make the best software that I can.Along with that comes learning. Along with that comes a job, because the pursuit of my craft overlaps with people's need for software.The job is not the craft. Jobs don't pay you for beautiful, elegant solutions, they pay you for results. You have to figure out how to be a craftsman within the context of THEIR time and THEIR money to make what THEY want. You do get some push-back, though; if they hire you, they can tell you WHAT, but they are deferring to you for HOW. No one gets to tell me how to do my job, or they can do it themselves. As a junior, you get told HOW a lot, because there's still a lot of learning at the beginning of your career, but then you start developing an opinion, and eventually, it starts holding it's own. That's how you know you're ready to be a senior developer.> If you're only in this for money then you may struggle to find the motivation to continue progressing with your learning as jobs are not easy to get in this field.Who are you speaking for? Because I would say the majority of the industry would probably disagree with you. I have found very few craftsmen in my 30 years of pursuing software development. Most I've met have never given a damn, most I met literally say \"just get it done\", they say - and I've been told by them that they \"code for today\", as they see that as virtuous; that sounds to me like the goal is doing the least amount of work possible without getting fired, the least amount of work to gain status and pay, until they peak at diminishing returns. To them, their craft is corporate politics, and BOY HOWDY have I seen them master THAT.Jobs are surprisingly easy to get in this field. You don't even need a formal education. Jobs are hard to get TODAY because the Trump administration is terrible for business and has ruined this economy. You won't see good job production until some time - probably ~2 years into the next non-Republican administration at the earliest.> Trying to speed run the learning process will also lead to burn out, there's no point in trying to learn everything that takes years into a month.You can temper this with a sufficiently large ego.",

It's hard to justify this exactly with any objective line or threshold, but I would tend to use it for something a bit broader than a single class, though it probably technically fits. I think for me a \"schema\" would have to include at least one relationship between two types of things, but that's not really a formal definition but more the one I think people intuitively apply.

There even is a standard called [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/specification), to describe (programmatically) how to structure data to interchange.So when the backend changes so much that the schema changes, the frontend also has to change, and indeed go through a \"schema migration\".

If the dup is elsewhere, you've missed it.Your code is considering a particular position `OTVPN[i]` with even a special rule, `if (checking == i) {`. You're honestly making this more difficult than it need be.Write a function to check the array you have and go from there. e.g. // you'll write this code yourself bool has_value(int* array, int size, int value); //... // in the code you show, you'd instead // have something like int value; // a value to scan into printf(\"Enter your One-Time Vote PIN (OTVPN): \"); scanf(\"%d\", &value); // now, use that check while (has_value(OTVPN, 50, value)) { // as long as the check is true, reprompt printf(\"Re enter your OTVPN: \"); scanf(\"%d\", &value); } // when you finally get here, you can set the value OTVPN[i] = value;You can actually get more clever with the `has_value` function, as you'll probably need similar functionality elsewhere. Instead, a find with a location where found: // returns first position of value, or -1 if not found int value_at(int* array, int size, int value);I feel this is likely to come in handy for you in future projects.",

But you don't need developers for that - almost anyone with a little bit of programming knowledge can vibe code their way through the easy stuff.It is when there are no off-the-shelf solutions, no tutorials to look up, the AI is striking out...that's when you need someone with skills. Someone with some mental fortitude to be able to work through complex problems, debug, and problem solve. Who can go looking through poorly written documentation or undocumented code. Who ultimately understands that, after a certain point, the buck stops with them - if they can't *find* a solution to the problem, they have to think through and *make* one.I think, like in an interview it is telling when a would-be developer get asked a question they've never seen before. They don't *know* the solution - but that's fine, because a lot of times you won't know the solution. So does the candidate sit down, start to think, formulate a plan, examine that plan, revise it and otherwise think through the problem until they get a solution? Or do they just shrug and give up and go \"I've never seen this problem before, so I can't solve it\"?So, for instance, if a software developer wanted to know what the software developer mindset was, they wouldn't just post a question in a subreddit - they'd do some research. Find some books written by notable in the field and read them. Read some blog articles. Put together their own idea of what it means - and once they've put in the mental work of figuring it all out, then they might ask some others if they were on the right track.**tl;dr:** Being able to solve problems instead of just asking others/the web/AI for solutions.",

C# for Microsoft stack (.NET, Azure, Unity). I know you don't want to but learning Java is the best way to get into the industry since it has the most jobs! Pick one, get good, learn the other later, they're similar! Don't avoid frontend because it's \"saturated.\" Your design background makes you uniquely qualified for design + code roles (design systems, UI engineering). Most frontend devs can't design. Most designers can't code. You can do both. One skill worth adding here is accessibility. Relevant to C#, Java, and frontend. Companies care (legal, UX, SEO). I know AudioEye has free courses that are practical and sets you apart  [https://www.audioeye.com/courses/](https://www.audioeye.com/courses/) Learn frontend (HTML/CSS/JS/React) as it's the fastest to paid work and leverages your design.

I was very active in my local coding community. I was actually running a coding group with hundreds of members by the time I got my first SE job.2. I did freelance work.3. I built apps for my IT department where I saw a need. 4. I just kept building. I always had one or more projects going, all the time. My the time I got hired, it was into a mid-level position at nearly 100K. I don't know that all that would work for everyone but the big tip is this: find and target an organization where you have contacts. For me, that was the applications team where I was already working as a network engineer. That was the group that hired me.",

That we expect our path to be linear, with no ups and downs, and also that we require things to be fast; time is always a factor in learning something new. Almost certainly, I would of been much faster if I had hindsight or a mentor. I would of chosen to learn a more widely used language.

If you're still building UIs that look like MS-DOS and the Commodore 64, you're not really allowed an opinion on UI development.In principle though, the recent trend has been for libraries to provide the functionality of common UI elements, and for developers to add the minor visual fashion changes. ShadCN, Radix, DaisyUI and HeadlessUI seem to be the most popular ones in my React bubble. This is a big change from even 5 years ago where if you wanted to build a dropdown select with styled options, you'd first spend a day building it yourself in styled-components or CSS modules before giving up, Googling a pre-built one, eventually doing `npm install bumfuck-dropdown-react` and praying that their styling API doesn't suck. Now you just pull it in from a library you're already using somewhere else, and add your own CSS. This also works well with AI. LLMs know how a dropdown select should work, but they can't see it, and even if they could they don't know what looks good.",

Html has a selection of those ui components natively, but those are far too bare bones to actually use. Which means every framework must implement them from scratch. To do that in accessible manner, they have to use aria semantics and behavior that are limited to those 40+ year old ui component concepts. For example, when you make a dialog, it must have dialog semantics and behavior, and it's going to look recognizably like a dialog in GEOS. Now what the hell is the point of that. If frontend was a sane world, html would have native dialogs with all that required behavior hardcoded and plenty of look customization to theme them any way you like.",

If you want to deeply understand backend architecture, authentication flows, database design, server configuration, etc. - build it yourself with Express. That's how you learn the fundamentals. But if your goal is to ship products fast and you're okay with some vendor lock-in, BaaS makes sense for MVPs and side projects. Most BaaS platforms have decent docs for the stuff you mentioned (auth, payments via Stripe integration, form validation). The tradeoff is you're abstracting away a lot of the learning. For job hunting, employers value both - knowing how to build backends from scratch shows depth, but knowing how to use modern tools like Supabase shows you can ship fast. Real question though - if you're applying for backend or full-stack roles later, how do you prove you actually understand backend concepts if you only used BaaS? Like would you point to the features you shipped, or would you need to build something from scratch to demonstrate that knowledge?",

I'd say go for it, just know its a big time investment compared to most smaller courses.It's a very good bridge to more structured studies, if whatever else you want to do branches out well from this course.",

I wouldn't have gone through the entire thing anyway, just the lectures focused on C and Python (and maybe SQL since I'm looking for data science roles rn too). Wouldn't have touched any CSS/HTML though lol. That said, theres things like memory management that I do not want to sit down and read through documentation or lengthy texts for, so maybe I'll skim through that lecture (seriously, I still don't know when/why to use a pointer) and the DS and Algo ones as well. Definitely feel like I should push myself into learning DSA properly though so a dedicated course for that might be my best option.Do you have any suggestions? Also, do you think it makes sense to go through basic fundamentals in C if I want to do C++? I know they're inherently different, but things like memory management (for example) would be important for me to understand anyway as I work on numerical code.",

The lectures are there to support the homework and to make sure you have the knowledge to complete the homework. In a good class, the teacher will simply have figured out good, small projects that are appropriate for the students' level. If you are self-motivated to complete projects, and can self-assign appropriate projects, you don't need a beginner class.Since you're considering CS50x, I might hunt down whatever textbook Harvard's DSA class (or any other good CS university) uses and just buy it and go through it. Again, you have to do lots of homework programming projects. For DSA, be sure you do the math parts too. If you can implement a dozen data structures from scratch and analyze the time and memory complexity of a sort algorithm, you're golden.I would use a low-level language for the DSA class, C is good choice, but you can use C++ if you're careful about not exploiting too many C++ features. Learning DSA is learning what's going on under the hood of these higher-level languages. If you do DSA in C, you'll learn all the memory management you need. Anything beyond DSA is optional. Later classes will be specialization, or too abstract to be widely useful.",

But it *is* easier to read, and to refactor without accidentally breaking things.Having said that in your example, whether the implementation of the behavior is the same or not, composition will look similar: it will make heavy use of *interfaces*. Using Go as an example (a language that only has composition, not inheritance):```gotype Collideable interface { Collide()}type Renderable interface { Render()}type Entity interface { Collideable Renderable}type Octopus struct {...}func (self *Octopus) Collide() {...}func (self *Octopus) Render() {...}type Spaceship struct {...}func (self *Spaceship) Collide() {...}func (self *Spaceship) Render() {...}```In the example above, Collideable is an interface that describes \"anything that collides\". Interfaces are commonly described as contracts; they do not contain any implementation, but they describe that such-and-such object will have such-and-such methods.the \"Entity\" interface is defined as \"anything which both collides and renders\". In order to be considered an \"Entity\", a type would have to be both Collideable and Renderable.A type satisfies an interface by implementing all of its mandatory methods. In order to be Collideable, a type needs a method called Collide, that has the same arguments / return type as in the interface. If it does, we say the type *implements* the interface.In Go, once a type implements the necessary methods, it will automatically be recognized as implementing the matching interface(s). In the example code above, both Octopus and Spaceship implement all 3 interfaces. (In some other languages you need to do something like `class Foo implements Bar` to make the interface relation explicit).Now on to your question. Focusing on just the Collideable interface, there are 2 scenarios: Either we have a common implementation, or we don't. If we don't, then the `func ... Collide() {...}` blocks above will contain different code. If there *is* a common implementation, you can e.g. pull it out into an external function:```gofunc Collision() {...}func (self *Octopus) Collide() { Collision()}func (self *Spaceship) Collide() { Collision()}```Alternatively, you can use composition to create another Collideable object, and reuse it for the Octopus and Spaceship:```gotype Collider struct {...}func (self *Collider) Collide() {...}type Spaceship struct { collider Collider ...}func (self *Spaceship) Collide() { self.collider.Collide()}type Octopus struct { collider Collider ...}func (self *Octopus) Collide() { self.collider.Collide()}```As you can see, the above example has a bit more boilerplate, but we have successfully combined composition and interfaces to give both Octpus and Spaceship the same implementation of the Collide() method, by giving them both the same \"collider\" property internally. Both Spaceship and Octopus implement Collideable, and they do it using the same implenentation (from \"Collider\").(Note: In Go, interfaces cannot contain implementation, only a list of methods (and their type signatures). In some other languages, interfaces are also (optionally) allowed to contain default implementations of their methods. That would allow us to skip the whole \"Collider\" thing and just write the default implementation for Collide() on the interface directly. Having said that, this can be a bad idea.)",

If you think you've stumbled into a superior design that happens to use inheritance, you could consider going for it. If your discover that your design is wrong then you could refactor it into composition.If you're not sure what to do you could err on the side of composition as a best practice. But I think it's wrong to dogmatically apply it (or most best practices) in a universal fashion.If I wind up with several classes that all inherit from the top of the hierarchy in a default fashion and have almost all of the same methods just delegating to some member/field/property/attribute, and in particular if I'm conceptually referring to that class as a form of that delegated object class, it's a sign that I would probably better benefit from refactoring it to inheritance.So do Octopus and Spaceship have no explicit super class? Do you think their instances ARE entities? Do they delegate heavily to a private entity instance? You'll probably have an easier time if you model it using inheritance. That's the way I think about it. I also don't mind getting it wrong and refactoring later, assuming I don't make a total mess of the system and I don't have a bunch of external systems that are going to be coupled to this particular design decision.",

        "body": "there are various ways to look at it. At design time, sure, you usually look at 'this is a thing' vs 'this has a thing'. But there may be more to it, and often, that is a grey line. A thing can have a collision (has a?) or a collision can be a thing too, that (has-a) participants . A spaceship is not a collision, but a spaceship is a 3d point cloud that may touch another 3d point cloud and require behavior to detect that. Or maybe a spaceship has-a associated geometry/cloud/volume? Sometimes its just mental gymnastics around how your team thinks about the idea being expressed and can go either way.But there are other considerations. Collision detection is often a constantly running subsection of a game and may need to be as efficient as possible, so having it on the side in something as compact as possible may be a requirement regardless of how you feel about is-a and has-a. An array-like container of small objects with something like (pointer, ID number, something) and geometric info (what volume does it occupy) that you can do a scene-wide check against may be necessary for performance reasons even if that means pulling the data out of the bigger objects in a bizarre (from an OOP perspective) way -- this kind of thing is why some games use parallel array type concepts when normally that would be anti-OOP.And it could be a poor example. collisions are often done in passes, like center of object distance (skip if far away) followed by bounding spheres (skip if not touching) followed by simplified but correct geometry checking. That would be done the same way for all your objects; it just happens that your octopus and spaceship have different detailed geometry in the final stage but you still do it the same way, different inputs to the same function (?) in other words.The main thing I am rambling about though is that design can be a grey area at times, and you just have to make the best choice you can based off how you plan to use the information, which can be its own headache for something like the geometry of an object in 3d since you use that in so many places in so many different ways. It clearly belongs to its associated entity, but at the same time you may need to access a lot of them iteratively without any baggage.",

This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. Fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. A calculator, an address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.",

Work on open issues and submit high quality merge requests (covered with tests and such. Nobody likes a low-quality MR). That will improve your Java development skills.Another thing you can do is making something for your own use. Something related to your interests and hobbies. Perhaps you can automate something. Perhaps you can make something easier, more accessible, faster, etc.If you want to stick with Python and C then decide the field you want to work at (both have their own niches). And then just google \"Python uses\" or \"C uses\" . If \"C uses\" gives nothing meaningful then \"programming language C uses\" to get programming related findings.My C is really bad (only touched it a bit during course where we did something with Arduino). But I can figure out it is a low level programming language. You can look into projects where you are developing firmware or programming devices. Python has all kinds of uses: web application development, data science, AI, cyber security, DevOps, etc. And then you can look up projects in these fields.If it is any use then I can give you a project idea that WILL be way over your skill level. But then you at least have something to figure out. Your router (perhaps your old one, to not brick the current one). Install a custom firmware on it. You can also modify some open source firmwares like OpenWRT.",

Something with graphics, audio, maybe controller support, if you're up to it.Pong is a good first one. Also Frogger, Flappybird, Asteroids, or maybe Vampire Survivors all seem approachable.You could make animations like found on [https://www.shadertoy.com/](https://www.shadertoy.com/) . You could make your own text editor. You could make a program to do your math homework & show steps. You could make your own programming language. You could implement [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) . You could solve this year's r/adventofcode. You can make your own image viewer or music player or an audio synthesizer like SFXR [https://www.drpetter.se/project\\_sfxr.html](https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html) or an emulator for the NES or another old console.Possibilities are endless, if you look beyond lists of beginner projects.",

And by understand, I mean being able to write code. If you can get good at writing simple utilities like this, those building blocks will help when it is time to create bigger projects.",

There should be little to no \"business logic\" in this layer.The one or more layers of \"composition\" methods, which bring the generic bits into more specific methods. Here is where you can say, \"okay, this method does something I need but other I don't\" and instead make another composition function or another \"layer\".Then your API basically uses composition methods to stay as DRY as possible.This isn't an easy thing to work out logically, and even many senior devs still struggle with designing these.

By far the biggest roadblock to their growth, according to them, is the small addressable market. Despite its huge population, India has a relatively small number of people with enough disposable income for startups to feed on. This means a startup has a limited domestic ramp up before they must try to find foreign markets.Second, India doesn’t have the volume of original IP including, but not limited to, university research. You cannot exploit ideas you don’t have to become a tech giant.Third, the policy atmosphere and capital markets in India don’t really compare to the best countries. So, many companies move elsewhere once their requirements cannot be met in India. InMobi, one of the largest mobile ad serving companies in Asia ($1B), was started in India but moved HQ to Singapore.Many companies were sold off by founders as they no longer wished to continue. Walmart bought Flipkart, an Amazon competitor, for $16B from founders who wanted to exit.There are several companies that started of great, became household names, but were then unable to keep their momentum. PayTM ($10B), at one time, was backed by SoftBank, Alibaba group and Berkshire Hathaway who all exited.Finally, while India produces a high volume of CS people, the quality is very uneven and many of the best choose to immigrate (to the US till recently but also elsewhere). This means the best Indian minds are not necessarily working in India.",

There are some world class companies operating in india - think Ola, Ather, Mahindra ( EVs), Flipkart ( e com), Jio ( 5G). India is also making some strides in home grown missile defence and drone tech. I would say - optimistically speaking - you SHOULD see some world class Indian companies emerge in the next 10 while the demographic divident is ripe.

Use that time to brush up the parts you want to keep (frontend, JS, maybe some light backend in Node) and don’t punish yourself for not mastering an entirely new ecosystem overnight. Stay active, you’ll get something.",

I hardly submitting tickets. I thought that my career was over, that I would never get a dev job again, thought I was the dumbest and laziest person in the planet who just freeloaded their way into the job.I got a job 2 months later (in 2023, mind you), and I got a substantial pay increase, worked way more front end development, scripts, and backend work. I just got promoted to level 2, making more money than ever.I thought, in the moment, that the day I got fired was the worst day of my life. Turns out, it was actually one of my best. If I somehow stayed in that position, I would not be a level 2, and I would be making so much less money.You might not see it, but this honestly is a blessing. It sounds like the project just moved in a direction that you have little experience in, there are plenty of projects that desperate need the experience you have and will pay money for it. You’re literally a senior dev with 10 years experience",

There's this guy harry who runs frontendnow, he basically helps people figure out how to actually position their cs background when competing for web dev roles. most of the time it's just knowing what to highlight and what employers actually care about vs what school taught you mattered.",

The job market sucks and THE most common filter for entry level/junior programming jobs is excluding people without a CS degree (or maybe an adjacent quantitative degree). So don't worry, for that reason alone you didn't waste your time.The CS degree also probably helps more than you think, even if you're not consciously using that knowledge.

Most of the world is dependent on few major companies like Nvidia and Google etc.. to make the best AI models and the best infrastructure for AI. Most of the world is just using the tech rather than developing it. So it will be hard to get into design for low level or PCB ASIC or really deep into AI because so many people have masters and PhD in AI and looking to get into these few companies who are actually developing AI models because it needs heavy infrastructure that most companies can't afford. Software Engineering in general is going through a lot and what needed an entire team of Engineers and Juniors can now be established by a couple of caffeinated Senior Engineers with AI tools. There is barely any real use for Juniors unless paying them like crap and treating them like cheap labor. Covid also taught a lot of the world to be remote-first and this opened doors for companies to hire from India and Turkey and countries with cheap software developer labor which take like 500 bucks a month. So many companies don't bother hiring a Junior who is new and unexperienced and paying them 10 times the amount. (this goes for remote company settings).It is a tough spot and honestly. I am in the same boat as you and some of my friends landed a good job with really good pay but all they do is manage legacy code that seniors don't want to deal with. 7 years ago having some leetcode skills and 1 e-commerce website in your resume could land juniors decent jobs. Today there is so much competition, the need is reduced and companies don't have a lot of money to work with. I am still looking for a job tbh so I can't be your guide to success. But personally I am just learning cloud devops and automation. It gives some weight on your resume than just \"I can code\". I am applying for jobs in Europe and hoping for the best. Being really good at coding is just not enough anymore.",

And those exceptions are incredibly extreme.Zuckerburg, Besos, Gates, & Musk all exhibit mental gaps that if it were in any other position of labor would not fair well.Even SBF, with the FTX scandal, still had trouble understanding why people were mad at him. While in prison no less.What troubles me is how not normal this is and how people keep thinking it is and trying to normalize it. Companies should exhibit focus, strategy, and discipline. Not be aimless, scattered, & constant high energy just for the sake of it. Since capitalism wants to exploit present bias in society it’s not surprising that it also rewards the hype cycle propped by companies with leaders who obsess about everything all the time and not deliver anything well.Tesla has many callouts to this yet keeps pushing hype.Microsoft, Google, & Meta, also have graveyards of things never quite taking off.I do tip my hat to those among the ranks that try to convert napkin drawing rants into launched products. But I wish we would celebrate those leaders more even if they aren’t billionaires./rant",

One of the largest mistakes of my career. I was promoted multiple times, got yearly 7% raises, and all that stuff so it wasn't clear that I was committing career suicide in the moment.I didn't know people working at actual tech companies to compare what was happening. 2 of my friends whet to get their Ph.D. in CS and the others I knew went to work at DOD jobs or equally shitty non-tech companies. It wasn't until I found various subreddits that I realized what was going on at actual tech companies and how different our experiences were over the years.I was even leading teams of 20 SWEs, have my name on patents, and responsible for all software aspects of the medical device. I was working with interdisciplinary teams and all that good stuff. The problem was I was learning learning one way to do things and that way was not how modern software was created. It was old school 90's style engineering company with managers that have been there since the 80's and 90s doing things that exact same way.It was top down management where they want engineers that just do what they were told and think minimally for themselves.. The company had a lot of lifers that got a job there as a new grad and just never left. If you were not a lifer then you were early in your career and was easy to take advantage of. There were very few middle career engineers with multiple jobs under there belt at the company.Once I saw the light I started telling every new grad hires on the down low that they should stay for a year or 2 and learn what they can. After that leave and get a job at another company that is more tech focused. This company would talk about how they are growing by hiring 90 new engineers in the last year, but they don't tell you they lost 80 engineers over the course of the year so it was a net gain of 10 engineers.Take charge of your own career and don't expect any company to manage it for you in a way that's best for you and not the company.",

Once you choose a college, choose a major, etc, there starts becoming a pretty wide range. People who are better students don't necessarily become better in the workforce, and people who were better students don't necessarily lead better lives. It's the same for everyone as they get older, not just CS grads. I have a cousin who is a lawyer and very successful. She's very friendly, outgoing, and good at her job. But she also says she got lucky and had a really great mentor at her first job. An old friend was a terrible student. He got a job partially by luck. A recruiter contacted him, he passed some new grad interviews (not tech), but they forget to check his transcripts. He did well enough in his interviews they took a chance on him once they saw his GPA. It worked out for him. And it's not like your first job sets things in stone. Plenty of people \"level up\" at different points in their career. A great support system is obviously awesome, but it won't always be available. And at a certain point, you're responsible for your own life and career. I've been solo a lot of my career. There are times I wish I had more mentoring. But I look at a company I used to work at. It fell apart after acquisition and leadership changes. People tended to scatter to one of three companies, all of which had people in leadership positions from the previous company. One the one hand, it's great you have a good working relationship. But it also felt weird, and there are times I wondered if people were scared or hesitant to try something new and expand their networks. I saw some places where once one of those legacy execs left, everyone started leaving. Maybe it was a sign. Maybe people couldn't last on their own. Maybe a combination. You could also argue people later in life have more at stake (I personally don't like this argument). But some people will say they have a spouse, kids, a mortgage. Do they deserve less stability and mentoring than someone fresh out of school? You'll see some experienced people post here looking for career advice. I've given people who reported to me advice that at some point that they might outgrow the company. I'm sure there are other manager-types who would prefer their team stay put, since it makes things easier for them. Yes, it's better to have a great manager, but you can't rely on that to shape your career. Most people aren't going to get carried and have things handed to them.",

I knew the implications of this early on. I would have no “trusted” mentor of any kind and not touch any programming if I took that position. I said hell no to that and struggled for a year working at a speedway gas station while I applied to hundreds of jobs. Eventually I found a job that paid a little less at $57,000, but I am working primarily with .NET and have a great mentor now and am getting a lot of experience because I program literally all day.I can’t imagine how my life would be from then to now if I had taken that role.

I'll give a range of \"150-175k\" or even say \"Yeah I've been interviewing for postings paying around 160k\". If it's mid => mid I'll start asking for \"175-200k\" or say something like \"Yeah I've been interviewing for postings paying around 190k\".Obviously this is just base though.

        "body": "Sorry to hear it, this is a rough spot to be in. The biggest thing that’s going to hold you back is making it through resume screening, and without any internship or real production experience it’s going to be very hard. My biggest suggestion is to network at companies where a referral actually helps you get your foot in the door and pushes you through the automated resume system. This means FAANG+ and big tech are out the door, as a referral will hold very little weight, and even if a real person reviews it, lack of experience will likely be your down fall. Connect with as many people as you can at smaller companies - even if that’s <200 employees. It might not even be a software company. Many CS majors have a “FAANG/Big tech or bust” philosophy and see everything else as a failure. If that’s you, you must put your pride away and take any chance you can get. This is a stepping stone, not the final form of your career.The next thing is to get very good at interviewing, leetcode, and preparing for a specific companies interview. This much is obvious, but your hit rate for interviews will be low, so when you do get one, you need to maximize the opportunity.I’d also really inspect how meaningful your personal projects are. I was surprised at how much weight they pulled during my interviews/screening, and I was told by multiple interviewers it made a large impression - which also means I got grilled on them so they could verify it was real/I did it lol. If your projects are very generic, even if done well, they likely aren’t helping as much as you think. Pick something you’d really love to learn about or make - maybe hobby related - and flesh it out a ton. The more niche/specific, the more memorable. Document well, consistent pushes, make graphs of your data and put them in the repo, reference research papers that informed decisions, etc.Lastly, I’d genuinely consider if a masters is right for you. New grad applications are already hell on earth, but doing them with no internship will be a challenge and a half. A masters degree puts you back in “intern” status before you finish it, so if you put your all into the things above during intern apps, you would likely snag some. Once you’re back to new grad apps, you could have an internship(s), maybe some light research experience (even if no paper), TA positions, and a higher degree. Good luck, and give yourself some grace while understanding what you’re willing to do for the job.",

It helps you get the knowledge to get a job, and the connections while in college to spring from. You don't learn AWS or React in college or usually even modern programming languages, skills that many people spend 2-3 years on learning just to get their entry level positions, but the ability to learn those quickly.And should be applying to 2-3 quality positions locally a day, not per week (I wouldn't bother applying remote for a first position).Good news is that most people applying to junior roles wasted their time and are just as clueless as you.

The problem is just about everything that can be done has already been done, so at best you're just rehashing existing software. It's very unlikely one of your personal projects is going to push the needle in this field to any degree. One recent example of excellently written software is bun, basically an entirely new runtime for JavaScript that dramatically improves on the performance of node.js. but the guy who wrote that is just phenomenal at what he does, it's unlikely that an average developer would be able to capture value like that.

I'd personally find it hard to justify using k8s / preferring availability just for this. Also, a core principle of SRE is having an error budget that you want to actually spend (i.e. having services that are \\*too\\* reliable is \\*bad\\*). I'd be a bit apprehensive to hire a senior whose recommendation is \"reliability at the cost of everything else\".## Too much human reliance\"A justification in the PR, and/or\"Personally, not a big fan of answers that boils down to \"let humans do this X process\". Humans are faulty, and manual processes tend to get ignored over time (e.g. people just rubber-stamping the justification).\"At each stage, monitor:\"This also seems like an extra toil that can be done automatically.In general, adding more bureucracy / slowing down development for the sake of needless reliability is also bad, similar to above.## Seems pretty textbookOverall, your answers give me the vibe of \"recommend the commonly recommended thing, just because that's best practice, without further thought\", like immediately jumping to k8s, specific DB, and so on.In the system design interview, I think I'd personally like to see how you think from the fundamentals and the first principle more, rather than just giving me a list of technologies immediately:- For a simple webapp, do we \\*really\\* need to use k8s? You're signing up your team to eat a lot of dev / knowledge cost before even hearing the full constraint of the problem.- Before jumping into the details, why not verify more fundamental things? e.g. do we need redundancy across different regions?- NoSQL theoretically scales horizontally better, but is that true in reality? In a lot of cases, there is a mismatch between theory and reality. Similar to how linked list are faster than arrays on paper for some use case, but they tend to be slower in reality due to caching performance.## Random nit'“What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.' Incorrect? I'd expect the answer to be 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS. I'd personally shrug it as nervousness / misunderstanding, but maaaaybe there's a small chance of interviewers really disliking it (e.g. \"this person has only ever deployed things on localhost\") since that's a pretty fundamental thing to get wrong.Don't beat yourself up too much though, interview fails sometimes do just happen randomly (e.g. there just happen to be unicorn candidate right after you). From the post, it seems like you're a pretty strong candidate and the interview itself went pretty well.I think the core of the issue is that a senior SRE should be someone who knows why we need to follow mainstream recommendations, and when we should not follow them. I'm not saying you don't have that quality, but I think the way you answer the interview questions did not necessarily demonstrate that due to the textbook answer and overemphasis on reliability above all.",

A few thoughts on what might strengthen future interviews:For the live debugging round—you did well identifying the issue and proposing observability solutions. One enhancement: frame your debugging narrative around measurable outcomes. Instead of just \"add alerts,\" try \"implement alerts on CrashLoopBackOff with a threshold of X failures in Y minutes, reducing MTTR by Z%.\" Concrete metrics make your experience more verifiable and demonstrate production impact.For system design—your answers were directionally correct. The feedback about being more concrete is key. When discussing rate limiting or scaling strategies, reference specific implementations you've actually built or studied. \"In a previous project, I implemented X pattern which handled Y req/s\" is stronger than theoretical answers. Even side projects count if they're deployed and measurable.The rejection stings, but use this experience to build a portfolio of implemented systems you can reference. Deploy a small web app with the observability/scaling patterns you discussed. Document it thoroughly. Next interview, you'll have concrete proof of these concepts in action rather than just theoretical knowledge.What specific areas do you want to strengthen with hands-on projects?",

Your hindsight answer is a lot better, but also like I wouldn’t not hire someone who just didn’t know that one thing. I would assume they had never worked in security and had probably used a safe modern orm for any database work and weren’t used to having to think much about it (which the only time you should have to think about it is using execute sql raw which is technically fine as long as there are no concatenations with the SQL string but is probably a bad idea anyway (vendor dependency for SQL, etc). I’d also assume they could be literally told something simple like parametrize all SQL queries and favor using an ORM etc",

However, the problem is management thinks that because the code is written, the job is done. I don't like that because it means they think they can just extract more \"productivity juice\" from my efforts. This is erroneous thinking, but that's upper managements specialty. With generated code, I need a bit longer to review it and think about it to internalize the changes and structure so that in the future I can reconsider the code if it needs refactoring or is causing bugs. But all they want is more and they want it faster than ever. So the little bit of enjoyment (albeit mostly as a curiosity to see these tools in action) gets turned into resentment towards it, as it's just another way the ownership class wants to grind workers into increasingly fine powder to lubricate the machinery of their avarice.",

Michael, a business manager, says that he was afraid of change until he heard an allegorical story, which he proceeds to tell.> > In the story, two mice and two \"littlepeople\" – people the size of mice – live in a maze. The mice, named Sniff and Scurry, are simpleminded and instinctive; they run the same path every day, eating cheese when they find it, but are always ready to move on. The littlepeople, Hem and Haw, search for a special kind of Cheese that makes them happy and fulfilled by keeping track of where they have found it before. All four discover a spot where their favorite cheese is regularly available, called Cheese Station C. The mice continue to run the entire maze each day while the littlepeople stop exploring and settle at Cheese Station C.> > One day the supply at Cheese Station C is exhausted. The mice accept that there is no more cheese and continue their running path. The littlepeople sit at the station confused and upset. Hem protests that there ought to be Cheese, and Haw wonders where the mice have gone. Meanwhile, the mice find a new supply of cheese at Cheese Station N. The littlepeople remain at Cheese Station C for several days, growing frustrated and hungry. Eventually Haw accepts that running the maze is the only way he will ever have Cheese again, faces his fear of moving on, and leaves Hem behind.> > Haw finds crumbs of Cheese scattered around the maze and some other Cheese Stations that are already depleted. He returns to Cheese Station C and tells Hem there is other Cheese, but Hem refuses to budge. Haw continues exploring, writing observations about his journey on the walls of the maze, until he arrives at Cheese Station N which is stocked with all kinds of Cheese.> > Haw reflects on the lessons he has learned and hopes that Hem will finally let go of his doubts. On the wall of Cheese Station N, he writes several lessons that change is inevitable and keeping up with it is the only way to continue having Cheese. Cautious from past experience, Haw inspects Cheese Station N daily and explores different parts of the maze regularly to prevent complacency. Hearing movement in the maze one day, Haw realizes someone is approaching the station and hopes it is his friend Hem.> > After Michael finishes the story, the classmates agree to meet again before dinner and discuss it. They tell different stories of encountering change and how they, or someone else, failed to respond to it. All of them agree that the Cheese story is a useful parable to follow and tell their friends.",

Ignorance, youth, and naivete just easily succumbs to lies, this one in particular.Education is the act of learning things. Education isn't bad. It's just that your education didn't end when you graduated. Right now you're being educated on tenacity, grit, the ability to adapt to pressure, the ability to evaluate previous decisions, navigating market conditions, extrapolating financial impacts, and all kinds of things.The good (and bad) news is, even when you're hired, education will continue to not be a scam, as your education will continue in ways you did not expect, with topics that may include but not be limited to: how to deal with people you don't like, how to navigate ambiguity, how to deal with tasks that don't have criteria for success, how to draw boundaries, how to make mistakes gracefully, and more.Education isn't a scam. I'm sorry you're going through what you're going through, but take it from someone who also struggled with a job hunt that lasted longer than the one you've been through: it is a filter, and there will be another filter after that, and another filter after that. You get to decide how you react to the negative pressure placed on you, and if you find that whatever you're currently doing isn't worth it to you: stop. Stop before you don't have a choice to stop, as the rest of your life now depends on that thing that you no longer find worth doing.You don't get to choose what happens to you, but you do get to choose how you react. The world does not owe you anything, and I suggest internalizing that. Not getting the thing you want in a quick timeframe shouldn't lead to regret and feeling like you \"wasted\" your time, it should just make you ask yourself if you really wanted it to begin with. You sound young, and youth is, by definition, about making mistakes. I see you mentioned in the comments that you're only sticking to this because you've already dedicated time to it -- that's a sunk cost fallacy. Time you've already spent is gone no matter what you do, but the time you still have in front of you is 100% yours to choose how to use.Good luck.",

That kind of mental illness. It's a real barrier and sense of struggle for those who have it and I don't wish it on anyone. So yeah for now, because I got my brain back through very risky means and have seen the light that I had prior to all this medicated bullshit run they've put me on, I learn for the sake of getting back on track to where I was prior to all this and also just for the sake of learning. I have a whole new perspective, aside from jobs, just the will and need to keep my brain sharp and exercised all the time, and hopefully not become some egotistical / arrogant prick like I did last time. My goal is strong mental skills + strong social skills. I've been without a brain for 3 years due to the debilitation of the drugs I was on/ But I've practiced my social skills through in person retail for about 2.5 years while I was recovering from my last episode and subsequent treatment. So living without yourself for that long, makes you want to strike oil while its hot, so now that i'm back, probably as a temporary thing as the new drugs will kick in and most likely debilitate me again, I'm trying to be as sharp as possible, as if I'm storing up on information for the eventual hibernation lol.",

I wouldn't have the same level of problem solving skills because I simply wouldn't have been forced to bang my head against a problem until I figured it out.I think it's similar to why the adventure game genre like King's Quest/Myst/Monkey Island/etc just aren't popular anymore. You don't spend days/weeks trying to figure out the puzzle, or brainstorm with friends/co-workers on what you might be missing. If you're stuck, you just go online and look up a guide for where you're stuck so you can move on. Maybe if you have good self-motivation and *want* to solve it yourself you can try and work through it - but you still know that the answer is a quick search away when that wasn't even an option before (yeah yeah, eventually there were things like the Nintendo Power Help Line, but that was still a MUCH higher barrier and often cost money compared to how easy it is now.)",

I can't speak for the current climate or future climate, as not only are vibe coders becoming more prominent, but CEOs keep asking for more AI use while still hiring by traditional coding skills.",

My thoughts: First priority should be taking the job that fits what you actually want to do. Working a job that you just don't care about will feel miserable at some point. The startup sounds like it would be more interesting to me, but that's just my take.Decide how much you actually care about tech work. Most Bay Area tech companies expect you to be more committed than just seeing it as a 9-5, and IME most workers here have a genuine interest in the work they do outside of just getting a paycheck. If you are going to find it difficult to care about what you're working on after 5pm, definitely don't join the startup. Tbh your best chance for an honest 9-5 might be working as a SWE at a non-tech company, which you could probably transition into from either role. If you do care enough about the work that you want to progress to senior+ and stay in the industry, the best place to start is a company with good product, good process, and smart co-workers. The startup sounds more like that. Finally, living down in Silicon Valley is indeed a very different social scene. I've done it and tbh I enjoyed it, but for a young person that wants to go out and be social it will seem tremendously boring. This is actually a pretty big QoL consideration, and you should consider it seriously. Generally I don't recommend reneging on an offer, but it sounds like living in SF would make a big difference to you. I would probably rather renege than sacrifice my social life for 1-2 years. However, if you think the grind of working at a startup will make you miserable, you may want to just stick with your current offer and try to find some flexibility or hope jobs in 1-2 years.",

This won't black list you or anything.Personally, I'd recommend living in SF and working at company 2, because that'll be a lot of fun, beautiful, etc.SF has great public transit, so you're options on where precisely to live in SF are expanded by easy train/bus access. A chance to try to find good housemates to split the huge rent bills. You may not even need a car... although having a car or access to a shared car is a good thing because traveling around California is strongly recommended.My guess is company 1 is in south bay, which if you lived down there, could have higher rent and much harder to get around than SF, because public transit just isn't good enough for daily activities. You would need a car for normal things, like guying groceries.I'd be thinking along the lines of what would make me happy. Commuting 1 hour on the train to company 1 may not make me happy.---For this one, I'd suggest trying to find a more experienced, female mentor in SF, maybe at company 2, or maybe find another way to meet up with women who work in tech (shared hobbies?):> I've been informed that the SF startup scene/grind scene differs drastically for men and women (I'm a girl)Can help put into perspective what's going on, what's important, how to be balanced with work and life, how to deal with problematic coworkers, or maybe someone to just vent with, if you become friends.",

Even better if you can take that and then put it into your own research in some way, like working on a problem you found inspiration from that.Also, location is something to take into account. For Pinterest, being in the Bay Area (or going to the bay area for like a month or something), is a plus because there are tons of events you could go to for networking and you can meet a lot of people from the Bay Area that go to the office. On the other hand, Google @ Seattle is the smaller-ish office (like it's not Mountain View or NYC) and San Diego for Amazon... I didn't even know there was an office there.

If you're having issues w/ lack of vocabulary/articulation, chances are that your fundamentals are lacking. You can go about filling the gaps either in a top-down way (e.g. start from what you know and work \"downwards\" into lower levels) or bottom-up (e.g. start from from C/ASM and work your way up back to high level).The former tends to be a more pragmatic form of learning. You can, for example, go from knowing about calling fetch (vs whatever is the abstraction for it in your favorite framework) to RPC/REST to HTTP spec (what different headers do, etc) or go from ORMs to raw SQL to reading about db normalization, etc.The bottom-up approach is useful for getting stronger at fundamentals, e.g. reading source code for hashmap implementations in various languages can help you understand how they actually work wrt memory layout, complexity, etc.With that said, senior level isn't necessarily about those. There's some level of importance in being able to accurately convey technical ideas via jargon, but equally (or perhaps more) important is communicating at an appropriate level for the audience (e.g. a junior vs a director). You're not really going to find resources on how to navigate this stuff, your best bet is imitate your seniors until it becomes natural.",

ADHD shows up differently in women, we tend to police ourselves a lot by trying to be “normal” and also are anxious and quiet around authority figures I think with leetcode you can use neet code and go through each pattern, doing all the easys for each pattern, until you get comfortable enough to do mediums. Do 2 problems at least a night (1 hr) If you have to redo easys until you get it, do that. I would say spend 10 min on ur own on the problem if you can’t figure it out watch neetcode solution - then do it and then wait two days and try and do it on ur own and then if you forget watch the solution again. Copy and paste all ur solutions in a Google doc so u can go back to them (cause you most likely will have pseudo code next to it). Keep doing this with the easys until ir makes sense to you and you can technically explain what is happening, watching neetcode solution more than once will help you because you will start speaking technically and confidently. And then when you’re good at all the problems u previously did time box yourself for 30 min to work on the same problem - pretend it’s an interview by then u will be confident because you have done this easy problem more than once. And just repeat for mediums and hards (time box 60 min) Maybe you should also go back to the fundamentals in the language ur comfortable using (w3 schools), relearning OOP principles and other things you might have forgotten. Use ai to help you study, ask it to ask you interview question and then you write the answer or if you don’t know what the algorithm solution is doing when reviewing the solution ask it to go through each iteration. Also ask DeepSeek (ai I use) to make you a study plan. But regardless you should do hacker hour where no matter what you do 1 hr of algorithms (at least 2 problems a day). Also use pomodoro where you study for 25 min and then you get a 5 min reward to scroll or get up and stretch or lay down. I use my Apple Watch to do it because it buzzes. You could also have a big timer on ur screen if you need to see it visually.",

Yeah you can Google it on the side, but a lot of times it's easier to briefly pause the meeting and have it explained by the person doing the talking. It signals that you're paying attention and willing to learn. I've had a lot of positive feedback about my willingness to do that, from both the business folks using acronyms I don't know and colleagues who were similarly confused but not confident enough to speak up.Honestly it sounds like you're selling yourself short a bit. I had some excellent mentors that beat in the idea of advocating for yourself in a corporate world, and being willing to make a change if the company you work for won't accommodate that.That said, I also went through a destructive leadership turnover cycle and it fuckin sucked! I was having full on panic attacks and needed to consult a therapist to get through it, and I think I've come out the other side more resilient. So do what you need to do, and if that involves seeking some professional help that's absolutely okay. My therapist likes to remind me that a significant portion of her clients are there for work related anxiety. Software Engineering is a high-stakes, high-stress career field.Oh! Also, therapy exposed that I had a sleeping disorder which caused me a lot of physical symptoms like brain fog, difficulty focusing, and memory problems. Anxiety can absolutely play a role in that too, but in my case it was physical symptoms making my anxiety worse not the other way around.",

For any concept or specific interaction between technologies I'm not 100% certain about or haven't touched in a while, I make a little sandbox on my personal computer with practical examples that I type out (not paste from google/ai) and play around with it for a day or 2 and leave some notes in markdown in the folder.Sometimes you haven't worked with a technology in depth for months, I come back to those folders in such times and its a quick memory boost, imo more than you'd get if you simply read up on it or googled a singular question.Flashcards are decent for interviews but imo not amazing for in depth knowledge.2. Intelligence can't be faked (at least when working with intelligent people), trying to sound smart isn't a cool look. The people who work with you will know how well you know your stuff in the same way that I assume *you* know how well each of your colleagues knows your stuff - usually some are a cut above the rest, no matter where you work.I think you taking the time to write this post shows you care about your knowledge which is frankly more important than how \"smart\" you are in the first place, I'm sure it's really tiring being a sole provider and most people would also have trouble finding the energy to upskill in your shoes. Not always possible, but maybe try stealing a bit of work time to read up/practice if possible, when you're less tired during the day. Best of luck! EDIT: Also, some times you just wont get a promotion - regardless of how well you do, there's many variables deciding who gets promoted - so don't take it to heart. The opinion your peers and/or technical leadership have of you and you work is more indicative of your skills than a promotion.",

Like you can take a class in networking to get a much deeper dive in how it works than you'd get in something like a CISCO course or something at an actual this is how the protocols work kind of way. Similarly for Operating Systems. You'll take a course in a CS program on OSes where you'll learn about deadlocking, processes, threading, multithreading, kernels etc in a \"this is the fundamental computer science of how modern operating systems work\" kind of way. Computer Architecture and organization will actually show you a level of detail of how computer architecture works that's much more detailed than you get just reading about hardware and tinkering with computers.

I never went to a bar when I was in college, so I didn’t have much use for cheap Jeopardy-like information that I was learning.In my five years of university, I think I actually enjoyed maybe two or three classes. The coolest one was data science, where we used algorithms in Python like k-nearest neighbor to classify clusters of data and iteratively displayed the algorithm converging, which was a pretty neat and beautiful display of mathematics.But the other stuff was like memorizing the five-state diagram of a CPU round-robin task priority queue, and how tasks were transferred from cache memory into RAM and vice versa. Not my cup of tea, and I forgot the information quickly after the test.One class on RISC-V assembly was neat—making a little library to read and write from a text file by meticulously setting up the assembly memory registers. but all in all it was a pretty painful experience and until I get a job the in the field I cannot really recommended it.

My university offers a first semester linear algebra, an \"applied\" linear algebra class that is much more difficult, and then a graduate linear algebra that is even more difficult. Linear algebra is used absolutely everywhere in CS type graduate classes.- probability, stochastic processes. statistics.- logic. These courses are often cross-listed with philosophy.- real analysis, differential equations, partial differential equations. This stuff is used everywhere.- integer number theory, math cryptography, abstract algebra.- topology- functional analysis. this is like theoretical linear algebra + real analysis. widely used.",

It also pays less at even the more senior levels. A director of product typically makes less than an engineering manager.If you enjoy the social side of SWE try to get a job as forward deployed engineer or an engineer at a company that values pairing or lots of meetings.",

They too want to get stuff out on time and are frequently more flexible than you would think, especially if you push back with solid compromises. Make your concerns known quickly so folks can shift scope. Use data if you can to support your case; using only your gut will frequently get you no where. As you get more practice and work with the same people your assumptions will get a lot better when faced with stuff like this. Another thing I started doing later in my career is try and get involved more in project planning with product just to have a jump start on things.Anyway, good luck!",

Some are just a pain in the ass, either because the planning involved is inherently difficult, or the customer changes their mind, or there are unforeseen issues necessitating changes.I work for a medium-sized business, with multiple departments and people who spent most of their time in meetings so that we don't have to. Which is nice, but it also means there's plenty of space for communication to get lost.You work for a startup. The whole company should be able to sit down and align on these things in one meeting. If you're not sure what the current stack/setup/codebase is capable of and how it's used, sit down with every other technical person in the startup and ask questions until you get it. If you find that requirements are changing on the fly, ask to be involved in all the meetings where requirement changes are decided/discussed. Enforce best practices by documenting the infrastructure, take meeting minutes e.g. in confluence, make sure discussions and decisions are not lost or forgotten.Also document your struggles with the changing requirements so that you can show your boss, look, I wasted X number of hours rewriting stuff last month. If there's a dollar value on the time wasted, your boss will be more likely to try to support you, because the business also can't be wasting thousands every month on wasted effort.",

Their El Segundo and San Diego campus got hit hard too. Lockheed got rid of their San Diego office completely a few years ago. This is a slow but very noticeable process.The primes want to leave SoCal. What happened in the Bay Area has come here too. Lockheed was Silicon Valley's largest employer until the 1990s.If you want to stay in the primes, long-term career move is relocating to the east coast, Utah, Colorado, Texas. If you want to stay in SoCal, SpaceX, Anduril, Turion, Impulse Space, Rocket Lab and other new defense tech startups with SBIR contracts are the places you want to be. They usually use newer tech stack as well. Interview is significantly tougher than the primes. Embedded work: C, C++, Rust. System-level work: C++, Rust, Go.",

Then there are a few smaller ones like turion space, and relativity space that don’t hire as much and don’t hire new grads. I think blue origin is your likeliest bet if you don’t have any internships but even then it’s hard to get into and most swe roles are in Seattle from my knowledge.For Defense I think they don’t have as many swe here.

If everyone hates it, do something else. Or adapt the process so it works for you.If you have people in your daily standup who aren't interested in what you're doing, your standup is too large. If most of the attendees are checking their phone or laptop instead of paying attention to who's speaking, your standup is too large. If you find that happening, bring it up with the team and make smaller groups.I honestly feel like a sprint longer than a week is generally too long, although this varies depending on what you're trying to do. I also find this to be a general indication that your stories are too large and need to be broken down more. Agile is all about fast feedback and two weeks to a month (or longer) is too long to go without feedback. If you do shorter sprints, you do need to have much shorter ceremonies as well.If you have on-call during your sprint, you should reduce the number of stories you plan to handle that sprint. Agile is all about prioritizing things and empowering developers. So if the on-call is the highest priority thing, you as a developer should take that into account when planning out the sprint. Based on past results, if on-call consumes your entire time during the sprint, accept no stories that sprint.You guys aren't really an agile shop, but very few places are.",

Children on a court may believe fine footwear grants them skill; amateurs don borrowed symbols and strike the posture of veterans; machines are adorned with hollow ornaments in the hope that appearance alone might conjure mastery. In each case, the emblem is mistaken for the discipline it represents.Managers clutching notes and markers are seldom distant from this same pattern of thought.There is little to be done to reverse it. Cultural change is slow, costly, and perilous, and many will resist it with quiet persistence or open force, for the familiar order offers comfort and shelter.For a season, one may even learn to navigate - and perhaps benefit from - such dysfunction. Yet this is never a lasting condition. In time, prudence urges departure, and the search for a place where form is bound to substance, and intention is matched by action.",

First thing is to understand what a dependency inversion framework is. Understand concepts like bean, bean lifecycle, constructor injection, application context. The spring framework is rich, learning to leverage its robust ecosystem to solve rudimentary problems is a key to success. The second thing that helped me was understanding design patterns. This one is somewhat controversial. Some people think that they only exist to cover up for language flaws and that they lead to overly abstracted code. Those people aren't wrong but don't worry about joining the debate. Whether or not you believe in using them you will see them all over your code base. [neetcode: 8 design patterns every developer should know](https://youtu.be/tAuRQs_d9F8?si=My6PZMe7diw444c9) this is a decent intro, I'd recommend finding a modern book in java to continue this. Next recommendation depends on what versions of Java your company leverages. Java has a robust collection interface that makes it very easy to do many operations on a collection of data though method changing. The stream API. (Java 9) Java 21 added virtual threads, a huge improvement for concurrency when using I/O heavy processes. Good luck.",

        "body": "you're not alone feeling this way - giant monolithic codebases with no documentation are brutal to learn, especially as a new grad. but here's the thing - the issue isn't just that you're learning the codebase. it's that while you're learning, you need to prove to your team that you're making progress and can contribute value, even though you don't fully understand everything yet.like you say you're asking chatgpt to explain stuff and trying to figure out how to contribute, but here's the core problem: even if you spend all your free time building mini projects and understanding the architecture, when you're in standup or talking to your senior, how do you show them that you're actually learning and can be trusted with real work? saying \"i'm still learning\" only works for so long before they start wondering if you can actually deliver.the advice about picking functionality and breaking it down is good, but that doesn't solve the underlying issue - proving your competence while you're still figuring things out. real question - when you're trying to move from \"confused intern who asks chatgpt everything\" to \"engineer who can contribute,\" do you think it's harder to learn how the codebase works, or harder to demonstrate to your team that you understand enough to be given actual responsibilities?",

Collect some simple data on the things that matter to you. Ensure you're making regular progress on the things that matter to you, and doing things you enjoy, with some regularity. Backsliding is OK, bad days are OK. Focus on the big picture. Key thing is to understand, if you introduced a change, did it have a measurably positive effect. You could bounce into a new job and be just as, if not more, miserable. Again, backsliding is OK, but it's important to understand when you're making forward progress and when you're backsliding.2. Work with people you actually like. Working with assholes, absent subcontractors, and awful customers aged me substantially.3. Exercise. Doesn't matter what, doesn't matter when, focus on building the habit.4. Diet. Learn the basics of cooking if you aren't already capable. Track your calories/macros for long enough to have a good \"broad strokes\" understanding of what you're putting into your body, and what your specific body/lifestyle actually needs nutrition-wise.5. Have a ***social*** hobby that you engage in regularly. Challenging as an adult with marriage, mortgage, kids, indigent parents or loved ones, etc. But again, build the habit.I lean on 2, 3, 5, and my family pretty heavily during the rougher weeks. Sometimes the family is the ***reason*** for the rougher weeks and I have a frank talk with my boss -- a person I work with and actually like -- about chasing some shiny objects for a bit instead of my current priorities. Support structures are important.",

At that point I would usually start working on a fun programming side project.When I start wanting to program again is when the burnout is over for me.It seems to take between 3 and 4 months of not working to get my spark back, and most people I know have needed to ***at least change jobs*** before they start getting better.

It's just that this is a place where I would actually probably want to work.

That portfolio got callbacks for applied LLM engineer and research engineer more than generic DS. Realistic targets imo are applied LLM, research engineering, and platform style roles focused on retrieval, eval harnesses, and prompt tooling. I split time 70 percent project, 30 percent interview drills. I used timed mocks with Beyz coding assistant alongside prompts from the IQB interview question bank, and I kept a STAR story bank with 90 second answers. Signaling matters a lot, but your background can carry once you show production minded LLM work.",

Startups might be a good option since they’ll have a lot of problems to solve and more opportunities to move laterally into ML depending on the company. If you care less about CS and want to do math, I think you need to go for a math master’s. It depends on the school but data science has become sort of bloated in scope and popular among people looking to pivot into tech, so I would first just look closely at the curriculum to see if it’s what you want.",

What makes job fairs good in my experience is that the people attending are already pre-filtered (whether it's by school, industry, city, etc.). If you open the floodgates to the general public, you won't have enough hours in the day to get to everyone. If you have some selection criteria that narrows down candidates before the event, then you've basically constructed the same set of barriers that left people ghosted and rejected in the first place.

        "body": "Having been through this a couple times, my advice is to look at how much you're being paid to stay. Deals differ, but in my experience if you're going to get a compelling equity payout, retention bonus, stock grant in the new company or are seen as playing a role in the acquisition (in a way that materially benefits you) you'll probably know about it (even if not exact numbers) within a week or two. If you're not being paid anything, treat it like any new job, and evaluate it on those terms. Would you have applied for this company before they bought your current employer? Are they doing anything exciting? Are they hiring for your role + experience?Also: executive bullshit can get especially thick after deals like this. They likely do have retention bonuses or targeted bonuses for certain milestones even if you don't, and otherwise decent people have a way of rationalizing really shitty behavior when someone dangles enough money in front of them. So, if you're hearing about the 2026 roadmap, that there will be no layoffs, or other stuff that paints a rosy picture around the future, take it with a big grain of salt. They _might_ not be lying outright (or they might be!), but they may have a lot of incentive to hold off a mass exodus even if leaving would be the better move for employees.What I'm reading is that you weren't really happy before this deal, you were serious enough about leaving to have offers on the table relatively quickly after the deal, you're not super jazzed about what the new company is doing (you don't mention this at all in your post), and you're probably not going to get much/any retention $ from this (sorry, but I think you'd know about it by now). I actually had almost exactly this situation earlier in my career, bought the BS, stayed, and regretted it. I like to think I'd be out the door pretty quickly if it happened again.",

(I find myself drifting towards the latter, now that I'm closer to 40 than 30 and realize that I'll never want kids or a house in the 'burbs.)The people with the tech research jobs actively sought that out during their PhDs. They found advisors in other departments working on ML, and attended ML seminars, helped run ML workshops, did tech internships, etc. There was a time when generic math/physics/etc PhDs got hired on to these jobs, but Covid slammed that door shut if you weren't actively keeping it open... nowadays, given the market, even getting hired as an SWE or data scientist right out of grad school isn't easy. Being a smart guy/gal who used Sage for your number theory project or MATLAB for your CFD project doesn't really cut it any more.The average time to completion in my program was 6 years. I knew a few people who finished in 4, and a few who stayed for 9-10, but most people got out in 5-7. I was on track to be a 5, until I got scooped, and I ended up making it out in 7. You said it was a foreign PhD program and these tend to be shorter because they expect you to already have an MS coming in and start working on research immediately, but it still raises an eyebrow that you're already 28 and penciling in being out by 32-33. (Mid-30s isn't old by any means, but it is just old enough that you will look around and see a lot of your friends having kids and buying houses, so if you're prone to comparing yourself with people that could gnaw at you.)So I think my gut reaction is this isn't a bad idea, but at least my experience has been that a STEM PhD is not a golden ticket to a high paying tech job any more. You will want to align yourself with that from day one of school if that's your goal. If you drift into doing a pure math or even classical applied math (e.g. CFD, PDEs) thesis, it might not get you where you want to go.edit: sorry, I said \"foreign\" but you're not even from the US, so from your perspective it's not foreign at all! I am from the US, and my message is written from that perspective.",

At some companies SRE's are SWE's who focus on infrastructure, observability, and reliability. At other companies they've basically took the old sysadmin roles, added more responsibilities, and relabeled it to be SRE.I realize I came off as pretty harsh on SRE's which isn't my intention. Many of the SRE's I've worked with in my career are incredibly smart and well respected.
