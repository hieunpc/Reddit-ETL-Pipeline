I don't have all of the source data I need to make these and use work either so I need to identify those, build views in SQL server for the source systems that the orchestrator can query and add to the extractors. It took Claude Code an hour with almost no interaction on my part aside from approving the plan upfront. It one shotted the whole thing. All models compiled. Then I had it build a tool to cross validate the data from the old system with the new system.By no means was this sexy or even complicated work but it was insanely time-consuming. That would've been a couple days worth of work doing it by hand. Hell, just cross referencing out which source data I was missing would've been annoying and painful. I know because I did pretty much this exact same task by hand about six months ago.I spent effectively 25 to 30 minutes on the whole thing planning upfront.",

If your company has ample confluence docs, uses jira well, uses datadog or some central observability, GitHub, Aws, then just using the relevant mcps + clis with an agent cli can do pretty wild stuff. If you have multi-repo setup, you can run the agent at a parent directory with a minimal md for context about what each repo is, with more robust md in each repo. You can use skills that teach it your particular workflows (eg when you make a pr, watch the ci to pass, if it fails investigate logs on circleci using circleci mcp).",

Ultimately I set up another call to just chat. Told them that I use AI regularly and asked what they used. I asked them about using it to help answer questions. I told them I'd like to talk about some things and just wanted their answer in their own words. It became clear that they knew what they were talking about but there was a confidence issue. I have the same thing in interviews, I often freeze in my thoughts when I should be able to easily answer. I don't know what the right thing to do is, but as of now the use of AI is so ingrained in business life how can I dismiss its use completely.

Second system syndrome is incredibly common at all levels.You can try to document everything, and particularly provide metrics around how things are running to make a case that it’s actually in hand. I would assume there’s a deeper issue with data access that you aren’t fully informed about, so you might not even know what you’re arguing against.Ultimately these decisions are completely out of your hands, a C-level executive that’s recently hired has absolute authority to start changing things entirely by opinion. It’s going to take several quarters for wrong decisions impact to be felt to the point of them being blamed for them.If your new CTO doesn’t buy what you’re selling, and you’re not willing to go along for the ride with an open heart, absolutely look for the quickest exit.I say all this as the C-level executive. It’s also very possible the new CTO is seeing/know something you don’t, and what you’re reacting to is the first step in a long term plan that they themselves can’t clearly articulate because they are new.If you do stay on, you should try to build a new relationship and pull in the same direction for the next year before passing judgement.

Don't assume that a long tenure of good work, or good relationships elsewhere in the company, will save you - if your reporting line is against you, it's over (unless you can move laterally within the org, but you would likely have to substantially change roles to get out from under the CTO.) Your performance reviews are about to get worse as well, due to downward pressure to push you out. They do not have to be fair, and defiance is pointless - if the CTO wants it, a \"case\" will be built for removing you, even if it takes months or years.The safest bet is to update your resume and reach out to contacts you trust. Presumably you have those, from former coworkers happy with what you accomplished. It is far easier to change your environment than to change the nature of a CTO who is not interested in engaging with you on goals, tech, costs, etc. on their merits. I am sorry you are dealing with this, but you should not pass up outside opportunities while holding onto \"hope\" that something gets better there.",

Your manager has likely built his career and secured his position by, as you say it, running the corporate playbook. He is in meetings you are not in and has access and built in authority in a way that you do not. This gives managers a natural political advantage over their ICs - so you need to tread carefully. I would not risk overplaying your hand by going to the CTO to break out from under him unless there is a clear business need you can point to - even then this is even harder without your manager on side. I’ve worked with managers like this before, yes they suck to work with. But judging on your post and responses I think it’s very likely that your manager has marked you as someone to keep an eye on and plan against. You’ve tipped your hand by openly having conflict with them. A coup at this point will fail. This person hasn’t made it to this point just to let an IC who wants to do things their way ruin their career. If you go to your CTO and effectively say “I can’t work with this guy because he doesn’t let me operate the way I want to”, what would your CTO say? You need a better way of framing it. Also you only get one shot to pull the “change things or I’m leaving” card and you better have an offer in hand that you’d be ok taking if things didn’t go your way.",

They don't really care about new customers or cost savings, that's just how they control and direct underlings what to do.

Being dependent on a single engineer is his nightmare. You think you can take this to the cto because he smiled at you and said good work a couple of times. That’s not the case. If you wish to stay at your current place, you should stop the open conflict with your manager. Continue putting out great work, making sure you get the credit and the cto sees it.

I get it, it’s competitive. I think the new reality is that DE interviews require at least two months of study. At least that’s been my experience",

Data engineers have to optimize the query and automate it.It’s the same thing with cloud engineering. If you can’t deploy websites. write SQL queries, generate SSL certs, and write terraform. You’ll need a lot of help or create a lot of technical debt.A decent path that requires job hopping and a bit of luck:Analyst to an analytics engineer to data engineer to data architect to management or cloud architecture.Seems to be easier to do this in a Google Cloud environment.

Even with a great gym AI tool in my experience a client is only going to be able to explain about 80% of the queries they want in layman's terms. There's certain things that the client won't be able to explain without a deep understanding of the table structure because they wouldn't know to ask. It can move us as data analysts and data scientists away from the simple monotonous queries that probably make up 80% of the work, into more interesting queries and working more as a consultant/advisor to our non-technical business partners. What's going to be critical for this is that the data scientist or data analyst needs to have excellent communication skills, specifically being able to take technical subjects and communicate them clearly to non-technical people.",

Prod only where you have customers who rely on prod being up is a war crime either waiting to happen or already in progress.Somewhere I have worked was \"prod only\". No source control or anything, so we introduced it. Before, it was literally \"send to prod and see if it catches fire\". After, it was \"send it to test and see if it catches fire\".Still had that one guy who said \"I'm only making a small change so I'm committing to main directly\". Told them to branch and make PRs.

The modern data architecture differs from the older legacy architecture in the way that it only treats the semantic layer G1 as a prod layer, even though the previous layers are in prod and allows for a lightweight downstream EOP product that significantly reduces report load times by normalizing the data upstream and reducing the cannibalisation rate upstream.",

Those being proper orchestrators (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect to name a few), transformation systems (Spark/Ray, Warehouses, etc), and if you wanted to, 'accessory systems' like Kafka and vector extensions to common DBs since you mentioned Postgres and ML/AI. To be clear, I don't think you ever need all of them. Each shop has, unfortunately in many cases, so many options that you'll be unable to really cover everything. If you did, say, an example of streaming some mock data (or real if you can get it) into Kafka and using the operators in Airflow to do some light filtering and dropping that in like TimescaleDB (a PG extension for time series), you'll have enough to go on to speak about the topics of orchestration, real time workflows, and useful DB system choices if you spend the time!On the other hand you mentioned the transition from Orchestrating ML workflows as a DE to going to creational ML workflows as an MLE. I don't think the transition is impossible, but I will say it's difficult. When I/my company looked for MLEs we specifically waited for very skilled candidates. Many applicants were trying to make the same transition you're mentioning but the reality is the skills are harder to obtain or practice on your own than SWE or DE skills. Hell I positioned myself to at least cross-train for it to fill the gap while we waited, but I was ultimately turned down. That's all anecdotal. MLE is a bit of a hot job right now, so you will definitely have competition up and down the skill spectrum and there are only so many positions to go around. Otherwise yeah soft skills like another commenter said. If you do a personal experimentation project, practice documenting it like it was going to be used by other engineers and was production-ready. Social skills, communication skills, etc. are never bad things to take on!",

Learn about the metadata management, from data catalogs to lineage tooling. GenAI requires context to function properly, so this isn't just documentation your data consumers will ignore4. If you're more on the analytics end, semantic layers are becoming hot again for much the same reason as metadata management. If metadata gives GenAI asset discoverability, semantic layers help it understand how to use the assets it finds",

Your current plan (Dagster+dbt on ECS) is the right tool for this scale.The real problem is not technical. A senior analyst from the parent company does not know how to use your stack and wants to replatform because Databricks has a schedule button he understands. That is a political problem not a tooling problem.Before you rip out six months of work, try this. The analyst needs a UI to schedule SQL. You can give him that without Databricks. Set up Airflow with the UI exposed (or use dbt Cloud if you have budget). Show him how to drop his SQL into a dbt model or an Airflow DAG. If he still cannot work with it after that, then the real conversation is whether the parent company is going to force their tooling choices down regardless of fit.Sometimes you lose these battles and the decision gets made above you. But make sure the tradeoff is clear before it happens. Databricks at your scale is expensive and you are not going to use 90 percent of what you are paying for.",

It is vendors, like Databricks, trying to redefine old concepts with a new coat of paint and crowing like it is revolutionary. Not new ideas or even new ways of working. The whole \"medallion architecture\" thing is stupid. It isn't new just new names that actually causes confusion in a field that is already difficult enough. The lack of business understanding and thinking tools are the most important part of the job blows me away. I am very comfortable saying that tools are the least important part of the job. You can pick up a tool in a month or so but knowing where and how to use it will take a lot longer.The trouble is employers want a way to measure talent. Unfortunately, they think knowing a given tool is the answer. They get what they deserve.",

From my experience when shit hits the fan things like this are coming back after some time and then you need a ground proof that you noticed that, and notified the person responsible (manager/supervisor). Especially if you are the one to accept the PRs, it’s a shared responsibility for the code quality. If it’s a smaller software house then I would be more persistent, because his performance has bigger impact on the product. And we are “all sailing on the same ship” :)",

The goal of software and data engineering has always been the movement of data. Its really just a question of who is your audience? Historically, software engineers would focus on transactional data and data folks would focus on batch or analytical. Once streaming and microservices showed up, the lines really blurred. So you could be a data engineer who does a lot of platform engineering and a lot of backend streaming, or you could be a data engineer who builds star schemas for power bi.

Even on the infra side, if your data is relatively small and simple, you can get a lot of work done just configuring and managing tools and services like Fivetran, dbt, and Airflow.I personally don't think data engineering (or analytics engineering) is software engineering, but there's still a lot of skillset / mindset overlap.

My favourite topic these days :)I don’t think “100% self-healing pipelines” exist in the way vendors describe them.If a SaaS provider completely restructures their API or deprecates an endpoint, no AI magically understands your business intent. If a column disappears, the system doesn’t know whether you want to drop it, replace it, backfill it, or redesign downstream logic. That’s not a syntax problem. That’s a decision problem. (Which can be taken by AI, but most of the time it doesn't have enough context)Automatic retries and exponential backoff are not self-healing. That’s just basic resilience. Even auto schema detection only gets you part of the way.What I *have* seen work in practice is more boring and more controlled:1. Detect the break and narrow down what changed.2. Create a new branch.3. Spin up a sandbox data environment for that branch.4. Let an agent attempt a fix there.5. Run tests and generate an impact summary.6. Ask a human to approve before touching prod.That’s not some magical self-repair system. It’s letting a machine try a fix somewhere safe and asking you before it does anything risky.If a vendor claims it can fully adapt to major SaaS API changes with zero review, I’d be skeptical. Skipping isolation and approval is how you corrupt downstream models quietly.Even though I think Airflow is not the best tool for AI, I also don’t think this is really about Airflow vs X vs Y. It’s more about whether your stack is reproducible and easy to run in isolation. Systems that are CLI-friendly and easy to spin up in a sandbox are much easier to automate safely. Highly stateful setups are just harder for any automation to reason about.So for me the answer is: true self-healing? Naah, we're not there yet. AI-assisted repair with guardrails? Yes, it works. It makes the boring parts of your job much more easier.",

Architecture (Lambda / Kappa) OR Data Modeling - usually companies ask one or the other Behavioral gets underrated a LOT. I once had a MS DE loop where they asked zero SQL / Python and basically 3 rounds behavioral and 1 architecture. HMs love it when you can explain high impact projects you've worked on (both technically and business value wise).I also think the scope of work for a DE in FAANG companies are generally quite limited. In Meta / Google in particular most DE work is more akin to a Analytics engineer where you're spitting and shitting out SQLs all day. Microsoft / Amazon is a mixed bag in that regard",

We have BQ and I've used PG/MySQL/Maria/SQL Server/Oracle/... so can probably help.Data types and nullability are concerns you'll need to learn and handle properly with any columnar DB, but there are also DB settings around nulls you should apply so that you don't end up with reports showing 0 where they should be null or logic that has to test for '' rather than null in a string. Data types between any two pieces of software typically require a map, so that shouldn't be a distinct concern. DDLs are a bit different e.g. `LowCardinality(Nullable(String))` but after thirty minutes of learning this should be second nature.Joins - there are many types and you should learn about the different ones e.g. left anti join, any join, global left join. If you build outputs with many (10+) joins or you join on functions you'll find the performance isn't great, but that's more of a design issue - design to (left) join on UInt64 fields. The weirdest thing to get your head around is that join order matters, which is bizarre if you're used to a query execution planner doing this for you. For heavy queries expect to specify the join engine and a few parameters to get things running just right - an LLM can give you a starting point and tuning tests, so not too hard.Table engines - Used properly this can speed things up massively and convey intent - the Set engine, for example is a great way to check if a value is good / bad without an additional join and operates near instantly.Primary Keys - not really a thing here, instead you have order by. There are table engines which should apply the primary key, but it's better if your logic sets this to be the case rather than relying on the engine itself. Expect to footgun yourself at least once here.SCD2s - can be challenge - ASOF LEFT JOIN is great in principle, but if you have a list of preferred suppliers stored as an SCD2 you'll need to order by supplier id and valid from and add a 'future' non-preferred record so that transactions after the end data don't continue to return 'preferred'Syntax: - argMax and various array functions are excellent and Claude is great at writing them - being able to refer to results from the same select can really cut down the CTE chain - if you're running on a cluster or with multi-client and orchestration, the boilerplate can get a bit OTT, but that's true for competitors tooMemory use - All columnar databases love to eat memory, expect to have nodes with 128GB+ if you've got a few tens of millions of rows of wide data.ClickPipes - not used this.",

Off heap pools, Netty buffers, Arrow, and even shuffle services can persist across runs. If heap dump already shows allocator dominance, I would test a control. Run one batch per pod and let Kubernetes kill it after completion. If memory resets, you are chasing allocator lifetime, not a leak. Then you can decide whether to tune `spark.memory.offHeap.enabled` ,Arrow configs, Netty recycler, or just embrace ephemeral execution.",

The interviewer was interested and asked a few things about what I know etc. and I got hired from that interview. So personally, I put some weight in certs when you don't have professional DE experience because it helped me get my first DE role.If you are already in the industry, then it's only worth it if your company can reimburse it.",

But to answer the part that has not been answered here yet, normalization does save space when contrasted with raw data entering the transactional system, e.g. displayed or entered at Point of Sales terminal, as well as with denormalized data in a DWH. That is not the point however, as storage has grown and cheapened even for on prem systems, since normalization was invented. The point is speed and scaling the write operations. When yoyr transactional (e.g. sales) system has to record hundreds and thousands of items scanned, or ordered online every second, it doesn't have time to repeatedly write the customer address, or name in each row of a big table. Rather thatbinfo is saved once in a normalized table and its id is used in each row representing item bought.In analytical (dwh) workloads, in contrast, you want fast bulk reads of whole chunks of a table, and each join is a burden for the analytical system, while storage and write speed are more relaxed",

Also, if you have a Orders table that mixes metrics and attributes about the customer and product all in the same table, that is also not normalized.It's more popular these days, IMO, to have those big tables than just using a star schema that will require a lot of joins. There are a few reasons for this, one being that most DWH end up using columnstore MPP warehouses and they just like joins less. I prefer to have a mix of both if I can - a load to dimensions, and making sure the other tables that inherit some of the data points are always updated in sync.",

If they don't give consent (about 25% of the whole data) we dont have any identifiers like ip adress, cookie id etc.And then people start complaining that our dashboards shows that our customers are useing the website less...",

When you are performing this for building a complex dashboard, it will take quite a lot of iterations which could lead to many browser tabs being open and a lot of context switching.Whereas in Sopho, there is just Canvas which is basically Notebook + Dashboard. Notebook has SQL cells where you can write SQL queries and also Chart cells where you can use those SQL Cells to create a visualization. Later when you have iterated and finalized the charts you want to be displayed, you can go over to the dashboard view of the Canvas and place the chart cells from the notebook in the dashboard. The benefit is that everything is in one place so no need of keeping multiple tabs open and switching contexts for building a dashboard with a lot of charts. The notebook basically acts as the backend for the dashboard. This workflow is inspired by closed source platforms like Hex and Fabi.Sopho uses Rust in the backend as opposed to JVM based Metabase and Python based Superset. Like Metabase, Sopho is a single binary which Superset is not.Canvas is the only differentiating feature that is delivered right now in this version. I am planning to add more AI native features to it because Metabase AI is an enterprise only feature. I also plan to keep Sopho fully open source with no dual licensing and tiering.",

Even scala, for good and bad, isnt a focus much in the Spark space where Python is still king. Is it good to look into these languages and understand them? I think so. I have had on countless times needing data from the software engineering team, or need to understand how the function of said data works and its way easier for me to just see the endpoint and understand what it's doing. Sometimes you get crap data and you need to identify why the data is crap. It isnt often, but it has happened a few times where it's useful. Also, if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to build out REST APIs for any reason, while you can certainly use django, and I do like me some django, you might be forced to make them in .NET or Java or Rails or whatever it may be that the company dictates. I have built many personal projects using all sorts of programming languages just on the sheer fact it allows me to understand the inner workings of the data I am getting. That has allowed me to have deeper conversations with the SWE team for when and how they produce data. TLDR, I think its good idea to understand it, and makes you a better DE, but is it necessary? I dont think so at all.",

I am not saying learn Kafka in details but learn how any message queue can be used in pipelines. Similar for other technologies. After collecting different small pieces and understanding how they operate in a system, you can move to more detailed topics like how can you use flink to distribute/optimize the ingestion pipeline etc. For experience, if you can build and manage a living system, you can implement it anywhere in company. e.g ingest some data to data warehouse, create reports with scheduled queries and deploy it on a server. If you can learn and able to show how you did these things properly in interview it means that you are getting somewhere. Imagine you started working in a big enterprise company and you have a database table and you need to show some reports on the data. Try to answer how can you create a pipeline that meets the requirements of the business.",

Are there multiple queries in a row that filter based on the same column?In general, repartitioning your data in RAM memory using the .repartition() method can speed up filtering or aggregating by that column, because it avoids a full shuffle. But if you are running this query only once in a single session, you are simply moving the shuffle one row above so it won't help much.If this is a recurrent query that runs every day, every hour, etc. I would suggest physically bucketing the data on disk before doing any join or filtering. Spark should be able to read the raw data, bucket it once and keep it like that for further runs. But I don't know all the details of your architecture so I'm not sure if this would be viable in your setup. Speaking of joins, do you know if it is guaranteed that one of the two views can fit into a single partition in memory? In that case, you can force a broadcast join to avoid a shuffle join, but this is only in the cases where you know more about your data than the catalyst optimizer, so to speak. Be careful to not make your worker nodes run out of memory by forcing a broadcast join when the catalyst chooses a shuffle join, however.",

I work on pyspark-specific recs, UDF detection, repeated computation/cache recs, broadcast join detection, improving sql plan hints, better ranking system.. But one has only limited amount of time, right?Anyway, thank y'all for stars! I'll try to keep the code and features simple to navigate. The ultimate goal I want to stick with is:\\-> i run a job on dbx. i see it's running long.\\-> i spin up spark-tui on the cluster. it gives me recommendations which i'll be able to trace back to my code and apply fixes",

There’s no good AI without good data, so you’re good.Obviously you’ll need to adapt to the market, learn how to take advantage of AI tools and implement them in your data engineering pipelines. Also, learn the fundamentals because they never change. Feel free to reach out if you need any help :thumbs_up_medium_skin_tone: Have a good one",

You'll be surprised how fast it'll go. Have it write the ingestion scripts, then ask it to explain *why* it chose a specific schema and made the decisions. Focus on the architecture, not the syntax. You need to understand the why across all of the decisions; this is very important. This gives you a ton of experience.For a project, just use a public API like NYC Open Data (Citibike)**.**  \"Which stations run out of bikes during Monday rush hour?**\"** . Collect the data, model it, and show some insights to answer that question. Then go a step further, do holidays change the trend? What about YOY growth?This isn't 'extra' work; it’s proving you're a partner who builds systems that actually solve problems. That’s what gets you hired whether you go for DE or analyst.",

Lance's file format is versioned, with the current default version being 2.0. 2.1 is already out there and is going to be the default soon, and 2.2 is also implemented and in the testing phase. The choice of file format used can impact the level of compression and performance you see, as the format is continually being improved.Re: performance, the F3 paper ([https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf)) shows numbers comparing Lance vs. other file formats and this is a good source of information (outside of the LanceDB team) in terms of scan and random access throughput (it shows that Lance is the fastest). The compression ratio shown in the paper is the worst, but the paper benchmarked against an old version of Lance (pre 2.0).From a roadmap perspective, Lance file format 2.2 that will come out soon has significantly more compression algorithms implemented, with some performance improvements as well. So more numbers will be published soon once that's out.Re: your performance observations, a) the version of the file format used matter, and b) the data types may not have the best compression ratios for that file version used. In LanceDB's internal suite, we regularly test against these modalities: long-form text, images and video blobs. For these cases, the write amplification in Parquet due to row groups is significant (which is the reason Lance was created in the first place). That said, even for conventional tabular data types (floats, booleans, etc.), Lance should perform on par with or better than Parquet, no matter the scale of the dataset. If you're getting sufficient performance out of Parquet, then well and good, in the end, what works best in practice is all that's needed!",

The gap between what is documented & what is actually used, is a massive headache, so your head is in the exact right place.u/Johnlee01223 is totally right about the complexity, though, building a custom usage graph means parsing millions of messy SQL queries. It turns into an edge case nightmare real quick, and parsing all those logs at scale can easily nuke your warehouse compute budget.tbh, to save you from reinventing the wheel, DataHub actually has this built in natively. It hooks directly into BigQuery (`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`) or Snowflake (`QUERY_HISTORY`) and automatically translates those raw logs into the usage graph you're prototyping, mapping out column level lineage, real join relationships, and showing exactly who is querying what.To keep the compute overhead low, we use server side query pushdowns to filter out high volume bot or service account traffic before it ever hits the parser.If you're curious how the architecture works or what the output looks like, check this quick breakdown [Dataset Usage & Query History docs](https://docs.datahub.com/docs/features/dataset-usage-and-query-history).btw, which warehouse are you testing your prototype on right now?

And building a usage graph is far from trivial. There are countless ways to write SQL that ultimately accomplish the same thing. On top of that, every tool interprets queries differently, since each has its own parsing logic and assumptions. Unless you have the first-hand control over the execution engine itself, extracting things like:* Column usage and aliasestypically means parsing user-written input (i.e SQL query) which comes with countless edge cases. So the solution you're coming up ideally has to be something that can be plugged into the compute engine itself .i.e. OpenLineage is taking this approach for collecting lineage information by integrating directly with various compute engines rather than relying solely on query parsing.I would say go for it and no one had a good solution for it yet afaik. Ultimately, the value comes down to what kind of usage graph you're building and how it leads to actionable insights. That’s challenging because interpretation itself is dynamic.",

Then run a `DELETE FROM` from query where the join between the target and temp table is not null, then a simple insert query to copy from the temp table to the target. This is handy if your join keys aren't set as the primary key of the table, but if they are the temp table is unnecessary and `UPDATE` should work just fine.

We haven't observed deadlocks so far.The table is clustered on a surrogate `id`, and business uniqueness is enforced by a unique nonclustered index on `(reference_date, key_a, key_b)`, which is also the key used for matching during updates.We also have auxiliary nonclustered indexes on `key_c` and `key_d`.We are not currently using MERGE; we're evaluating whether to use MERGE, INSERT WHERE NOT EXISTS, or separate UPDATE/INSERT logic.Tempdb usage hasn't been a bottleneck so far, but we haven't stress-tested it under full parallel load.",

EAV and JSON just let you add a new property any time, classical schemas require an ALTER.In addition to properties, do you need to store new types of relationships between specific or generic resources?",

For EAV it's impossible I think, for JSON you'll have to implement tooling that maintains CHECK constraints (if your database even supports that).I think the only reliable way to have required properties is a classic 3NF schema, but you don't want that; so maybe you would consider relaxing one of those requirements...",

But it can be fun to dive in, and play Sherlock Holmes.I would start simple, and forget about the 350+ pipelines. Start by diving into the easy places to get a head start and list all the problems you've found to kind of semi-cover your ass and set expectations:* Sporadic errors* Data loss on type conversions, * Lineage tool needs to fed better data or it is useless for this purpose.I would write something up, saying that the first 2 points must be fixed in order to get reliable result and success. How far have you found the first 2 points in your flow? If it is near the end, get some colleague to focus on fixing this, while you audit numbers earlier in the pipeline. Get someone else to fix it anyway, you focus on auditing data at other places.The 3rd point about lineage tool is not relevant yet. If you don't find a few clear errors that fixes stuff down the line, and you must go detailed through almost all flows as your last resort, the lineage tool *must* be improved and to be relied on. That is probably probably not a small task in itself, and there's likely a reason it is superficially setup as is.As for the actual data hunt; you most likely have already done so, but compare the 2 curated tables. If they are identical you know to whether to go forward or backwards in your flows for errors. If you need to go back in your flows, make an audit somewhere in the middle between the source and curated tables of going backwards. Does data match, does transformations makes sense. Then you do the same, figure out if you need to go forward/backward again. Audit somewhere in the middle again so you don't go through all steps. Break down your audit spots, and focus on 2 to 5 KPI's and the data they rely on. Document your code to easily reproduce the check at different spots for that part of the data, so you can show others.And make those others quickly check you're on the right path, and that they agree you compare the proper data, so a misunderstanding does not lead astray.Depending on urgency and resources available, I would show findings and clearly point out, that it doesn't make sense to compare and audit those KPI's if you can't trust the data in the first place. Suggest a plan, split up the tasks. Whether you are solo or can get help from team mates, don't do a bit of data loss fix, and then some audit, and then some check on sporadic errors, back and forth, etc. In all 3 tasks there's a bunch of rabbit holes to dive into, and I at least had trouble keeping a mental overview on the project itself and its progress while jumping from rabbit hole to rabbit hole. Almost fixing almost all problems at once, so the puzzle pieces suddenly match perfect at the same time hasn't happened for me, at least. And it sounded like a simpler setup than yours. Now it became quite long, TL;DR, break stuff down, audit certain data for certain KPI's midway though the flow, and midway from last checkpoint, etc. Focus on specifics tasks, don't do everything at the same time, and then you've got this, as long as you don't let yourself get bullied on timelines. Stand up for yourself, and let management know if you've discovered deeper problems, which requires more time than initially expected.",

Building and breaking things is an infinitely faster way of learning then stopping and taking a course or reading a book. Keep doing what your doing, find the help you need when you encounter a problem. Soon enough you will have encountered so many problems you can now solve that you're employable. Or at least that's the plan. That being said there's nothing wrong with getting interested in these new challenges and starting a new project to tackle them in depth. Most of my learning has resulted in unfinished projects and that's also fine",

You cant optimize \"after you're done\", there wont be anyone paying your time to do that if it already works.You need to clean it as you go, and your starting state is increasingly better with experience; not a single giant god-file of procedural code.That then takes you to the next trap. Once you've finalized one use-case, you want to refactor it, because now you can do it \"better\". That's a trap, you'll need to learn to accept \"good enough\" somewhere along the way and take your lessons to the next project instead of getting stuck in this loop.With that in mind, I actually think this is bad advice. I prefer devs who think a little before coding. Knowing your context boundaries can already help you structure your implementation greatly; starting with something like hexagonal is not slow anymore, it's fast and you can use scaffolders for it; openapi generators if you're using good structure will also accelerate API exposure AND consumption; so you arent over-engineering it if it took you 1 hour to setup and saved you 50 hours of refactors or bug-hunting as you implement, while simultaneously making it easier to change.You write code once and read it 100 times. Optimize for readability from the get-go, and continuously improve as you go.17YOE here.",

And even when they know they are working in terrible code, they lack the time, or the ability, or the courage to fix it.",

They correlate, but they're not the same thing.Math gives you vocabulary (sets, functions, proofs) and trains abstract reasoning. But the specific skill of \"I have a complex problem — how do I break it into tractable parts?\" is best built by solving a lot of programming problems with deliberate reflection, not by restarting algebra.Follow the math list others recommended — it's solid. But in parallel: do structured problem sets (Exercism, Advent of Code easy levels) and after each one, write out in plain English how you decomposed the problem before you touched code. That explicit practice of \"problem → sub-problems → approach\" will do more for your logical thinking than math alone, faster.",

Get error reporting setup. - From HTML, learn [templating](https://phptherightway.com/#templating). - Learn proper routing using urls vs direct file links. Introducing HTTP, like 404 Not found. - Learn routing with HTTP methods using forms (`GET /form` & `POST /form`). Starts the thinking in \"MVC\" & \"Restful\" like patterns. - Learn about validating (not sanitizing) data, returning early, sending error messages to the template with HTTP response codes. - Learn about databases (using SQLite, less setup) to populate & read data. - Next would be refactoring to smaller testable functions (Are you receiving the data (input or code to function) you need? Are you getting the output you expect?), - Then OOP and better project structure. - Try this out using the common beginner User Registration/Login projects and learn about password_* functions (vs md5, sha1, etc), etc.A beginner would then be comfortable getting into current concepts found in libraries and frameworks.See how this was more focused to learning based on experience?",

Before you worry about tools like Burp Suite, the single most valuable thing you can do is build a rock-solid mental model of how software actually executes. I'd seriously recommend working through CMU's Bomb Lab and Attack Lab (both freely available — just search \"CMU bomb lab\" and \"CMU attack lab\" and you'll find the assignments plus tons of writeups from students who've completed them). Bomb Lab teaches you to reverse engineer a binary using GDB and disassembly, figuring out what inputs defuse each \"phase\" of a bomb. Attack Lab goes further and has you actually craft buffer overflow exploits, including code injection and return-oriented programming. These aren't theoretical exercises — they're teaching you the exact thought process security researchers use: read the code or binary, understand the expected behavior, then ask \"what happens if I send something the developer didn't anticipate?\"Once you've internalized that mindset, the web security stuff you're learning (endpoints, parameters, open redirects) starts to click because you realize it's the same pattern at a different layer. A security researcher looking at a web app is doing the same thing you do in Attack Lab — tracing how input flows through the system and finding the spot where untrusted data gets used in a way the developer didn't account for. Tools just automate parts of that process; the skill is in knowing what to look for and why. Build that foundation first and everything else will make a lot more sense.",

What happens if you change the ID number? Can you view information that belongs to other accounts? I've seen that multiple times.The first thing I ever exploited was a login screen on a timesharing system. I made a trojan that ran, waiting for someone to attempt to log in, and harvested their username and password, then logged itself out. What I noticed, and exploited, was that if people got a \"Login failed\" message, they assumed they'd mistyped the password (it wasn't echoed) and the next time they tried, it worked, so they thought nothing of it.",

When something goes wrong (as it inevitably does), they're left to \"googling and praying\".On the other hand, when I do a proper deep-dive into a topic, I can not only diagnose problems without googling them, I can avoid them altogether. Even though I spent a lot of time learning it, the \"learned it fast\" people usually end up coming to me for advice when they get stuck.When I graduated, the world-wide web was pretty new and although the internet proper had been around for a while, it didn't really hit mainstream until the web came along. So I started hearing people talk about things like TCP/IP and sockets and firewalls and routers and I didn't know what any of that meant (they weren't teaching it in college back then unless you specialized in networking).When I asked for clarification on these, the attitude I got was kind of like \"you absolutely useless fucking retard what are you even doing in the building you worthless piece of human trash everybody knows this and if you don't already know this you should go kill yourself you clueless moron\" (be prepared to be treated that way a lot if you want a career in software, it kind of goes with the territory unfortunately). So I decided to teach it to myself and I picked up a big heavy book called \"TCP/IP Illustrated\". It took me a long time to work through it, but it answered all the questions that nobody seemed to think I was worthy of getting answers to and I could suddenly predict how things were going to work before I tested them.And then something unexpected happened. All the \"kill yourself moron\" people started coming to _me_ with questions about why things were failing. It turns out they didn't understand it _either_ and they were upset because my questions were uncovering their lack of understanding and they were afraid they were going to be found out.You don't learn slow.

Also, placements aren’t a perfect signal of skill.The best way to calm the overwhelm is, as someone suggested, to pick one track for 8–12 weeks (e.g., Java and DSA or web dev). Build small projects that you finish (and can explain). If you are struggling with learning, maybe build a lesson or activity planner to help you keep up. Also, do a little daily (30-60 min) learning instead of binge-learning.Focus on consistency and fundamentals, and you’ll be fine. Fundamentals are especially important as AI changes how tech works.

First guess 50, 75, 62, 69 done, how about 79? 50, 75, 87, 81, 78, 80, 79 done.Now convert that algorithm into a tree like data structure, a b-tree. Each node in the tree has a possible left and a possible right. To find the node you want quickly just check left, then right, which also makes this algorithm trivial for a recursive search.You mentioned that it needs sorted data, have a look at the quicksort algorithm and see how that one works at its core of splitting the dataset into two, and repeating itself on the two pieces.",

But yeah... it gets to all of us. Just don't let it get out of control. If you need to, step away, ask for help, there's nothing wrong with that. And I mean any help, mental, development, hobby, what ever it takes to not spiral out of control. Also, this is how you grow... by learning new things. That's why I switched teams a year ago. I felt like I had plateaued where I was after 7 years. I was afraid I had stagnated. When an opportunity came up to change to a new area, I leapt... with out thinking it through. Part of me regrets it because there was another opportunity that might have worked better, but overall, I'm good with where I am... I kind of like not having a ton of meetings. :P",

Once those feel comfortable rich by Will McGuire is worth looking at just to see how someone writes genuinely elegant Python with good separation of concerns. If you want something more data focused then pandas source is educational but honestly quite dense so I would save that for later. The key thing I learned from this practice is not to just read but to pick one function understand every line then try to rewrite it yourself without looking.

Even small internal tools or scripts that clean up CSVs can turn into very real use cases. A lot of practical software starts as someone scratching an itch inside a non tech environment.Also, it is fine if it stays a hobby for a while. Skills compound quietly. The fact that you are thinking about caching and replicas without external pressure means you actually enjoy the systems side. That intrinsic motivation is rare.

Are you working on a CRUD app? A REST API? A frontend?For a backend problem, \"If I fix the bug by condensing the data model, or creating a simple handler function that can be re-used, or condensing business logic to a service layer, or maybe this could be refactored by a making an MVC (model-view-controller) pattern\"For a frontend problem, \"this broken form component could be parameterized and reused, since we have several form components that essentially do the same thing, thus preventing future bugs in the other forms\"It can help to get a better understanding of design patterns, code isolation, code reusability, and generic implementation. Generic code is reusable code. DRY up your code.. Do Not Repeat Yourself.A very simple way to approach this would be \"let's write the code in a way such that making a change here, does not break or affect code over here\".If you break something else while cleaning something up, that might actually be a good thing, because you proactively addressed another potential bug in the future, and made your code more resilient in the process.Writing test cases can also help tremendously toward building repeatable approaches and also to ensure your code does not break again due to some change later on.",

The “build anything you want” advice only works once you’ve already felt a real itch to solve something.One pattern I see a lot is that beginners look for big, original ideas, when small, slightly annoying problems are better teachers. Instead of asking “what should I build,” try “what do I repeat every week that’s mildly inefficient?” Even if a better tool already exists, rebuilding a tiny version yourself forces you to understand how it works under the hood.Also, don’t think of projects as products. Think of them as experiments. Recreate a simple version of a tool you use. Add one feature it doesn’t have. Break it on purpose and fix it. That’s where the learning actually happens.Your website is already a great start. If you’re comfortable with HTML and CSS, maybe add a small interactive feature with JavaScript, like a habit tracker or a mini dashboard. What’s something in your daily life that could be quantified or automated, even in a basic way?",

With that attitude - what was the point of learning how to write the letter \"A\" in school? There are already enough As in the world.The point of learning to make something which already exists is so that you can learn to *build on what already exists, and make new things*. Standing on the shoulders of giants, as it were.You can't build the next killer app without building hello world first. It's a learning experience that can't be skipped.Find something which seems like it would be fun to make - something simple. Don't worry about if it already exists or not - you're not making it for other people, you're making it for yourself. My first programming projects were \"Guess the number\" type games. \"Your guess is too high, guess again\". That wasn't exactly revolutionary, and the world didn't need my game. That wasn't the point. The point was I *wanted* to make it, because I *enjoyed* it. And as a (desired) side effect, I learned about input, output, if statements, loops, conditions, and comparison operators.",

That kills working memory.What helped me:1. **Narrate intent, not code** — say “I’m writing a helper to isolate X” before typing. It reduces cognitive load.2. **Practice under fake pressure** — screen record yourself solving problems, or code while someone silently watches (even on Discord). Your brain needs exposure, not more prep.3. **Normalize partial correctness** — interviews reward recovery. Saying “I’m pausing to rethink edge cases” is better than rushing.You already passed the hard part (logic + projects). Now you’re just training composure, which is a learnable skill.",

For c# / visual studio I use windows for python / nvim I use Linux.To your questions:- windows is easier to learn on (compared to linux it is an os designed for less technical people). That said if you are serious about programming 90% chance you will have to learn Linux in some capacity anyways. - windows is easier for tool setup at the beginning, at a certain point it flips. The less consumery the tool the more the ease of use starts to favor Linux. In my experience windows has nicer GUI tools and Linux has (significantly) nicer CLI/TUI tools- windows + wsl. I write a lot of c# and play video games, so pure Linux is a nonstarter. Dual booting adds way too much friction. WSL is the best of both worlds - Linux cli + windows gui. - yes. A lot if not most server-based software runs on Linux via vms and containers. A lot of automation and build tools also run on Linux. Familiarity with the system is a huge boon. - it's good enough for me. I use it both at home and at work. Some tools I use, fwiw: git, tmux, c#, ts, python, rust, nvim, vs, vscode, docker, K8s, k9s, ansible, terraform. I use all of those in wsl except visual studio. Modern wsl networking is pretty seamless. I can run a postgres db in docker desktop, a .NET backend in visual studio and a next.js frontend in wsl and have everything talk to eachother just using localhost urls.",

I'd say that the software developers (professional or not) who do it (perhaps also) as a hobby, are the best developers. This is because the people who are the most interested in the field, are likely to be better at it than those who are not. And if you're interested in it, it is probably a hobby of yours, even if you do it professionally also.I sometimes hear the question \"Can a software developer be self-taught?\", and I'm usually like... who the f--- *isn't* self-taught in this industry? I mean, if you're interested in software development, did you seriously *wait* to start doing it until college? I started with BASIC on the Commodore 64 when I was 12 years old. Switched to C at around 17 years old. In college, I had to show our *teacher* how to implement linked lists (not because I was good, but because he was inexperienced with C). Sure, there were things I learned in college which I probably wouldn't have learned otherwise - or at least not as soon - for example, SQL, and other things which I found boring. But all the advanced stuff I learned on my own, because I wasn't going to sit around waiting for college to finally get around to teaching the stuff I was interested in.So, yes! You can definitely learn software development as a hobby only. I know things are more complex now than when I was in school, but on the other hand there are so much more resources available for free now. Back in the 90's when I got started, while the net was around, there wasn't as much content as there is now. For most things I wanted to learn, I'd order an O'Reilly book. You don't have to do that anymore.Here's what I would do if I were you. Do some tutorials, but don't *only* do tutorials. Find something simple to build - something you *want* to build. And I do mean simple - really simple at first. I started with text games like \"Guess my number\" - \"Your guess is too high, try again\", and so on. You don't need graphics. Just find something that interests you.And when you get stuck - google it, ask an AI - not to do it for you, but to *teach* you how to do it - or come here, and ask us. Since you're not trying to do this professionally, only because it's fun, you don't have to stress about it. Just have fun with it.Good luck!",

Im taking all the way back, create Hello World in Java, dont worry about running it you arent sure if you're there yet. After you right it, run it. Dont know how? Cool, you found a leak in your brain you need to fill. You wrote the code and know you need to do something to the code before you run it but you dont remember what that thing is, so research using that information to move forward. You are reminded you need to compile Java, you then remember learning in school that theres interpreted languages and compiled languages, Java/Kotling being compiled languages require you to compile your code before you run it. A little more research to figure out how to do that, likely ``` javac HelloWorld.java ```. Now its compiled so you can run it by finding the command to do so by googling. If you do that process, you'll have quickly written Hello World, which if it didnt take a lot of time that means you dont need to study that, great. But also you've learned how to compile and run via the terminal commands, which taught you what your old tool used to do for you. Then move on to a slightly more complicated project than Hello World, which will require less re-learning because you now know how to compile and run. Keep building small programs using basic concepts, of its too easy add more features, if its too hard then you know what to practice. Focusing on one language like Java or Kotlin will make it easier to learn another in a fraction of the time, so i would focus on one language. Swapping between syntaxes of different languages and different ways to do the same thing is just gonna bog you down, but getting comfortable with a single language will catch you up to speed with programming, and make picking up your other desired languages even quicker. It may seem slower, but really honing your skills with one language will make learning more languages faster after you have that foundation. Jumping between languages wont make you better, you'll just be learning the same concepts in different languages and barely making progress",

Once basics feel comfortable python for data Analysis by Wes McKinney is the practical reference for pandas and numpy which is where most of the actual data work happens.For R, R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham is genuinely the best starting point for research and visualization work also free online and builds everything around real use cases rather than theory first. The biggest thing that helped me early on was not trying to read these linearly but picking a small dataset I actually cared about and using the book to solve real questions about it.Errors stop feeling frustrating when they are blocking something you genuinely want to figure out. Since you learn better with explanation the r/learnpython community is surprisingly patient with beginner questions and you will likely get clear answers faster than waiting for a single mentor. You have a solid plan just start small and stay consistent.",

That's not a question of \"too many\" that's a question of whether you are choosing the right abstractions. Don't repeat yourself. If you find you're making several effectively identical or similar classes, then consider whether some other approach might not be better.Do you need a separate class for each ability? Maybe! I don't have the context on your project. It sounds at the very least like you want all of these to inherit from some parent Ability class, rather than drafting each as a fully bespoke thing.",

And what do I do when I have to touch something I dont know about? I look for help, I ask people close to me if they have done something similar, get an hour of their time and learn from the experience.

Look at it as a menu: sandwiches, soup, rice porridge, mac'n'cheese, cutlets, pasta, etc. Will you be eating all of these every day? Nope. Should you be able to make these? Better be (otherwise your food choices will be quite poor). Perhaps some days you are just picking a sandwich, some tea, and that's it. Your day is busy and you have no time to eat. Another day you have whole day for yourself. You can cook whatever you want in the kitchen. The menu changes. Daily tools you are using as a software engineer, also change, depending on the task, depending on the service, etc.What do I do?1)I write new features to the service we are developing and maintaining. For example in addition to being able to buy a ticket via an app one can buy also via an SMS (for some elderly who do not use smartphones, or whatnot).2)I debug why the stuff does not work or why it behaves weird. Today I had to figure out why a system that is expected to check the uptime of our service is sending empty notifications. Where is the text?3)I review the code that my team mates wrote. Code review. To catch some nonsense. To turn attention to some missing business cases. To suggest some improvements. etc.4)I do technical analysis and help our business analyst. He does not write the code. Reading code is difficult for him. So, he comes with his less-IT-questions to me and I provide answers to him. For new tasks for us to work on.5)I improve our infrastructure. Like this uptime checking service I mentioned in 2). Today I set it up because otherwise it would be more difficult for us to know when something just does not work at all.6)Attend meetings. May it be discussing new tasks, discussing some big problem in production environment, discussing team events, or something else.7)Write documentation. Not comments in the code but documentation for the business people for them to know how the stuff works and what it does.8)Do technical analysis for new projects. The stuff that software architects do. Come up with a structure for the project, suggest different solutions (with pros and cons), come up with the main idea what and how the project should do, discuss with the business side, etc.9)Onboard new members.

I try to create and improve our onboarding manual so the new guy can follow it and hopefully in the end he has a working local environment and can start working on his first task.10)Update libraries and frameworks. Fix vulnerabilities.11)Drink tea and scroll in the Internet while the system does whatever it does with my code changes and I have to wait meanwhile. (e.g. wait behind the running pipeline)12)Do some manual testing of the code I wrote. Before I pass it to the QA. Sure, there are unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests and such, but not everything can be tested and sometimes environment differences come into a play. So, I will check that the business use cases of my task are covered. A sanity check.13)Write these tests that I mentioned in 12)14)Think, think, think. A whole lot of my time goes into thinking.

I find this approach much easier to build with compared to using EJS/DataStar for SSR applications.I also decided not to use JWT. Instead, I chose to use sessions and cookies with credentials, along with withCredentials in Axios (HTTP client), and properly configured CORS middleware using origin and credentials.I recently started building my first full-stack application. I’m sure you’ll be fine. It’s not necessarily a mental overload, but it can feel like one at first—especially when shifting your mental model from:app.set('view engine', ‘ejs’) and res.render()to running two separate servers/projects within the same folder structure and primarily using res.json() to build an API-driven architecture.",

The spec just lays out the properties of the language and what a certain command should do, etc. It is mainly maintained by Oracle, and their implementation of java is the reference jdk. Essentially oracle JDK is the canon jdk.Now anyone can actually take that reference specification and create their own version of Java and that is exactly what those distributions are. Azul, microsoft, amazon... all of those JDK were actually versions of java developed by those companies themselves. So basically the Java specification is the document that tells companies \"Hey if you want to create your own java and have it work with any java code for some version these are the stuff you need to support\" Hence there is widely varying support as well, like Azul still supports Java 8.This can get pretty complicated, there is a community process where people can vote/have a say about what features are getting added to a new version of java, and they do it by creating a JSR (java specification requests) and JEP (Java enhancement proposal).If you are just starting there is no meaningful difference you will have when using any jdk (for the same version).It will start to matter later, one of the major being in GraalVM where there are some pretty neat changes to make java more cloud native and reduce startup time and memory usage",

For a lot of people joy in programming comes much later usually the first time something you built actually solves a real problem for you or someone else. Not a tutorial project not a homework assignment something you needed and made yourself. That shift from following instructions to actually creating something is where most people find it clicks. If you have never had that moment yet it does not mean programming is not for you it might just mean you have not yet worked on something that genuinely matters to you. Try building something small that you actually want to exist anything even something stupid and personal. That tends to be a better test of whether this is for you than any university assignment ever will be.",

It also feels really good to be grinding away a particular problem/\"boss\" and then finally \"kill\" it. This is not to say it is like those things nor that if you like those things you ought to like programming, only that I've noticed very similar patterns of behavior in myself when engaging with the above things as I do with programming: I ignore my sleep and health, I lose track of time very quickly, and I just find myself generally neglecting everything.Which is not exactly healthy, and I could really stand to dramatically improve my work life balance, but...I think it's just that I enjoy solving puzzles mostly. Always have. Programming is a massive puzzle for me, and I love attacking problems from all angles I can",

Just seems kinda oddC#'s linq is superior to java's stream api which is based on linqpNo extensions methods (as far as i know) etc..Overall i think if you learn one of them you will easily transfer to the other.

You unit test a function and you assert that when you tell it to do a series of operations and then save, it should write A, B, and then C to the storage layer.Now you change the code around and it outputs C, B, and then A to the storage layer. Your test fails because the mock was expecting calls in a specific order. Or maybe it's more complex, like now it write A and B in one transaction and then C in another transaction.It can be really hard to express in a mocking framework the idea that A, B, and C need to be saved, but the order and number of calls doesn't matter.So instead, write a \"fake\". A fake is a tiny, trivial implementation of the storage layer's interfaec, maybe it just keeps track of the objects that were saved in a HashMap or a sorted list.Instead of asserting that certain methods were called in a certain order, have your method write to the fake storage layer, then fetch the list of things written to the fake storage layer and assert that A, B, and C are in them.Now your code asserts that the end result is correct without being nearly as tightly coupled to the implementation details. Any sequence of operations that results in the correct output will pass.",

        "body": "I have done many lectures on this subject, which are difficult to summarize in a Reddit comment, but I'll do my best.**What to test**Each unit of code has a contract. Input: it expects specific parameters of certain types and/or a specific starting state. Output: it returns a specific type and/or changes states. When choosing what to test, you want to test only public methods, whose contracts are not expected to change frequently. Do not test private methods directly unless they contain something particularly complicated. In that case, try to refactor the complicated bits into separate pure functions to reduce churn during later refactoring.You also want to design and edit your code in a way that avoids changing contracts unnecessarily. For example, add new parameters to the end of the list and make them optional, preserving the previous behavior in which they did not exist.If you find your contracts changing all the time, this is a problem with your code design. Not only does it make unit tests fragile, it makes coordination with other people and new features far more difficult than it needs to be. Read up on clean code strategies and code architectural patterns. **How to test**The most common issue I see in fragile tests is allowing state changes to fall through from test to test. You must start and stop every test at a neutral baseline state, not allowing tests to affect each other. Every test should be able to run by itself or in any random order compared to other tests. In fact, there are many test frameworks that provide a randomized run feature to help you find and prevent this form of fragility.To do unit testing correctly with non-pure functions, you must make sure to create fixtures, which are state controls. Before each test, your fixtures set up the correct state. After each test, you tear down those fixtures back to a neutral baseline. Do this using the test framework's built-in services. In class format, these are often methods named like setUp and tearDown. In spec format, they are named like beforeEach and afterEach.Each test has the following pattern:1. Set up fixtures, mocks, fakes2. If state may change, assert beginning state3. Call the function under test4. Assert returns if applicable 5. Assert state change if applicable6. Assert mocks/fakes were called as expected, including the expected parameters passed in7. Tear down fixtures, mocks, fakes",

So, one can only check that once the function has been called, the data has indeed been stored. \"This function saves the data from the given data array in atomic write operations for each element of the array from first element to last element\" as interface contract describes a different behavior to check for - here the order and amount of calls to storage indeed matters.

It doesn't mean that everything should be inside the same function from a programming language perspective, but that the user of that module shouldn't be concerned about the underlying functionality. Think of private methods, or unexported functions - you can still have lots of these.**Grokking** takes a more \"inside-out\" look at code, where Philosophy assumes that you are designing something for other programmers to use, Grokking assumes that you are in the midst of building something complicated, and have to make sure that you yourself understands it. And of course you should build it with as small functions as possible - ensuring that each function only operates at a single level of abstraction.I'm not to sure about the parameter passing - it's been a bit long since I read either, so I'm not sure what exactly they are saying. But generally, receiving parameters or objects simply to send them on to other functions is considered somewhat bad design - but of course, if you want a deep module you'd have some \"facade\"-functions that receive everything, but doesn't really do anything about it.My personal take on this is to consider whether a function is a \"worker\" or a \"delegator\" (my own nomenclature) and divide functions into those who do stuff, and those who just sends work on to a number of other functions. But if any function only calls a single other function - that might be a sign of bad design. Anyways - as always, these kind of suggestions are always suggestions, not hard and fast rules. In some cases you might actually benefit from doing the opposite ...

Whether you agree with one or the other book depends on your coding style your mental model of how the code works.I haven't read the books so i don't want to talk all that much about the exact points where they contradict but i am sure that if both authors talked to each other they would agree in many areas. From the limited summary you provided i get this impression from the authors. Both authors want to structure their code in such a way that allows them to understand their code better.Ousterhout does this by creating strong modules in such a way that you only have to use the module and dont have to understand its internals. This essentially lets you ignore large part of the codebase because you just use the module.Normand does this by making very clear where change happens and what change happens. This allows you trace through the code better because you can disregard those places that don't interest you right now.Both sound like good advice to me. You don't have to exclusively pick one and stick with it. Try one out and see how you feel about it and make up your own mind. Personally, after writing a lot of Rust the Normand approach sounds much more appealing to mean than large modules, but sometimes a large module is the way to go.One think i would like to point out where i strongly disagree with Ousterhout. If you have a function with a lot of parameters, i agree that turning those parameters into objects doesnt help. All it does is that it wraps up the parameters into a slight easier to work with package. Functionally the function still has the same amount of parameters. Here is the part where i disagree; Placing those parameters into a global context doesn't help for exactly the same reason. How you have a function with a bunch of effectively global variables and all the downsides that brings. If you want to reduce the amount of parameters you have to actually reduce the amount of parameters. One way to do that is to do what Normand tells you to do.PS: Great question",

The idea there being, you don’t actually have to remember all the details of all the functions, you’ll simply know what they all do from a quick glance at the code. — The thing about these conflicting or seemingly conflicting advice is that they all come from a context which includes the authors entire personal background and the situations they’ve contended with, it’s possible you’ll never contend with the same kind of situation, and it’s possible that you’ll contend with “mutually incompatible” situations inside the same code base. In my experience that means you’re working in many layers of abstraction, and the way to solve that is to start delineating between which layer of abstraction a set of functions lives inside of, so you can apply the appropriate techniques there, and a different set of techniques in a different layer.",

        "body": "The common theme in both of these is to reduce coupling so components can be understood in isolation.Normand's philosophy in Grokking Simplicity is primarily based on his experience with Clojure (and to a lesser degree, perhaps Haskell), even though he wrote the examples in JavaScript to reach a wider audience. A similar book I can recommend is [Data-Oriented Programming](https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming), which is also about how Clojure does things, but with examples in other languages. Clojure was desinged very deliberately by Rich Hickey as a reaction to the problems of C++/Java OOP. Hickey's various talks go into more detail about his philosophy for Clojure.In Clojure, we just use (immutable) maps for most things. Keys in Clojure's maps are considered more fundamental than the mere aggregation of them, and can have a namespace independent of the map they happen to be contained in.Many Clojure functions accept and return a map. They may update a subset of the keys they care about and pass on the rest. You can test and understand these functions with just the subset, but easily compose them with functions that use a different subset. Clojure also uses \"global\" (albeit namespaced) objects for program state, but typically only a small number of them. It's often just a single atom for the whole program containing a large map, like an in-memory transactional database.",

We want the computer to do something, we tell the computer to do it.

If you're only using the programs the KitchenAid already ships with, you're not seeing the parts those programs consist of nor do you get a feel for what it means to dice a vegetable. This is what allows you to create \"an app\" in the first place, because if you were to code everything from scratch, you'd never finish.You can (and should) learn how the actual parts of React work, and implement smaller versions of them for yourself to learn why they work like they do.

There are tons of different institutions around the world, with different goals, credibility, etc. And education will change over time: What I was taught decades ago shouldn't be identical to what students are taught these days.I _think_ where I'm from problem-solving in general is somewhat expected to be something pupils pick up during general education. Cultures that have more of an emphasis on rote memorisation during general education will have to have some different approach that's more explicit about problem-solving. Going by the amount of people asking in this subreddit about how much they're expected to memorise there seems to be at least some educations that could be better at telling their students that just memorisation isn't the goal here.> What are some gaps in regard to overall approach and problems solving you see? I feel like if I know more about that, it will help me bridge the gap.> The two things I see the most is ->> 1. Not just getting the logic out in a draft then refining.> 1. Just focusing on making it work and calling it a day rather than thinking more into - how comfortable is this going to be to use.>> And I find it hard to explain why those two things are important.As far as the end of your post goes, I think that's more frequently a gap in education, teaching _programming_ and _informatics_ but not _software engineering_. The \"missing semester\" covers some of that gap.Ultimately stuff like API design and architecture is a form of user interface design, and I think the closest _I_ got to that in my education was database normalisation. We did actually have a \"software engineering\" course but I can't really recall what the curriculum there was. I think we were at least exposed to some version control system and UML.Students and parts of academia also generally have a very different work structure than other software engineering, where they have some project that might last one semester and can then be thrown out, so they don't really get into the kind of situation where they might have a hard time getting something done because of a design decision made five years ago. Only the PhDs and some other long-lasting research projects actually feel the effects of bitrot and technical debt.One approach you could take here is to frame it in terms of sustainability: Student projects tend to be disposable; outside that we generally want all of economic, social and ecologic sustainability (though the last one tends to be baked into the first one or ignored). Which might not lead you to the state of things that you want, but can at least give some indication of why, in a culture with so many disposable things, and problems stemming from that, software is no exception.",

If i was told tomorrow that AI is eliminating any coding my job requires writing by hand because they added magic and it now can perfectly output code, than I wouldnt worry at all. Even if in the future all we do is read code given to us by AI and fix bugs, then my ability to code makes me uniquely suited for doing exactly that over someone who only has ever used AI. And they will never invent an AI that can take in a client's requests and create their dream program, because clients are literally the dumbest people on earth and cant even describe what they want to human beings yet, and research on inventing the perfect client who doesnt change their mind after a feature is built or prioritize the complete wrong thing is lacking. As far as code is concerned, you need to practice and apply the concepts you learn, forget leet code and homework, you need to build a million small programs and do that a few hundred times, its just practice. I dont think \"ok i need to make a variable to hold a number, what was the keyword for that? Oh yeah, int, but the number is going to be a value of currency so I should use a float. Ok, now I now I want to multiply that 5 times. Whats the keyword that starts a loop? Oh yeah, for. So i need to take that variable, and type the word for. Then I need parenthesis, and inside the parenthesis need to define the starting point and I was taught to set that to 0 so Ill type that. Then I need to define where to stop looping so Ill take that first statement and set it less than 5, whoops I mean 4 because I started at 0. What was the last part of a for loop again? Oh yeah, thats how much the counter will increase so ill increase it by 1 each time. Now I cant forget to use the curly braces for my logic.......\"Thats how you first start out, and likely will think for every new keyword and bit of syntax you learn when starting out. Many \"intermediates\" still code at a snails pace that way and are convinced that an AI being able to do that instantly is doom for the entire field. Advanced developers arent smarter than you, we've just written thousands of for loops and defined a billion variables through sheer repetition and practice. I think \"it need to hold the value of money here\" and my fingers define a float variable. I want performance some action on that variable 5 times and I dont even think about the syntax, I type it. Ive done it a million times, its dont have to remember the keyword \"for\" or where the curly brackets go. Not at all because Ive planned out in my head to do that, Im not nearly smart enough to think 5 whole seconds in the future. Im dumb as shit. But because Ive used the keywords, seen the patterns, and practiced over my career everyday, it just comes out without ever thinking of the syntax.Beginners think coding is just syntax m. Syntax is the easy part, and literally anyone can memorize the syntax of a language. If you can read this comment written in English, you're proof of that, but you have 2 decades of practicing English. If you understand the CONCEPT of something like a loop or defining a variable, you've done the hard part. The part that seems hard, and the part that AI is great at is the syntax, which requires practice and repetition. As far as your concerns over the field transforming by the time you graduate... I gotta laugh, cause this field always has been seeing constant drastic shifts. Many of us here could tell of a time before Zuckerberg and his demons released the plague that is React into the web dev world, and suddenly if you didnt know React than you weren't hireable as a front end developer (according to some)... that was 10 years ago. Think about that, a whole new language and technology became almost a requirement for many jobs a decade ago, that doesn't happen in most professions.Take it even further, Javascript didnt exist like 20 years ago, if you want to work in web and you dont know Javascript you're boned. Doctors dont learn new bones every 10 years, and lawyers may learn new laws, but your countries entire consimtitution likely doesnt see drastic changes very often during the course of a lawyers entire career. There are programmers alive today that use to write code on paper. The fact that something new comes along and you get to learn it is a feature of development, not something to freak out about. At the same time, during covid, developers who were masters of a language developed by cavemen as they fought off dinosaurs were paid extraordinary amounts of money to come out of retirement and update welfare systems in the US because their skills using COBOL was desperately needed and the number of people with that skill set is very small. The last Java job a few years ago I was brought in for was working on a major upgrade of a codebase all the way up to the new and fancy Java version 8. We are currently, today, are on something like Java 24... There are so many jobs out there that will not budget major upgrades, or their systems are too critical to allow risking downtime or potential user issues, and chugging forward without the latest and greatest stuff is what the people signing the paychecks have determined is the best route forward. Corporate jobs are not startups that require microsecond code optimizations and the newest database architecture at the risk of user downtime. Hell, there's programming jobs where intellectual property or government security clearances are required and your VPN or workplace may not even allow for internet access, let alone an AI assistant reading every line of code and doing who knows what with, and your resources are the language documentation and whatever else the previous devs left for you. And in a world where even those jobs all somehow disappear and AI takes over... ok...? Use the AI tools? You want to be a programmer and build stuff, thats why im a programmer. If a client was going to pay me a ton of money to program an app, and that \"app\" was a sandwich, i wouldnt use Java, id use bread and turkey, and maybe a knife. Code is just a tool you use as a developer, if the project pays well and requires Java, ill use Java. If it pays well and uses French, I'll use French. What does it matter? If the paycheck gets signed and you get to make things, who cares what tool you use.",

Then I said to myself if this technology is so damn strong, I should not compete with it but rather embrace it so I started using AI to help me with code. At the beginning it was like a miracle, it knew everything. As the project got bigger with more files and more interdependencies, so more complex, AI started chocking. It was suggesting or doing things that made no sense, it was constantly contradicting itself etc. After also reading some news about how so many companies that went all in on AI and fired developers started losing money, because it did not bring so much value and was rather breaking code than fixing it, I got more confident. You don't have to worry about anything. They have already started hiring back developers to fix the AI mess. It's only going to get better from here. F them all and their AI, Adobe, Amazon, Google. Just focus on yourself, create your own projects for fun and the learning you achieve will just be a side effect for the future. Cheers :clinking_glasses:",

The blank page feels scary because the scope is undefined.For learning outside class, I would keep it simple. Pick one small project that feels slightly above your current level and stick with it for a few weeks. You learn more from finishing one messy project than from watching ten tutorials. The overwhelm usually comes from trying to optimize the perfect path instead of just building something imperfect.About AI, it is changing things, but it mostly shifts the leverage, not the need for people who understand systems and problem solving. Tools get better, but someone still has to define the problem, validate the output, and design how pieces fit together. If you genuinely enjoy this field, that curiosity will matter more long term than trying to predict the job market perfectly.",

When I’m faced with a blank file or an empty editor, I never know where to start, what to write first, or how to structure my thinking. It’s frustrating because I really want to build projects, create things, and deploy them… but I feel stuck when it’s time to actually begin. Is this normal in the beginning? How did you get past that stage?TLDR: Write it down. This is normal in any creative process. It's called writer's block. What I do to get past it is to write a one paragraph \"scope\" statement. This is a general description of the problem that I am trying to solve. It's important to write it because even if you think you understand things completely, you will often find there are details about the scope that you haven't clarified yet. Writing it down makes you confront the details.Once you have the scope clearly articulated and you better understand the problem, start writing your psuedocode; just a list of steps to get there. Each step will have sub-steps, but don't focus on them yet because you will overwhelm yourself. It always helps to define things generally before jumping into the details ( I think it has to do with the way the brain structures information, but that's a different topic). If you do get lost in the details, you can just back up to your scope statement and you will find that there is something that perhaps you didn't define as well as you originally thought. An important note about AI: Yes, it's scary to see things changing so quickly. But, remember this: Things are changing for all of us. You are not alone. Stay vigilant and you will survive.",

I got it because it was a team I worked with on my internship. Luckily my boss liked me enough to keep me. It was also immensely competitive to get the internship. Now Claude does most of my work. AI has changed everything. I feel checked out some days just because I prompt Claude instead of coding myself. My company is very AI focused and we have workshops and expectations to configure better tools and skills for Claude usage. The comment about knitting hit home for me. People aren’t gonna be programming much longer. I already have Claude pull down my card, make a plan, and even submit PR’s. It will be more management focused as we will be telling an agent to do it for us and verify results and intent. I also did the cs50 course way back, so fun :-) but that’s not what you’d be doing as a software engineer anymore. It might be hard to break into tech if you don’t have a degree just because it’s so competitive now. Maybe a boot camp would be a good option for networking and skill building if you really wanted to make this work. Maybe the coding traineeship is similar. Also, learning AI tools to help accelerate workflows.I do think that furthering your skills is a great idea and you seem to be taking it seriously. Having just been on the job hunt I know it’s a scary place to be. I relied heavily on my network and when I was interested in a role I did a lot of cold emails and messages just to chat about the company to have better resources for an interview. CS is a saturated field and I don’t regret getting into it, but I am starting to think about something like product management instead as I’m not sure how long my junior or mid level engineering roles will last.",

I come from a marketing and copywriting background. My angle is to combine copy, code, and security into one package and market to small businesses. You could do something similar. Your background is actually a great asset and a place where you should look to market yourself. An admin who can build internal tools for an office? That's valuable. An IT guy who can also build a company's website? That's a business. A good copywriter must have broad knowledge. You have three markets you understand. I'd tap into them first. I say continue to learn to code. I'm currently going through freeCodeCamp and then I'm going to go back to school to get an associate's in cybersecurity. My unique selling proposition is that I will code the website, write the copy on it that converts visitors into leads or sales, and secure the website for them. Instead of a small business needing to hire a developer, a copywriter, and eventually someone to handle security, they will have me. One person, one invoice. I've already built a website for my friend who runs a music lesson studio. As you get skills, try to apply them for other people.You may not want to do web development, but the principle can be applied to other areas. Stack skills until you can build something unique that people want. I'd highly recommend learning how to write copy. If you want me to recommend the best books on the subject, or if you want to chat more, feel free to DM me.",

Today, in 2026, I would tell everybody, do it if you love it, build things for yourself and others, and use the tools. I was speaking to a project manager at work today, has never written a line of code in his life, and has 20 repos on GH with some quite good apps in them. Sometimes I feel like people don't want me to say this, because then maybe it wont be true, but this is happening anyway. I honestly think programming will always be fun, but, and I could almost summon tears as I say this, nobody is really a professional knitter these days. It's something people do, because they enjoy it. If you want to build software, professionally, it's just going to be different now. Learn how to do that if the goal is employment.

Makes for a lot fewer headaches when trying to determine if we can trust the result.A lesser known detail about two's compliment is that it inverts the CY OUT flag as well. For example: 77h - 76h = ? 77h + 1 + 89h = ? (apply twos compliment) 77h + 1 + 89h = 101hThe 101h at the end ends up overflowing the adder and setting the CY OUT flag - which ends up conflicting with our definition of the overflow flag I assumed above.That explains the XOR on the CY OUT but not the CY IN. Fortinately this is just to make it so that we can use our 8 bit adder over multiple instructions to compute a sum/difference for larger numbers. It undoes the mucking about we did to make the CY OUT flag serve double duty as an overflow flag.",

On this journey, you will constantly be learning, and honestly you're probably always going to feel like \"something is missing\". I've been programming for like 7 years now and I still always feel like a dummy.Unfortunately, there isn't really a checklist of things to know, and once you complete that checklist, you're considered a \"good programmer\".The reality is, if you want to be a good programmer, you have to actually build stuff. By doing that, you'll start to to understand what works and what doesn't. And when I say build stuff, I mean doing it on your own as much as you can. Avoid following tutorials and using AI to help you - take the time to actually break down and solve problems on your own. It will be uncomfortable, but stick with it! It gets better over time. And that's what makes good programmers - those that can break down and solve problems, not those with encyclopedic knowledge of different design patterns or frameworks.Now having said that, I think it can be useful to supplement your journey with theory. There are plenty of resources out there for learning the most common design patterns, data structures, and algorithms. I think its important to familiarize yourself with them, know what they are and when to use them, but don't dwell on that stuff too much. You will learn far more actually building stuff.So if I were you, I would try to think of something interesting to you and try to build that - maybe a game, website, or an app. It doesn't have to be something unique either; trying to recreate apps or games you enjoy is a fantastic exercise. Or maybe there is some problem you are encountering in your life - can you build something to help solve that problem?Good luck!",

It is very common to feel like something is missing because libraries and frameworks only teach you how to use a tool but they do not teach you how to think about the structure of your software. When I first started working on larger systems I realized that knowing variables and loops is just the beginning and the real skill lies in making code that other people can actually read and maintain without getting a headache.​To bridge this gap you should focus on learning SOLID principles and common design patterns which act as a blueprint for solving recurring problems in a clean way. You should also look into unit testing and the concept of decoupling because these are the things that make your software scalable and prevent it from breaking every time you add a new feature. A very helpful way to learn this is to take one of your old projects and try to rewrite parts of it using these principles so you can see the difference for yourself. Moving from just making things work to making them maintainable is what truly marks the transition to becoming a high level developer.",

You start seeing systems, inputs and outputs, constraints, edge cases. That mindset transfers to mechanical design, controls, simulation, data analysis, almost anything technical.On the AI point, it is similar to calculators in math. The people who benefit most from AI tools are the ones who understand what is happening under the hood. If you can reason about logic, data structures, and basic algorithms, you will use those tools better rather than being replaced by them.Also, you do not need to decide your life direction right now. Treat coding like a low cost experiment. Spend a few months building small things. Automate something in your daily life. Analyze some data. If you find yourself losing track of time while doing it, that is signal.The bigger win here might not be the skill itself. It is the habit of choosing deliberate practice over passive scrolling. That compounds in any field.",

And this problem arise when we try to find what do we love,what do we enjoy, and what we are interested in .There are may reason why this thought hit one.But truth is that you don't have to be interested or else other in order to do it,am I right?Just like we listen song when feel bored and there is nothing like interesting thing in here,Just live every moment, don't ask how because there is not same answer for everyone just find your ownAnd most importantly you were saying that you are learning coding as side hobby so keep it that way You don't have to push yourself because when we try something forcefully then it becomes worse and also try this method while studying or learn coding Take 1 conceptAnd study it like kid! Stay curious Because you don't know computer science fully so you have. Many mystery stuff to uncover And if feel something easy then make it relatable to thing you already know or like Eg. String data type Eww :nauseated_face:,what the hell is string?HuhSo it's basically sentance that we write in coding?Nah man!! They call this thing an string,lol :face_with_tears_of_joy: I know it since childhood ..,...........My personal advice:If you are learning it as hobby then keep it in that way .You don't need to follow any course or strict roadmap to learn itWhen curiosity hit just drive in randomly and if stuck then solve it and do it again And by doing this you don't have to stay consistent because it will come automatically and you will become addicted to it. Your response is much matter because I have gone through same phase,and I am just giving my personal advice, I can help you further if needed and also note that if this don't workout for you then it's good because you have other ways to try. :saluting_face:",

So I wrote a script that sorts all of this by year, month, day - simple but all I needed and wanted.And as soon as you can somewhat code **learn unit testing**. Unit tests are not just about green checkmarks or code coverage percentages. If you constantly have the question \"how can I test this later?\" in mind you will automatically write better code. Unit tests will drastically improve the quality of and your confidence in your code.From there on build the next thing and the next thing and the next. Another good project is a personal website because you have at least some motivation to deliver something good and it will teach you how to build and actually ship.Now get of reddit and start building!",

Learn the core patterns, arrays, hashmaps, trees, sliding window, two pointers, binary search. That covers maybe 80% of what you will see in interviews. Two to three months of consistent practice is enough.The AI thing is fixable, just start solving problems without it first, struggle for 30 minutes then use it to review your solution not write it. That struggle is where the intuition builds.Projects that actually matter: something with a real backend, auth, a database, external APIs. Doesnt have to be original just has to be complete and deployed. Recruiters want to see you can ship something real not just push tutorial code.One year, one solid project, core DSA patterns, and consistency. That is it.",

You write it to make it work, once it works you re write it to make it less messy, then rewrite to make it easier to read, and so on. How many rewrites? How many does it take for you to look at it and go ”now that’s I’m satisfied about” :) As you get more experience, you will get a feel for it…. And start writing less messy code naturally. Refactoring though (rewriting to makenit more clear) never fully goes away… and that’s a good thing.Later on you might go back to some of those old projects and rewrite them to update them and keepnthe running for example…",

        "body": "This is a question you'll be asking and debating your entire career and any answer you settle on will have people who disagree. Some will say anything over X number of lines. Some will say any code chunk that needs to be re-usable. Some will say any distinct \"unit\" of intent. Some will say any time your code becomes unreadable or inconvenient to work with. Others will say whenever the moon is red and mercury is in retrograde. My typical approach is \"whatever makes the code self-documenting\"; if I am reading code and the intent of the function becomes unclear or disagrees with its function name, the function is likely either too long, doing too many things, difficult to test, unreadable, or unmaintainable. Not necessarily all 5, but still. If I start thinking \"oh, I should add a code comment here\" I first ask if it should be a function, allowing the function name to describe intent instead of a comment. If I start copy-pasting code in many places, I start asking if it should be a function so that the code within that function can be understood once rather than in each location. If my function is 400 lines, I might (not always) think making it a 40 line function that makes descriptive calls to other functions is more readable (sometimes it won't). If I go to test my function and part of it is a pain to cover, moving that difficult-to-cover chunk to its own unit makes testing both functions easier.With practice, you'll get a better feel for when something should be its own thing. And people will still disagree with whatever you choose lol",

Instead of writing inline code that sums the numbers list and divides them by the length of the list, I write a function to do that and call it \"calculate_average(nums)\"So in my main code it reads:\\average = calculate_average(data)Instead of:\\\\# Calculate mean of data points\\total = sum(data)\\average = total / len(data)This example is kind of trivial, but I hope, it still illustrates what I mean.So yeah, whenever I write inline code that does something that I could describe in a short sentence or a few words, I try to make that code a function, so that it reads more like I would explain to a human what happens, instead of telling a computer what it is supposed to do.And also, if you find yourself writing the same lines of code multiple times, because you need the same steps executed at different parts in your code, I would usually make that a function as well.",

Then whoever reads your code reads the function names and doesn't have to read code to understand what you are doing The general idea is to have 3 layers inside your file. The API layer where the public functions are and are calling other functions, the private middleware that has mostly calls to other functions in it, and the private low level where it is functions with mostly code. This way you have a modular, self documented, testable module.",

        "body": "**Category A - Organizing Code****1. To reduce repetition:**If you have the same, or a very similar block code more than once, consider making it into a function. This is called the \"DRY\" principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). This centralizes logic that improves both maintainability and testability.**2. Concept extraction:**Extract code that represents a single step you could describe with a short comment. Example: # Huge block or multiple blocks of code to register a user ... ...As this code performs and clearly definable task, we can improve the structure and readability by bringing it together in a function: def register_user(user): ...But then we look at what that function does, we see that it does multiple things: # big block of validation logic # big block of password hashing # big block of database insert # big block of email sendingHere we have 4 blocks of code, each of which could be written as functions, which makes the logic more readable than one huge block of code. def register_user(user) validate_user(user) hash_password(user) db_insert(user) notify_admin()---**Category B - Treating Functions as Values:**This is conceptually different from the other two, and mostly applies to more advanced code, so I'll only mention it briefly for completeness.Sometimes we need to treat functions as first class values, where the value represents a behaviour. A common example is when binding behaviours to button presses we may pass a function object as an argument.Here's a Tkinter example: button = tk.Button(root, text=\"Click Me\", command=function_to_run)In this example, the function isn't extracted for readability, it's because the API requires a callable.Other examples include closures, decorators, async tasks and more.---A final note about \"not overdoing it\".Functions are mostly about reducing complexity - they are a means rather than a goal. Avoid extracting trivial one-line wrappers that add no clarity or reuse, (unless required, for example by an API).Bad Example: def print_result(result): print(result)This adds an extra layer of indirection without improving readability, reducing duplication, or creating a meaningful abstraction.However there can be cases where wrapping a one-liner is justified. for example:Suppose you have this one-liner scattered in your code: if user.age >= 18 and user.email_verified: ...then we can wrap the condition into a function: def is_eligible(user): return user.age >= 18 and user.email_verifiedthen use it in each place that it is needed: if is_eligible(user): ...This is a good application of \"DRY\".",

After three to five solid hours, diminishing returns hit hard for most people.Instead of stretching sessions longer, I’d look at intensity and structure. Are those four hours deliberate? Clear goal, specific problem, short feedback loop? Two focused hours where you struggle productively can beat six hours of half distracted tutorial watching.On days when you don’t feel like coding, it can help to lower the bar. Review old code. Refactor something small. Read documentation. Keep the habit alive without forcing deep work every single time. Forcing it when you’re fried often just builds frustration.Progress in programming is much more about sustained months of consistent effort than heroic daily marathons. If you can keep this pace for a year, you’ll be far ahead of someone who burned out chasing eight hour grinds.",

And no matter how hard you study or what you accomplish, one person can’t know every language or navigate legacy code (in a single day) you have to maintain. AI gets a lot of hate, but…just being honest, you either stay on top of it or lose your job. You WILL learn the fundamentals and more because it’s the smart way to go. AI isn’t something you need to become a slave to. It’s something you use so you don’t get stuck. I’m still very much a beginner. I’m pretty solid with Python, but I’m not good with flask or SQLite, which is something I need at the moment. So I need a lot of help in that area along with building a web UI. My main problem with using AI is that AI isn’t really good for niche, edge-case applications. So I spend more time prototyping so I can capture the logic of what I want to do at every step along the way before writing the prompt. The flask route seems really straightforward to me, but I have to connect overything over HTML, JS, and CSS. For me, AI has really democratized programming and allowed me to do things I couldn’t do before. I can get stuff done and still learn as I go. AI hasn’t been all that helpful in troubleshooting. My personal rule is AI has three chances to get something right. If I can’t get what I need after three prompts, it’s tome to break down the logic and code in smaller steps.",

Maybe you wrote a thing and it all kind of fell apart and you're not sure why - an LLM can give you some guidance.Don't become dependant on the models. If you find yourself asking the same questions over and over, that's a sign you're not retaining the knowledge. Treat the models like an interactive version of Stack Overflow that won't be snarky and lock your questions.As long as you are internalising the knowledge through actual practice writing code, then LLMs are just another tool you can use. Don't ever ask them to implement features for you. Use them as tools to get instant feedback on the code you write and your understanding of concepts. Also remember they can be stupid and wrong! That's also an important step in learning - when you realise you understand something better than an LLM, or some bozo on the internet :grinning_cat:",

It is a more specialized field. Even in current boom and that companies want these engineers the hype is dwindling down and the market for new AI / ML engineers will become smaller for the next few years. Most likely Software Engineers will be creating tools that are AI wrappers with foundation models with a RAG or post-model training. You will likely need regular Software Engineer XP to make these things good.Also ML and AI engineers are a bit different. If you plan to make wrapper, RAG tools based on foundation models you will still benefit from good Software Engineer skills..NET Software Engineer: Established ecosystem and jobs. There are many tools that need to be expanded or maintained or even new tools to be created that attach to the current ecosystem of a certain company. There are multiple tools, languages that do a better job than the current common choices in the market. The established ecosystem, documentation, information, experience and hiring pool make it hard to change to a tool. That applies also to AI. There are 20 ways to skin a cat and AI is just another way to skin the cat (create software).In reality. You should look into the regions you plan to work at and what technology is needed. It might be smarter to learn Java with Spring boot or Node.js. There are also many related tools you will need to learn that are framework agnostic, for example PostgreSQL or MySQL and not forgetting good fundamentals and more theoretical stuff. Also the fact there are so many tools in the software market and it is hard to stand out nowadays therefore it is also smart to develop some social skills. Social skills are half of the game in the market. Communicating in a team is very important.",

What helped me decide was asking: what do I actually want to build right now? Not in 5 years, right now. For me, the answer was AI-powered tools, so I leaned into Python + ML basics. But here's the thing I don't think it has to be either/or. The .NET job market is real and stable. Enterprise companies need .NET devs constantly, and the barrier to entry is more predictable: learn C#, build CRUD apps, get hired. AI/ML has a higher ceiling but also a higher floor you need solid math, Python, and often a portfolio of projects just to get noticed. honest take for 2026: learn the fundamentals well in whatever excites you more (motivation matters a LOT when you're grinding through the hard parts), but make sure you understand how AI tools work regardless of which path you pick. Every .NET dev is going to need to integrate AI features soon, and every ML engineer needs to ship production code. The best position is someone who can do both, even if you specialize in one.",

Anyways, the question to ask is: do you want to be the person actually building and making cutting edge breakthroughs with advancements in the types of models we're creating (e.g., GPT, BERT, MobileNetV2, etc) or are you just wanting to apply them in a production environment?The former requires a lot of background in Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics, and the latter requires understanding APIs and what an AI model is built/trained for..NET is just a framework. You can learn it enough to be proficient with the tools and C# in a couple of weeks if you already have background in other languages and tools (especially if you're coming from Java).",

If you’re running into the same syntax errors, don’t fix the problem right away, try to understand why you need indentation, colons.Syntax changes from one language to the next but the fundamentals generally apply. If you need help debugging, honest to god, you can do it on paper or a white board. I graduated from Uni not that long ago and my first 2 programming classes required us to take exams with pen and paper, so we had to learn how to walk through the code without fancy debugging software. It’s something that really worked well for me.Track your variables, update the variables as you walk through each line of code, keep track of what variables are in scope, etc. This should make using a debugger a bit more intuitive. Also, some of the debugging functions were confusing to me when I started:* Put a breakpoint where you want to stop the function* step over means move to the next line of code* step into means step into the current line of code; ex. if this is a function call, now you’ll be walking through each line in that called function",

Or are you asking if it is worth it to use querySelector rather than getElementById?Personally I prefer to always use querySelector, so that I don't have to switch between methods when I want to select something that isn't an id, which happens quite often in complex and dynamic applications. But I also know plenty of developers who prefer getElementById, because they don't have to remember to add the '#' symbol every time. And then they only switch to querySelector for more complicated things.*Btw: I love all the arguments about one being \"faster\" than the other - and I'm willing to bet that if selecting elements is the bottleneck that hampers performance in an app, then you probably have bigger problems than that! Also, I'd like to see an example - a real world example, not a fake made up example of selecting 4 quadrillion elements - of one being slower or faster than the other :)*",

If you're very experienced, glancing over the documentation can give you an idea of what tools are provided and how things work, but you're not at that level yet.If you need to learn about fundamentals like what a function or method is, data types, variables, etc. Documentation isn't really for that.I think you should start with introductory resources like Harvard's CS50 in regards to actually learning programming, as well as just making things. A lot of programming is universal across languages, because ultimately computers work in specific deterministic ways, and languages are just tools we use to communicate with the machine, casting arcane spells if you will. Best way to learn after getting some basic knowledge under your belt is to just build things. Think of cool game ideas or problems you want to solve. You can then begin referring to the documentation. Like if you want to manipulate an array in JavaScript, perhaps pop or push them, you can look at the Mozilla Developer Docs.Basically, docs are a great tool, you will use them a lot, and they can help teach you somethings, but you need to be at a certain level of knowledge and skill.

Friends in other industries have reported similar issues finding opportunities (healthcare, legal maybe being the exceptions).

I think about the engineers who never respond to messages, or provide 2 word answers to questions because they have no social skills, or suck at their jobs and phone in all of their tickets. I think beyond being a \"bad\" engineer, just being insufferable to work with has a much higher cost today than 5 years ago.On the flip side, one of our best engineers turned down a 75% pay raise that was thrown at him because he didn't want to lose his work life balance and go into an office 5 days a week. If he and those like him stop having options, I think that's when I'd concede things are REALLY bad.",

They know how to market themselves and how to fit in well in a new job. Getting a job is a simple process to them.The weaker engineers who want to get a job, cruise, hope for an easy paycheck, can't contribute to technical discussions well, and feel entitled to a job because they have 8 years on the job? They will not survive without reflection and adjustments.But now the average senior engineers are in a new market. During the COVID mass hirings they were golden, they were in the \"good\" half by default. You could get the job done and that was great. Unfortunately, the bar has been raised where that's no longer the case. You *need* to be a good engineer or by default you are a poor one.At my work, I have seen the engineers I loved working with get a new, higher paying role just because it fell on their plate in a LinkedIn message and they decided to go through the process, nail it in 3 weeks, and put in their 2 weeks notice shortly after. Similarly, I have seen the engineers I detest working with, constantly argue and are not fun to be around, make the same mistakes constantly, etc. complain about how the market is dead and they can't find a new position anywhere.Who you are and where you fall in these categories is really up to you. I think if you are a senior engineer, you have the resources all available to be a good hire. It just requires a lot of effort - if you don't understand it, it won't work out.",

It leads to maximum technical debt, with repeated code and subtle errors. After awhile, the AIs start adding 2 new bugs for every bug or feature it adds. AI only works for the simplest of tasks.I don't see why \"YOU MUST URGENTLY LEARN AI CODING!\" is a thing. If it really does work and is effective, why should it matter if I switch now or I switch in 2-5 years, when the AIs will be a lot better and using them will be a completely different workflow?I also wonder how much of (1) is coming from people pushing AI hype or who work at AI firms, and how much of (2) is coming from people who actually worked on complex projects that AIs can't handle.",

I would say it varies a lot by company and even team.Some companies hire more “worker bee” type developers who are focused on implementation then lean on PMs or other business functions to decide the details of what to build. Others expect developers to make more choices about what to build and do the building. Those companies also tend to pay more because they expect more from developers. It does seem to be loosely correlated with how structured their processes are because if different people are making decisions than doing the implementation, process will generally be necessary to facilitate the coordination. The most obvious marker of this in my experience is the number of PMs or BAs or whatever they call them. If you’re evaluating a job offer and trying to understand how much autonomy you’ll have, look at how many of these people there are in comparison to engineers. The more there are, the more of that kind of work they will have to handle.",

Im a senior security engineer/GRC. I don't work from home, but i start at 08:30 and finish at 16:00 except for friday that i finish at 15:30 instead. So work-life balance is actually pretty good. I mostly don't carry work with me at home and i have full afternoon/night with my two toddlers. Really quality time i would say.Here enter a big-4 company. They offered me a job at a Senior Associate 3 level (whatever that is) for 2600 per month x14 tho, with ticket restaurant benefit and iPhone + unlimited data/calls etc and a hybrid working model 1 office 9 home (so 1 every two weeks). It was really tempting offer and it was a career upgrade for sure but big-4 companies have these flexible 9-to-9 work schedules haha, working weekends and they told me they encourage the employees to close the laptop at 18:30 if possible. I rejected the offer. Mental health and time with family are way more valuable than grinding for managers. That is my take. I might be a loser but it is what it is",

Try to weather the storm, maybe AI turns out to be less apocalyptic than we all thought and everything ends up okay.2. Try to pivot into something sort of tech adjacent. Someone will need to test the AI slop apps of the future or review the code they generate or whatever sad new jobs come about in the AI era. No guarantee these jobs are great, or that I could get one, or that they'll even exist. 3. Start over. I've spent the last 20 years building tech products that have by any measure made the world a worse place. Maybe this time pick a 2 career that actually does some good. 25 years is still a long time so while it feels too late to make a change, maybe it's not.",

What is stopping it from having the ability to check its own work and factor in countless variables that even humans struggle to think of? Couple of things about that1. We're approaching a plateau of what LLMs are capable of. They might be able to refine training data or build guard rails around existing tech to make it better, but throwing compute at the existing models is not showing the same \"line goes up and to the right\" growth from brute forcing the power. This plateau has some of the smaller companies without other sources of revenue like OpenAI absolutely shitting their pants. They do not have a business strategy beyond \"keep brute forcing it and hope it works out\"2. LLMs are great at common tasks with lots of examples, but really struggle in unique situations. Think \"big enterprise monolith unique to x company\". And these systems are hard for humans to understand. You can ask the LLM to do an impossible task. A human might come back and say \"hey boss this isn't possible with what we have, here's what we could do instead\". The LLM will charge ahead, delete important files, rewrite unrelated things, fail to complete the task but report a success anyway, because that's what it's been told to do. I've had this happen. My buddy at Amazon has seen two post mortems that were caused by Claude deleting AWS clusters from production.3. LLMs exacerbate the most important part of engineering, communication. Same Amazon friend is witnessing this first hand. A decision needs to be made about some upcoming work. He builds a design document that takes him 2 days to write and passes it to his manager. His manager has a bunch of questions, so he spends an extra day writing clarifications. His boss then uses AI to generate a shitty summary of his document and passes it to the director. The director has questions which the manager doesn't know because they didn't actually take the time to understand, so my friend has to meet with his manager and write more clarifications wich get summarized by AI etc. etc. you see where this has going. It's been a week and a half talking about work that could be completed in a day or two. You see this everywhere but LLMs are giving people an undue sense of understanding. It convinces you that you can do more by offloading your critical thinking to the chat bot. And you see this everywhere, in education, in engineering, in design, more content is being generated than ever, but for what purpose? It muddies the decision making chain and paralyzes people who just stop making their own cohesive thoughts to make decisions I think 3 is the most dangerous. Same Amazon org fired a bunch of engineers in the last layoffs and kept all the management. The director of the org is using AI to summarize hype pieces saying engineers shouldn't be writing any code themselves anymore and sending it out to all of his staff, em-dashes and emojis and all.So yeah. LLMs are increasing the amount of code that is being generated, but it's muddying the most important part of software engineering: building the *right* software, not the *most* software.",

Maybe... But here's the thing about being a SWE - the entire career has always been about adapting quickly: from punchcards to assembly to Cobol to C to C++ to Java and JavaScript to Python to C#, Typescript, and Rust. Or whatever languages, you get the drift. And that's just the languages, there are insane numbers of frameworks and tech stacks to learn as well.So what I would recommend is: don't doom about it, adapt. Like geneerations of SWEs before you. The learning curve has always been quick. Figure out the areas where Codex and CC are deficient, and focus on upskilling in those areas. Maybe that means not being a SWE at all, that could be true. But just recognize that this isn't actually different from what other people have experienced in the past. A college degree is a lot about learning how to learn, not about specific skills.",

AI is making it much easier for me to develop stuff. So companies are coming up with a million stupid ways for me to give them what they want. And there is always an endless list of things they want. Now I can't say \"that's a retarded idea it would take 15 years and deliver poor ROI\" now I'm like \"I can whip up a prototype today and have it in production in 3 months\" and they're like \"yay we saved 3000 dollars on this pain point.\" The other issue is that being a bad programmer or even a non-programmer means that when you prompt Claude, it is like a monkey playing with a grenade.

Basically it shows that when technology makes things easier for people, the expectation is that it will lead to less jobs, but it actually leads to more.For example, when high level programming languages were invented, making it easier to write code, instead of reducing the number of software developer jobs it actually increased them. Because now people were able to create things that would never have been possible before. The thing that you're missing is that you're thinking about how AI can be used to create the exact level of software that is being created right now. That's not what's going to happen. It's going to be used to create much more advanced software than was ever possible before. We're just in the in-between era where the acceleration hasn't quite started yet.It's not your fault for not being able to see it though. Many of the big tech companies are still stuck doing things the way they've always done it, so they're still looking at it as a way to create the same output with less people. The future will be the new companies that are using it to do more than before, not more of the same.If you want to help, be the change you want to see. Start dreaming up ways to use AI to do things that couldn't be done before. Best case you'll be able to start your own company. Worst case you'll end up learning lots of skills that can help you get a job.",

E.g. article by C\\*O of an AI company that AI will replace white collar workers in x time in the future (long enough for people to forget the said declaration at that time). Translation buy my AI tools and don't get left in your competitors dust. If you don't we'll go broke because our tools aren't profitable yet because they aren't good enough. If we get you to pay then we might be around long enough to make them profitable.",

People know it has value, but they don't yet know how much value.The improvements that companies keep making, makes it seem like the potential value is much, much higher than it actually is. Right now, everyone knows it is not as valuable as it is valued at, which is leading to the intense speculative bubble we're seeing. It is the belief in what it will do later that keeps the bubble so strong; if several PhD level papers come out showing we're not even close... that will probably kill the bubble.And of course, that probably won't happen for a while. The folks who would do such research are also largely funded by the people who need the bubble to continue.This is normal for an immature technology. What is NOT normal, is thinking the technology is going to replace everyone, without actually proving it can, and everyone hedging their bets on this happening anyways.Companies like Apple are probably going to be the big winners at the end of this. They're not firing their teams and replacing them with unproven AI. And at this point in time, it is looking more and more like AI usage just shifts the bottleneck further down the line rather than eliminates it (as far as automated programming goes).Since the changes it makes can be breaking and it has no accountability, a lot of devs are being forced into code review for thousands upon thousands of changes. It is likely to lead to unstable software, with limited ability to diagnose and maintain, even if companies increase headcount. You just cannot fit the context of the changes into your head fast enough to tell when the AI is doing something dumb.As such, the workflow we're accustomed to is not very accommodating to AI autonomous changes... until it can actually take over dev jobs, which is still a long time away.Site Reliability Engineers and Cybersecurity developers are going to feast.",

Will they guarantee you a job? No. Did they let me increase my Linkedin network? Yes. That network did, in the future, give me opportunities and connections into roles/jobs. Interestingly, I never took a role from that yet but the opportunity is there and there are some high value opportunities from startups there that I know were not posted on job boards like Indeed.Hackathons can also be a good learning experience especially if you are a student to see technologies (although they will, by nature, be hacky lmao) that are not used in school.Now, did I join every possible hackathon I could? No, not really. But you should definitely join some. You need to learn to prioritize what things to do with your time but trying most activities a few times at least gives you a better idea of how each provides value to you.Personally? Internships are still the highest value thing you can do while in school with interviewing for internships as the second highest value thing. Third highest value thing you can do is building your resume/network so that you can get interviews for internships. Great thing about these 3 goals is they can transition from internships to first job easily and directly.",

We continue down the path we are currently on; LLM capabilities are overhyped there is a gradual increase in skepticism from investors when it comes to AI. Yeah Claude opus 4.6 went exponential on this 50% task completion whatever chart, it hasn’t changed how I use AI and it’s not going to noticeably improve my productivity. My productivity has gone up maybe 30% because I can accomplish boring, boilerplate tasks near instantly. That has not changed in like 2 years, and I’m trying my hardest to automate my job away but the technology is just underwhelming at anything outside of unit tests. Finance bros realize billions have been thrown in a money pit, bubble pops, recession. FAANG scoops up all of the failed AI companies, drives cost down with scale and in ~10 years we get a permanent 30% buff to productivity with consumer grade AI. 2. I’m completely wrong, AI goes exponential, we all lose our jobs. Then what? You’re smoking fine crack if you think that means utopia. Wealth gap increases exponentially, daily life implodes for 99.99% of humans. Societal collapse, anarchy, who knows? Yes I’m paranoid but genuinely how else do you think it’s gonna go? No middle class = no revenue for corporations = no revenue for blue collar workers = economy ceases to existScenario 1 is most likely. I’m friends with a lot of people in finance. Just hearing them talk about AI and what they think it is… mind boggling. Smart guys all of them but makes total sense how OpenAI exists as a corporation. In this scenario, maybe I lose my job maybe I don’t. It’ll probably be as bad as 2008, but I don’t think much worse. I’ll bounce back. If Scenario 2, nothing matters expect my immediate needs. So who cares? Point is, why worry about what’s outside of your control? What, you’re all gonna pivot to plumbing because it’s so damn easy? You’re pushing 40 and haven’t bent your knees in 15 years, give me a break.",

As for people talking about parallel agents and 50 thousand MCP servers and gas town and ralph loops, etc, etc. I think that’s mostly just grift. There is definitely an AI-maximalist side of the internet that rewards content showing ridiculous overusage of AI.

We're focused on production RAG and LLM orchestration. Getting reliable accuracy for complex tasks is still a huge challenge. Hallucination is real. The cost per inference for anything truly 'intelligent' at scale, hitting real latency targets? It's significant; we spend a lot of time on cost optimization. Many 'middle-man' jobs involve nuanced decision-making, exception handling, and human interaction. Current agentic models just aren't good enough there, even with good retrieval architecture. They fail on edge cases constantly. Yes, automation will impact some jobs – it always has. But a widespread collapse driven by \\*current\\* agentic tech by 2028? IMO, that ignores the practical realities of deploying and maintaining these systems in production.",

Anyone who has been in the industry long enough knows how much low skill busy work there is and has watched it slowly be replaced. First it moved to junior devs, then offshoring, and now AI.It doesn't seem like much initially, but when 4 devs can do the work of 5 that's potentially 20% of all of us that are out of a job...and it's only getting more efficient.There's also the related issue of junior dev positions evaporating at a rapid pace, which will fuck the industry super hard unless AI really pans out in the next decade or so. Junior devs were always a net negative for at least a year and after that still mostly only handled busy work. Now that AI can rip through that it simply doesn't make economic sense for most companies to have junior devs on payroll, especially with retention rates so low.We live in a society that is capable of rapid technological advancement, but setup so that advancement almost exclusively benefits the wealthy.

However, that's not everybody, and not everybody wants to do that.Based on a couple estimates I've seen, and assumptions that software teams evolve from a standard staffing of 1/2 seniors and 2 mid/junior to 1 AI engineer dealing with coding agent issues, and 1 engineer feeding in architectural diagram, we might lose 30-50% of the industry. A ton of assumptions are baked in, but it's easy to roles, and huge swaths of engineering tasks being automated away.",

The laptop arrived 4 days late and was sent from the CEO’s personal addressI got a manager who asked me to estimate tickets. I estimated them at around 220 hours. He then said “can you have that done in 1 week?”, so I had to unfortunately inform him that there’s only 168 hours in a week and my employment contract says 40 hours per week, so… no? Sorry? (if it was like, 50-60 hours I might work a little extra or find some places where I can cut scope, but 220 hours??? yeah right)That same manager wouldn’t text me during normal daytime and would only message me at 1AM - 6AM. He was based in the same time zone as me. He then complained that I was “never available” and “disappeared”. I asked them what the core working hours are and they refused to answer",

Was about to give up but I happened to be in the right city at the right time and applied for a Senior role with only 1.5 YoE. Bombed the System Design interview as well. The only right thing that I think I did, was clearly explain my thought process thorough out the coding interview, and communicated that I respected other people’s time and would keep the good of the collective team above my own interests.Long story short, currently working at Palo Alto Networks. Pay is amazing, team is amazing. I am the junior most in a team of like 10 engineers, each with 9-10 years of experience. I learn a lot just by talking to them. My manager is also pretty supportive.

They're fed a nonstop stream of dubious claims of miraculous results (which often leave out all the other work or gotchas).",

It may take a LONG time to pay off (jobs are especially hard to get right now) but eventually it will succeed. Hopefully you'll find a position that is better than this one.In the meantime, there might be ways for you to work around the problem within your current organization. This advice will be appropriate for some companies and not for others so consider your situation before applying it.Sounds like you've effectively been \"demoted\" by being assigned less valuable work. Also sounds like you aren't being given enough work to actually challenge you (\"haven’t touched a line of code in 2.5 months\" \"just got assigned the most absurdly simple defect\"). Maybe you should go ahead and \"promote\" yourself without asking for permission.Figure out who at the company WANTS the system rebuild that you thought was a good idea (\"rebuilding the existing native application with my language of expertise that I’ve worked with & loved my entire career\"). Maybe this is a product manager outside of the tech world, maybe it's a VP who doesn't have the clout to get things moving. (If there isn't anyone who wants this done... maybe it shouldn't be!) Talk with this person. Say that you aren't being challenged in your current position and you have some free time. Offer to build what they are looking for as a \"Proof of concept\". Invest some time and just BUILD the darn thing (it's amazing how much faster a \"skunkworks\" project can go. If you succeed, maybe you end up as the tech lead for the project (which would consist of releasing the \"POC\" that you built).As I said, it's not the right solution for all companies, but it CAN be effective in some places. And it doesn't sound like you are especially worried about annoying your current manager.Sometimes, the way to stop being a mid-level SWE is to stop behaving like a mid-level SWE and start behaving like a senior SWE.",

When they then raised the rates to make payments almost double, for some odd reason these people couldn't pay their house payments. This cascaded the crash into banks having made bets that failed and lost enough money to make them go bankrupt. As such banks decided it was best to not lend money to anyone... which crashed businesses as well. You then add in that all this free money to people caused housing prices to spike, which then nosedived leaving banks with assets worth much less then the loans on it. You also had pension funds buy in on the banking bets, so when they collapsed the retirement savings of many also collapsed. And lastly you had insurance companies actually insuring these bets, then also collapsing. None of this is similar to the AI Hype. The 2000 Dot Com Bubble was lead by a whole new market appearing from nowhere. Before 95 most people had never heard of the internet and few had home computers. With cheap internet via AOL and cheaper computers people starting buying computer and going online en mass. With it came a lot of opportunities. You had companies like yahoo go from nobody to household names overnight. Everyone wanted in on it. You had people standing infront of college trying to find freshman CS majors begging them to work for them. You had a ton of money pouring in trying to start the next yahoo. It crashed and burned when people figured out that it wasn't profitable to sent dog food via mail. That you can't have 1000 clone sites that nobody goes to. Then the federal reserve did the unthinkable and raised their rates. This caused the 'free' money investors used to prop up the companies to dissapear. Anyone who wasn't already profitable no longer had money to borrow on cheap rates and went bankrupt. This again isn't like the AI Hype. Interest rates are already high. Only big tech companies are trying to make AI. This is more pushing AI as a productivity tool instead of opening new untapped markets of consumers. The AI Hype resembles much more the hype around 'Cloud' and 'Blockchain' and next 'Everything is a Service'. 2000 crash was about vaporware. 2008 was more about rot that killed the banks. AI needs massive upfront costs.",

As the hiring manager, part of my hiring decision was absolutely factoring in their story about why they kept applying and how they grew themselves to find a way to pass the interviews. These types of folks end up being some of the best employees you can have, so long as you focus on not disenfranchising them after you hire them.My current boss is also someone who had multiple talks with our company (interviewed twice prior) before accepting the third offer.

Generally those are the \"engineer\" roles but given how much competition there is for AI jobs even in those a M.Sc. or PhD will help a lot. As soon as it involves some kind of research getting the job with only a B.Sc. would be extremely unusual.",

That tells me a lot about your problem solving ability. You mentioned you were applying to cloud , devops etc. I shouldn’t have to explain this but you should have a master resume with all your bullets under your work experience related to all 3 of those the you will select the best ones for say devops and make a pdf of that resume for devops jobs, the you’ll do that for the other types of jobs you’re applying to. Then you’ll constantly be looking at the descriptions and try to iterate your various resumes with bullets of real experience that match what you’re seeing repeated in the various postings. Check the percentage of responses you’re getting and types ie phone screen etc. If it’s below 10% you’re doing something drastically wrong and need to analyze. Additional tip, if you want to position well esp in the AI world show your work tied to business outcomes meaning you understand how you impact cost and revenue. It’s going to be increasingly valuable to understand GTM and strategic thinking in tech jobs because of AI. It is important to think of any job as you’re a little business unit and all these AI agents or whatever are your workers in your little business that you’re in charge of.",

Idk if these errors are because you imported it from something else.you should put a small margin between your titles, so that's it's easier to read each individual sectionSome of your bullet points for projects in indented, but then nothing else is? and even the indentation there isn't done properlyThe dates should be pushed to the right, so everything flows better, they're out of line with your right edgeOther things:You don't really need to link individual projects on github tbh, if you already have your github on the top, though this is a nitpick and a personal preferenceWhy do you have seasonal delivery driver on there? It's irrelevant to what you're looking for. It's also the first thing on your resume so everyone is gonna be immediately drawn to it.Delete the word consultant, it makes it look inexperienced. People retitle their work all the time, and I think in your case it's justified. These we're just somethings that I've heard before in resume reviews:Always try to keep your resume on 1 pageIf you already have your bachelors, so removing the associates is a easy way to save space, and make this one page",

Promotions from Associate to mid and mid to Senior require only a \"budget confirmation\" in business justification, there is a maximum amount we can spend on promotions each year. In my experience, we've never exceeded that budget so these promotions always pass their business justification.Starting with senior to staff, then staff to principal and principal to senior principal the business justification becomes stricter. Staff is defined as a role that works \"across teams\", usually within an org. Principal is inter-org work and sr. principal is company level work. We must justify why we need individuals operating in those roles. For Staff it's not too bad, we produce a list of they type of work and project work that requires tech/engineering focus aligning teams (usually building something global/working directly with internal customer teams etc etc).Principal and Sr. Principal things get much harder. There's really not that much work at that level. My org of 100 has one principal, who focuses on cross-org database work, and one principal who is working torwards sr. Principal by focusing on aligning our entire orgs tech with other org tech leads. I really have no need for more than that.I have about 10 Staff engineers however, some recently promoted into that role from Senior. (We do a lot of inter-team work/support). They are all told if they want to make principal, it is /unlikely/ they will get the role within our current org (we'd either have to double in size, not likely, or one of the two principals would have to leave and require a backfill).For those staff engineers that want to \"grow\" by title change I encourage my managers to do several things. First, keep a constant eye on opening roles in the company, anything principal they should consider having their staff report apply to it and be considered. Likewise there are some other career paths, such as engineering manager (if they want to stop focusing on being an Individual contributor) or even other leadership roles (technical program manager etc). And lastly, yes, it is not a crime if my managers support their staff engineers in their next career step outside the company (referrals, helping be a career mentor, assessing other jobs etc). All of this is to say, yes, at some point, a \"promotion\" must consider business need, and that business need should get harder the more senior the role is. Managers should focus on the realities and be aware that sometimes growing people means having them leave the team or company, but it should happen at more senior levels.If your company doesn't have good definitions of what various levels of engineers should be doing for the company, I'd start there.",

Now, early career, you can generally show \"yes, we need person at L+1, we expect our L to grow into that role\", but major career transitions (Senior, or Staff) generally require a business need.In many companies, this is actually hidden by the modern practice of retrospective promotion, where you promote people after they demonstrate a sustained performance of L+1. Since there was L+1 work for them to do to demonstrate that, it is a lot easier to demonstrate a need. But it is also normal for people to be in a position where there are no career growth opportunities for them on their current team, or even at their current company. After all, if the company has a CTO, and you are ready to take on a CTO role, you are probably going to have to leave. A good manager helps employees realize that and make that transition.Think about it this way, if you tried to open up a new headcount for a Senior or Staff level role, would you be able to justify it with the work your team has to do? If you could, you can make the case for a promotion. If you can't, then people looking to go to Senior or Staff need to leave your team anyway, because even if you did promote them, their reviews would inherently be awful because they would have no ability to demonstrate performance at level.",

I would imagine that as a manager it is your responsibility to make the argument for promoting and keeping your direct reports. Is there a need for someone to increase the scope of work they’re during and provide further technical value to a line of business? If so, make that argument and push for a promotion. If not, that’s just an honest assessment of the business’ needs. The way I see it, if a team’s responsibilities evolve then the needs of the team change and it’s up to the manager to facilitate that change.Think of it this way:You have a business and all you sell are apples and the market only has a demand for 100 apples a year. Would you care if your employee was skilled enough to sell 100 vs 1000 apples? Probably not, right? As long as they fill the gap, there’s no incentive to cut further into your profits.Your decision to stay or leave is fully up to you.

That's just not the kind of place to be if you or your reports are primarily focused on professional growth.What you describe is the norm for most jobs outside of growth tech companies. You climb the ladder by applying for a different job that you must compete with others for, not by growing in place like is common in tech.If you want to be an ethical manager, you should be upfront with your reports about this. If you can make it happen, helping your reports find those roles elsewhere in the company where they can be successful is amazing, but that is often thankless work in situations like this. It can pay off for you down the road though, because those same reports may open doors for you on other teams or at other companies in the future.A lot of managers in this situation make the short sighted choice to say what they need to their reports so that they won't leave, even if it's detrimental to them.

I would talk to your manager on how to improve. I.e. what are some things that we can do to fix the issues that are constantly reoccuring so I could succeed? Questions like that open up discussion and it's productive. You're taking responsibility but laying the groundwork to improve.On another topic, why are you constantly making mistakes? What are those mistakes like? The type of mistakes matter and some times it requires reflection. You can ask yourself questions like:* Do you have ADHD and always been prone to making small mistakes? * What is your workflow like? * How can you organize things to reduce clutter and make things easier?* What are your development processes like? Can you add personal guard rails to prevent you from making more mistakes?",

There are plenty of resources online to learn at your own pace, but if you don't want to teach yourself then that's not a good option.\"Obviously I'm not a vibe coding monkey since I have the theoretical and programmer brain from my CS degree\" Gunna be honest, this is sounds super hypocritical to say right before you talk about how your old major project was completely vibe coded. Maybe you would learn something if you had to build the same project without Claude. It's super easy to understand code especially code that Claude writes. It's a whole lot harder to think of that logic and write code from the ground up. Think about how easy it is to read a book and how much more difficult it would be to write a book.From the sounds of it, it looks like you don't like CS but kept going with the degree and now don't want the last 4 years to be a waste. If I were you, I would really consider what you want your job to look like. I only have 2 YOE and I spend my days sitting in a cubical doing full stack development. In this time, I have learned that real world coding is very different from the fun projects I had during college, so now I'm getting a master's to pivot into a data analytics field. I had a couple data driven projects during this time and realized it was way more enjoyable. However, I also know that I don't have the discipline to self-study without the fear of an exam or project deadline so that's why I am getting the masters.Ill end with this, you're not alone at all. Over half of my friends that graduated with a CS degree went into a different field that involved no coding. One is in audio/visual, one is training to be a pilot, another a scada engineer. While yes, it's a bit demoralizing to pivot a career right after graduation, it's much better than being stuck in a role you hate.",

You already understand data structures, can read/write code, and know how systems produce the data that analysts work with. That context is genuinely rare. For the pivot, SQL is the most critical immediate skill — probably 80% of day-to-day data analyst work is SQL. The good news: with a CS degree you'll pick it up fast. Focus on window functions, CTEs, and aggregations with GROUP BY/HAVING since those show up constantly in analytics work. A couple of practical suggestions:\\- Practice on real datasets (Kaggle, Mode Analytics public datasets, or the Google BigQuery public datasets)\\- Build a portfolio of 2-3 analysis projects that tell a story with data, not just queries\\- Learn the basics of one BI tool (Tableau, Power BI, or Looker — depends on what's common in your target companies) For getting comfortable with SQL query patterns quickly, [ai2sql.io](http://ai2sql.io)",

I overwhelmingly receive interest in automation roles, but have had a few \"manual\" roles come my way as of late.Tons of off/nearshoring. It is a weird time. It seems like everyone recognizes that quality is declining across the board, and yet the trend of trying to push it off on individuals who have little to no passion for it continues. All the focus is on speed, and testing goes out the window. On the flip side, deploying changes only gets cheaper and cheaper, so production issues are viewed as less of a liability -- until you have a $10,000,000 issue.My hope is the eroding quality issues and disruption risk of the modern landscape will make quality somewhat a competitive advantage moving forward. Any team who has had effective quality advocates guiding processes and shifting quality concerns left/bringing the quasi-adversarial perspective knows the value they bring to a team/org. Alas, no idea if this will come to be.",

No one cares, nor should they. If anything, they should just be happy that I’m done because I won’t have a second priority. - IMO, the benefit is going to be almost all invisible. Companies that set their filter to “masters degree mandatory”, now you’ll be surfaced for those roles. This might mean you’ll get more bites at the apple, but it absolutely will not be a fix if you’re a poor interviewer.If you’re going to do a masters degree, it should be some sort of specialization. A general CS masters is basically what you learned in your bachelors, and definitely not very additive. I think programs in AI or Cybersecurity could be additive, or a masters program in CS that specializes in one of those (since those can be argued as additive)",

If you want a quick overview of agent building blocks (tools, memory, routing), this is a decent roundup: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/",

I think learning kotlin and building apps is a great way to boost your resume and show you know how to build real systems. The industry wants to move towards Kotlin Multiplatform to share business logic between iOS/android. I would recommend building your apps in KMP and not neglecting iOS if you're building on your own and not for a company.That said, at least when I graduated tech companies preferred to hire a leetcode grinder with no android experience rather than an experienced android developer who couldn't leetcode. My intro to android development was applying to amazon, passing the leetcode rounds, and getting thrown on an android team with no prior android experience. Unless Android is truly your passion, I wouldn't commit to only applying to android roles. This career is a lot about luck and taking opportunities where they come. From my experience leetcode, networking, and career fairs with the goal of an internship are likely going to be a better use of time than diving deep into mobile dev. Use mobile dev as project experience to get those internships, but don't force your career in one direction.",

Well that's easy but the hard part is always the refinement and the details. That's what they want you to figure out. When automating tasks, how do you get the best and most consistent results? Which models are the best? How to best set it up? Which tasks are best candidates to automate? How much money/effort can be saved this way? How can you still include a human element or some kind of safety mechanism or backstop so that the new process does not bite you if something goes wrong?

This is what managers are going to look for WAY MORE than technical knowledge going forward. At least that’s my prediction and what my manager has been saying but I’m not a fortune teller.

I’ve seen people accumulate two years of experience in something like a BA role and get a job as a dev upon graduation or soon after. The key is to upskill for the role you want. That’s the biggest downside, you’ll have to do the learning on your own hours (unless there’s not much to do at your job and you have time).",
