Many “new” platforms are abstractions over familiar engines (Spark) anyway.Most content creators aren’t learning everything from scratch each time; they’re reapplying the same approach to new tools. Once you’ve done that a few times, picking up a new stack is a breeze. Also, free tiers and cheap cloud setups make experimentation easy. You don't have to break your bank to spin up a Spark cluster. I’ve worked across multiple stacks as a consultant, and my approach has stayed the same: understand data, compute, movement, and modelling. The tool is just the means to get there.",

How did you use both business and data engineering expertise to design, propose, modify, and execute a solution? How did you ensure your proposed solution *actually* addressed the business problem?I'm consulting with a company that used a large vendor to design their data solutions. None of those original solutions actually solved the business problems at hand, despite the fact that they handled all of the data, did transformations, designed and scheduled pipelines, and all of the other data engineering fun stuff.Too many technical and data folk will specify and build something very technical and impressive looking just enough to get greenlit by managers. Then they go and build said thing and deliver the equivalent to a car whose wheels are on the roof. They met all the expectations: an engine, uses gasoline, produces torque through wheels, has seats, etc., but ultimately built something useless to the business.Reviewing that previous group's work, I've found that their stakeholder presentations are full of technical diagrams outlining the tools and technologies they will use, and how cool said tools are, but overall they contain little about how they will help. Using cars as an analogy (again), it's as if one advertised how great the metallurgy is in the car, what electrical connectors it uses, etc.; that kind of detail is ultimately important, the engineers are interested in it and stakeholders are impressed by it, but what *actually* matters is how the car works. Is the car safe, can it accelerate well, does it have good enough mileage, can it accommodate everybody in it, does it do what you need, and can you explain why and how it achieves all of this?How do *you* avoid doing the above and ensure your work fulfills business problems? Can you work both domains simultaneously: both understanding the business *and* having the technical expertise to construct data solutions that solve the problem? Can you show your technical expertise while explaining the business problem, and then show your understanding of the business problem while discussing your technical expertise? Can you keep all of this together in a cohesive story?Lastly, can you demonstrate the ability to learn and adapt? Can you learn new business environments/problems and then describe how you would approach finding a technical solution? Can you show that you're not a one-trick pony and have found proper solutions to things? The way my manager framed it: can you be left alone with a client such that your manager can sleep easy, knowing you will properly present and harvest information correctly?Being able to speak both \"languages\", business and technical, puts you far ahead of other candidates. In interviews, I often find myself interviewing the interviewer, asking about the characteristics of the project, discussing their current solutions, and where they're trying to go. Then from there, I describe technical solutions, the needed labor/resources, and how the outcomes of said solutions will solve their business problems. I interweave past experience into this to demonstrate familiarity and competency. Also, don't be a know it all - when you encounter something you don't know, say so and provide your approach to developing understanding - people can tell when you're bullshitting, and dishonesty is always a major liability.Anyway, that's my two (hundred) cents.",

Snowflake/Databricks mainly give you less platform wrangling in exchange for cost and lock-in.

This is why most teams cannot afford to maintain it. It's working because our team is very mature. I don't think you can expect it for a team that has been stable for less than 5 years and is still overloaded with requests and production issues.

Remote more accurately is rephrased as \"work from anywhere within the country you have working rights during specific hours which have been stipulated in a contract\".You also have the situation where if you work in the evening and there's nobody there with you, there's a strong possibility you're doing fuck all/maverick shit which is about to murder production tomorrow and there's nobody there to help.That being said, no harm in asking. You have to be okay with accepting this is really unlikely though.",

The entire company is remote.I can generally work \"U.S. business hours\" but might work East Coast hours one day and West Coast hours the next day depending on what works for my schedule. If I need to be gone for an hour in the middle of the day, I block it off on my calendar. If I need to go to a longer appointment, I'll book it either at the beginning or end of the day, block it off on my work calendar, then let people know in Slack the day before. If I need to flex more than two hours like that, I usually just take half a sick day--I think I get 9 sick days a year? \"Unlimited\" vacation days, though. The assumption is that sick days are short-notice while vacation days are approved in advance.I usually have two 1-hour meetings on Mondays, then no meetings the rest of the week; every 4-6 weeks, I have a 30-minute meeting with my manager. There is a monthly Engineering \"meeting\", but it's recorded, so you only need to join the Zoom if you feel like watching live or want to ask questions in the Q\\&A; the agenda is provided in advance. Everything else is asynchronous, including the daily standups, Product updates, etc., unless you want to ask someone questions \"live\" to debug a project you're working on. Then, a meeting is scheduled. \"Just hopping on a call\" isn't really a thing in my team, because if you need to ask detailed questions on how to do something, that means the documentation needs to be improved, which means someone needs to write more down for the next person. So again: the call should have an agenda prepared and sent in advance.I am on-call 24/7 a week at a time, every 6ish weeks. There are rarely pages outside of business hours, though. Only a few times per year.I would say all the flexibility on my team is because everyone is senior+, so no one really requires close \"supervision\" per se. We also have tight delivery deadlines, so regardless of schedule flexibility, you won't last long if you don't get your work done.",

How much data are you joining per row, as in what is the content of the columns you're joining (if this is big this also causes problems)? Are you increasing the number of rows with these joins? Also, what is actually failing when it does? Try to see what's going on using the Spark UI while it's running to see what's taking so long, or what's going wrong.I think repartitions and partitions will mess up your performance. Repartitions will be pointless because I think Spark will reshuffle with the next join anyway, and persists make it more difficult for Spark to optimize the entire plan and may take up space on memory / disk, which you may already be lacking.If column renaming seems to mess up your execution plan try to do all of the column remaining before the joins (so rename columns for each dataset first) and/or do all the renaming at the end. I don't see how your action plan would result in anything other than a bunch of BroadcastHashJoins with no shuffling in between this way, given all of the joins are joining small tables to a large table on the same unique ID.Also check how much memory each executor is using and how the data is distributed across your workers. If your data doesn't fit in your cluster's memory it will become very slow either way.All that said, if you're doing 27 joins on 820k rows with max 64 cores it might just take a long time either way.

Even if each side is small, Spark’s optimizer might not treat it that way. Tools like AQE exist to reshape joins dynamically, but in practice they are not always enough, especially if Spark does not recognize your joins as equi joins.What changed the game for us was three things combined:* Using explicit broadcast hints instead of letting Spark guess, for example `broadcast(df_small)` Forces a BroadcastHashJoin rather than a nested loop join.* Reducing the logical plan spike by collapsing intermediate transformations. This means fewer repeated `.withColumn()` calls.* Using DataFlint’s plan diff tooling to see where broadcast dropped out. That exposed the real culprit.You can tune memory, partitions, and caching, but none of that matters if the plan never selects an efficient join algorithm.",

A lot of the workarounds requires airflow or similar but that doesn't help us dbt cloud folk.Also, to be clear, parse is likely a misnomer here, dbt doesn't have to touch the db on a parse normally. Compile is what is probably eating OPs compute and time. Even then it's kinda crazy how much time it's taking for them. We have 5000+ models (with thousands of tests too) and it doesn't take that long for a full compile. Like 3-5 minutes. And that's including a lot of introspective adapter calls.I've also seen other folks manipulate the hash that dbt checks so it doesn't think it needs the full parse as an alternative workaround. It does need something like airflow to do it, given I'm on dbt cloud I can't.",

It spends more time shuffling the index tree than actually storing your data.Try using \"rewriteBatchedStatements=true\" in your JDBC Connection String and let us knw if it solves the performance issue.Also, if it is one time thing or full reload, you would be better off dropping the indexes, the non-primary ones at least, before you begin with the load/reload.Hope this helps.",

If you're doing everything incrementally there's little cost impact of that vs daily. But if you're doing a bit that's full refresh at the same time consider different frequencies based on day of week & hour of day. Ex: weekdays are every 15 minutes, but night & weekends are hourly. * Consider using aggregate tables for common dashboard pages. * Pay attention to database optimizations for files and tables.

I don't think this information is really a hard requirement for getting started though.Data engineering is just so incredibly broad. So much of your day to day job is dictated by what size company you end up applying at as well as the industry. For example, Kafka is a foundational piece of tech for a high percentage (forget the actual number) of fortune 500 companies. But it's also totally overkill for many smaller companies who may not need near-real-time analytics or near-real-time data processing.I'd say to become very comfortable with SQL (postgres and one data warehousing dialect such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery), Python, and dbt. While some may classify dbt as an \"Analytics Engineer\" tool, I think it's a great bridge between the worlds of data analyst and data engineering. Plus it's very common at companies of many different sizes.Then become comfortable with some form of orchestration tool such as Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, or some equivalent of those. For Airflow, there is a MWAA local runner docker image that might be useful for running a local version of Amazon's managed Airflow instance. Just search \"github MWAA local runner\" to find the repo which should have instructions. This is way easier and cheaper than running a real airflow instance.Maybe just read up on data ingestion tooling such as Airbyte, Fivetran, or Meltano, just to fill in that gap so you understand how transactional data gets loaded into a data warehouse (ELT is a good term to know/research).At that point, I'd say the knowledge you've acquired is transferrable to most tools that small to mid-sized companies would require (or at least desire) for an entry level data engineer position.Good luck!",

It sounds like you could use some re-structuring of your tables if I'm interpreting this quote correctly. You shouldn't need every single column of your table to know what to join on. How many columns do your tables have?>I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persistedThat's because that's not how that works. A count statement materializes your dataframe, but it doesn't magically make that dataframe available downstream. That's what caching is for. If you have `myDF.count` and then use do `myDF.join(other, ...)`, Spark will either re-calculate `myDF` entirely (which means your `.count` statement is actually making your code SLOWER by doubling the amount of processing you're doing), or it will intelligently cache the results on its own after seeing that the Dataframe is being re-used, in which case the `.count` still didn't do anything that a cache wouldn't do.TL;DR - don't use `.count` unless you're trying to get the count. Any other use of it is a hack that can be done better in different ways.>I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impactThis makes sense. With only 50-100 records, I guarantee that Spark is already broadcasting those anyway. None of your tables are large unless you have an enormous number of columns in your \"main\" table. 50k records isn't very much if you have your tables designed properly, which brings me back to my original question above.>Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without?Yes, you should always use good engineering practices and write clean code. Using functions and classes has no impact on the Spark query plan, but it does have an impact on your and your coworkers' sanity.>Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?Making your code maintainable and having a large query plan are separate issues that are only loosely related at best. Again, Spark doesn't care how your code is organized. Pulling code out into a function will not impact it at all.Use good software engineering practices to make your code maintainable. Use good data engineering practices to keep your spark plans efficient.Edit:After reading the post again, I have one more question>However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error.Are you doing something other than the joins? 6 joins isn't a lot and will absolutely not create a large query plan and also absolutely would not be the cause of an OOM error. Can you post a sample of what your code looks like? Because that really doesn't add up to me.",

Depending on what table i am joining i will also need to filter the main table. I do not bring in every single column from the small table but just just a few. I then repeat this 6 times. I then save the updated main table.The way i implement the join is to get all the keys from the small table, lets say key1,2,3. then iterate 3 times and get all the key1s from the small table and join it to the main table on the left. repeat this for all the keys. And rows in the left that havent been mapped will then have a new column written as flag and map this to Yes.The errors i get when writing it as a function / loop: The cluster runs out of memory (from my understanding of your point means my execution plan is too large)So for my side question the main point i should be focusing on is how to make sure my execution plan is optimal? is there a guide on this?Edit: just saw your edit regarding looking at the code:So first I get the keys from the mapping df:     valid_keys = (         mapping_df.groupBy(\"key\")         .count()         .select(\"key\")         .distinct()         .rdd.flatMap(lambda row: row) # we want to flatten to make a list         .collect()     ) I then loop to do the joins:     # Step 2: create a dictionary that only has the join keys that we need     filtered_dict = {k: v for k, v in join_keys.items() if k in valid_keys}     final_matched_df = None     current_df = main_df     for key_name, key_cols in filtered_dict.items():         # Drop output columns from current_df BEFORE the join to give us the filtered df without the output columns         for col_name in output_columns:             if col_name in current_df.columns:                 current_df = current_df.drop(col_name)         # Get the mapping key which is the key + the output columns on the key we are joining by         mapping_key = mapping_df.select(*key_cols,*output_columns).where(col(\"key\") == key_name) # return the rows where the keys match         # display(mapping_key) will do join on key 1 then get key 2 then key 3 etc         # We join the mapping key row on the key and get the mapping key which includes key + the output columns         joined_df = current_df.join(mapping_key, on=key_cols,how=\"left\")         # get DF which only has the matched rows         matched_df = joined_df.filter(col(\"key\").isNotNull())         # Accumulate the DF with the matched data         if final_matched_df is None:             final_matched_df = matched_df         else:             final_matched_df = final_matched_df.unionByName(matched_df)         # Get the unmatched rows for next iteration         current_df = joined_df.filter(col(\"key\").isNull())Then i create a flag if a join doesnt occur:     # create the flag     if missing_flag is not None:         final_matched_df = final_matched_df.unionByName(current_df).withColumn(             missing_flag,             when(col('key').isNull(), \"Y\").otherwise(\"N\"))So this code will be called 6x (one time for each small table)",

        "body": "Disclaimer: I work for LanceDB, and I wrote most of its catalog integrations. Someone saw this post and sent to me so here I am writing my first Reddit reply lolLance does support most of the catalog on the market, check out this page: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/) I guess I did a bad job marketing these features. I did publish a few blogs, but mostly under the context of integration with compute engines, like [https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/](https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/) and [https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/) . For all the supported catalogs, you can basically use Lance side by side with your Iceberg datasets.But I think you raised a great question - \"anyone actually cataloging their lance datasets? or is everyone just yolo-ing it\". I did these integrations because we do have real customers using them. But I do see a common trend that data engineers in enterprise corporations that have data lake, data warehouse or data lakehouse setups, and trying to integrate Lance for AI features tend to want catalog support. For the frontier labs AI engineers, they tend to just prefer having storage-only solution and yolo-ing it.To bridge that gap, I also did one catalog within Lance, the Directory Namespace: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/) . It is basically a catalog living in a directory, backed by a Lance table, so everything still stays purely in storage. It is also compatible with just a plain directory of Lance tables, which is typically how people start using lance format, when they do pip install lancedb and create a table. In general, most of the users I interact with treat embedding as a part of real data assets. You can definitely store multiple versions of embeddings generated by different models for different use cases or just compare their effectiveness and switch over time. That is actually one key use case for Lance, which is you start with a table with just a single column, maybe images or videos. You continue to do data evolution - add embedding columns, caption columns, feature columns over time, and they accumulate and become a very wide table. That becomes your entire multimodal data asset. Check out some case studies with for example Netflix [https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/](https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/), Runway: [https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/)",

So Microsoft release Data Factory 2.0It also really put my back up that they changed their ‘data engineer’ accreditation to a ‘fabric data engineer’ accreditation and changed all the content of the course/exam to be all about fabric.. who wants to hire an engineer who ONLY knows fabric?I can imagine Fabric being appealing to smaller companies who don’t have the resources of a whole department of Data Engineers, ML Engineers, Data Analysts, BI Devs etc They are the ones who will benefit from an easy to use ‘all in one’ solution.

There's a creative tension there that needs some judgement to negotiate, and sometimes, there'll be a shift or some contextual thing that changes that means suddenly it's time to tweak your implementation model again. You need some freedom to be able to do that - but it should be constrained - go too far off-piste and nobody will understand what you're up to.Back to the question, if you've got multiple dev streams working in the same area, it pays to have a canonical representation that they can all agree on (whether they're human or machine) to support data-sharing and integration later on - therefore, there has to be some design-first approach to data - at least at some level.If your approach to that is to all agree on some canonical higher-level model, then you can handle implementation-specific choices by always providing a well documented mapping from your system's model back to the canonical one and get the best of both worlds.",

I was once interviewed by a company that worked primarily with Excel and they'd asked me if I had experience with excel because they needed an excel guy who'd automate the excel routine and they called it a data analyst position but these types of companies never really understand that Excel is a spreadsheet not a database. So in your case, I wouldn't give up on being an analyst, I'd just try to find a job that has a different approach to what you are supposed to do. Otherwise DE will feel the same way in a company that doesn't understand the difference between a BI analyst, an ETL developer or a DE. So it ain't really about switching to another role, it is more about your current employee. And don't underestimate SQL. It is one of the most powerful tools there is in the data world. If you feel stuck with SQL, go and learn PL/SQL or any other procedural language, marvelous things can be done with it once mastered. Like the latest \"marvel\" for me was pg\\_clickhouse extension, you basically can query clickhouse from postgresql, build dashboards using just 1 connection. I am more of an Oracle guy myself, but postgresql and clickhouse or duckdb offer a new world of possibilities and it is all just SQL that you are feeling bored by =)",

Oven if you do the stuff with python. You will do the same things as with SQL.As an analyst your tools should be- power BI- microstrategy- Tableau- Qlick- SAS Vita workbench (visual analytics)They are all about the same thing. Visualize data.Create Heatmaps, graphs. Distribution layout.Add trend lines. That kind of stuff.Data engineering is really preparing the data, order it in a way that you can create the graphs. Workaround data bugs, remind source system to fix their data. Enable analysts and scientist.Your tools are concepts. Data Vault, Kimball Star models.You work on data bases like Oracle, postgres, terraria.Or Kafka, Apache iceberg or had up to name fancy approaches.Data science is ML, fancy mathematics to get some insights from existing data.Maybe ask some data science guy. I would say your tools is mathematics first. Haha.I would not pick the job by fancy names/ tools. What do you want to achieve? What motivated you?If you tell more I can maybe deep dive a bit, if you like ( except data science)",

Thanks for providing more insight.When I started consulting in data engineering I have been told everything lower 3 years consulting in data engineering consulting is junior grade.There has been some truth to it, because no one taught me what data engineering is about and I learned through experience and failure in different projects.i would not say this is necessary today, since the knowledge is better accessible. For example here in r/dataengineering are multiple experienced engineers that are willing to share their experience. And AI also gives nice ideas on how to tackle the challenges.My advice is do not focus on tooling as the primary goal..Look into data governance ( most boring data engineering topic IMHO, and I put it here because it is about metadata)Data quality ( that's always a thing, and IMHO the most interesting part)Data modeling strategy ( that is the most difficult part. ).All of these topics you can tap in today without changing jobs and they will accompany your DE career.If you see a job that features a tooling that interests you, go for it.there is nothing wrong in that. But see it more like a car acquisition you always wanted to drive.Also when applying to position try to highlight your core data engineering skills that you already have. I think that's a better thinking approach then do tool bingo. You might also discover more interesting jobs by doing so.I hope that advice helps you and provides some motivation to you.",

Goes back to mainframe batch processing. If your metadata drives what runs and when, this fits.\"Pipeline Metadata Store\" is more modern, emphasizes you're tracking pipeline state rather than just \"jobs.\" Works well if you're in a dbt/Airflow world.\"Orchestration Control Tables\" if you want to be explicit that this layer is decoupled from your actual data models.\"Run Manifest\" is borrowed from dbt. Better if your metadata is more about \"what happened\" (observability) vs \"what should happen\" (control).I'd skip anything with \"connector\" unless it's actually handling source system connections. That term is overloaded now, half the modern data stack thinks connector = Fivetran/Airbyte-style ingestion.Quick side note: if you're manually querying these tables at job start to figure out dependencies and last-run timestamps, might be worth checking if your orchestrator exposes that natively through its metadata DB or API. Saves you from maintaining two sources of truth for job state..and a huge future headache.What orchestrator are you on?",

The concerns are contradictory, if you know what I mean. I'm a DE and I don't think AI can take my job in the next 5 years. Nobody is gonna tell AI what the data looks like for security reason and also it's just spouting things based on probability not actual logic so the procesing logic and domain knowledge still need to be done by human. If anything, it might generate more demands to build data warehouse to train AI models, which are separate use case from the existing analytics and financial report use case. The real concern is the market downturn and if the AI bubble bursts, people might stop hiring altogether because they want to cut cost (which has nothing to do with AI as a technology but AI as a balance sheet problem). There's no way to bullet proof that future, other than a beefy saving just in case....",

But it's a way to get you practical experience on something end-to-end without being too high stakes.If you really want to practice before you join, build a DAG in Airflow just to understand how it works. Meta uses Data Swarm as an orchestrator which is most similar to Airflow, but they've abstracted so much as to make it trivial to create a new DAG. With Data Swarm you're not even really building a DAG, you're just building the config and the back end logic is doing most of the work for you. They also have a custom visualization software, so play around with the free version of Looker or Tableau. Most onboarding projects are going to be something like \"take this raw data, build a denormalized / aggregate table, build a dashboard on it\"If you can do those things, write good SQL, and write basic Python, you're already ready for the job.",

Two quick pushes though: I wouldn’t drop line items entirely (you’ll want them for margin/returns/cohort/LTV and subscription analysis), but you can keep them in a separate table/partition and only join when needed; and I’d strongly consider adding a lightweight transform layer (dbt or even scheduled SQL) so your “business tables” (orders, customers, subscriptions, spend) are stable and not raw connector schemas.For costs/lock-in: biggest surprise costs are usually (1) Looker exploring raw wide tables, (2) GA event data blowing up, and (3) Airbyte sync volume if you pull too much too often. oh yeah also get budgets/alerts in GCP day 1, partition/cluster core tables, and create curated views for Looker so analysts aren’t querying raw. Also, if you ever want less lock-in later, keeping transforms in dbt + storing raw exports (GCS) makes migrating much easier than relying on tool-specific modeling.",

Can get a bit pricey though. Landing the data into Google storage and then transform from there. I find a little bit of Python goes along way in the DIY DE space as well!",

So, you either will have a vendor lock or mixing different entities in one (like Hive Metastore + Hive SQL).Second option looks nice, for example, an OpenLineage standard can be used, but the existence of lineage in catalog will depend on query engine.If I would build a solution on open source technologies, I would prefer a second option. Something like DataHub that supports OpenLineage ingestion via REST API. But I would avoid heavily tighten \"all-in-one\" solutions and would keep lineage as an option.",

The Platform Approach (Unity Catalog) **-** I’ve used Unity Catalog extensively for this. It essentially forces the catalog and lineage to live together. Because the governance (permissions, access controls) creates the lineage automatically as jobs run, you don't have to \"maintain\" the lineage separately. The catalog is the map of the lineage. If you treat them as separate tools, you end up doing double the work to keep them in sync.2. The Open Source Route (OpenMetadata) **-** If you are looking outside of a specific vendor ecosystem, tools like OpenMetadata are tackling this exact \"all-in-one\" problem. They treat data assets, lineage, and quality checks as a single entity. It proves that the market prefers a unified view. Data engineers don't want to tab switch between a catalog to find a table and a lineage tool to see where it came from.3. The Shift to Orchestrators (Dagster) - The most interesting shift right now is actually happening in the orchestration layer. I’ve been using Dagster, and they handle this through “software-defined Assets.\" Instead of lineage being an afterthought or a documentation task, the lineage is defined by the code itself.* Assets **-** You define the data asset, and the lineage is inherent.* Asset Checks **-** You attach quality checks directly to those assets in the graph.So, to answer your question, Yes, a combined solution is useful. In fact, things are moving even further, merging Catalog + Lineage + Execution (Orchestration) into one view so that \"accountability\" isn't just a log you look at later, but part of the pipeline run itself.Hope this helps.",

When you have 100K+ datasets, this breaks governance completely. **Why integration matters more than people realize:** • **Metadata propagation** \\- tag one source table as PII, lineage cascades it downstream to 50 derived tables automatically. Manual tagging doesn't scale.  • **Impact analysis** \\- \"this pipeline failed, who owns the upstream data?\" If you're jumping between tools, you've already lost.  • **Trust flows backwards** \\- you can't assess data quality without tracing upstream. Separate systems = manual stitching every time. Most of the modern catalogs are moving to a model of \\- out-of-the-box connectors that \"pull\" lineage into the system from external systems \\- support reporting of lineage INTO the system via standard catalog-native API-s/agents/emitters or vendor-neutral protocols like OpenLineage **The caveat the other responses touched on:** some solutions like Dagster's \"software-defined assets\" are elegant but only work for what the orchestrator controls. Your data doesn't start in the warehouse: • Production systems feeding Kafka streams  • Real-time stream processing (Flink, Spark Streaming)  • Cross-cloud data movement that never touches your orchestrator  At my previous company, \\~40% of critical lineage came from **outside** the orchestration layer. You need a catalog that can **aggregate lineage from multiple systems** (streaming, production databases, warehouses), not just generate it from one orchestrator. **The test:** can you trace a BI dashboard → warehouse → dbt → Kafka → production database in one query? That's 5-6 systems owned by different teams. The catalog is your aggregation point. Best of luck with convincing your customers and the world!",

A couple became lite-DE who also do lots of DA work. Most went into BA and project management instead because there were more opportunities there and they dont have to do lots of self-learning. If you go that route (management or lite-DE), prepare to have very strong domain knowledge and stay within your industry even if you switch job. The pay isn't bad, and maybe even better if you're political and ambitious. There are heaps of companies who are still using legacy systems and still need DE who are really good at SQL. You do have to upskill and learn data modelling. You should volunteer for those sort of project in your current job to at least say you have experience with data modelling such as Kimball. There are lots of courses on data modelling you can take. Once you got your foot in the DE door doing SQL and data modelling, you should learn Python, infrastructure etc and become a more well-rounded DE. The job description for DE is constantly changing. It's getting more and more heavy on infrastructure and companies just expect you to be able to do anything. But always know your strong point. The expertise I'm still advertising for myself is data modelling, Databricks and the ability to step into Data Analyst role if needed (because I was one). You'll be competing with DE who used to be software engineer. They'll be much better than you at coding. There might be DEs who were SREs/DevOps and they'll be better than you at infrastructure. I also have another friend who isn't that technical but she became the data lead and earns way more than me. She has excellent leadership skill, communication skill and also very studious and has a millions certificates so she can participate in any technical conversation even though she doesn't write code that much. So work with your advantage and continuously learn to overcome your disadvantage, regardless which path you take.",

Snowpipes can be triggered when a new file appears. Airflow deposits the file in the DL.Then a staging area (schema) that links to the landing area and allows hashing to eliminate dupes. No transformations here. All columns varchar. A reject schema for data that cannot fit into bronze due to an error. Then Medallion architecture for schemas bronze, silver, gold. Bronze (column transformations to correct types) from the staging. Any data rows that do not conform go to reject schema. Also Bronze is a great place for SCD2 tables. Silver is new & inferred data that is valid but doesn’t exist in bronze. Like splitting customers by geographical zones based on their address. It can make sense for some silver tables to be SCD2, but that’s rare. For geolocation you go get another single source of truth, stage it and bronze it. Then the silver combines two different bronze tables. The silver geolocation could be scd2 for tracking the moves that PK did. And so on. To meet all Gold requirements, for dimensions and facts. Gold is dimensional tables that Kimball and Snowflake are famous for. DIM and FACT. Using Airflow for pushing the data in the Medallion layers is standard practice. To go from BigQuery directly to Snowflake FACT, this is called a Proof Of Concept. Nothing wrong with that. Suggestion, put it in a Dev environment and build a Prod environment. Dev & Prod (maybe UAT eventually) can simply be different database names, same Snowflake account, same Datalake account. You do NOT want the PowerBI people doing their own “fill in the blanks“ that’s how you get data silos. They Will Do This !!!For example (true life example) the PowerBI people will go get their own geolocation data from god knows where and make mistakes, so that Sales Dept will have X$ in one zone and Finance Dept will have Y$ in the same zone for the same time period, as each Dept will have a different PowerBI person. Data must be centralized. For SSoT to work, and in every data row identity the source system for each PK. Maybe as part of your naming convention for the column. Don’t be afraid of typing long column names. Use acronyms when it makes sense. If you haven’t already, take an online course on Medallion and Kimball architecture.",

The sane pattern is raw + PII stays in-region, and only aggregated/anonymous data can move cross-region (if allowed). Practically that means separate regional stacks (EU BigQuery dataset + EU Snowflake / or whatever) and your Airflow just orchestrates per-region configs. Start with 2 regions (EU + US), keep schemas identical, and create a “global” layer that’s aggregates only. Biggest footgun is mixing PII across borders and hoping to “fix later”, get the rule written down first, then architect.",

I had deployed my own project on AWS, set up a data pipeline and a basic streamlit front-end, spoke about docker, scheduled functions, the trade-off between different database options and why I made my decisions.My advice, unless you get a role as an apprentice where you're guaranteed a job afterwards, don't bother. Grad schemes say degree or equivalent experience a lot of the time, and jobs themselves definitely value experience more.Also, look up the apprenticeship providers in the uni league tables. If you were really serious, I'd recommend going to somewhere like Georgia Institute of Tech and paying out of pocket for a reputable course.",

If that’s the case, I’m increasingly recommending to materialise results NOT on the warehouse, but on an iceberg table, possibly with a REST catalog that allow for git-like management and branching (e.g. Nessie). This way, you remove versioning issues from the map (just use iceberg and catalog’s versioning features and best practices)For table data access, you can use the iceberg table as external table in your data warehouse (ok if you have infrequent access or if it’s ok to have a bit of latency) or load the latest version of data in bulk (replacing the existing table) on a single work table on the warehouse if you need high availability or low latency for reads through the warehouse That said, there are 100s of variants and approaches :) if you have some specific needs just drop some more info on your need and stack, I think a lot of people may be able to help",

I assume *you* guys care what version is in the wild, same as any need for source control. Depends what you're using, I guess. As u/chronic4you said, if you're using Delta Lake then versioning and metadata is part of it. I can't comment on Iceberg, we don't use it. We do use Delta Lake, and in my case, we wouldn't have differently-named versions knocking around in terms of production. They just get replaced. But we don't run parallel releases and stuff like that. For capturing version metadata in Delta Lake, you could use custom commit messages when altering/replacing tables. This is kind of something I've been thinking about a bit, too. The potential for drift between the DDL code that *is* source controlled and the object in the catalog that the DDL defines concerns me. I don't really have a solution.If you're using simple SQL tables for example, good luck to you. Times past I've had various permutations of \"x\\_dev\", \"x\\_revision\", \"x\\_update\", and even \"x\\_new\" sitting in the database alongside the proper table. Good times.",

If it comes up in interviews, a brief “I had a medical issue that’s now fully resolved and I’m excited to get back to work” is more than enough.Focus your applications on the solid 6 years of experience you have, and make sure your resume and profile highlight recent skills and achievements. You can also work on small projects or contribute to open source to show you’re still keeping your hands in, but honestly, a 9-month gap is very normal, especially after the last few years.If you haven’t already, reach out to your network and former colleagues—referrals can really speed things up. And don’t let self-doubt creep in; hiring managers care a lot more about your skills and fit than a short gap. Good luck!",

So I am not sure how this applies in your country.Make sure that in the interview you stay authentic. The coach said.Remember you sell work time. Your personality is the bonus.And before the job interview say to yourself that you can do it that you want to do this job.Sometimes it is not about you, why you did not get the job. You can only review the interview in your mind and think if you are unsatisfied with some answers.If you think you nailed it in the interview, then I would say you had bad luck.Hth",

        "body": "I think the limit is mostly hardware and cost, so as long as the cluster/warehouse can handle the IO and compute, 100 TB by itself isn’t a blocker.But the more interesting question is why you’d need liquid clustering on a 100 TB table in the first place.At that size, it often looks like a raw or near-raw table, and raw tables usually have predictable access patterns (time-range filters, append-only writes). In those cases, directory-level partitioning on a timestamp is usually sufficient and cheaper, because partition pruning is extremely effective and requires no ongoing reorganization.Liquid clustering starts to make sense at this scale when:* Queries frequently filter on high-cardinality keys (e.g. account\\_id) in addition to time.* The table isn’t strictly append-only (MERGE/UPSERT, late data, corrections).* Access patterns evolve and you don’t want to constantly redesign partitions.* You want to avoid over-partitioning while still getting good file-level pruning.So the question isn’t “can liquid clustering handle 100 TB?”, but rather whether the workload actually needs it. For a truly raw, time-sliced dataset, partitions alone are usually the right tool. Liquid clustering is more justified when the table behaves less like raw ingestion and more like a shared, multi-consumer analytical dataset where time alone isn’t selective enough.",

We had a bunch of automated processes scraping data from different sources feeding it into our CRM and then triggering marketing automations. Seemed straightforward enough but then we started seeing weird discrepancies in our reporting and it turned out one of the integrations was pulling in data fields from an older deprecated system that hadn't been properly sanitized. It wasn't a security breach per se but it was definitely a compliance nightmare waiting to happen. Trying to trace that data flow manually was a total disaster. It felt like we were untangling spaghetti and every time we pulled on one strand three more popped up. What really helped us was implementing a virtual data platform that basically acts like an AI data engineer. It was able to map all the data connections identify the data quality issues and flag those unexpected data flows between systems we didn't even realize were happening. Like it showed us this whole chain of dependencies that would have taken weeks for us to figure out on our own. The cool thing is that it didn't require us to move any data around. It just analyzed everything in place and gave us a clear picture of what was going on. Then we used the no-code tools it offered to build agents and workflows that enforced the correct data governance policies and automated the cleanup process. We even built alerts that would fire off if any of the agents tried to access data they weren't supposed to which gave us some peace of mind. Honestly before this our data team was spending all their time firefighting data quality issues and dealing with ad-hoc requests from sales and marketing. Now they're actually working on strategic projects that move the needle. The company that helped us out has a referral program and Id be happy to connect you. I get a little kickback if you become a customer so full disclosure there but it honestly solved a huge headache for us and it sounds like you're dealing with something similar. I can drop you a link if you're interested.",

This can be suprisingly difficult, both because there are many obscure setup challenges that can arise, and because it's kind of boring and frustrating to troubleshoot the part that doesn't give you any immediate results.4. Try basic examples. Use things you research, see if you can reapply them, get an understanding of how new things work.5. Apply them to your problem. In a bigger project, and if you have more experience, you will want to keep in mind maintainability to make changes to this easier. But it's still valuable to just take a crack at it. Maybe it works, maybe you'll run into a dead end and have to start over, this tiem with a better understanding of how to make things work better and be more maintainable.6.

If you're wanting to deploy something with Docker then pick something that can run in a Docker Container, figure out how to containerize it or if it's already done try to figure out what they did to get the project container ready, look into how the container is built, and then look at the steps needed to deploy the project somewhere. From there you can begin to find where your knowledge gaps are and then go search for appropriate documentation, videos, etc. as you go. If you're having attention span issues then try to train yourself to do a little at a time and then come back. (Or speak with some medical professionals about possible ways to help) I have used books, looking at open source code, videos when those came around, and talking with others to learn things. From there I try to build and stop to review materials and to brainstorm on how to get around blocks. You can use LLMs to help with learning as well, but you need a way to validate information coming from them as of now and you also need to learn how to not let it do all the work for you if your intention is to learn. If you're wanting to learn something try not to give up and keep at it. Good luck on your learning journeys.",

        "body": "There's just so much wrong in the OPs post. 1. You didn't go to a decent college. If you did, you'd be able to code. Your school sucked and completely let you down. I'm sure they still collected their crippling tuition, though, didn't they? That's not your fault. You're not in charge of the school. I'm an Engineering Manager and a self-taught coder, and it grinds my gears every single time I interview a new CS grad and find they can't code. I don't even know how many times I've seen it. 2. Your idea for learning to understand code completely is misguided. Your goal should be to build and deploy a working project. Something super simple. Do it in the next three days. Then immediately go to work on a slightly more complicated project, which you should also deploy within a few days. Then add a database and deploy that within a few days. Etc. Your big problem isn't that you don't understand everything about code, it's that you can't code on your own. There is a huge difference there. It isn't even the same topic. Keep learning but consider all lessons to be an expense you have to pay to build a project. All projects should be as inexpensive as possible. Learn the bare minimum to get building again. When you've built and deployed at least two non-trivial full-stack projects and you feel comfortable with a programming language, a full-stack framework, a database language, a testing framework, and a deployment strategy, then you can start researching better design patterns. Then build another project. I'm sorry to hear that your school let you down so completely. If there is a bright side, it is that all of us become self-taught eventually. Good luck with your studies.",

MOOC Helsinki is gold so definitely stick with that.Here is a solid progression path with the specific skills you need for each stage.**Beginner Skills*** **Core Logic** You need to master `if` `else` statements and loops like `for` and `while` to control the flow.* **Data Handling** Get comfortable with `int` `double` and `String` types and using the `Scanner` class to get input from the user.* **OOP Basics** For things like a Bank Simulator you specifically need to understand Classes Objects and Constructors. You also need to learn Encapsulation which just means using `private` variables and `public` getter and setter methods to protect your data.**Beginner Project Ideas*** **Number Guessing Game** This is a classic for a reason. It forces you to use random number generation loops and conditional logic to tell the user if they guessed too high or too low.* **Console Calculator** Build a calculator that runs in the terminal. It helps you practice breaking your code into separate methods for addition subtraction multiplication and division.* **Simple Quiz** Create a multiple choice quiz. You will need to use arrays to store the questions and answers and a loop to cycle through them while keeping score.**What you need** You really just need a good IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse and you should absolutely start using Git for version control right now. Good luck and keep putting in the work!",

A CLI tool that grows features, like persistence, undo, or import and export, will teach you more than jumping straight to flashy apps. As you move up, projects that involve failure handling, like a small server that must recover from bad input or partial crashes, force you to think like an engineer instead of a syntax user. Also, not using AI for a while is a good call, but do not confuse that with avoiding documentation or reading other people’s code. Learning how systems break and how you fix them is where the real growth happens.",

What matters is that you caught it early (3rd sem is still early).A big mistake people make right now is trying to pick a “future-proof domain” instead of building fundamentals + proof of work.Here’s a simpler way to think about it:Step 1: Stop trying to predict the job market.AI noise, saturation talk, etc. mostly affects people with shallow skills. Strong fundamentals age well.Step 2: Build a core base first (3–4 months):One programming language properly (Python / Java / JS — doesn’t matter much)Data structures & basic problem-solvingGit + basic LinuxThis alone puts you ahead of many students.Step 3: Use web dev as a vehicle, not a destination.Web dev isn’t bad — generic web dev is.Build 2–3 small but real projects:CRUD appAuth + databaseSimple APINot to become a “frontend dev”, but to learn how software actually works.Step 4: Let interest emerge from doing, not thinking.Most people don’t “discover” interests — they develop them after building something.After that, you can branch:Backend / systemsData / analyticsDevOps / infraApplied AI (later, not now)Important reality check:AI won’t replace developers who understand systems, trade-offs, and can build things end-to-end. It will replace people who only copy tutorials.Your goal for the next 6–9 months isn’t mastery.It’s momentum + consistency.Pick one path, commit for 90 days, reassess. That alone puts you ahead of most.",

I started with BASIC, PASCAL, C way before OOP became mainstream.In the beginning, I couldn't make heads nor tails of OOP and it took me quite long and many failed attempts.Maybe, moving on to Arduino with its C++ can help, or a complete, 100% cut to a different language, like Java with the MOOC [Java Programming](https://java-programming.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki might help. Another thing that might help is Python with its very easy to understand object model.OOP requires a different way of thinking - kind of a rewiring of the brain to look at things differently. In OOP it's more a dialog between the individual objects than the sequential command patterns we are used to in procedural programming. In OOP you more or less \"talk\" to the objects. You ask them to do things for you. You ask them to change their internal state if needed (yes, the \"immutability\" topic will now come up and I might anger a few people with my mutable approach).My breakthrough with OOP was when I got into my current job in Industrial Automation working with our DCS (Distributed Control System) and with our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems. There, everything was object oriented with inheritance and I started to see the advantages and how OOP works. Our SCADA even goes further in the direction of being an Entity-Component system where each Entity can have many components with many different aspects, but that leads too far (it's basically just some very extended form of composition, not inheritance).> it often takes me hours what my developer colleagues can do in minutes.This only boils down to practice, ample practice.You will feel stuck and dumbfounded for quite some time but you will eventually reach the point where things fall into place and you all of a sudden understand. It's not as complicated as it seems.Don't give up! Keep going!",

It's a natural instinct if you spend most of your time close to the machine itself, but it's actually disruptive to learning HLLs.HLLs are designed to be somewhat implementation-agnostic; they have rules, and they trust that some intermediary layer will implement a thing that makes those rules go. Getting bogged down in how that intermediary layer might work (\\*) generally will impede your understanding of the higher-level layer. This is a skill I had to learn when learning SML/NJ: the fine art of no longer worrying about how the language represents a function, trusting \"It just does,\" and learning the language independent of its implementation. The language is just rules and math; you could implement it with pencil and paper if you had the time and patience. Once you have the language under your belt, you can start caring about how it was implemented on a Von Neumann architecture with registers, RAM, and the like.(\\*) C++ might be an exception that proves this rule; there are actually quite a few features of C++ where the reason they work that way is \"It made it a lot easier to write the compiler\" or \"Look, this language is old, and older computers didn't have enough RAM to do things like lookahead compilation or multiple passes, so it is what it is.\"",

        "body": "So, I wrote [a few chapters on OOP in a free book](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/). I tried to think of the ways we incorrectly teach OOP (because that's the way we learned OOP.)I think the summary I can provide is:* A class is like a blank paper form template. You go to the doctor's office and fill out strings for your name, phone number, a list of allergies, etc. This form is a *class*; everyone fills out the same fields (i.e. the member variables) to represent a real-world thing. Each filled-out form is an *object*, a specific concrete thing.* I hate the isolated \"Car\" and \"Shape\" and \"Animal\" classes you always see in tutorials. What a \"Car\" class looks like in real code depends on what software you are making: a used car ecommerce site, a traffic simulator, a racing video game, etc. Meanwhile, the same real world person would be described by different classes: `Customer`, `Patient`, `Employee`, `WeddingGuest`, etc. Ask yourself how a paper form would describe the person in each of these roles and what fields it would need.* A common mistake is to write classes a certain way because we heard that they \"should\" be written that way. If you feel like classes and extensive hierarchies of classes are causing more bureaucracy than organization in your code, go without classes. (If you can; a complete rewrite has its own problems.)* For a second, forget about OOP: imagine you have **a bunch of functions and they all have the same data structure passed to them as an argument**: that's your class. That tells you what the member variables and methods should be. I have an example Python tic-tac-toe program done [with and without OOP in the book.](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/chapter15.html)* Inheritance is overrated.* For a moment, stop thinking of inheritance with genetic or grandparent-passing-away metaphors. Imagine you need a new class that is very similar to an existing one, but you just one to change one or two methods, so you copy-paste the code entirely and just change those methods. This is what inheritance does, but instead of copying-pasting code, you leave that out and make a subclass and then only specify the methods you change.Anyway, in general we explain OOP badly, and it is a bit (but not entirely) overrated. Don't feel bad for finding it confusing.",

The most close synonims for an *object* is: record, structure, set of variables, and now comes the difference: with the *methods* (functions, subroutines, procedures) operating on it.If you ever worked with files on Unix-like systems or Windows, you've already familiar with OOP. You create a File \"object\" by *open()* or *creat()*, which you can refer with the *file handle*, which these function returned. The variables of File is hidden for you, we have some idea how it looks, but we don't care as far we can call *read()*, *write()* methods to do what we want with the file, then we can *drop* or *destruct* it by calling *close()*.In OOP, instead of file handle, you got a pointer (sometimes called reference), and you can \"call\" methods. Now comes the part where you'll understand the whole shit:`read(file_object, &buffer, length)`is same as`file_object.read(&buffer, lenght)`In Python, you can call a method both way, although, highly recommended to use `obj.method()` variant.And again, as elctronics, programming is not *difficult*, but *simple and* *complex*. OOP is just as *difficult* like pull-up resistor: if you know struct, function, memory, OOP is easy-peasy, and if you know current, instable state, DCC and GND, pull-up resistor is straighfoward... but try these two simple things to explain someone who knows nothing about programming and electronics.",

The first thing I did was get assigned as an extra code reviewer for an MR that was written by a developer experienced in the language. I did my review first, and I had to spend time reading through his code, cross-referencing documentation for the libraries being used, and generally just building my understanding of the code. When the other code reviewers and testers also did their passes, I read their issues to see what I had missed. (Which is a good habit that I do for everything I review, not just this).After that, I did an MR of my own and had it reviewed by the person who had done the previous MR. There was still a ton of referencing documentation but I had a fairly good idea of what I needed to do.It gets substantially easier the more experience you have under your belt. I've coded in more than a dozen languages, so at this point picking up a new one is pretty simple as I already know how to \"think like a programmer\" which is the core skill that we need.",

Tutorials feel productive, but there’s nothing forcing your brain to retrieve or apply anything, so it fades fast.What usually works better is picking a very small goal and letting that goal pull the language in. Something concrete like parsing a file, building a tiny game, automating a task you already do, or reimplementing a simple tool you use. Then you learn just enough syntax to make the next thing work, look things up constantly, and accept that forgetting is part of the process. That cycle is what actually builds memory.Docs and references are great once you’re actively coding, because you approach them with a question instead of passively watching. If boredom is the problem, reduce scope, increase feedback, and write code every day even if it’s messy. Speed comes from doing, not from finding the perfect resource.",

Traditionally this training teaches auto mechanics, HVAC installers, even electronics technicians, but many training centers provide computer programming. My son actually took two years of programming in high school before going to college. As far as continuing education in programming, there are a couple avenues. First you can attend a community college for two years to get an associates degree in computer programming. That's not as expensive as a bachelors degree in Computer Science but it gets you half way there. Most universities will accept an associates degree as the first two years of a computer science curriculum. The advanced math comes into play if you want to get a bachelors in Computer Science. Most degree programs are either in an engineering school or a business school. Some colleges make you choose an area of concentration (mine was physics) Business curriculums do not usually require calculus while science and engineering tracks require calculus, differential equations and linear algebra. A Bachelors in computer science will serve you well and keep you employed, but an associates in computer programming will also help you get work.

The only things you really need to know are how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and maybe a little basic algebra. Many programmers go through their entire career with having to do barely any math at all.> Do note, however, that the answer is a bit different if you are interested in getting a degree in Computer Science. Many universities or colleges will have specific prerequisites you need to fulfill before you can either enter the major or graduate (calculus classes, etc). And, since Computer Science is, to a certain degree, applied mathematics, you will almost certainly end up learning about discrete math, writing proofs and other similar topics while earning your degree. You do not need to be inherently good at math in order to learn these topics (or any mathematical topic, really), but having some mathematical maturity certainly wouldn't hurt, and would probably smooth the learning process.",

It’s deeply integrated into engines, has way more learning resources for games specifically, faster iteration, and teaches fundamentals you’ll reuse everywhere. Yes, you’ll shoot yourself in the foot sometimes, but that’s part of understanding how things actually work under the hood.Rust is great, but the borrow checker adds cognitive load that’s not directly helping you learn game logic early on. It shines once you already understand memory and systems programming. For a beginner building terrain gen, gameplay systems, engine-level stuff, C++ will feel more straightforward and less “fighting the language.”Short version: start with C++ for game dev fundamentals, then Rust later if you want safety and modern design. You’re not wrong about either, but C++ is the smoother on-ramp for what you want right now",

It's syntax is newer, and the language itself is much newer, which introduces a plenty of benefits. Firstly, it doesn't have the burden of having as much layers of backwards compatibility - C++ is filled with legacy code, and deprecated methods. Rust, on the other hand, is much fresher in that sense.Okay, I realized I am probably going on a tangent, so here's the list of the stuff I love about Rust over C++:* Beautiful error messages* Immutability by default.* Less verbose syntax (try to read the c++ std library, you'll get what I mean)* **THE ABSOLUTE BEST** tooling - `cargo` is really just a life saver. Don't even get me started on installing dependencies.One notable flaw I can point out is the borrow checker, since it can be confusing and you have to sacrifice some convenience in order to keep the code safe (but at least Rust doesn't allow unsafe behavior unless you explicitly want it)",

I dont want to discourage the idea, but you should be advised that the comparative lack of tooling and ecosystem might overshadow the other benefits of Rustby contrast C++ is native to the unreal engine and already integrates beautifully with its visual scripting language, unreal blueprints.

However, as I've said many times to many people, programming is not about any particular language, it's about learning to think like a programmer. Methodical, structured, analytical thinking and problem solving skills. Those skills are universally applicable across all programming languages, and, frankly, throughout life as well.So you hone some skills and write a bunch of programs and learn how to program and think like a programmer.

Learning to code is a \\*\\*journey\\*\\*. But thankfully, there are loads of resources out there that can help you choose your path! So, it's okay if you're not totally committed to building a career, my advice would be to measure the amount of resource you devote until you know that.You can teach yourself to code without access to any paid content or courses. It's a long road, it takes a lot of dedication and frustration, and drive to go find the answers yourself. But I'm not sure there's ever been a skill so thoroughly documented online as software development. Software developers largely love to share what they've built, and the very fine details of how it works. Youtube is full of tutorials. There are plenty of websites that will explain different programming languages or tools to you. Github is a massive source of real code that drives real projects which you can read and download and involve yourself in the discussions of. If you're looking into a career, I recommend finding a university within your state with an accredited computer science program. The degree matters a lot when it comes to job prospects unfortunately. I also think it's a medium quick way to actually develop serious development skills. I know for me personally, I was on the self-taught path for many years and just very stuck. It was my degree program with the help of professors and peers that finally unlocked things for me and got me over the tough parts of learning development. You'll find no shortage of universities that offer remote degree programs in computer science as well. This is an expensive path, but its the most reliable path to a career.If you're not sure what you want yet, and you're just out to explore maybe try joining some community projects. Hackathons, game jams, competitions. Even if you don't feel like you're ready, just be honest about your level and express that you're there to learn and you're bound to find loads of people just like you who would be glad to learn along-side you. That's a great way to 'explore' and get a sense of what actual development is like even before you have the skills yourself. Even if it means you're joining a discord call just to watch and hear how more experienced developers are working it'll give you a sense of what its actually like once you're in the middle of things.I won't recommend any particular course or source of information personally. I've found that everyone seems to click with different materials.

Literally ask someone to input a number, input another number, and select an operation to perform, then return the result. Maybe do a slight expansion on it, like remembering the last result.Then iteratively add a little bit of complexity.2) a to-do list console app, that allows the user to write a to-do and saves it to a file so that the to-do exists on the next run. Also let the user mark off a to-do. Again, maybe extend it slightly, like allowing the user to view marked off to-dos.3) now maybe you want a simple console app that gets data from an API, instead of a saved file. There's APIs for everything, pick a free one that interests you (many people choose a weather API, for me, it was a football one, maybe you want a recipe one) and output some information in the terminal. This is also particularly good because you have to read the APIs documentation4) now you get to branch off what complexity you want to add. Maybe you want to figure out how to automate tasks. You could try and save data from the API above into a file at regular intervals. Maybe you want to add a graphical user interface, so you look up how to display the API data, which could mean in a web browser, or in a mobile app, or a desktop app, whatever interests you. Maybe you want to get data from multiple APIs and store it in a way that you can easily check what data you want, so you create a database that gets populated by various APIs.Start with the commonly suggested ones, expand on them slightly, iteratively add a little bit of complexity you haven't tackled before for every project.

These more easily let me test arbitrary sections of code by simply generating the appropriate structure for the test to consume, so my testing functions are just wrapping regular calls with a generated struct and comparing results.Take a few minutes to ask yourself \"how could I verify this works without having to run the whole program or use a test environment?\", it'll likely lead to developing better code.

Many tutorials make it really easy to work within a certain paradigm, but the paradigm falls apart as soon as you apply it to a real world example with real world requirements.> Is it just based on the number of years you work on building software or simply the environment where you can get feedback from top tier engineers?I've been mostly working on my own, even as a Junior and never had a Senior who would teach me good programming practices. For me it's been mostly about reflecting about my work, about **why** things become difficult and how I could avoid these traps. I started to watch many different talks from software conferences on youtube and while many of those talks are about fixing symptoms of problems instead of identifying problems, there are some that help you understand why you end up having certain problems. So you need both, a number of years of experience to reflect on, and actually reflect on the experience. Also, in any case: do not listen to people saying things like \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\". They likely have no idea what they are talking about and they don't know what that quote actually refers to. Usually these people think that they lose about 5-15% performance when they follow their programming paradigm and think that's an acceptable price, but they actually lose at least factor 30, in many cases even factor 1000 performance (Yes, things taking 2 seconds when they could be done in 0.002 seconds).A good way of structuring your code will also give you good performance as a free benefit.",

When complete compile those coordinates into HPGL language and feed that into an HP CNC machine. I wrote that in HP PASCAL in 1981. I had known the manager of the tool department through the church I went to and he had seen my work on the CPM machine that was donated to our church. I was doing work on the CPM machine for free because I wanted to create computer games on it and I had to promise to do something productive on it while I played games. I wrote a rolodex type program for church memberships in basic. Over the years I've worked with almost every programming language known to man. What made learning a different programming language easier was learning a different spoken language to train your brain to think in that spoken language. I speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, German enough to order in a restaurant, and some basic Mandarin. This helps train your brain to easily switch between different programming languages as well.

At the very utmost (and even that should be the ultima ratio) use it to give you explanations. Never use it to give you solutions nor code. AI is tempting. Still, it is far superior to pretend it doesn't even exist.Don't be afraid of making mistakes. We all do (even with decades of experience). Mistakes and failures are what teach us, from what we actually *learn*. You need to struggle to learn (and that's why I said to avoid AI - it will take the struggle away).",

You just start to get a feel for what good patterns are as well as what goes wrong when bad patterns are followed.But as for more concrete tips I'd say you want to keep your API /API layer as agnostic as possible from the implementation details - your API layer should ideally be focused on defining the contract and routing the logic to internal code to fulfill the contract. You don't want to expose internal details, raw primative implementations, or anything not relevant to the contract. This is both so external clients have a clean interface to work with as well as minimizing the blast radius of any changes to the workings of the API itself. Yeah you can implement a key value store with a dictionary but if you abstract it behind a data provider then your API layer doesn't care if you're using a dictionary or a database or a cache, and you can swap between them easily.In addition anything that's exposed to the public internet should have protection against anything that could possibly go wrong, malicious or otherwise. This includes sanitizing inputs, protection against injection attacks, rate limiting, proper status code handling etc...",

        "body": "That approach is pretty normal, and honestly how most people actually learn once they move past tutorials. You usually need just enough understanding to make progress, then you circle back and deepen fundamentals once you hit friction. Trying to master an entire stack up front often turns into endless prep with very little feedback.Surface level knowledge is fine as long as you are aware it is surface level and you know where the edges are. The risk is not shallow knowledge, it is hidden gaps that you do not realize are there. Projects are good at exposing those gaps naturally.Exploring multiple stacks can help you see which concepts are universal and which are just implementation details. Over time the fundamentals stick because you keep encountering them in different contexts. That usually beats trying to learn everything in isolation before you build anything real.",

You can’t learn “the whole thing” at all. You can only learn the parts you need. There’s many things I’ve used over 20 years and I still don’t know even nearly “the whole thing” because I’ve never needed all the things there is. As long as you know all the things you will need, and have understanding how they fit together then you can go piece by piece and learn those parts. It’s much easier and sticks much better when it’s “ok I need to do X so I’ll look that up and learn it and do it” rather than “oh yeah I looked it up a week ago, but now that I need it I don’t remember it anymore…”Also one tip: write down some things you feel are useful or important to remember from the start. Like “ok when I use this way to connect to database I need to set that up” and whatnot. It’ll be handy later when you jump between things and definitely will forget things.",

Most people don’t learn a whole stack end to end before building anything, they learn just enough to make progress, then deepen the parts that keep breaking or slowing them down. Surface knowledge is fine early as long as you circle back and firm up fundamentals once you hit friction.What usually bites people is not the breadth, it’s skipping the underlying concepts that repeat across stacks, like data flow, state, error handling, and tradeoffs. If you understand those, switching stacks becomes much easier and less scary. Think of projects as a way to expose gaps, not as proof you should already know everything.",

Part 1 would be a preparation for the exam done at home with whatever tools they want (ai, colleague,...) and they could take any code they would have done to part 2 (which was the actual part cut from Internet).The first part had exercises centered around getting every child from a node in a tree (and going deeper till getting the last).The first exercice from the second part was going up the tree till the first node was found and then, the exam was basically going down the tree either from top or from a specific node with the eventual join here and there on another table.All that to say : if you understood your code from the first part, second part should have been no problem at all. going up a tree being so close to going down but a lot less complicated to implement - It's a sole loop. And once done with going down and up, every other exercise could be done with some copy past from your own codeWhen the result was in, most of the student had the first part nailed in tight. But some would have no idea at all about what was what (one exercice asked to check the depth of the tree and one of the student thought that just taking the node.parentId was the answer. Not to throw shade at the guy (I'm pretty sure he's one of the smarter) but he clearly didn't understand the first part that was, most likely, generated (or copy pasted from a student. But since I checked every file before allowing them to bring them to part 2, I have some idea.)In essence, ai didn't write bad code. That's not the point.The point is, they used it in a way that didn't make them grow their understanding of what they were doing.That's the part I'm really critical when in comes to ai use in learning... But in general too. No matter if you're a junior or a senior. If you don't learn, you, at best, stay at your level.",

AI usually helps with automating repetitive stuff, but anything else than that is total unprofessionalism to me. Why did script kiddies became vibe coders? If you're not doing something unique then here's your problem on why AI is so useful to you. AI can literally identify problems in the world. Just look at the school system, it's trash & thats why AI is so useful there, because exams are the dumbest thing in the world. There's so much other useful use cases for AI, but coding is not the one, at least for me. It just struggles when you're an engineer in a very specific project or area, like embedded programming.If you aren't the one solving specific problems & showing and discussing them with your client and sharedholders & reiterating, you're probably doing something that shouldn't be in your role.There's also so much other examples on this, but I don't have time",

This time around getting back into programming I have a music library and none of the import tools did all the things I wanted so I started making individual tools to do the things in bash, upped my complexity switched over to python and now I have a full blown application that can match and tag from music brainz, manage rename and movement of meta data files, fix tags intuitively, convert file formats, manage album art and image tags, download lyrics make lyric files or tags test sync then downgrade to plain text on failure, and a ton of other things. Conquered 1 by 1, as my goals grew and complexity grew. My next goal is build a full Web UI for it so it's easier to do more with the application.

Some of it is solid foundational theory. The rest of it is the history of brilliant quirky, strange people thinking strange thoughts. They didn’t have any idea we profs would try to teach, and you students would try to learn this stuff. So take it with a grain of salt. I bit the bullet and got through it.So, young Padawan, take it with a grain of salt. Keep plugging away. Bite the bullet, dive into the cloud of unknowing. You will get it. Also, my life as a programmer has, since then, gone through lots of cycles of “WTF? This makes no sense at all” and then understanding. You would be wise to get used to your emotions when you dive into that cloud of unknowing. I’ve struggled with that all my working life. I think it’s part of the creative process of programming. I’m also a cyclist. This cloud of unknowing is like being halfway up the mountain and thinking f—-k this, I’m never going to make it. And then I make it to the summit and get to bomb downhill.

I know plenty of friends of mine who also didn't do too great in school for CS but they went on to have swe jobs at top companies. In school you don't really have a lot of time and you can't put in as much focus or effort into it as you would like. With work it's not like that; you have one thing to focus on, makes things a lot more manageable. At that point what really shines through is your persistence; persistence is the key thing in programming, at least in my eyes. I will say that it is hard to decide whether it's right for you or not. I guess the answer is, when you are doing it are you focused on it and are willing to sacrifice things for it? If yes, I think that's enough. Don't let school kill your confidence. If you are drawn to programming, that's a very good strength, you just need persistence, diligence, and curiosity to carry you further",

You should evaluate your life, what you can handle, and what you prefer. All advice will fall short and even you won't know whether staying/switching/dropping out was the best. If I had to make a similar decision now, I'd switch, but only because I lost much more time than I expected. The mental distress is really what you should sort out though. It doesn't necessarily go away if you quit your pursuit of programming, and may stay with you after you're done with education. Don't be afraid to consult a professional. Of course also don't fall for the endless therapy loop, but some people do benefit medical help (e.g me) without much side or long term effects.",

My point is university is trash. Sometimes they're phenomenal and the best places to learn on the planet but more often than not they are a waste of money. Id encourage you to find trust in yourself as you sound quite creative and intelligent from the bit I know of you. Ill also bet you just simply learn 100x better from practice and self directed discovery and curiosity than a broken theoretical course.",

Try analyzing something you care about (budgeting, fitness, etc.) Document your work — even simple visuals or insights go a long way. This will lead to something called “portfolio” like a folder of all your project work Analytics folks use Excel / Google Sheet, SQL, Python with pandas, R, Tableau/PowerBI If you want something practical and project-oriented that walks you through real exercises in data analytics, this book below is designed for beginners and emphasizes hands-on work over pure theory:AI-Powered Data Analysis for Beginnershttps://a.co/d/8v7IwjKThe book offers good ground in programming, math and stats, analytics mindsets and methodologies, using AI, with lots of examples. Many of the prompts that’s discussed are fully optimized to use lowest tokens. Full disclosure: I’m the author of the book I mentioned — sharing it because it’s designed for similar use casesNo pressure — you don’t need to buy it to start.

Here is where Joe badly misinterprets his own thought process: “Of course!” Joe thinks. “It’s all so simple now. The key to understanding monads is that they are Like Burritos. If only I had thought of this before!” The problem, of course, is that if Joe HAD thought of this before, it wouldn’t have helped: the week of struggling through details was a necessary and integral part of forming Joe’s Burrito intuition, not a sad consequence of his failure to hit upon the idea sooner.Learning is also a good mix of strategies that are entirely general to the human species across any domain, and tactics that will work for you specifically in some specific situation. If you find some great way for you to learn concept A, it doesn't necessarily mean that it'll work for some other learner, or that it'll work as well for concept B.What you're asking about is general enough that we can only give very general learning advice, like [Oláfur Waage's _Learning Rust the wrong way_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL9LANLg5EA) (more about learning in general with Rust as a specific example of something to learn).",

Gaining some foundational knowledge about how it works3. Applying that knowledge and thereby gaining a better understanding4. Encountering problems/new information5. Asking questions about the problem/information6. Repeating steps 3 through 5 foreverThe only thing that really ever changes, aside from the specific concept, is the complexity/breadth of it, and by complexity, I really just mean the amount of information. When something is more complex, it takes longer to make sense of the individual parts and make it all make sense together, and it makes it harder to know which questions to ask to gain clarification or find information that you're missing, but it's still the same process. If you're able to memorize the information and regurgitate it on command, but don't feel like you really understand what it means, then you've most likely been skipping over steps 3 and 5, meaning you're just encountering new information and trying to commit it to memory without *using* it.If you don't understand how something works, try to write something that uses it, and as you run into issues, start Googling away to find the information that you need. If you encounter more things you don't understand while Googling up info, follow up on that as well until you feel like you actually understand what's going on. Keep doing that until you can apply that concept/knowledge effectively and can reliably predict what's going to happen.",

BASIC is dead and has been for a long time. (Yes, I know about SmallBASIC and VB.NET, but they have nothing in common with the BASIC of old) Python does the job much better nowadays.

It's what they can do with the language, how they can analyze and break down problems and create step-by-step solutions for the individual sub-problems that then can be implemented in a programming language, that makes a good programmer.The people of old didn't have too many choices (I was there - learnt programming in the first half of the 1980s).

Great chips but all you easily had for programming was the built in BASIC. By the time I got to college, almost 10 years later the college was teaching with Modula 2 at the introductory level. Note the phrase \"teaching with\", if you are learning to program the language is really a tool to learn concepts. By the time one would finish the full program a student would have been exposed to at least 3 mandatory languages.People often ask why? The answer is pretty simple out in the real world you may end up working with a number of languages. The problem with BASIC is there is very little real world use of BASIC anymore, even gaming has gone to Lua for scripting.Now what do I suggest for beginners, that is easy C or C++ for the equivalent of the first 3-4 semesters of a Computer Science program. Why low level languages? This is again simple, you can be forced to building data structures at a low level. Personally I See languages like Python as damaging to the development of good programmers as it hands user modern concepts and unfortunately most programs designed around Python don't dive into how things work. The other reason is that properly done, by mandating the command line for the first few programs (2 semester equivalents) you also learn how compilers and linkers work, at the user level anyways. The command line is important because there are Python programmers out there that can't even create a directory at the command line. So I'm not a big fan of people learning programming with Python.However I really believe that most programmers need to learn Python at some point but properly educated that will be a piece of cake. The reality is Python has been relative simple for a scripting language. At some point a programmer will also have to learn the languages suitable for the platform at hand. The problem is platform languages are a moving target, you need a good understanding of the basics of computer science to adapt to what is new. Languages like RUST or Swift are literally works in progress, it is a continuous learning challenge to remain effective with these languages.",

Another approach might be to convert your xlsx file to a csv file, which is plain text. Then use a giant-file-capable text editor like notepad++ to break the csv file into more manageable chunks.

        "body": "The JVM's startup time is mainly just time taken to load the JVM itself and all of the parts of the Java standard library that are needed to run your code. You can't do much to speed this up aside from getting a faster computer, or choosing a non-JVM language. The reason it was faster the second time is probably just because the JVM's files were already in your operating system's disk cache and didn't need to be loaded from disk again.When people talk about the JVM \"warming up\", they're usually talking about something slightly different. The JVM starts out in a \"bytecode interpreter\" mode, and only switches to JIT compilation when it detects that a certain piece of code is heavily used. This warmup process actually *improves* startup time, because it can start running code right away instead of waiting for everything to be compiled to machine code.",

Like, if 1.5 seconds is too much then you either need to look at keeping the JVM warmed up and constantly \"running\" or look into a language that doesnt use a virtual machine. Most apps written in Java dont concern themselves with start up times. Web APIs, servers, things like that - who cares if it takes an extra second to start up? As long as it performs acceptable when the JVM is running, then it typically isn't something people concern themselves with. Is there a reason you need it to start faster?

This was for two main reasons, increased security because if someone where to break in, or coerce their way in somehow, they wouldn't have ddl access to the schema, at least, and two, to prevent ddl, and row,table locks from being created when the connected user (webserver, reporting system, etc ) can't change the table structure or update the database.You may want to take a look at what services your launching as well within said java program.

The reason this evolved is because when you do “new SomeClass()” within Java it’s very difficult to test it the class that contains it.Imagine you created a CreditCard service within your Controller, when you want to unit test the controller you want a FakeCredirCard service, but if you did “new” it’s very hard to swap it out.Spring lets you annotate both the real CreditCard service and the fake one, then you dynamically get the one that fits the scope (ex: test)",

C++23 IS THE latest standard - C++26 will go to final vote to ratify in March this year.C++11 is old and was incomplete even then. They missed shit like `std::make_unique` - which had to be added in C++14, the `chrono` didn't finish until C++17, which is when we also got `filesystem` and `variant`, and finally type punning was defined. We didn't get library support for type punning until C++20, which is when we also got the `ranges` library - a god damn revolution in implementing algorithms. C++23 gives us `#embeded` to bring us to parity with C, type-safe formatter strings, UTF-8 support, and more container types. Starting with C++11 also leaves almost all of `constexpr` on the table.1) Install the latest compiler package from your vendor of choice.2) Always direct it to use the latest ISO-strict standard it supports. The compiler will default to an earlier and non-standard tolerant mode. When C++26 is ratified, it'll be a following software update that suddenly you'll get the new features.3) Keep learning C++. We all learn variables, functions, loops, conditions, pointers, user defined types... You're still going to slog through all the basics. There's no point in limiting yourself to a specific standard in this journey. You'll arrive to the latest standard when you're ready for it and it's ready for you.4) It takes time for compiler vendors to catch up. Microsoft with MSVC is still scrambling to implement C++23 features. All the vendors are struggling with modules. Don't be surprised when stuff is missing. It's not actually a big deal. But keeping up with software updates means you get to capitalize on their latest additions day-of. C++26 also comes with some changes that are worth being there.5) Most teaching materials are going to teach you the same basics. For the most part, the rules of C++ have never changed since before the C++98 standard... Except when it does. And that's the thing about fixing on a specific standard - there are very standard version specific rules you don't want to get bogged down on. Template deduction, initializers, `auto`, constexpr, move semantics... A lot of that gets nuanced changes over versions, and there's always breaking changes between spec versions. I think it was C++14 that finally said you can't specialize standard library template functions, and fuck, I had a code base predicated on that.Ultimately, the differences between the specs MOSTLY won't really matter until you get through the introductory materials. C++26 does change that a little bit - because it's going to require catching the use of uninitialized variables, which was formerly undefined behavior. That's going to send ripples all the way back to the beginning of learning C++.",

The language is old and has lots of traps and strange quirks. Every solution has at least 3 different ways to write it and each C++ version makes them easier (usually) to write.

If you are learning on your own your goals should be to obtain the same level of understanding.Here is the thing, you don't know what languages will be in demand by the time you are good enough in any one language to even apply for a job. If you learn well you should be able to adapt to what ever language a project requires.Frankly I don't see C++ as a good language to develop apps in as it has been eclipsed by more modern languages. What it is though is a very good language to teach the principles of programming. So is it a decent place to start, yes with one qualification, the program you follow should have at its goal teaching you from the ground up. At some point while going through a decent program, you should start to invest time in learning another language and hopefully seeing how the technology transfers from one language to another. If you have the goal of a specific platform like MacOS then start to learn Swift. At some point you should also pick up Python, however if you do it right Python will be a no brainer. In fact you will have a better understanding of how Python works if you have followed a CS program and actually did some data structure development, memory management and the like in C++. You spend some time at that level and you instantly can grasp what is happening in almost any language.",

They do not analyze the whole picture but have a tunnel vision.So, having said that, go for programming if you want to do that. First, learn to make stuff without AI. Then, when you can already build stuff on your own, learn to use the AI (and also how to NOT use the AI). AI should not fill a gap of knowledge, for you, but it should just speed up these tasks that you would know how to do on your own as well. Like this you'll be able to assess the output that AI gives.

Sure, it can be helpful to learn client and server languages, but you don't have to and it only adds time to your learning, which isn't ideal if you're self-taught. Best thing IMO is get a job, then learn what they want you to learn.",

Use Backend-as-a-Service:* **Firebase** \\- Auth, database, storage, hosting. Free tier is generous. Perfect for solo devs.* **Supabase** \\- Open source Firebase alternative, uses PostgreSQLThis lets you focus on the app, not server maintenance.**When you need a real backend later:*** Node.js + Express (JavaScript, easy transition)* Python + FastAPI (clean, simple)* Basic REST API concepts* PostgreSQL or MongoDB**The practical path:**1. Learn Flutter basics (2-3 weeks)2. Build a simple app with local storage (todo app, notes app)3. Add Firebase for auth + database4. **Publish it** \\- even if it's simple5. Learn backend properly for your second or third app**Skills that matter more than people think:*** Git (version control)* App Store / Play Store publishing process (it's annoying, learn it early)* Basic UI/UX senseDon't overthink it.

When your main function calls Pat\\_Divide with an array of exactly 1 element, you should be able to see that the `if` statement is true and then Pat\\_Divide immediately returns with only that one element.When your main function calls Pat\\_Divide with an array of exactly 3 elements, more imaginary people get involved:* Pat\\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\\_Divide and the other list to Alice\\_Divide.* Bob\\_Divide gets one element, immediately sees that the `if` statement is true, and immediately hands back that one element.* Alice\\_Divide, on the other hand, gets handed a list of 2 elements, and so is unfairly forced to do more work. * Alice\\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists (of 1 element each) and hands those lists off to Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide. * Mildred and Leroy act just like Pad\\_Divide did when Pat\\_Divide was given a list of 1 element, and each immediately hand back that 1 element. * Alice\\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) produces a sorted list of 2 elements. * Alice\\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\\_Divide.* Then Pat\\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)* Finally, Pat\\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.When your main() function calls Pat\\_Divide with a very long array, even more imaginary people get involved, but we don't really need to know all their names:* Pat\\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\\_Divide and the other list to Alice\\_Divide.* Bob\\_Divide returns a sorted list of all the items in the left list (by involving other yet-unnamed family members).* Alice\\_Divide does something similar to what she did before: * Alice\\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists and hands those lists off to Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide. * Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide divide their individual lists into even smaller pieces, and hand them off to other family members, who eventually help them produce sorted versions of those lists. * Alice\\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) combines the 2 sorted lists into a single sorted list. * Alice\\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\\_Divide.* Then Pat\\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)* Finally, Pat\\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.(Optionally, you may later learn multitaking techniques, so that Mildred, Bob's side of the family, and Leroy can each work on different parts of the problem simultaneously. ).Good luck trying to explain recursion to the next person!",

Take a selection of playing cards, and put on the table in front of you, make sure they aren't sorted, but still layed out in a nice uniform \"array\".2. Then split the array in two halves - moving them a bit towards you (down the table)3. Split the two halves in another two halves each, so you have four groups of playing cards, and move them a bit further down.4. Continue until you have a number of individual cards layed out with space between them - it still looks exactly like the original array, and feels a bit silly at this point.5. But now, merge the two cards to the left, in order from lowest to highest, and move them a bit up the table - do the same for all the rest, so you have a collection of groups of two cards, each group sorted.6. Then merge the groups two and two, moving them a bit up the table, so you end up with a collection of groups of four cards, all sorted.7. And continue doing that, until you have only a single list of cards, all sorted ...It is important that you actually do it, and not just try to imagine it in your mind!Every time you move down the table, it is another call to the \"divide\" function, and every time you move up, it is a return from the latest \"divide\" function. Note how you can't return from a divide function, before you returned from the next divide-function that was called! This is what recursion is all about, and it is mindboggling to think about - but it works :)",

Typically, this requires a higher level of skill than C#, when it comes to the nitty-gritty of programming. However, working on middle-ware also means that you don't get to make any consumer-facing applications, and hence, that could be very dry in comparison. Unless you're in the gaming industry, where C++ is huge.Of course, all this is a very over-simplified generalization. C++ can do most things C# can as well, and the situation really depends on the company you work for.On the other hand, C# is more general-use, just like Java.What's clear is that, in developer surveys over the past 20 years, C# consistently ranks as one of the most satisfying languages to use, while C++ usually has a poor reputation (it even has an unofficial mascot of a diseased rat with its leg blown off). That means C# tends to be more enjoyable to work with day to day.edit: gaming use case for C++",

The contributions will still even show on your profile if that is something you are concerned about. Not pushing because you are worried an employer will see a junk project?

You debug and realize you are accidentally counting down when you thought you were counting up because some variable was accidentally negative becauses you had two values swapped around.There isn't a whole lot of magic or complexity to debuggers. They just let you freeze-frame and walk through your code step by step. But that's an incredibly usesful ability.(Some debuggers also let you change values on the fly, but this is rarely all that useful, since you'd likely need to make that change many times and you'd be better off making a temporary code change for that instead.)",

It's a concept of how to handle data at runtime by creating objects and then performing actions on those objects.A method or function are the actions that you can use on those objects.A class is a description of an object, at runtime a constructor creates that object in memory, and the instance is the runtime object that was created by the constructor.You need to think in two ways - the code as a dry written thing, and then the multiple real things created when you run that code.Like the Cake class.At runtime you pass in (as arguments) butter, flour, sugar, eggs, vanilla flavour to the Constructor, which then makes an instance of a cake - say a plainSpongeCake.You then call the methods or functions of that Cake class.So you call addIcing(), add sprinkles(), etc.For your next cake, you instantiate the same class but this time you add in chocolate instead of vanilla and then call the same methods. Voilà, you now have a richChocolateCake too.You can now call the cutSlice() method, and that works on both cakes.That's pretty much OOP in a nutshell.You could make an interface class and have the cake class call that. You just put the addIcing() etc method signatures in that class, as you only really use them to guarantee that particular methods will be available in your cake class.Lots of languages use the principles of OOP so it's very much worth learning!Once you've mastered OOP and are getting to grips with Java, then you can start looking at using patterns in the code such as MVC and Singleton.Good luck! Stick with it!",

Or I'd have an idea for something, and I'd follow different tutorials for each part of it (e.g. one tutorial on how to connect to an API, another tutorial on how to save data in a db, then put the pieces together to build a scraper). Now that I'm much more experienced... I do exactly the same thing. I built a tool recently for orchestrating restic backups in kubernetes using CRDs and it was the same process. Follow a tutorial to read/write kubernetes objects from python, follow a tutorial on installing CRDs in a cluster, etc.. put the pieces together and go. The only difference I suppose is more often than not the \"tutorials\" I'm following are docs pages instead of explicit tutorials, or sometimes a short \"how to\" from an LLM. The content is the same though: read how to do x, and apply it to y.",

So that the input can't change logic in the middle of your frame on a when it's not desired, but how that will work depends on how threading / input is handled in your environment.Most game engines will use a singleton here, which is probably a good tell to use one. And in some you will get the whole state first from a singleton and work on that in the frame, and in some actions are taken directly from the singleton.For example:KeyboardState keyState = Keyboard.getState();keyState.KeyW == true---Input.is_key_pressed(KEY_W)And all the state problems are handled under the hood.---And just injecting input state directly as an argument to the frame if you decide to not use any singletons or globals.",

Most \"wrong\" decisions cost way less time than endless deliberation.**My take on your specific case:**Singleton for input is fine for a hobby engine. Big engines avoid it for testability and flexibility, but you're not building Unreal.

If you learn somethings, that's great, but they're not there to teach, there're there for views/clicks/baiting, playing on insecurities and crank out unrelated videos instead of structured topics (except for free code camp, they tend to be more long-format structured videos, at least on languages).As for the logic stuff, you could try review math and other \"logic\" thinking topics.And art to learn to think more abstractly.",

Couldn't find a way to implement my chosen approach. I tried a couple days, but then left the exercise and kept revisiting it regularly.

Use git. Gonna write your million dollars app tonight? Use git. Hell, are you Uni and taking classes? Use Git. This may shock the non devs incthe room, but git doesnt just work for code, nodes you write in a text file can be habdled the same way. New devs hate git, but eventually you'll have used it so much if yiu use it all the time that that feeling would be like an artist wqtching new artists hate using a pencile. Dont take any shortcuts because its annoying, itll become second nature if you use it every single day, touch typing and keeping your fingers on the home row was probably annoying when you learned how to type, now you dont even think about it, and people who type with their pointer fingers look crazy to you simply because you have built the muscle memory needed to use a skill that makes you better at typing without even trying. Git isnt gonna get in your way at all once its second nature, and if you dont use it youre just hurting yourself. But just like how you can learn to type by playing games online, you can passively get better at git by using it when you decide to learn Rust or build a game or write a novel. Dont think of it as some big deal that you need to treat as its own lesson plan and practice over and over again, think of it as salt you add to every meal from now on",

For example, if you want to be a service tech who visits customer sites and fixes broken stuff, you won't need to know much coding.Similar for technical writing or operations staff, a but less so if you want to be a tester as being able to use (and program automated testing tools is a useful skill - as opposed to simply recording scripts).On the other hand, if you plan to develop systems or do analyticial work, in which field?As for learning as others have said, pick a language, go through the tutorials and practice the exercises. Don't use AI to do the work for you as you won't be learning very much, if anything.The only thing I would add is pick a field of interest first, then identify the main tools (/programming languages) used in that field and pick from that list - as opposed to choosing randomly.",

As you've discovered, checking pixel-level collisions like this is a bit performance intensive.Most games don't check collisions this way. Instead, like \"You can't move through walls\" or \"If an enemy touches you, you die\" are determined by representing both the character and the object as simple shapes. Boxes and circles are the most popular (often the sides of the box are parallel to the coordinate axes which makes the math super simple). A \"capsule\" shape is also quite easy (it's just the union of a box and two circles). Triangles involve more math to program, but may be helpful if you want arbitrary rotation or more complicated shapes (any shape is approximately a polygon; any polygon can be broken into triangles).Often the hitbox really is, quite literally, a box!",

        "body": "First off coding is work, it doesn't produce adrenaline but rather headaches, drowsiness and fatigue. Lets not 3 Mile Island the world here, C or Python, should not cause somebody to feel slow and dumb. So the first thing that comes to mind right now is to choose one, which if you are learning is C.Not to date myself but I first got interested in computers before the S100 bus debuted, so maybe 13 or 14 at the time. For years all I could do is read Byte and when I could find it Dr.Dobbs. It wasn't until the Vic-20 came out, 1980, that I could actually afford a computer and that ViC 20 was barely usable. So for a good number of years my interests where satisfied by reading what I could.It actually took me a while to get to college and that was where my first formal training started and unlearning the VIC 20. At the time the school had Sun workstations so that was like a step into the future. So what motivated me, well the place I was working for was paying the bill. Since I didn't want to go hungry anymore it was a good idea to keep working. Now that said not a programmer per say but use the knowledge almost everyday before working. So staying sharp with software was important. However that required me to keep writing code, sometimes toy programs and in a couple of cases finding bugs for an Open Source project. At work I had some focus on CNC and PLC controllers which is always a challenge, beyond spread sheets and Python code. So even if work was NOT as a programmer, I was heavily involved in automation.Now that I'm retired the motivations are different. For example to keep track of my investments, I have spread sheets of stock portfolios. Now on the surface one might laugh at spreadsheet programming because it looks to be simple but I'd have to say there is as much depth there as their is with Python. The motivation is that I need to keep this organized and understand where my next meal is coming from.If you want to stay sharp though, who doesn't and frankly at this age you work at it, yo need to do more than stock portfolio management. To that end I keep a couple of hobbies going and use those interest to drive software development there. This is the key, use it or loose it. If you want to have any usable skill at all with respect to software you need to stay in the game. Motivation is sometimes hard to come by or even keep, so you really need to integrate programming into projects that you are interested in. Programming itself can also be a motivator, simply learning about new languages can motivate some. I didn't even know that C3 existed until yesterday for example and it actually looks interesting. For most of us though we need that outside pull to start a new project.Lets say you are into bicycling and those little trip computers look to be so handy. That lust could be the motivator for a DIY trip computer for a bicycle. Going DIY means it can work exactly as you expect, in every way it is yours. The challenges are the motivator. What are those challenges (just a few):1. Embedded project.2. Battery operated (maybe solar) and thus needs to be efficient3. Small custom Printed Circuit board.4. Limited screen size and I'o possibilities.5. Case size limitations.6. Limited program and data space.7. Limited programming languages due to microprocessor.In any event the project becomes the challenge.",

It’s truly just me putting this weird pressure on myself.I find myself thinking1. I want to prove I am valuable and up skill wherever and however (and do it fast)2. I bet Dan could solve this in 2 seconds.And it’s never helpful to waste my energy because I always get my work done. I have become very resourceful and still ask for lots of help. This has given me the opportunity to work with lots of experienced devs. I still feel very junior and feel slow but at this point it is also the pace that everyone expects from me.Unless someone says you need to move quicker, try and take it easy on yourself which is way easier said than done.

Working on something your interested in can really help with that. So work on projects your interested in and use those to drive your exploration. For instance at one point I found out that JWST raw observations are available online. I feel like it would be such a cool project to try to convert the raw sensor data into a viewable image. I am not sure how difficult this would be or how interested you are in JWST but that could be a fun project. I am sure you can find some science data your interested in to do projects with.

One company we worked with had a NSFW mode on their site, so I usually worked with that toggled on whenever it was possible. Otherwise, browser extensions can also be useful to blur/black out images as-needed, and on staging sites where we did a lot of our dev work we wouldn't test with actual NSFW content, and instead use whatever bland imagery/videos we had on-hand. This actually works out better in most cases; If you're troubleshooting compression issues on UGC, it can be handy to test with specific images/videos so you can see differences in compression in a more controlled format.Now, when troubleshooting production problems? Yeah, sometimes you can't avoid seeing some.. Stuff, and even if whatever it is \\_is\\_ your kink, you're there to work, not jack off (especially if it's a production issue that's costing the business money).Given I primarily do front-end work, the hardest part for me can be focusing on the issues no matter what is being displayed front-end center.. Which has included some \\_disturbing\\_ (but perfectly legal - just things I am \\_not\\_ into) shit at times. Those are worse than the things I might enjoy were I off work; That's where having means to disable imagery is absolute crucial whenever possible.",

We had to dig deep into how to prevent the presence of these bots and taking down their posts and deleting everything in short notice before they'd shut down the whole forum. Unfortunately vBulletin didn't have many tools at the time to recognize these posts like modern online community sites do, so we had to implement this from scratch (with the help of a group of students from a local university one of the cofounders of the forum was tutoring their thesis)",

I don't even know that many engineers in total. >I ended up telling myself to just wing it and that this would be my last attempt at the field.I don't even understand what this is supposed to mean without context lol. 7 years is a good long run at any company regardless of the circumstances around how it ends. If you're still young, unless it was a truly standout employer, you probably should have been working on jumping soon anyway. My only concern would be unemployment pay if you even qualify for it and the logistics of transferring things like 401k funds without an HR department. The entire last paragraph is the story of like half the people here lmao. Not that many people choose a major or career because they're super passionate about it - no one dreams of becoming an accountant or an underwriter fam. I feel like CS is somewhat prone to being romanticized like that because it has an unusual element of art/creativity to it - of course there's tons of child coding prodigies who go on to become 10x developers for the hell of it, but it's not the norm. What do you mean accept your fate man, it's just a job! You're not dying. Go find another one (I get it, the market sucks right now). But it's delusional to think that other fields are so safe and glamorous. Even if we're not in the golden age of the 2010s and things can get worse, our payscale is typically still significantly above average by every metric. I have to ask though, if you were so miserable, what have you been doing for this long instead of working on leaving or working towards something better? That's a real question, not being a dick. I get it, I'm about to hit 6 years too with a vaguely similar story and sometimes feel dumb compared to friends in this field. My growth has slowed a bit because I've been exhausted by pouring most of my energy in the last 4 years into a rather toxic and draining relationship, life happens.

I'll bet that the majority of folks today who consider themselves software engineers have never had to use pointers in a professional capacity. Are they still used? Of course. However, for the majority of coding tasks that ask the programming has been abstracted away. Back in the late '70s)early '80s my uncle was an engineer for Bell labs. He wrote a lot of the code that was used for midsize long distance carriers. From what I understand, a bunch of that was done in assembly. Probably 99% of developers today have never used assembly in a production environment. There will always be a need for low-level skills, but the percentage of people who need them will shrink and the number of skills that will eventually be considered low level will expand.",

The problem is autonomy vs responsibilities. The more responsibilities the less autonomy we have, and by extent the more we have to sacrifice to meet those responsibilities.

I hang around here keeping an eye on things to see if the market ever heals, to see if I should try looking again, while I make ends meet doing unrelated work.That said:Your university degree is a long-term improvement. You keeping this job another week, another month, another year is a short-term improvement. And even if you don't sleep for the next month trying to \"catch up\" (at reduced effectiveness, because there are only so many hours in a day your brain can be 'learning' before it gets too tired to effectively learn), you could lose your job because the company goes under, or because someone just gets it into their head that you shouldn't be there, etc. The job is uncertain. Your university is certain. The university isn't going to fire you. You've learned a lot. They screwed up by hiring someone who didn't have enough time in the day to juggle two jobs (your university work is a second job). Consider looking back at your time at this job as an \"extended interview\" where it turns out that you and the company are not the right fit for each other *right now*, and it might be best if you move on. End things on a positive note with them, so they can say that you worked hard.I hope that you've been clear from the start that you're in school and still learning, and that you would give juggling two jobs as good a try as you could. Tell them that this is simply a matter of not having enough hours in the day (due to university) to 'catch up' at the rate they need, and you're getting out of the way so they can find a person with time/experience to do what they need. But keep in mind that I literally couldn't even get interviews. So maybe all my advice is bad.",

If you were a bit older/had a family then I would say SF/Bay Area.I will say that in terms of nature and outdoor sports, the west coast is hard to beat.

I got my second internship by winning a hackathon and talking to the sponsor of the prize I won.I got my first job by posting my app on LinkedIn and getting featured by 9to5Mac.Advice: Unfortunately, you are behind the curve. Not entirely your fault, the economy is rough, don’t beat yourself up about it.

The trick with personal projects is to make them using relevent skills e.g. study the job descriptions youre looking to apply to and decide which frameworks/libraries/languages to use based off what theyre looking for, and make sure to put those keywords in the bullet points for those projects. Hot take but it matters less what the project actually is meant to do rather than what you used to build it—as long as its at least a little interesting and not super generic (weather app, todo app, etc) , your idea is fine. This will increase your chances of getting interviews.When it comes to interviewing, its a separate skill, I dont think having internship/work experience necessarily helps with interviewing skills. Technical Interviews are either leetcode style (practice by doing leetcode), conceptual questions (easy to prep for via google/chatgpt or through your school notes), or system design (not usually asked for new grads, but I had one for the offer I landed and I genuinely think my experience working on personal projects are what made me not completely bomb it, and I highly doubt interns are learning system design skills well if at all).For behavioral interviews, when they ask about working on a team you can just talk about group projects you did at school. The literal thing/impact that the project did is irrelevant outside of giving context for a story. Passing behavioral interviews are all about framing yourself as a good teammate that the interviewer would enjoy working with.",

If you report this to his next level or HR, he will get fired. So this can mean one of the following: 1. If you are a good performer, and expecting a salary raise, your manager want to give you that raise, but he feels unable to negotiate with upper management, so he is nudging you to get an offer and then use that as a leverage for your own sake. 2. Your manager has insights into upcoming downsizing and he is okay if you go. He is pretending to \"match\" your offer but giving you a chance to secure a good position. 3. Your manager for some dark reason is working against the interest of the company. He is either disgruntled. 4. Perhaps he is really concerned for his future, and sees that you have become relaxed at work place and not growing your skills, so this is his clever way of making you realise that you are still not good enough as an all rounded engineer. 5. Perhaps he is really concerned about your future, and general nature of the industry and the need to be in the habit of interviewing. 6. Your manager is just plain stupid and doesn't know how to do his job properly. I think it is a combination of 1 and 6. However there are better ways to do his job than nudging an employee to get an offer so that he can give you a raise.",

Know that it's not too late. A lot of people are JUST getting back from holiday vacation now. Now's actually a GOOD time to apply for jobs. Let's look at what you DO have! You'll have your degree, you'll have your medical data internship, you'll have some decent project experience, and your AWS certification. That's more than most people. Everything will be okay. Keep it up with the applications. Remember to apply to any and every company you can think of. Apply to med companies, tech companies, space companies, banks, insurance companies, the power company, your local city if they hire developers (many do for things like the city websites and sometimes for infrastructure).

These guys just end up working illegally (and risk being deported, rightfully so) or paying consultancies to get minimum wage jobs to pay off their loans. 25 of the remaining 50 will end up coming back, 10 more will come back as their h1b won’t get picked, and maybe 10-15 people will be able to stay, pay off their loans and make a career there. Maybe 1-2 will get a green card before they’re 50 if they’re exceptional. AI has made these margins just smaller. Fewer jobs, lower pay, especially at the entry level. Once your foot is in the door- you’re a lot better off. Any experience in India does not matter.

While I was employed, I was not making Bay Area level money to survive long term. The biggest downside was that I had to pay all relocation costs myself. And obviously a huge risk if a job never came to fruition. The neutral, moving here didn't suddenly bring in a bunch more opportunities. It wasn't like I had a bunch of recruiters suddenly knocking on my doors once I put Bay Area in my location. I was still cold applying and everything like that. The biggest upside came once I passed the interview and moved on to team matching. At the time, I was reading a bunch of discussion boards where people were sitting in team matching for upwards of 8 months. Some people even needing to reapply because their time expired before getting a match. I had my first call with a hiring manager 3 days after being told I passed the interview. And the two days in between were the weekend. I had a job offer in hand by the end of that day. I have zero doubts in my mind they pulled my resume first, because I was already in the area and can start working more quickly for them. Truly, I also think being an American citizen helped in that too, because it again meant quicker to writing code for them. They didn't need to do any Visa sponsorship or anything like that.",

Not UML diagrams or factory patterns. I work at Prepfully and from what our ML coaches tell me, companies like Meta and Google focus heavily on ML system design (think designing a recommendation system end-to-end) rather than traditional software patterns.Leetcode is still important though, especially for the coding rounds.Your time is better spent on ML-specific design (feature stores, training pipelines, A/B testing frameworks) and leetcode.

Doesn't need to be a GoF, but extensible, maintainable code doesn't just organically come about from a language's built-in features. Over the last 10 years, I've worked with multiple codebases (at FAANG and out) that were really poor at extending to new use cases. Each of the teams had this code-level blind spot: they had business requirements, they had system-level designs, but at the code-level, it was coder's choice on structure and pattern.",

Some people say that having a conversation about the weather or your favorite soda or how Metroid Prime 4 is kind of cheeks is superficial, but what those people don't get is that it's all part of the social dance where you're feeling people out, implicitly saying you're open to friendship, sharing a laugh, etc. Like it or not, you are correct that avoiding this can make somebody come off as a bit cold. *What* is being said is relatively unimportant, assuming you don't say anything offensive (so table politics, religion, social issues, etc).I struggled socially a bit in my late teens, I just worried too much about what other people would think of me if I said something wrong or stupid. But I forced myself to get out there anyway, had no problem teaching/making friends in grad school in my 20s, and I'm practically an obnoxious social butterfly now in my 30s lol. You can do it!",

I have savings, low expenses, and could get by for a while without being a SWE (maybe go into retail or something), but I’m scared given how bad the tech market is and don’t see it improving in 2026.You can do whatever you want man, it's your life. If you feel a company is mistreating you or disrespecting you that's all the justification you need to walk. With that being said, are you mentally prepared to start interviewing again and facing numerous rejections potentially for months until your next offer? I would tell you to tough it out while you interview on the side but considering you've been working nights and weekends I don't see that as feasible.Regardless of your decision, take this all as a learning experience because you're approaching the realization where your self respect and mental health come before the job.",

Live your personal time at your happy place. (don't do drugs)2) Implement an immediate feature freeze. New features go into the post-release backlog. 3) List everything that needs to be done and sort it into the four quadrant urgent/important matrix. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority\\_Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_Matrix) New tasks go into the matrix. If its not important, you don't do it; send it to your manager and have him delegate it to somebody else.4) Disassociate. Disassociate hard. All that work crap is happening to your Sims avatar, you are just the player. When somebody (anybody) gives you grief, you look directly into their face with your dead eyes and tell them that their concerns have been noted and placed into the task queue with an assigned priority. Take notes and categorize it accordingly. If they don't back off, start smiling, but keep your voice emotionless.",

Burnout is a fickle beast. It might help just getting a new day-to-day, or it might make it worse due to pressure to perform in a new role. It ca go both ways.In my case, it helped, but there are no guarantees.> Did you feel more exposed during layoffs? I didn't, no.> How did you make your value visible when outcomes were less tangible?When I'm in a more architectur'y or tech lead'y roles it is more about mentoring and communication, so the more you're seen around the teams, helping out, answering questions and just being someone that enables those around you, then that is mostly enough.Making other teams succeed is also a success for you. Just make sure that you're actually a part of that success and not leeching of it (looking at you middle management).In higher positions you also get to start initiatives you believe brings value, and that value can be measured in some way. But again, don't be the guy that just starts stuff just to boost their resume. Do something that the others will actually like (or at least have good support from the ones that will be affected).",

The biggest factor, to me, was not in the role itself but the people that surrounded me. I made one switch after being burn out due to boredom and ended up in basically the corporate trash pile of non-performers that had managers who found it easier to move them to this new effort than to terminate them. I had an impossible situation of kicking something off with a bunch of people who had poor skills, poor follow through, and poor attitudes. I was heavily involved in terminating over 80% of the team, including my boss. All while trying (and obviously failing) to make forward progress and then playing catchup while onboarding the new team while dealing with an unhappy customer who just wanted results. I was very busy for a period with HR actions, customer engagements to appease an upset customer, serving the role of like 5 different positions, trying to come up with clever ways to meet impossible milestones, convincing company leadership that the project was completely screwed and we needed help, etc. I went from boring to extremely not boring. But one type of burn out to another. Having a mountain of work to get done that grows much faster than you burn it down, constantly pivoting to emergent tasks that had to be resolved immediately and had me up until 3am writing documents and building slides, dealing with nasty people on the regular… it really wears you out. I’d much rather have the burn out from boredom over that.",

Work fast food, or retail if you have to. If I lost my job, I'd take a job stocking shelves, or flipping burgers if I had to. Way too many people looking for a software development job, just sit at home completely unemployed instead of getting a temporary non-programming job while they work on getting a programming job.Edit: I missed that you have a physical disability. This limits your options with non-programming jobs to ones that you are physically able to perform unfortunately. Still I would expand your job search beyond just software and cybersecurity to non-IT related fields just to get income coming in. Also, try to do what you can to get back into shape. Exercise will also help your mental state, and relieve stress.",

On days where I didn't fell like writing yet another cover letter I'd convince myself to just find 3 job ads I liked and leave the tabs open, which would turn into starting the cover letter, and eventually into applying to all 3. Also, start using an AI assistant to help, like copy+pasting the role text into it and getting a score for your profile. Networking helps a lot, I suck at it so I can't help, but you should try to expand your Linkedin friends list. Speaking of Linkedin, forget Easy Apply, I haven't heard of a single person who got hired through it. A really good advice I found was, find Linkedin Easy Apply jobs and then apply through the company website. Good luck",

No different from the tariffs added to physical goods.France, Italy, Spain, UK, India, already have digital services tax, some based on revenue, not even on profit. We could easily do exactly the same. We don't even have to make them insanely high, follow a protectionist strategy or trade wars. Just a \"small\" reciprocal DST on revenue is all you need. For example, take the France DST, 3%, if your gross ad, digital or e-commerce revenue is 100M, even if you made 0 profit, even if you made a loss, you owe France 3M. They did set a high 25M threshold to avoid hitting small companies but no tech giant with a large French audience can scape it. UK does something similar but 2%. India's one is even higher at 6% of gross revenue but it's limited to ads and their related services.Do that same thing on the gross cost of offshoring and the problem solves itself overnight.

Not exactly a CS MS, but a technical degree with some rigor nonetheless (like a CS MS).Generally speaking, degrees like EE, CS, CE, ME, etc. are all fungible. Nobody really cares which specific degree you received as long as you can pass the interview. As you get further in your career the fact that you have a degree becomes completely irrelevant, unless you need to check the box to meet requirements for a job. A CS degree might be a more natural fit for today's LC style interviews, but an EE major that takes a few electives can easily be on-par and any major that grinds LC problems will have a massive advantage.I've interviewed a large number of folks over the years. I can think of 3 personal projects out of well over 100 that were actually interesting to me. Most are obvious resume fluff and might as well just not exist. The 3 that were interesting were all related to hobbies that the individual had. For example, one was for scheduling and tracking autocross (I think? maybe some other race type) races.

Make a list of your teammates, and rank them from 1-3 on trust, higher is better. 3 means you both banter about your personal life and support each other when management does dramatic things. **Note: If you have none of these people, stop here and start building those relationships.**2. Grab some time to shoot the shit with your high trust buddies one on one. Tactfully ask how the company promotes, evolves people, and grows. Get specific, examples, resumes, etc.3. Use this information to make a case for why you should be paid more. **Note: Typically management cares about outcomes (customer satisfaction, revenue, cost, logos), not inputs (time, energy) or outputs (code, features, etc). If you don't have outcomes, you almost certainly don't \"deserve\" a raise.**4. Apply to other companies in the area and start working with recruiters. This is your reality check. **Note: If you aren't getting in the door, you now know you _can't_ earn more elsewhere. If you aren't getting past the interviews you now know where your weaknesses are.**5. Get decently far into the interviews (interviews are between 3 and 5 rounds long, once you're getting to finals (and not necessarily passing them) you should feel pretty high conviction you can land a new job.6. Tell your manager, in writing, at least 24 hours before your next 1:1, that you'd like some feedback on how to improve here. Mention your most impactful project and your least impactful project. This will signal to your manager that you're highly coachable (asking for feedback).7. At this 1:1, listen, ask non-defensive clarifying questions (e.g. \"Oh, so that wasn't as impactful as I thought. I'd like to do better next time around, how would you prefer I approach that situation when it comes up again?\").8. After the 1:1 take notes, reflect, and integrate all the knowledge you now have (peer's input on how promotions are handled, your performance in interviews, your manager's perception of you, your manager's ability to guide/help you grow)9. 24 hours before the next 1:1, tell your manager, in writing, that you'd like to discuss what growth at the company would look like in their eyes. **Note: This is the start of the negotiation. If there is a formal performance review process your manager will almost certainly shunt you to it. In that case this meeting is about learning the rules of that game and how to play it well. If there isn't a formal review process and your manager is good they will lay out a path, if they're bad, they'll wander around the subject.**10. Take notes, reflect, integrate. Your goal here is to answer this question: Do I leave, play the promo game, or wield power (threaten to leave) to get more money?At this point you should know what you want and need to do.Good luck kiddo!",

If it becomes May and you start with nothing else lined up, keep applying but do not list it on your resume or talk about it quite yet.Once you’re in the job like 2 months + I would list it and tell other prospective employers it’s just not a good fit for you. It may be a red flag to some employers since they think you’ll be a liability, and potentially also leave quickly. Leaving early will burn the bridge and likely prevent you from working there the future if you care about that. Reneges happen, I’ve done so twice in my ~7 yr SWE career working.",

Literally study a textbook and take notes for your language, then review your notes, especially before the interview. Anticipate the questions they will ask you (they tend to be pretty common), and rehearse your answers (In the STAR) format. Rehearse in front of your webcam if you need to watch it back. DONT sound nervous! Pretend you're a CEO. How would he answer? He wouldn't sound nervous, he'd be cocky.And apply as much as you can. I've been trying to stick to 10 applications a day and it's starting to work out for me. After not even making it passed the phone screens, I'm currently interviewing with 3 companies.

The way most companies set salaries is using market reference points - the market is roughly geographic and industry tied, though companies can kinda pick and choose who they think is competing for the same workers (software engineer at a FAANG and programmer in the IT department of a paper company are probably not in the same survey).So, junior dev in some industry group and city has a median of $X. A new grad offer might be 80% * $X and the company might say that the salary band for junior is 80%-120% of the market reference. Each year they get a new market reference and also adjust target points - performance based. So if the market reference is at $110k and you're at $91k, they might bump you up 2-5% on the target. If the market reference goes up, you might get a juicier raise. If it goes down, you get less of a raise. You'll have a target point and an effective point - they won't cut pay if you're target is lower than your effective, but your raises will be smaller.If you start getting above 100%, the raises are often lower. At that point they're thinking \"get promoted to get more money\" - part of the reason for the wider bands is to be able to make offers to people being hired away from other jobs.If your friend got 5 years of really good raises, I'd bet on a rapidly climbing reference point (2010-2022 were pretty good years) along with being below the midpoint target, then some pullbacks in reference point and being above target.Managers don't typically know what the reference points will be and also don't really know how you'll perform relative to expectations.",

There was an SQL take home question that I did not get correct and I still got hired.I worked as a full stack dev for 3 years there and really busted tail. Won a few awards from the company and got promoted twice. I got laid off in October, due to my own fault, but have had some success with this experience.My advice: stay off reddit and socials, put your head down, and you will be fine. Take whatever you can get out of school. Apply to smaller companies. Message employees on LinkedIn.

At this stage in your career, you should be hoping to level up every 2-3yrs. Sometimes faster depending on the company. A high growth startup is the type of environment I would expect to progress quicker assuming I’m contributing at a high level. If you aren’t promoted in the first 2yrs of being there, seek employment elsewhere unless you really strongly believe your equity is worth sticking around for (it often isn’t but there’s always exceptions)",

That started getting me a lot more responses.Another thing that helped a lot was community — finding people who had non-traditional starts, bad first jobs, consulting firms, or “training-heavy” roles, and getting help on how to position that experience instead of hiding it.Since I’ve worked at an early-stage startup for 2 years and am now in Big Tech, and I’ve seen a lot of resumes from people coming out of places like Wipro, I’ve been thinking about starting a Discord or something to share what helped me, how to reframe early experience, and how to avoid getting filtered out when your past work wasn’t ideal.For what it’s worth, I wouldn’t scrub it entirely and leave a 4-year gap — gaps tend to raise more questions than imperfect experience.

On the other end are the same kind of people who refused to use IDEs, GitHub, or any other technology that made things more efficient because of some weird purity thing they have. Lastly there’s people in the middle who realize it’s a tool to be used, and like most tools, with proper use it can be very effective at making things more efficient.",

Also every day I get handed things that aren’t outright wrong but don’t quite make sense and we work it out. Asking questions helps to resolve those things. Part of being a developer is actually validating requirements and things you’ve been assigned. It’s an ongoing dialog. You got through a CS program, you’re smart enough to figure it all out but be proud of your work but also humble and you’ll be a better developer for it. It took me 6 months to get okay at asking for help. I was used to never needing assistance in school. I never got any help from tutoring or anything in computer science classes bc it always clicked and was easy for me. I had this weird sense of pride about that. I did good work my first 6 months like that but definitely spun my wheels a bit and could have done better had I just embraced collaborating with folks. Now if I don’t understand it after spending a few minutes looking stuff up, I ask for another set of eyes or to talk something out. I’d say I probably help out other people 10x more than I get help but I don’t have any pride about it I just like checking in on folks",

I had one class where the dude worked at Netflix and it was during covid and they sent him home to work. He ended up moving right after, to my college town. He was still working at Netflix, but then taught our DSA class as well. Some days we wouldn’t have class cause he’d have to fly out to California. Anyways, that was my best class by far, we did SCRUM every time we met, everyone solved the leetcode style homework projects together, we had class assignments that were a bit harder and the whole class worked together.

Completely self taught myself graphics programming through The Cherno, LearnOpenGL, and Game Engine Architecture Volume 3, since my college classes did not really cover it in particular. Made the switch because I desperately needed something more fulfilling job wise than game dev, which was drying up way back in 2018 just about. Way before Ai and outsourcing has caught on. I enjoyed C++ so I did that. Then fast forward a bit more I dabbled in web dev a bit (did use Ai to initially learn, and figured it out in about a month), did that a bit longer but really did not like it. So, basically just learned I love working in C++. From there just continued building little c++ projects and am now actively working on my engine which is in a presentable state, but nowhere near complete (if it ever will be). Recently been diving into embedded for job opportunities, since even graphics development is a big challenge in my area. Been screwing around on my Nucleo board, and building circuits and what not. The job doesn't require embedded, but is definitely embedded oriented. So, I have a bunch of little nick nack projects in c++, my engine, and this sample embedded project just to show I am interested in embedded. At the end of the day, I have quite a bit to talk about in an interview. I bet they would maybe be surprised for someone to explain how they developed a fairly large project, made design decisions, and just know the full ins and outs of the project they built, especially from new grads. At least, that's just under the presumption that a lot of candidates may be going full fledge into Ai and not understand a lick of what they are doing. Regardless I feel as though I do fit the role, it is super duper entry level after all (they listed wanting someone with some form of knowledge in at least one out of every language under the sun basically), but was just concerned how fast they expect you to adapt to something more complex than you have ever worked on before. My engine is three projects, with about 100 files, but that's a drop compared to a companies code base with thousands just on one project.Edit: All of that just to say I am currently waiting to hear from them, though they are located near me in bumb-fuck nowhere. So, there may be a couple qualified candidates, but not many. On top of that, they have five roles open for the position, so just increases the odds.",

I will say it makes sense in class but the number one thing for me is if a problem waits till a meeting you waited too long. I’ve seen that a lot too. Status every day people bring up problems they had all day the day prior. One of the juniors on my project is like that so I check in on her most days to see how things are going and chitchat. I think some of it for folks is a sense of anxiety over performance, but there’s a saying that bad news doesn’t get better with time. Don’t understand something you’ve been looking at for an hour? You might annoy someone mildly but that’s just bc they are focused. Come in a meeting and say you struggled for 8 hours the day before to understand something that takes 5 minutes to figure out? That kinda thing happening often will completely ruin people’s opinion of you on a team. They’ll see you as unreliable and unprofessional. You won’t have problems with this I’m sure, I’m just tryina tell you what I think you have to be conscious about. Always remember that your whole team is shipping together.

Just the sites I've been using seem to have at least twice the number of jobs for FE as BE. Granted, it could be that there's more people applying or that it's sending me options I hadn't looked at because all the others hadn't panned out.>I would say relax, I spoke with loads of companies between September and December, did a million interviews only for people to drag their feet when it came to the offer stage or pull interviews because 'market conditions' made it difficult to make an offer.I'm hoping that's the case. My most promising interview was at the start of December and they ended it by saying they loved my application but they weren't hiring...I don't know why they were even advertising then, but that was a downer before the holidays.>New budgets have been done for the year now so keep applying and work on some side projects in the mean time. You'll land a role by the Spring, trust me.Thanks. I'm back at it today, but I figured I'd at least ask about the potential of looking into frontend in case there's something there I've missed.",

If the project had enough devs then full stack is fine cause people can jump between roles as necessary, but rarely is full stack done for anything other than saving money (at least in my experience at my last job).",

I have used AI for my project but the approach I have taken for it includes asking the prompt and then understanding WHY and HOW it works. Now I do fully agree with your parents; that you should use it because it will be the future. I think with that in mind, you should use it but FULLY understand what it is the AI is giving back to you as a response. Like \"why does this work?\", and \"why would this answer be better?\" should cross your mind. That's the approach I have taken when using AI for my personal projects. It helps too, because if you complete something one way, there will almost certainly be a more faster and elegant way to complete said task. AI does sometimes give you a better more faster approach to completing a task but just take the time to understand it.",

I've stopped coming to this sub as often as it's a bunch of boomers that greatly underestimate the power of AI because they don't know how to prompt. I find that most peoples idea of AI on this sub is still very much just \"ahh chatgpt sucks\"Tools like Claude Code have completely changed the industry and I think you'd have to be pretty ignorant to think otherwise. Most of my friends work in big tech (UWaterloo grads) and don't write much code themselves anymore. However, you must be able to understand the code, that is now the difference between a good engineer and a \"vibe coder\". I work at a much smaller tech company where most SWEs have been here for 10+ years and are mostly in the 35-55 age bracket, and they are all very behind on AI usage.",

Like I enjoy developing, in any capacity, solving problems, creating solutions. I prefer .NET, but would do literally any language or even infrastructure. Sounds cliche, but if you're passionate, you'll more easily learn, and that passion 100% shows up in interviews. So. Just apply. And prep for interviews. Once you're employed, then start planning.

While there I wanted to prove I was ambitious and voluntarily started taking on PM assignments since the front end dev work was pretty low. I was scared they’d see I wasn’t really needed lol. After that my next company was at a fortune 500 and I knew someone that got me an interview but it was for QA, but it was a fortune 500 company so I really felt like it was the right move.I have great passion when it comes to personal projects, but I’m not one of those guys that will argue about tech stacks/tools with people like it’s a sports team. I just like getting shit done, but unfortunately this “meh” attitude of not really caring what I use sometimes comes across as not passionate.As for what I enjoy, I really just enjoy being left alone and turning my work in. Whether it’s building a QA test case or building out some new app feature, I equally enjoy both. I settled on cybersecurity because it seems to scratch my itch to solve problems, investigate, and not have to be on endless phone calls (being left alone). And it also seems easier to get into then software dev since I suck at technical interviews apparently.",

Use that sales experience. \"Fake\" it. Not literally. But just be outspoken, be agreeable, put yourself out there. Once you've built up some good job experience, metrics, more confident. Try and find that F500 chill remote job, where you can be left alone and just coast. If the job sucks, has little growth or opportunity, toxic culture. Then do enough to stay afloat and put energy to applying to another role.Edit: Push to be tactical now. Apply apply apply. Try to get anything that meets your absolute needs (enough pay, remote, etc) while staying interesting enough of a position. Dont be overly strategic yet. Be strategic once you get the job. Plan, get to know your peers, get to know the culture, be strategic. Find your place, make a plan. Evaluate your goals/plan as time goes on. You may not want to leave after a year.

Many of us problem solvers get bogged down on planning out most optimal solutions and paths, because it's fun. But when it comes to executing on that plan, day after day, you really have to stop thinking of yourself like a machine that can deterministically follow whatever oober optimized plan you make.

Although I did get one phone interview from Capital One, where I talked to the recruiter but she told me that I would get rejected from the position since I didnt meet the baseline requirements of a 1.5 year minimum for the position. She gave me her number and told me to apply again in January since that is when I would meet the requirement. I am going to text her soon now, and apply to the position she tells me to apply to, but I am wondering on whether I should put this startup I had a big part in founding, and getting off the ground. Its only 3 months in and its steadily growing traction. I obviously don't get paid by it yet so need another full time job on top of it. Should i include it on my resume? I think I have done some cool things while working on it and it rounds out my skills well. My only concern is whether this would dissuade recruiters from selecting me for an interview since it may seem like I wouldn't be able to put the time commitment into the paying full time job. For the record, I've done a pretty good job on balancing both and still am able to perform well at my current job. Just concerned on whether this is a plus or a con to a recruiter. I would love some feedback on this and my resume overall. Thanks!resume: [https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu](https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu)",

Seems counter intuitive to hire a “consultant” without any industry experience, but that’s how they do it. Bring em in green and mold them how they want.And if you get hired into one of these consulting firms as one of their junior software devs, that obviously will have many parallels to being a new grad SWE at any other company.

It's similar to Dev Associate. As I understand, Dev Associate is harder (deeper, vs wider). I couldn't tell you if SAA is impressive on it's own, or if both are worth it. Many people do SAA then do Dev. I felt that just getting Dev, the harder, more important one, done on it's own was enough. SAA is still tough too I imagine (2 vs 3 months basically?). I can only speak to my own experience and say I went from 0 interviews to weekly with the Dev Associate. Did I get more interviews because I had Dev over SAA? I don't know.SAA and Dev Associate are both good. Which, or both, I couldn't tell you 100%, but I went with Dev because I've heard it's more relevant to a web dev/full stack/SWE role.Couldn't speak on IT but I know IT is hard to break into too these days.I had very basic AWS experience before hand, basically deploying a couple websites on EC2 and some user permissions for a company. The stuff these certs go over are solutions for very large scale applications, thing basic simple websites don't usually need. It helped but wasn't huge.I'd say just pass the test to get the cert, you won't fully understand the material yet, but the first step of learning is just get the basic knowledge down.

Pro tip: have a good eye exam every year with a solid MD or OD. Not the strip mall variety. Equipment gets better and allows your provider to see things early. Make sure you find a good one. And watch out for carpal tunnel and tennis elbow. I've had both - not fun. Nothing to worry when you're young but at my age FML..",

What used to be a PM + 5 engineers in the future might be 2 PMs vibe coding + 1 super deep engineer supporting with human effort. There will still be a need for hardcore deep tech people to do truly novel / hard things. But there will be so much opportunity for people who actually have product / business skills to create prototypes and find PMF before that point.For you as someone who doesn't currently have those deep skills, this is a fresh slate. On the tech side you would be competing against people like me who DID spend 10 years coming up the old way, hands on. Whereas on the product side, I think a lot of the engineers are hopeless and even demonstrating luddite behavior as they see their jobs threatened. That seems like the path of least resistance for you.It does depend on your nature a bit also. Personally I have always enjoyed both the product and engineering sides. I gravitated to the tech side because it was more valuable and the limiting factor. I very much feel that shifting now the other direction for a lot of types of software products.",

Most of what I use I learned on the job. If you only care about the basics, you won't make it through interviews. Recruiters like passion.If you want to get hired in embedded, you want/need the full EE or CE degree. Half the jobs won't interview CS and the ones that will, you're a lower tier candidate. Very little of standard CS coursework involves low-level coding and none of it involves learning bare metal from the logic gate up.Your list isn't enough prep but Signal Analysis and Processing is the most fundamental to advanced EE and CE theory.

Sure they’re more inclined but CS for embedded is perfectly valid and you aren’t seen as a lower tier candidate because your degree is highly relevant. Ofc this depends on position, you have no clue about PCBs or pure electronics but for an embedded software position it’s more than enough. I’m a CS grad, and in my BS I had about a 40% overlap with the CE program. I’m in my masters now, and I have plenty of embedded, low level and hardware related courses which I take as a pure CS student. I also do research in hardware security, where the majority of my peers are ECE grads (I’d say 70%) and the rest CS. Apparently the notion that CS degrees don’t touch low level stuff and are only pure high software is quite propagated which typically doesn’t hold true.

With the way the market is right now, if the pay is good and it's something you like and wouldn't mind learning more, why not? Years back an AWS recruiter reached out to me and I remember saying \"Gee, I'm definitely under qualified for this job Idk if I should interview\" Even made a post on here seeking the same kind of advice. I'll tell you what they told me back then, which turned out to be the best advice I've ever gotten. Nobody actually knows what they’re doing. We’re all just figuring it out as we go. If someone offers you an amazing opportunity but you aren't sure you can do it, say yes, then learn how to do it later.",

I once was in the process of doing several hours of interviews for one job; meanwhile, the leader of a brand new group somehow got hold of my resume and wanted to interview me for that group. After the first 90 minutes of interviews, they explained the situation, switched up interviewers and started interviewing me for the other job (the basics of the two jobs were very similar; this wasn't a problem as far as interview prep is concerned). I got the job and it turned out to be a great opportunity for me to have a big influence over this new team.",
