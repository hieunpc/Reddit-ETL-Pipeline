Today’s platforms have to support analytics, data science, and increasingly AI workloads alongside traditional BI.The criticism of Databricks and Snowflake feels a little unfair; they are not trying to replace data warehousing fundamentals, they are trying to support multiple workloads. Both platforms can absolutely deliver a well-designed data warehouse if the right discipline is applied.In my experience, the real issue is people rather than platforms; there is a strong tendency to chase modern tools and certifications while neglecting core concepts such as data modelling and integration. I regularly see engineers openly say they have no interest in modelling, which I would argue is foundational to being effective in this space.So I agree with the spirit of the post; that we have lost sight of fundamentals. I do not think modern platforms are the culprit; they simply expose gaps in skills and architectural thinking that were always there.",

In data analytics and engineering the real problems are and always have been people and processes. Technology only enables them. What actually got us here is weak data management and governance.That said, I also partly agree with the criticism. Modern data stack tooling has reached a point where many organizations think that throwing Databricks or Snowflake at every data problem and calling it done is enough. This is especially true in organizations where IT (which should not be the owner of data in the first place) is expected to “fix” data issues. They look for technological solutions to what are, in reality, problems of processes, roles, ownership, and culture. In that sense, the frustration expressed by Inmon is very much understandable.So the concept of the data warehouse did not fail. Technology simply made it easier to avoid the hard work. Vendors and consultants sold a convenient illusion. Integration and enterprise data are not a tooling problem, they are a design choice and an organizational commitment, and a governance problem. Expecting a platform to solve that is exactly the mistake that keeps repeating itself. Blaming modern platforms for the decline of data warehousing feels like blaming a database for poor data modeling. The real issue is that many organizations never built enterprise data capabilities in the first place.",

The UI is clunky, but the schema explorer and cross database support are hard to beat once you tune it a bit.What has helped me more than switching clients is changing how I use them. Smaller result set limits by default, fewer auto refreshes, and leaning on the SQL editor instead of clicking around the tree constantly. That alone fixes most of the sluggish feeling.I have not found a single tool that nails fast exploration, smart autocomplete, and wide database support without tradeoffs. Most teams I know end up with one main client and a lighter secondary one for quick checks, rather than trying to force one tool to do everything.",

If you can get some Databricks exposure—even in one-off projects—I’d take it. At the very least, you’ll be able to talk intelligently about both in interviews, and more companies are running hybrid stacks.Long story short: Don’t abandon Snowflake just because Databricks is cool now, but add some Databricks to your arsenal if you can.

You generate the code to download the historical weather and air quality data (backfilling) into feature groups (tables) and write an incremental pipeline to download weather forecasts, weather observations, and air quality observations. The 1st challenge you will encounter is how to perform a temporal join to join air quality observations with weather observations. This requires an ASOF LEFT JOIN between the tables. Only a few data warehouses support it it (and Hopsworks feature store). You want that data back in Python (e.g., Pandas DataFrames) to train the model. Hopsworks provides that data via Arrow from the Lakehouse tables. If you go via JDBC/ODBC to your data warehouse, performance will be vile - Arrow (ADBC or ArrowFlight) is best for Python clients.My book (referenced in the thread) covers these fundamental skills of backfilling vs incremental pipelines and data models - star schema, snowflake schema data model and OBT (don't use this for ML!).",

        "body": "ML usually uses the lowest level distinct data. So either bronze if bronze has 100% of source (usually they never do) or you build into staging an extra layer for de duplicating row data with hashing, from vetted sources. If data from higher levels is required, either a view or make some new tables in silver for the ML data process. Make sure it is repeatable at different times or days with the same filter. Then what the ML spits out, that is information, store that in Dim/Fact gold layer. Like a Customer Rating. The fact is the rating calculated by the ML based on history available at the time the CR was calculated. The Dims would be DimCustomer, DimCustomerRating, DimDates, FKs into a new FactCustomerRating table. So the ML the Python code reads the datawarehouse repeatable data, and sends into staging the output, that then gets processed. Unless you build APIs and have the ML process running continuously so that a new customer is processed in near real-time.",

My team was a small team seperated from our centralised team, we started with our own different jank.

It's 8 columns wide in letter format and someone wrote paragraphs that I have to scroll past 2 words per line.I finally find the 4 references to how record type 22 is generated and the documentation just says payment type. I now need to go read vague 1-liners as to why record 22 is being generated in this or that instance. Turns out I need to go read IRS instructions on 1099R forms to figure out how this code is supposed to be used. Of course, the IRS is not referencing our internal code sets so I need to cross reference all of those too.I have read through 1000's of pages of documentation over the years and most of the time it only tells me things I already know and doesn't answer my questions.",

I'm not even talking about grammar, because I'm also bad with it (I'm not native in English). However, I don't like texts that are not straightforward to the goal.One example is dbt documentation. This doc was driving me crazy because it was too verbose with stupid things. For example, in the section about the dbt folder structures, they spend 3 or 4 paragraphs explaining why organization is important. I don't care for it, everyone knows that organization is important, just go to the point and tell us how to organize in DBT.I have the doc here, you can take a look. Basically 70% of the text is useless to understand dbt organization. https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overviewIn the documentation we have to be direct to the goal of the tool and explain how it works. There is no need to make stupid analogies for 5 years old kids. Who is reading the docs is expert enough to understand it.",

I have been on both sides of this coin (as a consultant for many years and also as manager/staff). I have worked with some clueless managers/directors who some consulting company got their claws into and only cared about bleeding the customer while providing a day 1 legacy solution that ends up getting built 2 years later.You're in a tough spot. I could be wrong but based on what you wrote, I got the sense that you probably don't have a lot of experience and therefore the consulting company will use that against you.Best to call a meeting with your manager and the consulting company contact and lay your cards out on the table...be polite, but don't hold back either. If you still get no support from your manager, time to look elsewhere.",

In general there's no reason for them to acknowledge whatever solutions you provided.

You can't develop in a vacuum and expect users to accept a (to them) long delivery time just because you want to run the data through all the layers in your architecture. Of course, you also have to protect your setup and governance, but sometimes speed of delivery is more important than perfected delivery.",

If you're doing everything incrementally there's little cost impact of that vs daily. But if you're doing a bit that's full refresh at the same time consider different frequencies based on day of week & hour of day. Ex: weekdays are every 15 minutes, but night & weekends are hourly. * Consider using aggregate tables for common dashboard pages. * Pay attention to database optimizations for files and tables. Ex: for athena used compressed parquet files of the appropriate size. * etc, etc, etc",

Scalability -- build templated scripts of processes that only require inputs to run. For example, the name of a source, its connection, the name of the tables, and so on.Pros: scalable, easy to add new sources (just add a config)Cons: Harder to understand than \\[2\\] as there is an extra layer of abstraction (the \"metadata\" layer)2. Ease of understanding -- simply have processes for each source that move and/or process the data. It's a bit easier to understand for other people and new joiners since there's just one thing to look at which could be a bit more scalable in the future since other people can chime instead of you bottlenecking your data teamI've seen 2 work well when there isn't loads of data but a big need for data in the company. \\[1\\] works well in say traditionalindustries like manufacturing where realistically it will always be a central data or IT team trying to process probably quite a lot of data, so it depends but the key always is design first then modularity IMO",

At different layers of the stack there's different approaches.For custom API extractor's, I wrote the first two as completely separate. Then when I was working on the third, I started by copy-pasting stuff from the first two, looked at where things were identical and put as much of the overlapping code as I could into a library. Then I made all of our future extractors use that library. We were writing them in go so this took the form of an interface which extended `io.reader` that the custom extractor would implement.For loading, using the aforementioned library produced data in a standard format along with a schema file that could be used to generate a snowflake load statement. Then we had a single snowflake load component defined in our task orchestrator which we re-used everywhere, changing only the configuration. (We used argo-workflows as our task orchestrator instead of Airflow. I... don't recommend doing that)And then for transform jobs, I'd conceptually sort them into two categories. 1) Transforms which you can determine programmatically from some sort of metadata. This could be standard transformations you perform on every table like an upsert, or it could be parsing fields out of a JSON document based on a schema. You should generate these SQL statements with code. You can have that code be DBT macros, use code-gen to generate DBT statements, or just generate and run the SQL statements from your application. I'm not a huge fan of abusing DBT macros for stuff like this because I find JINJA to be kind of messy, but a lot of people swear by it. Probably comes down to personal preference. As for having the code that generates the SQL statements also run it, you should avoid this unless you directly benefit from detecting and implementing schema change on-the-fly. Otherwise just having a daily/weekly pull request that you generate with a script is probably fine.2) Custom business logic transformations. I wouldn't do anything special here. If it's in DBT that's enough standardizaiton.Then once you're writing custom transformations you can kind of do whatever you want. DBT forcing everything to be SQL select statements is a pretty high level of standardization.",

But it is likely if risk management gives you one definition that is true for all that risk management decides, (you can ask them too, how universal they feel the definition is), but I would not assume that risk management and controlling will agree on a definition, even at start they request the same.I hope that answers my point of view.",

It sounds like you could use some re-structuring of your tables if I'm interpreting this quote correctly. You shouldn't need every single column of your table to know what to join on. How many columns do your tables have?>I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persistedThat's because that's not how that works. A count statement materializes your dataframe, but it doesn't magically make that dataframe available downstream. That's what caching is for. If you have `myDF.count` and then use do `myDF.join(other, ...)`, Spark will either re-calculate `myDF` entirely (which means your `.count` statement is actually making your code SLOWER by doubling the amount of processing you're doing), or it will intelligently cache the results on its own after seeing that the Dataframe is being re-used, in which case the `.count` still didn't do anything that a cache wouldn't do.TL;DR - don't use `.count` unless you're trying to get the count. Any other use of it is a hack that can be done better in different ways.>I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impactThis makes sense. With only 50-100 records, I guarantee that Spark is already broadcasting those anyway. None of your tables are large unless you have an enormous number of columns in your \"main\" table. 50k records isn't very much if you have your tables designed properly, which brings me back to my original question above.>Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without?Yes, you should always use good engineering practices and write clean code. Using functions and classes has no impact on the Spark query plan, but it does have an impact on your and your coworkers' sanity.>Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?Making your code maintainable and having a large query plan are separate issues that are only loosely related at best. Again, Spark doesn't care how your code is organized. Pulling code out into a function will not impact it at all.Use good software engineering practices to make your code maintainable. Use good data engineering practices to keep your spark plans efficient.Edit:After reading the post again, I have one more question>However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error.Are you doing something other than the joins? 6 joins isn't a lot and will absolutely not create a large query plan and also absolutely would not be the cause of an OOM error. Can you post a sample of what your code looks like? Because that really doesn't add up to me.",

        "body": "Okay thank you!So to explain better lets say i have 6 small tables with columns a,b,c,d,e,f..I will join on key defined on each row in the small table. for example depending on row 3 it will be joined on key 1 and depending on data in row 5 it will be joined on key 2 to the main table using a left join. Depending on what table i am joining i will also need to filter the main table. I do not bring in every single column from the small table but just just a few. I then repeat this 6 times. I then save the updated main table.The way i implement the join is to get all the keys from the small table, lets say key1,2,3. then iterate 3 times and get all the key1s from the small table and join it to the main table on the left. repeat this for all the keys. And rows in the left that havent been mapped will then have a new column written as flag and map this to Yes.The errors i get when writing it as a function / loop: The cluster runs out of memory (from my understanding of your point means my execution plan is too large)So for my side question the main point i should be focusing on is how to make sure my execution plan is optimal? is there a guide on this?Edit: just saw your edit regarding looking at the code:So first I get the keys from the mapping df:     valid_keys = (         mapping_df.groupBy(\"key\")         .count()         .select(\"key\")         .distinct()         .rdd.flatMap(lambda row: row) # we want to flatten to make a list         .collect()     ) I then loop to do the joins:     # Step 2: create a dictionary that only has the join keys that we need     filtered_dict = {k: v for k, v in join_keys.items() if k in valid_keys}     final_matched_df = None     current_df = main_df     for key_name, key_cols in filtered_dict.items():         # Drop output columns from current_df BEFORE the join to give us the filtered df without the output columns         for col_name in output_columns:             if col_name in current_df.columns:                 current_df = current_df.drop(col_name)         # Get the mapping key which is the key + the output columns on the key we are joining by         mapping_key = mapping_df.select(*key_cols,*output_columns).where(col(\"key\") == key_name) # return the rows where the keys match         # display(mapping_key) will do join on key 1 then get key 2 then key 3 etc         # We join the mapping key row on the key and get the mapping key which includes key + the output columns         joined_df = current_df.join(mapping_key, on=key_cols,how=\"left\")         # get DF which only has the matched rows         matched_df = joined_df.filter(col(\"key\").isNotNull())         # Accumulate the DF with the matched data         if final_matched_df is None:             final_matched_df = matched_df         else:             final_matched_df = final_matched_df.unionByName(matched_df)         # Get the unmatched rows for next iteration         current_df = joined_df.filter(col(\"key\").isNull())Then i create a flag if a join doesnt occur:     # create the flag     if missing_flag is not None:         final_matched_df = final_matched_df.unionByName(current_df).withColumn(             missing_flag,             when(col('key').isNull(), \"Y\").otherwise(\"N\"))So this code will be called 6x (one time for each small table)",

You could even write a test for it if you've got that kind of gumption, Trying with specific date ranges that you mentioned the API accepts. Also, if you did a merge statement instead of a copy into (just assuming I guess) on primary key, it would probably fix the dupe issue, even if the API returned everything every time. Seems like that shouldn't be the case though, and is likely a param in the API call that needs to be verified.",

A malformed param might end up getting ignored or erroring out depending on the API. Alternatively, your filter doesn't work the way you're expecting it to work or the param you're filtering on isn't the right one.>I’m deliberately not deduplicating downstream because I want ingestion itself to be incremental.Would suggest implementing something like a rowhash and which you can use to determine if a row \"exists\" or not. Will make your pipeline a lot closer to being idempotent and a lot less likely to see double insertions.Means you can run your pipeline in an incremental fashion now in an efficient way (only call the data you need ever X hours in a time period instead of doing a full load every single time), and it also means if you are in need of a full load for whatever reason, you can run the same pipeline one time to backfill.",

Do it on a smaller subset over more than a day,  make sure check your filter parameters are also parsing correctly e.g it’s not expecting datetime in some specific format and its erroring on their side and becoming 1900-01-01. They should return you a bad request but other systems often don’t follow best practice. Remember the [robustness principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) when it comes to integration. Ultimately if you’re going the route of a watermarking pattern to ingest incrementals and not dedupling downstream it doesn’t hurt to have some internal validations e.g asset min(created_at) > last_created) that fail the processing.",

It's a combination of:* Market temperature* You as an individual at a technical level* You as an individual at a personal level* How realistic your expectations areFrom what I read on the subreddit, people who struggle a lot tend to have very unrealistic expectations for their first role, underestimate how much work is required, as well as overestimate their own position within the job market e.g. no years experience, done one bootcamp, \"can't find a remote job paying $200k USD - job market is COOKED\".Purely anecdotal although I got into Data Engineering during the previous DE boom 5 years ago, so I had market temperature on my side. Additionally, I was unemployed so was programming, studying, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours per week as well as applying for jobs within the country I'm a citizen of, so a lot less complications in terms of borders.Based on what you have written, there is a possible issue with borders although if the subreddit is anything to go by, a lot of US work is being outsourced to your location.

Oven if you do the stuff with python. You will do the same things as with SQL.As an analyst your tools should be- power BI- microstrategy- Tableau- Qlick- SAS Vita workbench (visual analytics)They are all about the same thing. Visualize data.Create Heatmaps, graphs. Distribution layout.Add trend lines. That kind of stuff.Data engineering is really preparing the data, order it in a way that you can create the graphs. Workaround data bugs, remind source system to fix their data. Enable analysts and scientist.Your tools are concepts. Data Vault, Kimball Star models.You work on data bases like Oracle, postgres, terraria.Or Kafka, Apache iceberg or had up to name fancy approaches.Data science is ML, fancy mathematics to get some insights from existing data.Maybe ask some data science guy. I would say your tools is mathematics first. Haha.I would not pick the job by fancy names/ tools. What do you want to achieve? What motivated you?If you tell more I can maybe deep dive a bit, if you like ( except data science)",

Thanks for providing more insight.When I started consulting in data engineering I have been told everything lower 3 years consulting in data engineering consulting is junior grade.There has been some truth to it, because no one taught me what data engineering is about and I learned through experience and failure in different projects.i would not say this is necessary today, since the knowledge is better accessible. For example here in r/dataengineering are multiple experienced engineers that are willing to share their experience. And AI also gives nice ideas on how to tackle the challenges.My advice is do not focus on tooling as the primary goal..Look into data governance ( most boring data engineering topic IMHO, and I put it here because it is about metadata)Data quality ( that's always a thing, and IMHO the most interesting part)Data modeling strategy ( that is the most difficult part. ).All of these topics you can tap in today without changing jobs and they will accompany your DE career.If you see a job that features a tooling that interests you, go for it.there is nothing wrong in that. But see it more like a car acquisition you always wanted to drive.Also when applying to position try to highlight your core data engineering skills that you already have. I think that's a better thinking approach then do tool bingo. You might also discover more interesting jobs by doing so.I hope that advice helps you and provides some motivation to you.",

        "body": "From a data practitioner’s perspective, IDP delivers value, but not in the glossy way demos suggest. In real pipelines, the biggest gains aren’t perfectly structured outputs, they’re time saved on discovery and triage. Analysts, data engineers, and analytics managers spend far less time opening PDFs, scanning documents, or hunting for the “right” version. Error rates improve mainly because fewer documents are missed or misinterpreted early, not because extraction is flawless. Complexity still exists, but teams get faster at deciding what matters and what needs attention, which is often the real bottleneck.For data roles, this is where a local, intelligence-driven system like VaultBook has had practical advantages. Instead of forcing everything into schemas upfront, it keeps documents intact and applies intelligence at the retrieval layer. Data analysts quickly surface related reports, prior assumptions, or historical decisions. Data scientists revisit source material tied to experiments or models without re-parsing files. Managers review contracts, specs, and analysis together in context. Because the intelligence runs locally and focuses on relevance rather than brittle extraction, workflows stay simpler. The measurable benefit is less context switching, faster recall, and fewer “did we already analyze this?” moments. That kind of efficiency compounds quietly, which is often more valuable than flashy automation.",

A couple became lite-DE who also do lots of DA work. Most went into BA and project management instead because there were more opportunities there and they dont have to do lots of self-learning. If you go that route (management or lite-DE), prepare to have very strong domain knowledge and stay within your industry even if you switch job. The pay isn't bad, and maybe even better if you're political and ambitious. There are heaps of companies who are still using legacy systems and still need DE who are really good at SQL. You do have to upskill and learn data modelling. You should volunteer for those sort of project in your current job to at least say you have experience with data modelling such as Kimball. There are lots of courses on data modelling you can take. Once you got your foot in the DE door doing SQL and data modelling, you should learn Python, infrastructure etc and become a more well-rounded DE. The job description for DE is constantly changing. It's getting more and more heavy on infrastructure and companies just expect you to be able to do anything. But always know your strong point. The expertise I'm still advertising for myself is data modelling, Databricks and the ability to step into Data Analyst role if needed (because I was one). You'll be competing with DE who used to be software engineer. They'll be much better than you at coding. There might be DEs who were SREs/DevOps and they'll be better than you at infrastructure. I also have another friend who isn't that technical but she became the data lead and earns way more than me. She has excellent leadership skill, communication skill and also very studious and has a millions certificates so she can participate in any technical conversation even though she doesn't write code that much. So work with your advantage and continuously learn to overcome your disadvantage, regardless which path you take.",

When you get to the \"Set Scripting Options\" part of the wizard, there's an \"Advanced\" button—click that, then look for the \"Types of data to script\" option. Change it from \"Schema only\" to \"Schema and data\" (or \"Data only\" if you just want inserts). That will include insert statements for your data.For views and security objects like users/permissions, the wizard sometimes skips them by default. Make sure they’re selected under \"Choose Objects\"—expand the tree to manually include your View and Security options. For user permissions, you might have to script those out separately, as SSMS sometimes leaves out the explicit DENY/GRANT statements for users.Once you've done this, your .sql file should include create table statements, insert statements for your data, view definitions, and possibly some user/permission scripts. Double-check the final script to see if everything you need is there—sometimes for things like user permissions, you'll have to supplement with a bit of hand-written SQL at the end.Good luck! If your module ever evolves into building internal tools around this database and you want a less manual way to let others view and update data (especially if you don't want to give direct database access), there are platforms that can help you spin up safe, web-based interfaces pretty quickly. But for now, the scripting approach should tick all the boxes for your assignment.",

Grad schemes say degree or equivalent experience a lot of the time, and jobs themselves definitely value experience more.Also, look up the apprenticeship providers in the uni league tables.

All that matters is what value you generate. Public sector in UK may be different, I’m not sure. You should also consider palantir training/certs.

When they break, it will be noticed and important people will know your name.If you want to DM me - feel free to. I transitioned from Biology (Genome Sciences and Technology, University of Tennessee Knoxvile) into industry about a decade ago.

        "body": "Man I feel your pain. We went through almost the exact same thing a few months back. We had a bunch of automated processes scraping data from different sources feeding it into our CRM and then triggering marketing automations. Seemed straightforward enough but then we started seeing weird discrepancies in our reporting and it turned out one of the integrations was pulling in data fields from an older deprecated system that hadn't been properly sanitized. It wasn't a security breach per se but it was definitely a compliance nightmare waiting to happen. Trying to trace that data flow manually was a total disaster. It felt like we were untangling spaghetti and every time we pulled on one strand three more popped up. What really helped us was implementing a virtual data platform that basically acts like an AI data engineer. It was able to map all the data connections identify the data quality issues and flag those unexpected data flows between systems we didn't even realize were happening. Like it showed us this whole chain of dependencies that would have taken weeks for us to figure out on our own. The cool thing is that it didn't require us to move any data around. It just analyzed everything in place and gave us a clear picture of what was going on. Then we used the no-code tools it offered to build agents and workflows that enforced the correct data governance policies and automated the cleanup process. We even built alerts that would fire off if any of the agents tried to access data they weren't supposed to which gave us some peace of mind. Honestly before this our data team was spending all their time firefighting data quality issues and dealing with ad-hoc requests from sales and marketing. Now they're actually working on strategic projects that move the needle. The company that helped us out has a referral program and Id be happy to connect you. I get a little kickback if you become a customer so full disclosure there but it honestly solved a huge headache for us and it sounds like you're dealing with something similar. I can drop you a link if you're interested.",

So instead of returning 204 I must return a boolean for a success or not.

        "body": "I'm gonna tell you something that took me way too long to figure out and honestly still pisses me off that nobody just said it to me directly when I was your age.Stop building shit to impress other programmers. Start building shit that actual people need.You're seventeen, and coded for like 6 years? Cool. I was similar. And I wasted years, like genuinely wasted them building technically complicated garbage that nobody used. I'd make elaborate systems with clean architecture and clever algorithms and other developers would be like \"wow nice\" and I felt smart. But you know what? That's just jerking off. Nobody outside of programmer circles gave a shit because none of it solved actual problems.The real turning point isn't learning another framework or getting better at leetcode or whatever (ofc that's important too at some point). It's when you stop asking \"what's a hard technical challenge I can tackle\" and start asking \"who around me has an annoying problem I could maybe fix\". And I mean really asking. Not imagining problems, not building solutions looking for problems, actually talking to real humans about real annoying shit in their lives.I wish I'd done at seventeen instead of building my tenth todo app with a new fancy tech stack. Go find someone, it can be your parents, a teacher, local business owner, literally anyone, and ask them what repetitive annoying thing they deal with. Then build the dumbest, simplest possible thing that makes that less annoying. Not elegant. Not impressive to other devs. Just useful.For an Example, my friend used to manually copy-paste data from emails into spreadsheets for her work every morning. Took her like 45 minutes. I could've built a script that parsed those emails and dumped it into a CSV in literally an afternoon. But I didn't, because that wasn't \"interesting\" to me. I was too busy implementing a custom database engine for a project nobody would ever use because I wanted to understand B-trees. See the problem? She had a real problem that cost her actual time every single day. I had the skills to fix it in hours. But I never even asked because I was focused on impressing myself and other programmers.This will humble you hard. All that clean code and design patterns everyone is proud of... Nobody cares when they can't figure out how to log in. The clever optimization doesn't matter when they just need a button that exports to Excel because that's what their boss wants. You know what's funny? Even Linus Torvalds had to learn this lesson. When he built Git, he didn't start by designing the perfect distributed version control system architecture. He started because he was pissed off at BitKeeper and needed something that worked for the Linux kernel workflow, specifically handling huge numbers of patches from contributors he didn't fully trust. Git's internals are actually kind of ugly if you look at them. It's basically a content-addressable filesystem with some scripting on top. But it solved the actual problem he had, which was managing kernel development. All the elegant design came later after people were already using it. He built for the problem, not for the architecture. That's why Git won and all those \"better designed\" version control systems nobody remembers lost.Or another time, built an inventory system with proper relational database design, normalized tables, foreign keys, the works. User wanted to bulk-edit 50 items at once. Couldn't do it because I'd built individual edit pages and never thought about bulk operations. They just stopped using it and went back to Excel where they could edit multiple rows. My database design was objectively better than Excel. But Excel let them do their actual job faster, so Excel won.You'll realize pretty quick that like 80% of what you thought was important is completely irrelevant and all the boring stuff you ignored is what actually matters. Authentication, error messages that actually tell you what went wrong, handling edge cases like what if they upload a file that's too big, making sure it works on their old laptop with Chrome from 2019, having an undo button, that's the stuff that makes or breaks whether someone actually uses your thing.This field is packed with people who started young. I've met self-taught developers who picked it up at 25 and they're way better than me at a lot of things because they focused on solving problems instead of collecting technical skills like they're achievements in a video game. There's a guy I used to work with who switched from being a chef at 28, learned to code at a bootcamp, and he's one of the best developers I know. Why? Because he spent 10 years in restaurants learning how to handle stress, communicate with difficult people, and deliver under pressure. Those skills transferred. His code isn't always the prettiest but he ships things that work and people actually **want** to use them.[continuation in the replies]",

Worse, when people do not ask anything and you just silently are stuck. Just ask your question away. No matter how stupid it sounds to you. A stupid question that gets answered is better than a stupid question that does not get asked and you remain stuck.2)when you get this idea about comparing yourself with others then instead of saying \"I might have an imposter syndrome\" then self-diagnosing yourself with it solves nothing. When a person knows more stuff than you then learn from him. When he does something better than you then ask for hints and for advice. People who are more knowledgeable than you are your opportunity not your threat. Talk with people not self-diagnose yourself with irrational stuff.3)when there are hackathons, open door days, seminars, internship offers, student job fails, then again, talk with people. Use these opportunities. Attend these events. Even when you are saying \"But I do not know anything.\" When you know nothing then you have nothing to lose but only to gain. Be proactive.From technical side:1)go for degree studies. Pick a university/college that is known for its CS program and apply to it. Does not have to be Harvard University or something. A local state college also does. Without a degree you'll be fighting an uphill battle. For various reasons.2)do not build calculator apps or TODO apps. Build stuff that matters. You won't be using that calculator app you made. And there is no \"But perhaps somebody might start using.\" No perhaps. If there is no need for it, then do not make it. Make things that matter. Start with yourself. Build stuff for your own use. Something related to your interests and hobbies. Perhaps something to make your daily tasks easier and faster for you. Something for your friends and family. Like this you are learning to solve real world problems not making useless template \"projects\" that everybody is copy-pasting from some tutorial.2)Leetcode and competitive programming are useless in the real world. Yes, there are companies that might ask such questions during their interview phase, but other than these, useless. Prioritize actual real life problem solving not focus on how to make an X task as fast as possible. DSA (data structure and algorithms) has its place but that place is not in Leetcode nor in competitive programming. Apply DSA in your projects, instead.",

Did I study the *library*? Nope. For one project I had I needed to do image manipulation *(straighten/skew an ID card)*, so I learnt how to do just that. Nothing else; anything that I try to memorize will end up being forgotten after a few days in a different library.My recommendation: Learn just enough for doing the task you have at hand. Once you feel satisfied with the current project *(or abandon it like 95% of projects that are started, because finishing one is extremely hard)*, move to a different project that requires you to use a different part of the libraries you are interested in. Do not take it all at the same time, just bit by bit and motivate yourself with the project.",

        "body": "Most people responding in this thread are wrong. They’re coming from only their own personal experience and they don’t realize how much variation there actually is between people. I’ve taught software engineering to a couple hundred people. There is a spectrum for what you’re describing. I used to call it rabbit hole vs. fuzziness. Some people are comfortable moving on with just a vague understanding of a topic (these people are “fuzzy” on the details). Others can’t move on until they’ve understood every last piece (they get lost down the rabbit hole). Go too far on the spectrum in either direction and you have problems. In my experience with people learning programming, you run into way more people having problems because they’re too “fuzzy.” But you DO get some people who struggle because they consistently go too far down the rabbit hole — even when working on a specific project, even with a tight deadline. You should 100% address this. I have two tips:First, keep a very dynamic, organized todo list. What I mean is, before you start working on pretty much anything, you should explicitly write out high-level goals and todo items. Generally, what do you aim to accomplish? And what do you think the high-level steps are that you need to take to get there? Then as you work (and get a better sense of what needs to be done on a granular level), start to populate more specific sub todos (nested/indented below the correct parent todo). Cross todo items off as you complete them — and add more as you realize you’re missing them. You should be switching back and forth between doing the work and managing the todo list. Keep the todo list correctly organized in a hierarchy (sub todos indented below the correct parent). This process is helpful for a number of reasons, but in your case the biggest one is it helps keep you focused on the bigger picture. You’re constantly reminded how what you’re doing fits in to getting you to your initially stated goal. That way you’re working toward the goal rather than being distracted by every single thing you don’t totally understand.Keep a separate list of open questions. Writing them down can help you resist the urge to chase down all the answers right away. You can always come back to the list and answer the questions later if time permits.",

        "body": "A socket is provided by the OS as a means for different processes to communicate, essentially acting like a file handle. You can write to it or read from it to send or receive data. It’s like a mailbox where the OS acts as the mailman and figures out how to transport the mail. Sockets don’t necessarily need an address - e.g. you could have an anonymous socket for communicating between processes on the same computer. In this case, it’s usually held in memory by the OS kernel until the socket is closed. Sockets can also be local-only, and are often bound to a file path so other processes can also go find the socket and send mail to your program.When you’re writing an HTTP server you *do* want an address so that others can send you mail (HTTP requests), so when you bind to a socket with a specific port you’re telling the OS “if you get any letters to this address, stick them in my mailbox.” By binding your socket to a port, you’re giving it an address that is reachable over the network. Otherwise, you couldn’t have a server that just sits and waits for requests - nobody has a way to send your program any requests!Here’s a pretty good [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/D26sUZ6DHNQ) that explains sockets simply and in better detail than many developers ever know or care to learn. In practice, you usually just need to know that it’s a stream of data handled by the OS, very similar to reading/writing files, and how that data is handled beyond that is not really your application’s business. It is helpful to know that sockets usually stay open for a while after you’re done with them (in case the other side has more data to send), and you’re limited in the number of sockets you can create, so it’s prudent to reuse sockets where possible rather than open new ones regularly.",

In C it's a number referencing a file descriptor, with syscalls for the defined operations. In Java it's an object (java.net.Socket) with methods for the defined operations. The actual implementation will be via references to data structures in the system's networking stack, which will keep track of addresses and buffers, and handle the encoding and exchange of your data via the system's networking hardware.",

Usually the first file you open is file #3, the next one is #4, the one after that is #5, etc.In traditional UNIX sockets, when you say \"I want to make a network connection\" the OS says \"OK, your network connection is #3.\" Then later you can say \"I want network connection #3 to connect to server 10.234.5.67 on port 80,\" followed by \"Send the bytes 47 45 54 20 2f 0a 0a over network connection #3\".Most of today's networking systems evolved from traditional UNIX sockets and work basically the same way, even on \"non-UNIX-like\" platforms such as Windows.> Is a socket an object?The socket is the object in the OS's internal data structures that is manipulated when you tell the OS to do something with network connection #3.> Is the socket a number?For the purposes of asking the OS to do something with a socket, the socket is #3...but \"3 means the connection between this computer and 10.234.5.67\" is only valid in the context of a specific conversation your program had with the OS.> Is the socket a file?The \"numbers the OS hands out, like #3 above\" are called *file descriptors*. They were originally made for files, but were adapted for sockets. When you want to write the word \"hello\" to a file that you previously opened and the OS told you it was file #3, you tell the OS \"Write these bytes to file descriptor #3: 68 65 6c 6c 6f\".One interesting decision they made was that if #3 refers to a network connection instead of a file, then *you can still tell the OS to read or write bytes exactly the same way*.A socket isn't a file, but it sort-of acts like one.(UNIX domain sockets are a different beast. I'm not going to discuss them here.)> Is a socket an IP:port combination?No. IP:port combination is a setting you put on the socket for outgoing connections. For incoming connections you set a port; the OS only gives you connections from others requesting that port. You can also optionally set an IP address for incoming connections, sometimes called a \"bind address\". In case your machine has multiple IP addresses, the bind address tells which one you're interested in getting connections from.> when creating an HTTP server, why do we use sockets\"Why do we use sockets to make an HTTP server?\" is like asking \"Why do we use a print statement to put data on the screen?\" Because that's what the system provides.There's a lot of stuff going on under the hood! For example the humble print statement could be replaced with a syscall or a BIOS interrupt or writing pixels directly to a framebuffer or [building your own graphics card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs).But as a beginner you don't want to think too much about the underlying layers just yet; you'll just get confused and overwhelmed. \"Use a socket for network connections\" is the networking equivalent of \"Use the print() statement to put text on the screen.\"",

If you can't think of one go browsing places on Reddit, Github, etc. and get a look at what others are making and see if you want to try to clone something or put your own twist on it. I usually try to ask myself what needs to be done to get the project going. Like I'd break it down into steps and go. If you're wanting to deploy something with Docker then pick something that can run in a Docker Container, figure out how to containerize it or if it's already done try to figure out what they did to get the project container ready, look into how the container is built, and then look at the steps needed to deploy the project somewhere. From there you can begin to find where your knowledge gaps are and then go search for appropriate documentation, videos, etc. as you go. If you're having attention span issues then try to train yourself to do a little at a time and then come back. (Or speak with some medical professionals about possible ways to help) I have used books, looking at open source code, videos when those came around, and talking with others to learn things. From there I try to build and stop to review materials and to brainstorm on how to get around blocks. You can use LLMs to help with learning as well, but you need a way to validate information coming from them as of now and you also need to learn how to not let it do all the work for you if your intention is to learn. If you're wanting to learn something try not to give up and keep at it. Good luck on your learning journeys.",

If you can build a project that parses JSON data in the FHIR format, you are already ahead of 90% of students.2. **Cloud Experience:** Learn the basics of AWS or Azure. Healthcare is moving to the cloud rapidly.3. **Data Pipelines:** For a Data Engineering role, learn **Apache Airflow** and **Docker**.4. **Privacy:** Read up on **HIPAA** compliance. You need to know how to handle sensitive data safely.For your portfolio, try taking a messy public health dataset and building an automated pipeline to clean and visualize it. Good luck!",

You also need to learn Encapsulation which just means using `private` variables and `public` getter and setter methods to protect your data.**Beginner Project Ideas*** **Number Guessing Game** This is a classic for a reason. It forces you to use random number generation loops and conditional logic to tell the user if they guessed too high or too low.* **Console Calculator** Build a calculator that runs in the terminal. It helps you practice breaking your code into separate methods for addition subtraction multiplication and division.* **Simple Quiz** Create a multiple choice quiz. You will need to use arrays to store the questions and answers and a loop to cycle through them while keeping score.**What you need** You really just need a good IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse and you should absolutely start using Git for version control right now.

As you move up, projects that involve failure handling, like a small server that must recover from bad input or partial crashes, force you to think like an engineer instead of a syntax user. Also, not using AI for a while is a good call, but do not confuse that with avoiding documentation or reading other people’s code. Learning how systems break and how you fix them is where the real growth happens.",

What matters is that you caught it early (3rd sem is still early).A big mistake people make right now is trying to pick a “future-proof domain” instead of building fundamentals + proof of work.Here’s a simpler way to think about it:Step 1: Stop trying to predict the job market.AI noise, saturation talk, etc. mostly affects people with shallow skills. Strong fundamentals age well.Step 2: Build a core base first (3–4 months):One programming language properly (Python / Java / JS — doesn’t matter much)Data structures & basic problem-solvingGit + basic LinuxThis alone puts you ahead of many students.Step 3: Use web dev as a vehicle, not a destination.Web dev isn’t bad — generic web dev is.Build 2–3 small but real projects:CRUD appAuth + databaseSimple APINot to become a “frontend dev”, but to learn how software actually works.Step 4: Let interest emerge from doing, not thinking.Most people don’t “discover” interests — they develop them after building something.After that, you can branch:Backend / systemsData / analyticsDevOps / infraApplied AI (later, not now)Important reality check:AI won’t replace developers who understand systems, trade-offs, and can build things end-to-end. It will replace people who only copy tutorials.Your goal for the next 6–9 months isn’t mastery.It’s momentum + consistency.Pick one path, commit for 90 days, reassess. That alone puts you ahead of most.",

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqjA04\\_dpk&t=4239s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqjA04_dpk&t=4239s) You learn SQL, C, Python, HTML/JS/CSS, Networking, and Flask. Generally, you \\*alone\\* decide what you need to know based on the problems you would like to solve. Nobody else does. The deep knowledge beyond 'checkboxes someone told you to fill' comes from your own independent learning. To learn 'real coding', pick something in your life you want to automate, or you wish was better. That's the key. Toy projects are fine, but it is nice to make something someone can use. Say you are in a Discord server, why not make a bot that does some useful task? As you make the bot, let people test the commands, see if they identify errors. The Python classes you teach to kids, what resources do they have to learn? Wouldn't it be nice if they had a pretty website with all the information related to the course? Wouldn't it be nice if they had a Leetcode style interface to do problems at your website? Wouldn't you want to tell them, \"Hey kids, look at this website \\*I made\\*, let me know if there are any problems with it?\"Is there any software you use you think is dated? As you make these useful projects, you get a hunger for wanting to improve it incrementally. You identify the necessary technologies to learn as you make these useful projects.if you were making my website suggestion, the learning could be like this: \\---1. \"i wanna make a website. how do i make a barebones site?\" -> consult youtube, perhaps watch Harvard CS50 for an HTML introduction, watch other youtubers you like. copy down the examples the lecturers give, maybe afterwards start writing your own barebones site. when you start writing, you consult documentation for intricate questions. learning generally goes: YOUTUBE VIDEO \\[brief intro\\] -> WRITE CODE -> CONSULT DOCUMENTATION | Repeat.2. \"i wish the site was pretty!\" -> learn css, watch a vid on css, put it in your site3. \"damn, this code is getting messy... maybe i need this fancy react.js format to make the webpage snappier & stop repeating myself.\" -> learn react.js, watch a video, start writing it, consult documentation as needed4. \"i wish the kids had a pretty editor they could write in... oooh what's this, monaco editor? i'll use it in my project.\"5. \"what's this tailwind css thing i've heard about? it could make making my site prettier easy, lets try it.\"6. \"hmmm... i want my site to have a backend so they can submit code.\" \\*google\\* \"oh, what's this, Judge0 is a framework that allows me to implement a judging system for the coding problems students submit?\" \"hmm... flask is good for site backends? lemme try it out!\" \\---Learn by DOING... there are 'buzzwords' to know, such as: Docker, Tailwind CSS, PostgresSQL, CI/CD, Flask, Django, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn. But the main way to learn these things is writing useful software you care about",

Right now you have a lot of tools, which is great, but you are missing situations where the problem is fuzzy and you have to decide what to build, not just how.One way out of the “I don’t know what to make” loop is to add constraints. Pick a small annoyance in your own life or school routine and try to automate or improve it, even if the result is boring and ugly. The learning happens when you hit decisions about structure, tradeoffs, and maintenance, not when the project idea is exciting.Also, getting lost in frameworks like React is normal. They assume context about state, architecture, and collaboration that beginners rarely have. Those concepts usually click after you have struggled through a few messy, self directed projects, not before.",

System topics and real-world tradeoffs mattered more than I expected.If there’s one thing I’d share: you don’t need to rush interviews, but doing a few earlier can be really useful.

Neither on the job nor when hiring. I would go as far as to say that including them on a CV/resume actually takes away from it, as it conveys a certain naivety and highlights inexperience.

Learn what you can. Don't bother downloading the certificates as they're of no use to you. The recognised ones will all cost you money.

Also let the user mark off a to-do. Again, maybe extend it slightly, like allowing the user to view marked off to-dos.3) now maybe you want a simple console app that gets data from an API, instead of a saved file. There's APIs for everything, pick a free one that interests you (many people choose a weather API, for me, it was a football one, maybe you want a recipe one) and output some information in the terminal. This is also particularly good because you have to read the APIs documentation4) now you get to branch off what complexity you want to add. Maybe you want to figure out how to automate tasks. You could try and save data from the API above into a file at regular intervals. Maybe you want to add a graphical user interface, so you look up how to display the API data, which could mean in a web browser, or in a mobile app, or a desktop app, whatever interests you. Maybe you want to get data from multiple APIs and store it in a way that you can easily check what data you want, so you create a database that gets populated by various APIs.Start with the commonly suggested ones, expand on them slightly, iteratively add a little bit of complexity you haven't tackled before for every project. What to build will kind of define itself by what you're enjoying/what complexity you can think of.",

Traditionally this training teaches auto mechanics, HVAC installers, even electronics technicians, but many training centers provide computer programming. My son actually took two years of programming in high school before going to college. As far as continuing education in programming, there are a couple avenues. First you can attend a community college for two years to get an associates degree in computer programming. That's not as expensive as a bachelors degree in Computer Science but it gets you half way there. Most universities will accept an associates degree as the first two years of a computer science curriculum. The advanced math comes into play if you want to get a bachelors in Computer Science. Most degree programs are either in an engineering school or a business school. Some colleges make you choose an area of concentration (mine was physics) Business curriculums do not usually require calculus while science and engineering tracks require calculus, differential equations and linear algebra. A Bachelors in computer science will serve you well and keep you employed, but an associates in computer programming will also help you get work.

Learning to separate your logic is important. Python has more frameworks/libraries to solve a larger variety of problems. JS -> Python basics are pretty straightforward, unlike say C# or Java. Something that’s bitting more than you can chew can be good. It forces you to think about modularity and separation of logic. Tutorials can be good as a reference, but not worth copying and pasting beyond getting a foundation, like a working web page or mobile app that’s half way presentable with standard practice folder structure. Build your own unique application from there",

Some of it is solid foundational theory. The rest of it is the history of brilliant quirky, strange people thinking strange thoughts. They didn’t have any idea we profs would try to teach, and you students would try to learn this stuff. So take it with a grain of salt. I bit the bullet and got through it.So, young Padawan, take it with a grain of salt. Keep plugging away. Bite the bullet, dive into the cloud of unknowing. You will get it. Also, my life as a programmer has, since then, gone through lots of cycles of “WTF? This makes no sense at all” and then understanding. You would be wise to get used to your emotions when you dive into that cloud of unknowing. I’ve struggled with that all my working life. I think it’s part of the creative process of programming. I’m also a cyclist. This cloud of unknowing is like being halfway up the mountain and thinking f—-k this, I’m never going to make it. And then I make it to the summit and get to bomb downhill.

In school you don't really have a lot of time and you can't put in as much focus or effort into it as you would like. With work it's not like that; you have one thing to focus on, makes things a lot more manageable. At that point what really shines through is your persistence; persistence is the key thing in programming, at least in my eyes. I will say that it is hard to decide whether it's right for you or not. I guess the answer is, when you are doing it are you focused on it and are willing to sacrifice things for it? If yes, I think that's enough. Don't let school kill your confidence. If you are drawn to programming, that's a very good strength, you just need persistence, diligence, and curiosity to carry you further",

You should evaluate your life, what you can handle, and what you prefer. All advice will fall short and even you won't know whether staying/switching/dropping out was the best. If I had to make a similar decision now, I'd switch, but only because I lost much more time than I expected. The mental distress is really what you should sort out though. It doesn't necessarily go away if you quit your pursuit of programming, and may stay with you after you're done with education. Don't be afraid to consult a professional. Of course also don't fall for the endless therapy loop, but some people do benefit medical help (e.g me) without much side or long term effects.",

My point is university is trash. Sometimes they're phenomenal and the best places to learn on the planet but more often than not they are a waste of money. Id encourage you to find trust in yourself as you sound quite creative and intelligent from the bit I know of you. Ill also bet you just simply learn 100x better from practice and self directed discovery and curiosity than a broken theoretical course.",

Or as [the \"monad tutorial fallacy\" blog post puts it](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/):> let us suppose that Joe’s metaphor is that Monads are Like Burritos. Here is where Joe badly misinterprets his own thought process: “Of course!” Joe thinks. “It’s all so simple now. The key to understanding monads is that they are Like Burritos. If only I had thought of this before!” The problem, of course, is that if Joe HAD thought of this before, it wouldn’t have helped: the week of struggling through details was a necessary and integral part of forming Joe’s Burrito intuition, not a sad consequence of his failure to hit upon the idea sooner.Learning is also a good mix of strategies that are entirely general to the human species across any domain, and tactics that will work for you specifically in some specific situation. If you find some great way for you to learn concept A, it doesn't necessarily mean that it'll work for some other learner, or that it'll work as well for concept B.What you're asking about is general enough that we can only give very general learning advice, like [Oláfur Waage's _Learning Rust the wrong way_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL9LANLg5EA) (more about learning in general with Rust as a specific example of something to learn).",

Don't expect to be done with this in minutes or hours. It will be more likely several days since you need to form memories of the critical details and memories of how they work together. I often find that sometime after a study session questions start popping in my head, as if my brain's background processes keep working on understanding the concept and notice what information is still missing. I then look that information up too, regardless of how irrelevant it seems.

Asking questions about the problem/information6. Repeating steps 3 through 5 foreverThe only thing that really ever changes, aside from the specific concept, is the complexity/breadth of it, and by complexity, I really just mean the amount of information. When something is more complex, it takes longer to make sense of the individual parts and make it all make sense together, and it makes it harder to know which questions to ask to gain clarification or find information that you're missing, but it's still the same process. If you're able to memorize the information and regurgitate it on command, but don't feel like you really understand what it means, then you've most likely been skipping over steps 3 and 5, meaning you're just encountering new information and trying to commit it to memory without *using* it.If you don't understand how something works, try to write something that uses it, and as you run into issues, start Googling away to find the information that you need. If you encounter more things you don't understand while Googling up info, follow up on that as well until you feel like you actually understand what's going on.

Sure, from one side, you'll be learning a bit less than you'd learn during your Bachelor studies as your Master studies will take less time. From the other side, you have already covered probably a lot when it comes to Databases related courses in Bachelor program. Still, a Master degree for non-CS people should teach you various topics that will be covered also in CS Bachelor program. So, you can cover that gap.I personally think that you won't get such quality from learning online. All these bootcamps and online tutorials are more like for beginners. I have checked some and they do not cover more complex topics one will learn during his university studies. They won't force you to work on your thesis project where you have to come up with something more unique than another \"X management system\" that you'd get from bootcamps. University studies will also give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects in your Github. When going by online tutorials and online bootcamps your imagination will be limited. They will tell you to make a TODO app. You will make a TODO app. Nobody will use that TODO app.If Master studies cost a lot for you then you can try some online learning and see how it works out for you. Your current career definitely will be a bonus point. But if you see that you are not landing a Junior developer or a Junior data engineer role (forget jumping into a Mid-level or into a Senior-level position) then consider going for a degree.",

I don’t see much value in inventing my own Netflix or re-implementing an HTTP library, especially when AI can do that with a single prompt.Because of this, I sometimes feel like I didn’t manage to get into the industry in time — and at the same time, that the industry itself might soon look very different from what it is now.And on top of that, there’s real life: buying a home, raising kids, all the usual responsibilities.I guess overall I’m just worried about how to live this life the right way.",

AI will be/is important and will be/is generating this stuff super easy and quick, but it’s not quite that simple…..A few months ago I decided to dive into Identity in ASP.NET (basically built in .NET authentication) and .NET does so much of the heavy lifting. It abstracts all the details away, allowing you to just focus on plugging it in, creating your policies and then focusing on your business logic instead of infrastructure.However…. I sort of quickly realised, that if you don’t understand how it works internally, the abstractions don’t really help or make it any better. You still have to call the relevant methods in the relevant order, and understand what’s going on in order to get the most from it. The abstractions, just save you having to write your implementations… it’s not a substitute for understanding how it works.I see AI as the same. It’s an abstraction. We ask it to generate code, it does. That saves us time and speeds up development, but if we’re unable to understand the inner workings, we won’t be able to get the most out of it. The best way to learn is to build. So build these solutions yourself, and understand how these work not because you’ll be building these yourself in the future but because it is imperative you understand the inner workings to get the most from AI generated code….",

If you don’t know what’s happening under the hood, you can’t really use them well — whether it’s [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Identity or AI-generated code.My struggle is more about the next step after that understanding. Even if I go deep, build things properly, and really learn how they work internally — will there actually be an employer willing to take a chance on someone without formal work experience? In many cases, resumes are filtered out automatically before a human even sees them if you don’t have 3–5 years of relevant experience.Part of me knows that building something unique, finishing a real project, and showing it publicly might be a way to bypass the traditional job search. That also takes time, just in a different way. And realistically, 6 months isn’t a long time at all — maybe even 1–2 years isn’t.So for now, I’m trying to treat programming as a serious hobby and long-term investment, and see where it leads. No matter how the industry changes, I still believe that understanding programming fundamentals will become almost mandatory, and once you have that, switching languages or technologies is much easier.I’ve also been living outside my home country for 6 years, and while things are generally fine, being a foreigner adds extra friction to everything — internships, official employment, even simple life stuff.

Javascript is the most in demand (going by listings in the U.S.), but there are also many more Javascript developers than any other language and can be very competitive depending on where you live. You'll often find that knowing a niche language and a niche industry/application will in many cases make it easier to get a job and you will be paid better for it, the mean salary for Rust dev's is like 150,000, almost 50% more than a Javascript developer. In my country, some of the best paying and hardest to fill dev roles are for COBOL developers because COBOL is the ancient backbone of a lot of finance and government systems. What you learn to build is also probably more important than the language itself (although these are often related). For instance, python developers are in demand because of the boom in machine learning and AI, if you learn python but don't develop skills in machine learning or AI you're going to find relatively fewer jobs available to you.",

Data analytics is definitely a skill that’s in demand, and you don’t need a ton of theory or expensive courses to get started.Here’s a roadmap that works for a lot of people breaking into analytics:Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera — audit for freeKhan Academy / YouTube playlists on Excel & basic statsSQLZoo for interactive SQL practiceNext step is to focus on building something that hones your skill. Try analyzing something you care about (budgeting, fitness, etc.) Document your work — even simple visuals or insights go a long way. This will lead to something called “portfolio” like a folder of all your project work Analytics folks use Excel / Google Sheet, SQL, Python with pandas, R, Tableau/PowerBI If you want something practical and project-oriented that walks you through real exercises in data analytics, this book below is designed for beginners and emphasizes hands-on work over pure theory:AI-Powered Data Analysis for Beginnershttps://a.co/d/8v7IwjKThe book offers good ground in programming, math and stats, analytics mindsets and methodologies, using AI, with lots of examples. Many of the prompts that’s discussed are fully optimized to use lowest tokens. Full disclosure: I’m the author of the book I mentioned — sharing it because it’s designed for similar use casesNo pressure — you don’t need to buy it to start. But some folks like having a structured guide as they work through exercises and build confidence.",

If you don't have anything to say, just ask questions, ask for clarification, inject yourself into the conversation. You will have more impact, you will even have an easier time staying engaged.It's true that some people truly are more talented at particular skills than others, for sure. But I think a lot of \"talent\" isn't innate ability, but more like a very minor calibration of personality that slightly reduces inhibitions to do something. Imagine if you were 5% more likely to speak up, or 5% more likely to cook a meal, or 5% more likely to exercise each day. Over time it could create a huge difference in outcomes. 5% is a small enough margin that, even if it isn't your DNA, you can just consciously make yourself do it. Old fashioned discipline or initiative or whatever. It really does work!",

A lot of it is just nerves that goes away with time as well.If you're not sure about something, and you can't look it up quickly, just say that you don't have the info to hand and you'll share it later, or if you absolutely need it, tell them that you need a minute to find it, mute your mic and dig around. The important thing is honesty, be honest and transparent and people will be patient with you.Take a moment to reflect after the meeting on things you needed that you didn't have and things you had but didn't need and use that to prepare next time, but don't beat yourself up over it.

You get access to the courses for life, and the better rated ones are generally quite good. As for making is stick, building things on your own is 100% the best way to get there. Get a feel for the language out in the wild and make some things on your own, and it will stick a LOT better. I wish I had started doing that earlier than I did.",

        "body": "Java uses OOP but OOP is a separate thing. It's a concept of how to handle data at runtime by creating objects and then performing actions on those objects.A method or function are the actions that you can use on those objects.A class is a description of an object, at runtime a constructor creates that object in memory, and the instance is the runtime object that was created by the constructor.You need to think in two ways - the code as a dry written thing, and then the multiple real things created when you run that code.Like the Cake class.At runtime you pass in (as arguments) butter, flour, sugar, eggs, vanilla flavour to the Constructor, which then makes an instance of a cake - say a plainSpongeCake.You then call the methods or functions of that Cake class.So you call addIcing(), add sprinkles(), etc.For your next cake, you instantiate the same class but this time you add in chocolate instead of vanilla and then call the same methods. Voilà, you now have a richChocolateCake too.You can now call the cutSlice() method, and that works on both cakes.That's pretty much OOP in a nutshell.You could make an interface class and have the cake class call that. You just put the addIcing() etc method signatures in that class, as you only really use them to guarantee that particular methods will be available in your cake class.Lots of languages use the principles of OOP so it's very much worth learning!Once you've mastered OOP and are getting to grips with Java, then you can start looking at using patterns in the code such as MVC and Singleton.Good luck! Stick with it!",

I told Claude that I had no experience with token based authentication and she went ahead and built it with me, only forgot to hash the passwords, had me build a database with those tokens instead of using a provider and other things.

They don't understand what's going wrong, so they start a new chat and go from there until it starts to go wrong. AI also expects that the path to the goal is known, but it's not and technical debt grows.This is the AI that non-developers are so impressed by, they're blind to how bad it is. They don't understand how having AI add patches creates difficult to maintain code, they don't understand that it's a bad idea for AI to play chinese whispers with themself as they rewrite a codebase, they don't understand that AI can't actually think and strategise and plan for the future.The AI that programmers are impressed by is it's like having access to a senior developer who isn't tired of you. You can talk strategy with it so that you can enter new fields, like you can go to AI and ask \"I'm looking for a high level overview, no code, use and explain jargon, and provide multiple options. How would I go about implementing {*whatever it is*}, thank you\". It's able to present you with what you're meant to do and not rob you of the learning experience of understanding and implementing it, and you unlock the jargon to make searching more efficient.There are significant flaws with the claims people make about AI, it can't do what they think it's doing, and they need programmers to sort it.",

It’s primarily a Dependency Injection framework with extra modules for web, databases, etc.A big idea behind dependency injection is you don’t create the objects yourself, someone else does and you simply request what you need. The reason this evolved is because when you do “new SomeClass()” within Java it’s very difficult to test it the class that contains it.Imagine you created a CreditCard service within your Controller, when you want to unit test the controller you want a FakeCredirCard service, but if you did “new” it’s very hard to swap it out.Spring lets you annotate both the real CreditCard service and the fake one, then you dynamically get the one that fits the scope (ex: test)",

Or I'd have an idea for something, and I'd follow different tutorials for each part of it (e.g. one tutorial on how to connect to an API, another tutorial on how to save data in a db, then put the pieces together to build a scraper). Now that I'm much more experienced... I do exactly the same thing. I built a tool recently for orchestrating restic backups in kubernetes using CRDs and it was the same process. Follow a tutorial to read/write kubernetes objects from python, follow a tutorial on installing CRDs in a cluster, etc.. put the pieces together and go. The only difference I suppose is more often than not the \"tutorials\" I'm following are docs pages instead of explicit tutorials, or sometimes a short \"how to\" from an LLM.

In some ways, they are similar, so the choice comes down to your preference. Which do you find more interesting, * Data exchange and communication between computers, or * Shared processing between computers?If it's the communications, then \"Advanced Computer Networks\" wins. If it's processing then \"Distributed Computing\" wins. Both sound interesting because they will go far deeper than the introduction one might get from a 15 min YouTube video on either.",

It's one of those (mostly) low-pressure desk jobs that you do to make a stable income while you do what you really want to do in your free time. That said, it will contribute close to nothing when it comes to helping a career in game dev. The knowledge will 100% be helpful, but it won't help you get a programming job unless it's ultra entry-level (and 99% of game dev jobs aren't entry level).It is an excellent job to have for paying bills though, and depending on the environment/level of independence, it can give you lots of time both at home and at your desk to learn programming independently. As long as I get my tasks done each day, I can pretty safely bring my laptop to the office to study/work on my own projects most of the time.I will say though, \"building a multiplayer online game\" is a very, very ambitious goal shared by many aspiring game devs who don't know what it actually takes to do something like that. To the point that it's a known red flag/meme if a dev tries to crowdfund an MMO. If you intend to make games by yourself, your scope needs to be reduced \\*drastically,\\* and you'll not only learn more but be more satisfied with the process if you focus on making small, simple games. If you want to make something bigger, then find friends/collaborators to work with-- particularly people who are willing to work on something for the fun of it instead of trying to turn it into a business. It's very, very difficult to \"start a game studio,\" so you want to start by making games for fun and learning to enjoy the process of making them before you \\*ever\\* think about monetizing. Basically don't think about monetizing/turning it into a business until you \\*have business.\\* And if you want to get into programming for an existing studio, be prepared to spend years and years doing contract work to build a reputation, and to navigate a highly competitive field where you could be let go at a drop of a hat.Make small games. Fail faster. Fall in love with actually making the games, not the idea of making games. And know that game dev, especially solo, is a very multidisciplinary endeavor where each discipline within it can take years and years to master. Pace yourself.Source: IT person of 6 years who gave up game dev because I found out I don't actually enjoy the process of programming after even more years of trying and going to school for it. What I discovered was that I actually wanted to tell stories, and I didn't need to force myself to be a programmer/artist/designer/writer/composer unicorn to do that. I could just write stories instead.",

You need basic ones, and more specialised ones for programming certain things (e.g. writing a networking protocol will require you understand networking), but they diverge very early on into generalist vs specialist. IT generally isn't really a path to (games) programming work per se, it's more a path to help desk, ops, sysadmin, database admin, infra, devOps, etc. If you want to work as a programmer, providing you can already operate a computer to do basic file admin, web browsing, text editing, etc., you should just start programming right away and focus on that. If you need to earn money right away and IT jobs are all you can get right now then it's better than starving... We very much need IT people to keep the software we write up and running.For games and multiplayer online games specifically you'll need to have good overall programming skills and pattern awareness to implement the gameplay logic. Plus OS awareness, networking, database design/implementation for the online part. Plus a good understanding of 2D or 3D graphics as applicable for the rendering part. Then there's all the art...If you use a modern game engine you can mostly get away with just doing the art and use their abstractions for most of the other stuff. Still very much need to know most of the above though, just not as much as if you were to implement it.\"multiplayer online game\" is very ambitious, so a very rough idea of what your expectations starting from zero should be: A small/toy 2D game you could build within the next few months.

Mimo, Brilliant, and apps like those are good for getting your feet wet, so I wouldn't tell you to stop. However, once you feel like you want more of a challenge, and are looking for more in-depth knowledge that'll last you through your career, I would recommend free courses like cs50, The Odin Poject, or freeCodeCamp. I especially recommend cs50, since it's basically a free Harvard course. And in my experience, it taught me more than basically 2 years of my actual college courses (might just be bad professors though ngl).Just a word of caution but when you're trying to learn on your own, make sure to pace yourself and try not to take on more than you think you can take. Seen a lot of people (definitely not me) be like, \"I'll be the greatest programmer ever! I'll just do TOP, cs50, 11 hour youtube courses, and build my own projects all within 6 months!

I'm designing and building some DIY solar garden lights where the LEDs do interesting animations. I haven't found any commercial lights like what I want. To finish the project, I will have to code my first embedded microcontroller, design the electronics, learn to design circuit boards and have them manufactured, design and 3d print the housing.This may seem overwhelming, but I've been taking it one little step at a time. It's not linear, though, not steps in a straight line. Sometimes, working on the software gives you bright ideas for changing the hardware to make the software smaller/better, and vice versa.This project pretty much illustrates why experienced developers encourage you to pick a project that interests you as a tool for guiding your learning.

        "body": "First off coding is work, it doesn't produce adrenaline but rather headaches, drowsiness and fatigue. Lets not 3 Mile Island the world here, C or Python, should not cause somebody to feel slow and dumb. So the first thing that comes to mind right now is to choose one, which if you are learning is C.Not to date myself but I first got interested in computers before the S100 bus debuted, so maybe 13 or 14 at the time. For years all I could do is read Byte and when I could find it Dr.Dobbs. It wasn't until the Vic-20 came out, 1980, that I could actually afford a computer and that ViC 20 was barely usable. So for a good number of years my interests where satisfied by reading what I could.It actually took me a while to get to college and that was where my first formal training started and unlearning the VIC 20. At the time the school had Sun workstations so that was like a step into the future. So what motivated me, well the place I was working for was paying the bill. Since I didn't want to go hungry anymore it was a good idea to keep working. Now that said not a programmer per say but use the knowledge almost everyday before working. So staying sharp with software was important. However that required me to keep writing code, sometimes toy programs and in a couple of cases finding bugs for an Open Source project. At work I had some focus on CNC and PLC controllers which is always a challenge, beyond spread sheets and Python code. So even if work was NOT as a programmer, I was heavily involved in automation.Now that I'm retired the motivations are different. For example to keep track of my investments, I have spread sheets of stock portfolios. Now on the surface one might laugh at spreadsheet programming because it looks to be simple but I'd have to say there is as much depth there as their is with Python. The motivation is that I need to keep this organized and understand where my next meal is coming from.If you want to stay sharp though, who doesn't and frankly at this age you work at it, yo need to do more than stock portfolio management. To that end I keep a couple of hobbies going and use those interest to drive software development there. This is the key, use it or loose it. If you want to have any usable skill at all with respect to software you need to stay in the game. Motivation is sometimes hard to come by or even keep, so you really need to integrate programming into projects that you are interested in. Programming itself can also be a motivator, simply learning about new languages can motivate some. I didn't even know that C3 existed until yesterday for example and it actually looks interesting. For most of us though we need that outside pull to start a new project.Lets say you are into bicycling and those little trip computers look to be so handy. That lust could be the motivator for a DIY trip computer for a bicycle. Going DIY means it can work exactly as you expect, in every way it is yours. The challenges are the motivator. What are those challenges (just a few):1. Embedded project.2. Battery operated (maybe solar) and thus needs to be efficient3. Small custom Printed Circuit board.4. Limited screen size and I'o possibilities.5. Case size limitations.6. Limited program and data space.7. Limited programming languages due to microprocessor.In any event the project becomes the challenge.",

For an ISP-like project, you'll need to know how your own project fares against typical ISP metrics:* How many requests can it serve at once.* What happens to requests that come in after it's quoate has been filled?* Does it filter requests based on any kind of algorithm?There are other questions that you might think of based on what your own research into making a mini ISP has revealed.

So if you want to use the term \"functionally retarded\", you've come to the right person. Don't worry, I'm not offended.You do not need to know a lot of mathematics in order to succeed in the field. C is not significantly more math-intensive than any other language. Things like pointers are tricky for beginners, but those are tricky for beginners regardless of whether they're good at math or not.Modulus is something that will come up in any programming language. It's usually used to determine if a number is evenly divisible by another number. It's pretty easy, conceptually. Divide two numbers. Discard everything before the decimal point. That's modulo. Like, 9 % 3: That's 9/3, or 3.0. Discard the 3. You're left with 0.0. It's evenly divisible.Now do the same thing, 9 % 4. I'm pulling out my calculator for this part. That's 2.25. Discard the leading 2. You're left with 25. Not evenly divisible. In most cases, that's as far as you'll need to go with it. Some sub-disciplines within software are very math-heavy, such as graphics/games programming and AI/machine learning. But that's mostly at the very deepest, darkest fringes, and not something you will likely encounter outside of specialized roles that will highlight the need for deeper math skills. And definitely not as a beginner unless you are specifically diving into those areas.",

        "body": "Don't worry too much!! You only need as much math as what you are trying to build requires. If you write a text based adventure in C you'll need very little math's knowledge. If you build a game using raylib, you'll need to learn quite a bit. If you encounter difficult maths problems, someone has probably figured out how to do it so you don't have to work from scratch, and there are plenty of good resources online to learn the harder stuff. You'll also naturally develop your math skills as you progress as a programmer.I will now offer rambling unsolicited advice on learning math based on my own experience. I believe many people that believe they are bad at math are encountering two related problems that make it difficult to identify or articulate why learning math is harder for them relative to others. The first is missing prerequisite knowledge, the second is study methods that do not work or are inappropriate for them. The exception is for some cases where neurodevelopment and learning disabilities create hard limits, however in many cases these can be managed by adjusting your study methods (as was the case for me, as I have ADHD and dyspraxia).Learning math and learning to program are very similar in that there are foundational concepts/skills you need to learn or develop in a particular order before you can learn more advanced content. When I got to university I had a lot of gaps in my knowledge; elementary stuff that compounded from my early education through to high school (which I ended up dropping out of). This conceptual debt made it harder to progress over time, while others only had to learn one new concept to solve a problem, I might need 5 or 6, which snowballs very quickly. This also made the traditional lecture -> tutorial -> homework learning pipeline ineffective because it assumes you have certain prerequisite knowledge and they cant/won't help you identify specific concepts needed to catch up.I found it much easier to learn at home following youtube videos (I highly recommend organic chemistry tutor), khan academy lessons, resources on the r/learnmath mega thread, or good textbooks with clear progression and references to related previous topics. These formats are easy to pause if something is too advanced, giving you the opportunity to go learn prerequisites as you need, before returning to the original problem. To practice I would follow videos of worked examples, print 50-100 problems to work through, then mark my own answers to find if/where I was going wrong. I'd also return to reattempt packets of questions later. Now I have the ability to not only deal with difficult math problems day to day, but when I can't I have learned how to learn to solve things. Good luck, and apologies for the wall of text!TLDR; Don't worry. You probably aren't bad at math, missing prerequisite knowledge and/or study methods that don't work for you might be falsely giving you that impression.",

That said, it's one of the more primitive options. If you feel another language has something more to offer you, that's your call.

Programming really doesn't require math. A mathematician will say it's all math, but that's their problem. Programming requires a way of thinking and, amusingly, some folks who are very good at math kind of suck at it. I hate seeing folks with math frustration allow that to gatekeep their possible programming glory.I got a minor in computer science, where the only higher math course required was calculus 1. I took it twice, passed the second time. I also tutored people in programming. One student, a science major, had her 4.0 in jeopardy because of a basic programming class she thought would be easy. Another student I helped out was my former calc professor, trying to learn programming.Being science or math oriented doesn't equate to programming success. Some of the worst code I've ever seen comes from engineers; folks who know and use far more math than most mortals.I mayn't be great at math, but I can program and have done it professionally for decades. And, so can you. Good luck.",

Our team have seen much better results and project velocity in training engineers up in software development than we have in trying to teach software developers about the AEC space. All your current experience plus a reasonable amount of software development knowledge should open up some exciting doors.My second observation that you are more than welcome to ignore is that, based on your comment at least, you might be at risk of spreading yourself quite thin. Python alone is going to open up hundreds of rabbit holes you can dive into, web development is fantastic to have an understanding of especially if you want to hook your python scripts up to services or APIs but again is a bit of a behemoth, and ethical hacking is of course a huge field in itself.I'm not trying to dissuade you from any of it, it sounds like you find loads of it interesting which is fantastic, but focusing on one at a time to a reasonable depth and making sure to cover your fundamentals would be my advice. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is a great course / website / book if you want to start seeing some results early on. LLMs can be great personal tutors too if you're happy to be patient with them when they lose the plot, but they're pretty double edged in that they will also rob you of learning opportunities if you lean on them too heavily.Hope some of that helps!",

Inheritance promotes this naturally, composition can as well through factory methods if designed well. So, assuming the calling code doesn't know or need to know the difference, we can look at the tradeoffs in the interface implementation.It is not clear to me how composition supports sharing of common behavior. It seems like it would require complex rules for the \"base\" class to execute or skip common behavior based on instructions from the \"derived\" class. This adds complexity to the delegation mechanism and reduces flexibility. In this simple C++ example, `derived::foo()` has flexibility to add to or completely replace `base::foo()`. It also has access to shared behavior in `base::bar()` at any time. I am not sure how this flexibility can be supported with composition - would love to learn more about that.Furthermore, this inherent flexibility of inheritance supports unique implementation requirements. I believe with composition that must be designed into the equivalent \"base\" class from the start. It is impossible to think of all the odd requirements clients may have in the future. class base { public: virtual void foo(); protected: void bar(); }; class derived : public base { public: virtual void foo() override { // derived::foo() can choose to add to, or entirely replace base::foo() // derived also has access to base::bar() at any time. } };In the end, it is best to avoid \"this or that\" thinking. Both composition and inheritance are tools available to be used when they make most sense. I get the idea there are a few problems with inheritance from people using it incorrectly and they look for ways to not use it all, even if it means bending over backwards.",

Because I used to have the same questions when starting out years ago.Dicts and classes are different, but both can be made to do similar things (ie composing objects from scalar types).The difference is that, in most languages, classes provide neat abstraction features, like inheritance and methods, and greater control about how you can use it.Classes can be defined, shaped, and optimized however you like, while dictionaries will just be dictionaries which is optimized for doing 1 thing that is O(1) access time with acceptable storage for the key space.On optimizations, let’s say you’re modeling a square rectangles. With class, you can just define it as having 2 fields like this{ width: int, height: int }Every instance of this rectangle object will cost you 2 ints of memory space. If the int is 64 bit, then your rectangle is just 8+8=16 bytes each, and 10 rectangles will cost you 160 bytes.If you instead wish to use a hash map/dictionary to represent the rectangle with int width and height, that dictionary is probably using much more space than just 2 ints because how hash maps are implemented. If you have multiple such rectangles, it’ll waste more space pretty quickly due to having to initialize mostly empty map to store 2 values. Every insert incur further work as the program needs to hash and potentially resize the haystack or change hash function to fit more keys.Another thing to think about is a dictionary is just a hash map, so its access time is slower than just field access (it has to compute the hash value of the key, whereas with class, the location of the field value within the object is already known).Oh and another thing is with dict/map, you don’t know if you’re gonna have a value at that key unless, you know, you access it. This happens at runtime. With classes, it’s a compile error if you’re accessing the field that does not exist.Last thing is maintainability and DX - with maps, if you decide to change the “key” you’ve been using pervasively like class fields, you’re gonna have to change all occurrences of those string keys. Whereas with classes, your LSP might support renaming that field with just a press on F2. This is very useful when the codebase is huge.Use maps to store values when each key is considered sibling or equivalent to each other, e.g. mapping post codes to region names. Think of it like dynamic lists/arrays, but with key access instead of index access.Use classes to encapsulate more complex objects that you want to extend with methods and your own initialization rules, etc.I’m sure you’ll get it the more complex your program becomes.",

Languages that impose strong typing can't usually get away this kind of thing.> for most cases where you need a data-holding object, do you just use a class?This is based on context. There are a few tuple syntax options. There is also a dynamic type which is pretty close to duck typing. Your basic typed options are struct, class and record.

To the point that some people want the flexibility of dynamic programming but will actually go to the effort of invoking the Rosslyn code generator to verify property names at compile time to get the benefits of both worlds. Like if you’re consuming a json file in a data dictionary you can use this feature to compile time verify property names and so forth.

        "body": "So I think you are misinterpreting what a class is; a class is a language-based concept that allows you to create custom data structures that also have behavior (or member functions) attached to it. This allows you to make ANY data structure that you want that follows the rules of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Classes allow a language to be called object oriented, since in object oriented programming, the focus is on creating more and more of these data structures which when declared in code are called objects, hence object oriented programming.A dictionary is a data structure. So you can for instance create your own dictionary class implementation, though I’m sure one exists in the C# STL. So two completely different things essentially; a class/object is a programmer-implemented data structure with associated behavior(s) attached which follows the 4 laws of Object Oriented Programming, and a dictionary is a data structure that if you really wanted to you could implement that.As for your second question, explicit type declarations are very important in the programming world because they essentially allow one to know at all times a general idea of how many bytes/chunks of memory a variable is taking up, as well as help with avoiding implicit type conversions which can cause a lot of issues. You won’t see this come up much as a beginner but the second you start working on anything that’s a bit complex, you will see why this is a big deal. This was something that I struggled with when I started in JavaScript, as the dynamically interpreted types would lead to really odd behavior at unexpected times. This becomes more apparent the further you get towards the hardware; python is built upon a great deal of layers to emulate natural language to its best ability, whereas in C/assembly you are dealing with extremely explicit operations that having a byte offset could cause the entire program/system to crash. To give even more explicit control for this reason, you will later see C/C++ users will use even more strict types like uint_32 and long long or even stranger looking types to someone who has never used lower level programming languages. Also, tbh, it just helps with readability, being able to know exactly what each type is defined as.As far as running a script, anything dealing with Windows is gonna be a pain in the ass (I’m an arch Linux user if u can’t tell by my windows cynicism) but it’s what u gotta do since C# is .NET. But essentially all the stuff u did in VS is just for programmer ease of mind, but really thats just an automation tool. Hell if you want to just open up a terminal and run a script real fast all you gotta do is type dotnet run [name of program].cs And it will run it. VS generates a ton of metadata files to help with the building process which is why it’s a pain in the butt to set up but once you do it will make it a little faster.Anyways do you have any other questions? I hope I explained well, I use a great deal of Java but I’m mostly a C/C++ developer so much different domain but still same concepts",

Why don’t we put everything in 1 file or 1 folder and have automatic access to code written in other files?TLDR: it’s for organizing large codebase. We can separate different concerns with namespaces.If you have organized folders for other computer files/works, why not source code?You probably don’t feel the need to modularize your code into modules/namespaces because your program is not yet complex enough.Imagine if we work at Google, with millions of lines of code. And now you want to name something specific to some implementation, maybe you want to implement search result for a TV. There’s a very high chance the name “SearchResult” is probably used somewhere in there. Without namespaces, we must come up with new names every time we want something different, like “SearchResultMobile”, “SearchResultMobileWeb”, “SearchResultTV”, and so onWith namespaces, each names or symbols are confined to only have meaning in its namespace, so you can have mobile.SearchResult, mobile_web.SearchResult, and tv.SearchResult instead. All code relating to TV implementation will live in the namespace “tv”, not cluttering other namespaces.Namespaces help separate concerns, and the “import” part is explicit - you have to define wht and where you want to bring symbols outside of our namespace (eg folder, in Go) into scope, to avoid you running/compiling code accidentally (which might be malicious or just bugs).My example might not be good, but at least it demonstrates the point.My tips: Whenever you are asking why programmers do stuff the way they do, imagine you have to work with big ass codebase (100k LoC++) with incompetent coworkers, and maintain that code for years, then you’ll understand why.",

You should probably start there.That being said, about programming itself: I think the first step is to really understand why you want to program. Is it because it fits the idea of a \"better you\"? Do you want it to be your profession? Do you want to impress people? Do you need tools to make your life easier? You need to spend time thinking about that, otherwise you will program for a whole lot of bad reasons. And programming is probably one of the less gratifying crafts for people who do it for bad reasons, because you're inside, on a chair, you encounter a lot of problems, you create a lot of complexity; it can easily make you feel like a fraud, dumb, and make you realize the human brain is very ill-equipped when it comes to computing. In a way, that can be depressing.Once you understand your reasons and don't lie to yourself, I really think you should understand your learning profile. Some people like the bottom up approach (like [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), [Build Your Own Lisp](https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/), things like that), other like high-level stuff. Some people like to study pure algorithms, others need to build tools. Some like \"boring languages\" (boring can be good) like Python, Go or Gleam, others need more exotic languages like Haskell, Clojure, etc. Some people like to read books linearly, others explore and start 10 projects in parallel. The point is to understand how you learn the best.Once you do, please pick preferably one technology (language) that fit your personality and let it be your main mode of expression for a while (probably years if you're serious). Don't rush. See [this page](https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html). Understand the language and the ecosystem. Become good at it. Mastery plays a strong role in pleasure and contribute to create that wholesome \"flow\" feeling.And please don't be too hard on yourself, don't seek perfection. Avoid burnout. We all need to have some unstructured fun sometimes. Kanban boards are good, but not very fun, especially if you just sit in front of them. Don't overthink or become fixated on \"protocols\"; just do stuff without producing artefacts - no notes, no plan, no Git repo; avoid paralysis. You can even delete your code afterwards, that's ok. The absence of metrics or artefacts doesn't mean there's no improvement. It's a bit like learning a foreign language: even if the only thing you do is speak with people, you will improve, sometimes way faster than people who use elaborate notes, methods and tools.",

As you've discovered, checking pixel-level collisions like this is a bit performance intensive.Most games don't check collisions this way. Instead, like \"You can't move through walls\" or \"If an enemy touches you, you die\" are determined by representing both the character and the object as simple shapes. Boxes and circles are the most popular (often the sides of the box are parallel to the coordinate axes which makes the math super simple). A \"capsule\" shape is also quite easy (it's just the union of a box and two circles). Triangles involve more math to program, but may be helpful if you want arbitrary rotation or more complicated shapes (any shape is approximately a polygon; any polygon can be broken into triangles).Often the hitbox really is, quite literally, a box!",

It’s overkill for many personal projects, but is the standard for enterprise software in my experience. I also just think it’s nice to have a server for the UI for a million reasons, even just to have things like environment variables without rebuilding. Even if you don’t want to hide away your true backend, server-side rendering and other server features that are UI-specific are still useful.",

You need to build things yea but you also need to monitor your weaknesses and practice.Start by learning a programming language and core software development concepts until you can build something. For this look at courses (free or paid) and also doing coding exercises like from [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/).Once you feel confident you can start to look at small projects you can build, aim for something you can build in 2-3 days which will require some core concepts or development pattern. This is practice, not designed to build things to release or for a portfolio. Repeat building more core understanding and building bigger projects.During this process try to step back and identify weak areas and focus on them.Key advice, don’t get hung up on remembering syntax and language specifics, that can be looked up while coding. But you do need to understand core concepts and patterns. Example: having to look up the syntax for a for loop is ok, not knowing when you need to use a for loop not ok.",

Look up Bob Tabor and go through his javascript course. It is as easy as it gets, but you won't be a developer when you're done. What it will do is instill concepts and maybe give you some confidence, because when you are done, you'll realize, Bob Tabor makes it look easy. But he's slow and methodical.2. Start on a free and easy platform like w3schools. They are constantly adding content and I have full access (got it on sale), so I can pretty much do anything, learn new skills as they are added, get certifications.3. Lookup roadmaps and game plan all this4. Eventually I think you need to consider paying to learn, on a platform or in college.5. You might look into Team TreehouseI have used Team Treehouse's platform and they have what's called tech degrees. Some companies have heard of them and people have gotten jobs after completing their curriculum. But it's no guarantee. Thing is, without something reputable on your resume, you won't get a job, so if you're learning for fun, great, if you're looking for a career, well, just go on indeed or elsehwhere and see how many jobs there are for inexperienced engineers and look at the requirements. Nearly all require a degree, and nearly all are using ATSs to scan resumes, so no degree means, resume is dragged to trash bin. Self-taught is alright, but you won't save yourself time, and you should think about paid school, just because that's the smart route. Employers trust Professors, not youtube instructors. I mean, it's okay to be home-schooled, but I'll tell ya, you may still be studying in 6 years on your own.So that's my recommendation for you. Have some goals. Lookup roadmaps. Game plan.Honestly, you should consider a different career, like delivering pizzas. Something that's less resourceful than building code. Dreams die when reality hits. None of this is easy. If you use Tabor and w3schools, maybe they instill the confidence for you to move onto harder learning, because that's beginning stuff, and you need to get into intermediate and advanced concepts and learn far more than HTML/CSS/JS to get a job (or to show anyone you're serious). My guess is, you'll give up like everyone else. But if you are driven and surprise us all, please check in with progress reports. Use all the doubters as your motivation.Remember, failure is not only an option, it's expected.",

The progression from basic pod issues to complex multi-failure scenarios sounds perfect for building real debugging skills. Most tutorials just show you the happy path. Quick tip: if you're planning to open-source this or share the repo, make sure to scrub any sensitive data from your commit history first. I've seen devs accidentally leak API keys or internal URLs when sharing learning projects. \\`git filter-branch\\` or BFG Repo-Cleaner are lifesavers for this. The retro terminal UI is a nice touch - makes debugging feel less intimidating. How long did the 50 levels take you to design? Coming up with realistic failure scenarios that actually teach something is harder than it looks.",

If you have trouble with this start really small. Put an input box on the page to enter a transaction. Try to get the transaction into the database. Try to display a transaction. Then start adding features one by one from there. I would do authentication later as I think it can be complicated to start with.",

You can set it up so that when you push a new change to github, a build will be started, you can set it up in such a way that new code changes can't be merged into your main branch UNLESS that build succeeds. You can write automated tests to test your code, and only merge into main if those pass. For a small project you might just think \"whatever\" but a big project this is very very useful.Log viewer looks fine - but path to log is hard coded in. What you should do is change it to take command line arguments, for the path and the different options it presents the user with.Look at some code that accepts and parses command line arguments - You want to use this mechanism if possible. Consider this: if you want that interactive aspect where it asks you to pick an option and then you pick one, you can still have that if you use command line args, but you'd wrap it in a shell script (or batch file on windows). You don't really want to restrict any tool you write to interactively ask the user for input, when all user input it requires can be given up front as command line args.",

Do this until you have Garrys Mod.Edit: to make this more specific, I recommend going one of the following routes, depending pn what you already know and what your end goal is.1. Low level stuff, like C++ with Allegro or SDL or SFML. Or Java/C# with no engine (this is how minecraft or factorio got made). This will really get your gears turning, but you will have to do everything yourself. You learn a lot, but slow progress.2. Unity (or Godot). Faster results, but a lot of complexity gets hidden away and you learn more about the specific engine and less about programming.3. Maybe something web based? I hear you can target webassembly with nearly anything nowadays, I'm sure you can make a roadmap from that.",

Now about the tips:-do not implement stuff until you fully understand the logic behind it. Its really hard to debug a physics engine if you dont know how the state is supposed to look at each step of the process. (If you have to make the calculations by hand for some test cases, then do it, its slow but it helps a lot with debugging)-get yourself the best way of debugging you can. Something that lets you visualize stuff like the vertices, lines, bodies, variables, etc. Do not debug by guessing whats happening.-start small, make you engine by breaking it down into its smallest parts and making sure each small part works and connects easily to the rest of the code (like legos). Using assertions helps but im not sure the general opinion on assertions.-dont be against looking at the industry standard solutions. For example, if you are dealing with colision detection, trying to make your own version instead of just looking up the already existing algorithms (aabb, gjk, sat) is most likely going to take you longer and give you a worst result. The algorithms that already exist where created by really smart people with a lot of math and programming knowledge and, unless your use case is really strange, its probably better than anything most people could come up with.Lastly, seriously, this is a humongous task, you should only make a physics engine if you either-find it fun-want to learn-your use case truly cant use any existing engine",

It’s up to you how much effort you’re willing to spend to get a certain level of results.As the other commenter says, having to pick how many colors you want before seeing the image can be a problem. A photo of a street fair and a charcoal portrait aren’t going to have the some complexity of palette. But if you accept that it has edge cases, and are fine with how it looks on a nice diverse set of test data, then _k_-means is probably a reasonable choice.Color space conversion is very wise. Straight lines in sRGB (the default color space in 95% of situations) are not, in general, perceptually uniform. The first image [here](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/color/perceptually-uniform-color-spaces/) is a nice illustration of that. There are a few computationally simple but roughly perceptually uniform colorspaces that make much better choices. The page I linked recommends HSLuv. Personally, I prefer [oklab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space); I’ve also heard good things about [Jzazbz](https://observablehq.com/@jrus/jzazbz), and there are a handful of others. All have their strengths and weaknesses. But almost anything will be better than sRGB for this purpose.Be cautious of color spaces that are just called HSV, LAB, etc., because both those terms are more like categories than specific spaces. The simpler ones are merely new coordinate systems for sRGB, which will not solve anything.",

They are also not designed with long-term maintainability in mind. Python does not support async, making it a poor choice for UI. They also scale terribly; every line of code will inevitably slow down the applicationUsing JS is a no-go if you intend to support mobile. WebView-based solutions like Tauri or Electron drains battery like a mf.NET is pretty much designed for exactly the kind of thing that you want to make; supported on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS and various others.I'd also recommend looking into [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/), as MAUI does not support Linux desktop (currently)Other reasonable alternatives would be Java, D, Rust or C++> Any pitfalls I should be aware of?Never use floating point to represent money Don't depend on libraries or frameworks where there's a big chance you might end up paying huge licensing fees some time in the future with no escape> Would you choose differently for a solo developer?No. The \"productivity\" of a developer is subjective and entirely reliant on how familiar the developer is in the language, rather than a language having some supposed inherent productivity benefit. Especially not when the alleged productivity is from dynamic typing which is just outright nonsenseI'm of the conviction that programming language matters a whole lot more than many people are willing to admit. Just picking something solely for the reason that it's familiar is poor reasoning for anything other than personal hobby projects that will never end up on someone elses computer. It's not subjective; languages makes different trade-offs, and specifically JS and Python trade off basically everything just to have a simple syntax which is not something that you want in a financial application or any long-term project where you expect a lot of changes and new feature requirementsI was involved in a buyout of a company where the code base was Python. They went bankrupt because their solution ended up costing way more money than they could possibly hope to make. Even just for the infrastructure. Each transaction has a set price, and if the cost per transaction is higher than what customers are willing to pay, then that's game over. A lot of companies go bankrupt this way, it's just not talked about because it's depressing",

People don't put PornHub on their LinkedIn. Their tech stack is impressive for the amount of traffic they get, and those skills are transferable to any other websites. So it's useful experience.It was a few years ago but someone told me that as part of your onboarding you were expected to watch porn at work. The reason was to desensitize you from feeling embarrassed because you will for sure see porn.",

One company we worked with had a NSFW mode on their site, so I usually worked with that toggled on whenever it was possible. Otherwise, browser extensions can also be useful to blur/black out images as-needed, and on staging sites where we did a lot of our dev work we wouldn't test with actual NSFW content, and instead use whatever bland imagery/videos we had on-hand. This actually works out better in most cases; If you're troubleshooting compression issues on UGC, it can be handy to test with specific images/videos so you can see differences in compression in a more controlled format.Now, when troubleshooting production problems? Yeah, sometimes you can't avoid seeing some.. Stuff, and even if whatever it is \\_is\\_ your kink, you're there to work, not jack off (especially if it's a production issue that's costing the business money).Given I primarily do front-end work, the hardest part for me can be focusing on the issues no matter what is being displayed front-end center.. Which has included some \\_disturbing\\_ (but perfectly legal - just things I am \\_not\\_ into) shit at times. Those are worse than the things I might enjoy were I off work; That's where having means to disable imagery is absolute crucial whenever possible.",

We had to dig deep into how to prevent the presence of these bots and taking down their posts and deleting everything in short notice before they'd shut down the whole forum. Unfortunately vBulletin didn't have many tools at the time to recognize these posts like modern online community sites do, so we had to implement this from scratch (with the help of a group of students from a local university one of the cofounders of the forum was tutoring their thesis)",

Other fellow CS graduates changed careers to blue collar jobs like plumbing, and they never got went back to a tech career. Best of the best CS grads got jobs though. It took until 2006 to feel normal. It started sucking in 2001.2008: barely felt anything, already a senior eng, and tech industry didn’t get impacted as bad as other industries like finance, except for entry level engineers. Felt normal by 2010.Now: this is the worst since dot com, jobs have dried up for all levels.Not going to sugar coat it: this feels much more like dot com bust than 2008. You’ll have to change careers if you need to now. When things recover, they’re going to hire new grads, not older grads who haven’t worked and been sidelined for years. My best advice is to take those super lowball offers from crappy companies, as the experience you’ll get will be much more valuable than the actual salary you’ll earn. Yeah, your career lifetime earnings will be impacted and behind people who graduated in the good times, but it beats leaving the industry altogether.",

I got fired from my first job for poor performance and had a new one lined up a month later. Interviews were a breeze compared to today. A simple phone screening, and a single 2-4 hour in person round. Maybe half the interviews I did involved some light whiteboarding.In 2006 I decided I wanted to live a different place and started interviewing for new opportunities. It was so easy to get offers. In March 2006 I had three offers to choose from after interviewing over a span of a couple months. I choose poorly and so in August I started interviewing again. And again, I ended up with three offers to choose from by the end of September.In 2008-2010, like 60% of developers at my company were laid off. I barely missed the cut because I got lucky and transferred to a strategic project just before my old team got decimated. But everyone I kept in touch with found a new development job within a few months at most.In 2018 I got laid off and had two job offers within a month.

        "body": "I dropped out of school in Jan 2000 as I was offered stock options for AutoDesk’s web start up. The first crash happened 2 months later. I’ve worked steadily since then in the industry. The **2000** one was wildly different because we didn’t communicate well on a global scale at that point. Prior to the crash, I heard stories of people making it rich in tech, but generally tech wasn’t all that well respected. The average person wasn’t using the internet for a ton. My out of college salary was 38k if I remember correctly. The prediction was the options I got would be worth 350k, which was more money than I’d ever dreamed of. (Spoiler: They were worth 0). The crash happened, the company failed, people were laid off. That part was similar to now. Everyone was just waiting for it to be their turn, comparing themselves to their peers. Fearful. I eventually took a job working for the government for 34k. Getting a job was hard. There was a fear that this internet thing was just a fad and we’d struggle to get pretty mediocre pay. Still, I wasn’t super nervous. I got into it for engineering and if all I did was write C++ Windows apps forever, that was fine at the time. For me, things started returning to normal in \\~2004 when my original company had been sold and asked me to come back for 63k / year. I took the job and worked there until 2012.By the **2006** crash I felt more like a mid level engineer. The *economy* felt bad, but in my corner of the world it felt like everyone knew tech was the future. Things were still optimistic for me. There were still layoff fears, but we didn’t really have any and my company was pretty stable. What feels different to me this time? It’s been an employees market for a long time and that’s changing. I know so many people who have made more than your average doctors do. Hell, I do and I’m a college dropout. It feels to me like this could be a huge realignment if it continues. How long do I think it will last? My personal, uneducated guess is that companies will shift back to wanting engineers. At some point they’ll realize the tools can multiply their productivity (Not replace it) and at that point they’ll want more people and produce more faster. I think this will come in the next 2-3 years likely? At the same time, I think some damage here has been done. You need a job more than it needs you and I think it could take a long time for that to shift back completely (If it ever does). I don’t actually thing we’ll see the boom at the level of \\~2018. Or at least I won’t. Maybe you will!In the early 2000s I saw a ton of people who got into software to “Get rich quickly”. They took an online course and called themselves web developers because they could “Save as HTML” in word. A lot of them shifted real estate agents or other jobs. I think we’ll see the bottom of the industry drop out like that again. What helped me survive? Uh. I’m a hard worker. Probably a bit of a boomer take (I’m Gen X), but I’ve always been very professional. I saw so much shit that I wouldn’t pull during the late 2010 boom era. Don’t get entitled. Don’t be a pain in your bosses butt. Entitled things: Complaining about a company offering only vegetarian food on certain days of the week.

I ended up with only 4 interviews:- Macromedia. They owned Flash and Dreamweaver which were leading internet software at that time. They were later acquired by Adobe. My interview was canceled before it was scheduled because they decided to stop all new grad hiring. - MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This was basically a defense contractor job. It didn’t work out because I wasn’t interviewed for a specific position. They did general screening. I got put in a database then never heard back. - Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Same story as with MIT Lincoln except it’s an atomic lab. - Hewlett-Packard, working in their printer division. I would have had to relocate to Boise. I turned this down even though I had no better offer since the work and location seemed too boring. I eventually got a part time job working for the university. This was supposed to convert to full time but the funding fell apart. The project was funded by tech companies who were cutting back. I ended up going to grad school instead. By the time I finished four years later in 2005 (with no PhD), the job market was somewhat better. It was not hot but more places were hiring. I got an offer to work in big tech on well known but old school software. It was pretty good for what I needed then. Salaries were way lower than now, especially when it came to stocks. I think my initial grant was like $5k over 4 years. Later, the job market improved A LOT. I got raises but eventually jumped to newer, better paying companies.The Great Recession in 2008 was very different. Tech was hit but it was short lived. Maybe a year? All my friends in other industries got laid off and the bad job market dragged on. In tech, mobile phones juiced a huge run up in software that roughly correlated with the rise of the iPhone once it had apps.",

I wasn't impacted, I don't really remember any friends or neighbors being impacted either. Maybe it was my location, but as bad as I heard it was supposed to be, I never saw it first hand. I'm not affected this time either, since I have my own company, but it definitely feels different and more serious, at least in this industry.

If you can accept and find a way to keep your leverage, learning, and identity separate, you'll be far better off. When you lose one of those things, like your job, it really helps if you don't spiral and remember you still have leverage, and keeping learning.The failure mode for some many people in this field is basically: job loss -> identity collapse -> loss of continued learning -> inability to frame leverage for new jobs -> out of field. They have everything they need to keep moving forward, but the ideal of accepting the chaos and moving incrementally through without the shield of formal employment is too much. You have the skills, you have the experience, you just adopt a resilient mentality. It's okay to take a break, and of course none of this is far, but also, no one is coming to rescue you.",

I hadn't had luck with my job search and needed the money. Did it hurt that they let me go at my most vulnerable health-wise? Absolutely. Did I suck it up and take the job and work there for 5 more years? Yup, and it was great for my career.",

He is killing team morale, and if his behavior continues to go unaddressed the good people on your team are going to start heading for the exits.Taking the management position puts you more in the line of fire, and TBH this is kind of the most un-fun situation you can walk into as a new manager, but it also gives you more control over how this goes down and *potentially* gives you an opportunity to get some great peer feedback from the other team members at performance review time if you effectively clean up this messy situation.It's up to you, and how much initiative you want to take. Taking the manager position under these conditions is definitely the higher risk, higher reward path. I think I would have a very honest discussion with your boss and tell them you might take the position, but you need to know the full context of what you're walking into before committing to it. That seems like a fair request to me. The comments that concern me most is the current manager saying things like \"this is a really delicate situation right now\". That *could* mean that they are just naturally conflict-avoidant and are (unrealistically) hoping that the kid will knock it off on his own (he won't). *Alternatively* it could mean that the manager knows something about the situation that you don't, and as a new manager walking in to deal with it I would want to know what I'm getting myself into.",

The idea that I can branch into different fields without necessarily having to start from ground 0 is appealing because I’m a type of person who likes the idea of moving around cities and trying new things.

I’ve always been skilled with coding but knew I needed to put in extra work to learn more tools and languages, as well as come up with impactful projects to have on my resume. I thought a lot about it and realized i didnt want to do the upskilling work necessary to be appealing in the tech job market— this led me to realize that the industry work in general may not be for me. So as a CS major— be very introspective about whether you are willing to do the work you’ll need to do to get internships and jobs rn. Even if the job market gets better, it will still be just as competitive in my opinion— from here on out just the degree won’t be nearly enough. Ask yourself if you’re afraid of doing the extra work because you’re doubting yourself *or* if it genuinely just doesn’t interest you. It was the latter for me, so I switched. Lastly, look at any data your current college puts out about career outcomes, and look on Linkedin to see how people who graduated in CS from your college recently are performing. Talk to any upperclassmen you know about their struggles or successes in finding internships, because if you dont get an internship during college, the only thing thatll help you in the postgrad job search will be luck and an immense grind on applications and a project portfolio. Ask yourself if you enjoy CS enough to do that. A lot of people are! I was not.",

I answered with, “If I could remember the names of any of the patterns, I’d tell you.”They got a good laugh out of that. And they even offered me the job (though I ended up turning them down later.)

Not UML diagrams or factory patterns. I work at Prepfully and from what our ML coaches tell me, companies like Meta and Google focus heavily on ML system design (think designing a recommendation system end-to-end) rather than traditional software patterns.Leetcode is still important though, especially for the coding rounds.Your time is better spent on ML-specific design (feature stores, training pipelines, A/B testing frameworks) and leetcode. Maybe brush up on basic patterns just in case but don't go deep on Gang of Four stuff.",

Doesn't need to be a GoF, but extensible, maintainable code doesn't just organically come about from a language's built-in features. Over the last 10 years, I've worked with multiple codebases (at FAANG and out) that were really poor at extending to new use cases. Each of the teams had this code-level blind spot: they had business requirements, they had system-level designs, but at the code-level, it was coder's choice on structure and pattern.",

After I got a job and was in the field I had people knocking down my door trying to get me to work for them because the economy shifted to now loads of places needing workers and old guys started retiring with younger people not going into the field. I went into the trades when the job outlook looked good and graduated when it was a bad market, I went back to school for tech when the market was great and graduated when it took a shit. I got jobs in both cases but it took longer, you can’t predict what will happen in 2-4 years when you start school even if the market is good or improving",

Is a problem hard to solve? Then, imagine that you could have the data in the perfect optimal structure. How much easier does it become to solve the problem? Most often, it becomes at least 10 times easier, sometimes it becomes trivial. Now, can you somehow take the shitty data you have today and transform it into the optimal dream structure? Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. Sometimes, you can get half-way and that may turn out to be good enough to make an impossible problem merely hard.Switching to this frame of mind when faced with seemingly hard/impossible problems has saved my ass more times than I can count.

It has little to do with whether or not AI is useful; it’s clear that there is a market for access to LLMs (even if the people who want to pay for them are wrong about their usefulness, which I’m not saying they are or are not.). Think about previous bubbles: the dotcom bubble did not mean the internet was useless, for goodness sake, nor did the housing bubble mean uh, houses were useless. In both cases, it rather meant investors had made foolish decisions about where to put their money in a mad rush to profits driven by hype. It is pretty clear at this point that there similarly just is not a path to investors making their money back given how much investment has gone into this now. However, the thing about any bubble is there’s no telling what it will take to pop. It may go tomorrow, or it might take another few years. There’s no way to know, usually. In the case of the housing bubble, you could look at when the higher rates of crappy ARMs kicked in and make a pretty solid bet things would fall apart at that point (see The Big Short) but that was a special case.You can look at the AI buildout and see, “okay, we’re building data centers like there’s no tomorrow, Nvidia’s accounts receivable is ballooning [ie, they’re allowing companies to take out debt to pay them], we keep inventing more 2008-style debt instruments to build these data centers, OpenAI and Anthropic and Cursor are completely unprofitable” and you can see that this cannot go on. But the bubble will only pop when investors lose faith in a major way, and there’s not really any telling when that will happen. There are some signs it might be soon, but it won’t happen until it does.",

A long vacation may be what you need to at least stave off burnout for a little while longer while you do it.But burnout, contrary to popular belief, comes from a sense of a lack of control over one’s situation, not simply just the overwhelming workload you’re tasked with. In other words, a vacation will not save you on its own, no matter how awesome it is.My advice would be to get 1:1s with the senior engineers on your team (NOT anyone on the management track.. yet). They should be on your side. Explain the challenges you’re facing and whether they have any advice for you. Best case is they identify that you’re being overworked and will help you manage upward. If you’re a high performer with a boss that won’t look out for you, it’s common that they will just assign more and more work for you without taking into account your workload.

But our team is a little dysfunctional in the sense that it isn't a team and individuals are siloed on specific applications. As an example of a better arrangement, in my team's department we matrix developers onto various other projects across the organization. At best, only small subsets our department work on the same project at the same time, and there can be a lot of siloing.On the other hand, we do our best to cultivate a robust team culture of our own. We frequently share insights with one another (including at regular, roundtable department meetings), do all sorts of bonding activities, try to ensure our bench is at least 2-deep on any topic, and we have a manager who thinks strategically about how we develop our staff and which projects we engage with. Even when our junior staff are going off on their own, we ensure they're never truly alone.Anyway, I would encourage you to speak with your manager about your concerns and what you can do to ensure you are learning/growing/thriving, not getting burnt out, and so on. You need to be managing up, helping your manager better serve you. Meanwhile, as others have said, you should have earnest conversations with the senior engineers on your team.",

Burnout is a fickle beast. It might help just getting a new day-to-day, or it might make it worse due to pressure to perform in a new role. It ca go both ways.In my case, it helped, but there are no guarantees.> Did you feel more exposed during layoffs?

Just make sure that you're actually a part of that success and not leeching of it (looking at you middle management).In higher positions you also get to start initiatives you believe brings value, and that value can be measured in some way. But again, don't be the guy that just starts stuff just to boost their resume. Do something that the others will actually like (or at least have good support from the ones that will be affected).",

I made one switch after being burn out due to boredom and ended up in basically the corporate trash pile of non-performers that had managers who found it easier to move them to this new effort than to terminate them. I had an impossible situation of kicking something off with a bunch of people who had poor skills, poor follow through, and poor attitudes. I was heavily involved in terminating over 80% of the team, including my boss. All while trying (and obviously failing) to make forward progress and then playing catchup while onboarding the new team while dealing with an unhappy customer who just wanted results. I was very busy for a period with HR actions, customer engagements to appease an upset customer, serving the role of like 5 different positions, trying to come up with clever ways to meet impossible milestones, convincing company leadership that the project was completely screwed and we needed help, etc. I went from boring to extremely not boring. But one type of burn out to another. Having a mountain of work to get done that grows much faster than you burn it down, constantly pivoting to emergent tasks that had to be resolved immediately and had me up until 3am writing documents and building slides, dealing with nasty people on the regular… it really wears you out. I’d much rather have the burn out from boredom over that.",

This would mean more high level executive vision discussions and more delegation of execution & architecture details — more soothing for your fried brain, but comes with a learning curve.

It was a gamble that paid off after I got promoted, but it could have easily not panned out that way. Could have gotten a shit pay bump or no promo at all. Even after all this, Im still not sure if I made the right decision. I guess the takeaway is that problems with your employer may feel more immense if you had the opportunity to leave but didn’t.

That's worth... basically nothing over the course of a typical 9-5. Not exactly a CS MS, but a technical degree with some rigor nonetheless (like a CS MS).Generally speaking, degrees like EE, CS, CE, ME, etc. are all fungible. Nobody really cares which specific degree you received as long as you can pass the interview. As you get further in your career the fact that you have a degree becomes completely irrelevant, unless you need to check the box to meet requirements for a job. A CS degree might be a more natural fit for today's LC style interviews, but an EE major that takes a few electives can easily be on-par and any major that grinds LC problems will have a massive advantage.I've interviewed a large number of folks over the years. I can think of 3 personal projects out of well over 100 that were actually interesting to me. Most are obvious resume fluff and might as well just not exist. The 3 that were interesting were all related to hobbies that the individual had. For example, one was for scheduling and tracking autocross (I think? maybe some other race type) races. It was technically not very exciting in the least but demonstrated that the individual could identify business opportunities and then deliver value.",

I need to know how the work my team is doing will affect others. I often play devil’s advocate especially in planning meetings because honestly, a good QA engineer will know the most about how an application actually works. You do not work in isolation and you will always be communicating with other members of your team be it about bugs you find, clarity in acceptance criteria, making suggestions, offering a test strategy, etc. All of this holds true if you are focused on manual QA or automated QA. I feel that the current industry expectation is that a QA engineer should do both. In my last job, I was wholly focused on automation. It was nice but maybe too nice and too easy. In my current job, I have to do both plus work on various QA initiatives. I really don’t like the manual part but understanding test case writing, test planning and various manual techniques has just added to my skill set. I still advocate and do automated testing at every opportunity, though.",

On days where I didn't fell like writing yet another cover letter I'd convince myself to just find 3 job ads I liked and leave the tabs open, which would turn into starting the cover letter, and eventually into applying to all 3. Also, start using an AI assistant to help, like copy+pasting the role text into it and getting a score for your profile. Networking helps a lot, I suck at it so I can't help, but you should try to expand your Linkedin friends list. Speaking of Linkedin, forget Easy Apply, I haven't heard of a single person who got hired through it. A really good advice I found was, find Linkedin Easy Apply jobs and then apply through the company website. Good luck",

Picking up “slower” hobbies. For me specifically, the gateway drug into slower hobbies was painting. Having a hobby/skill that takes a long time to develop and see results from is what you need to get out of the lowest effort dopamine cycle of social media. You need to do something that delays your dopamine payoff for much longer than minutes to start training your brain to not expect it all the time.3. Diet and Exercise - this fits in the same category as #2 in that it’s a slower payoff activity, but I think it deserves its own mention because being able to physically see your progress is huge motivation and doing it just puts you mentally in a better space.",

I think .Net is great for small local companies/boring tech but if you really want to expand your earning potential, I'd start learning another language.

But you shouldn't constrain yourself to what you're being taught in school. It is a very specific discipline which requires a lot of self-initiative, curiosity, and ability to learn on your own. The upside of this is that you don't need to spend hours in library or school.

Sometimes, this is because the teacher does not clarify ambiguities because to them things are obvious. As a simple example, let's take variable assignments: x = 1 y = 3 y = x print x print yWhat would the output of this block of pseudo code be? Among students new to computer programming, a variety of answers are common:Some, intuit overwrite semantics and answer: 1 1Some, intuit swap semantics and answer: 3 1Some, intuit move semantics and answer: 0 1A good teacher will have a series of test questions designed to ferret out these mismatched mental models, and correct them. Once students have good mental models of how languages behave they can finally start learning.So I doubt that you are cooked. You probably just need a bit of guidance. If you're struggling with a particular concept, go talk to your teacher. Write out the different possible code snippets you're considering to achieve a particular task, and have him explain why they do or don't work.Have you tried sitting down, and just writing some simple code to see if you understand things. I would suggest using a language that offers a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) so that you can try things out interactively without getting bogged down. A google collab notebook, or a Jupyter notebook can be great for this.I got started writing software when I was in 4th grade on my Commodore 64. Started out just faffing around with loops to repeatedly print things like \"I am the greatest!\" on the screen. I played around with sorting algorithms. I created a program to display the Mandelbrot set (it took about 12 hours to calculate on the C64 when written in BASIC). I even learned to use raster-interrupts and bank-switching to create a double-resolution interlaced display (albeit at an eye-watering 30Hz).",

They said they didn’t expect me to finish all of them but I wanted to prove them wrong lol.Didn’t get to the job btw. They cited my lack of experience with a specific framework but said I was really good. What’s annoying is I told them in the phone screening “job looks like a good fit but I have no experience with this particular framework” lol",

If you're the oncall engineer, you may need to wake up and fix things if shit hits the fan, but it's supposed to be a rare occurrence. If it happens every few days, the system you're supporting sucks and needs some serious re-engineering with a focus on reliability.Normally, any system with 24 hours uptime will require some level of oncall support, but they're not that bad. It teaches you a lot about building systems that are reliable and easy to support.However, if a team's oncall rotation involves frequently waking up at night, that's a red flag.",

The chill rotations I've had you'd maybe get one off hours page every six months or so, maybe.It's more of a mixed bag for the rotations I don't like, but when I see corners being cut for deadlines and product managers being okay with that I get real nervous. I had one rotation (also at Google) where I could expect to get a 2AM incident at least a few times that would take hours to address, and I held the pager every other month. It was hell. I burned out so fast.On call bonuses were normalized at Google, I wish that was more industry standard. We essentially made half pay for the 16 off-hours on-call time (double pay for two weeks). The whole team was on the rotation, so everybody understood the responsibilities and how to prevent incidents. It was awesome.",

Worst case was a week after joining a new team, hadn't even gone through onboarding yet lol. The FAANG was much better. Engineering had a lot of power in determining what's actually important. So I got a lot of tickets, but they didn't have to be settled as soon as I got them. I had 2 instances of staying up overnight, and both times multiple engineers across my organization worked on the issue since it touched all of our systems.In both instances, I was expected to be near a computer or phone.

I don’t mean general thinking, but I’ve seen juniors get frustrated not understanding requirements and sit there and think it’s like school where the assignment is what it is. Also every day I get handed things that aren’t outright wrong but don’t quite make sense and we work it out. Asking questions helps to resolve those things. Part of being a developer is actually validating requirements and things you’ve been assigned. It’s an ongoing dialog. You got through a CS program, you’re smart enough to figure it all out but be proud of your work but also humble and you’ll be a better developer for it. It took me 6 months to get okay at asking for help. I was used to never needing assistance in school. I never got any help from tutoring or anything in computer science classes bc it always clicked and was easy for me. I had this weird sense of pride about that. I did good work my first 6 months like that but definitely spun my wheels a bit and could have done better had I just embraced collaborating with folks. Now if I don’t understand it after spending a few minutes looking stuff up, I ask for another set of eyes or to talk something out. I’d say I probably help out other people 10x more than I get help but I don’t have any pride about it I just like checking in on folks",

So jumping over that hurdle where asking questions isn’t a form of “oh, so you weren’t paying attention?” to “yea, let’s tackle this together this is pretty tricky.” would be a slight adjustment for me. I had one class where the dude worked at Netflix and it was during covid and they sent him home to work. He ended up moving right after, to my college town. He was still working at Netflix, but then taught our DSA class as well. Some days we wouldn’t have class cause he’d have to fly out to California. Anyways, that was my best class by far, we did SCRUM every time we met, everyone solved the leetcode style homework projects together, we had class assignments that were a bit harder and the whole class worked together. It was really fun.",

        "body": "Yea, I enjoyed c++ game development for a while. Completely self taught myself graphics programming through The Cherno, LearnOpenGL, and Game Engine Architecture Volume 3, since my college classes did not really cover it in particular. Made the switch because I desperately needed something more fulfilling job wise than game dev, which was drying up way back in 2018 just about. Way before Ai and outsourcing has caught on. I enjoyed C++ so I did that. Then fast forward a bit more I dabbled in web dev a bit (did use Ai to initially learn, and figured it out in about a month), did that a bit longer but really did not like it. So, basically just learned I love working in C++. From there just continued building little c++ projects and am now actively working on my engine which is in a presentable state, but nowhere near complete (if it ever will be). Recently been diving into embedded for job opportunities, since even graphics development is a big challenge in my area. Been screwing around on my Nucleo board, and building circuits and what not. The job doesn't require embedded, but is definitely embedded oriented. So, I have a bunch of little nick nack projects in c++, my engine, and this sample embedded project just to show I am interested in embedded. At the end of the day, I have quite a bit to talk about in an interview. I bet they would maybe be surprised for someone to explain how they developed a fairly large project, made design decisions, and just know the full ins and outs of the project they built, especially from new grads. At least, that's just under the presumption that a lot of candidates may be going full fledge into Ai and not understand a lick of what they are doing. Regardless I feel as though I do fit the role, it is super duper entry level after all (they listed wanting someone with some form of knowledge in at least one out of every language under the sun basically), but was just concerned how fast they expect you to adapt to something more complex than you have ever worked on before. My engine is three projects, with about 100 files, but that's a drop compared to a companies code base with thousands just on one project.Edit: All of that just to say I am currently waiting to hear from them, though they are located near me in bumb-fuck nowhere. So, there may be a couple qualified candidates, but not many. On top of that, they have five roles open for the position, so just increases the odds.",

If you can then confusion generally into just solving technical problems, that’s a lot of our profession.

I will say it makes sense in class but the number one thing for me is if a problem waits till a meeting you waited too long. I’ve seen that a lot too. Status every day people bring up problems they had all day the day prior. One of the juniors on my project is like that so I check in on her most days to see how things are going and chitchat. I think some of it for folks is a sense of anxiety over performance, but there’s a saying that bad news doesn’t get better with time. Don’t understand something you’ve been looking at for an hour? You might annoy someone mildly but that’s just bc they are focused. Come in a meeting and say you struggled for 8 hours the day before to understand something that takes 5 minutes to figure out? That kinda thing happening often will completely ruin people’s opinion of you on a team. They’ll see you as unreliable and unprofessional. You won’t have problems with this I’m sure, I’m just tryina tell you what I think you have to be conscious about. Always remember that your whole team is shipping together.

My most promising interview was at the start of December and they ended it by saying they loved my application but they weren't hiring...I don't know why they were even advertising then, but that was a downer before the holidays.>New budgets have been done for the year now so keep applying and work on some side projects in the mean time.

Or is it more involved (i.e. coding-wise, distributed systems, etc.)?It's a broad area. Anything related to infra supporting developing and running ML models is counted as ML infra. It's not all about MLOps. E.g., supporting models to run on a new type of accelerator (think about TPU, ASIC, ...), is also ML infra; code-designing software + hardware for faster network for ML workloads, ... \\> Could you explain what the day-to-day looks like? If you could also describe what a typical sprint (something like a new project task) looks like, that'd be great too.E.g., the compiler is supposed to take a model and compile it to hardware-specific code that should be able to run on a specific type of accelerator. But the model keeps crashing in the runtime --> the compiler didn't handle an edge case properly (this needs lots of efforts to repro) --> submit PR to patch the compiler --> re-compile and deploy the model.\\> a Master's/PhD necessary for this type of engineering? Personally, I am planning on attending my school's +1 Master's program, which (hopefully) will complement my knowledge/skills in this speciality.Not necessarily. But you need lots of self-learning while you work. It's unlikely a school program can cover what you need.\\> On a related note... Is this role entry-level friendly? I.e. is it something that will be extremely difficult to break into as a new grad? If so, what would the career progression look like to eventually end here?It's not very entry-level friendly. Lots of folks worked on adjacent areas (maybe non-ML) like databases, networks, compilers, before joining.\\> What type of courseload is most important? I'll be taking Distributed Systems next semester, Operating Systems in my senior year... It's admittedly quite \"late\" in my college career since I took a while trying to figure out what I wanted to do. These are recommendations that ChatGPT recommended to me but am seeking some further details from real experts and professionals.Highly dependent on what type of ML infra engineer you want to be. But generally fundamental courses like OS, compiler, database, DSA, can be very useful to help you self-learn more stuff along the way.AI can help you progress faster -- but you need to have the basics to understand what it is talking about as things can get abstract at first place.",

Make sure you’re getting through understanding the problems and the patterns of problems and the use cases for different data structures and algorithms. Also, write out the time/space complexity for your solution before checking it.After that, you can spend a little more time on the python syntax side.

Although I did get one phone interview from Capital One, where I talked to the recruiter but she told me that I would get rejected from the position since I didnt meet the baseline requirements of a 1.5 year minimum for the position. She gave me her number and told me to apply again in January since that is when I would meet the requirement. I am going to text her soon now, and apply to the position she tells me to apply to, but I am wondering on whether I should put this startup I had a big part in founding, and getting off the ground. Its only 3 months in and its steadily growing traction. I obviously don't get paid by it yet so need another full time job on top of it. Should i include it on my resume? I think I have done some cool things while working on it and it rounds out my skills well. My only concern is whether this would dissuade recruiters from selecting me for an interview since it may seem like I wouldn't be able to put the time commitment into the paying full time job. For the record, I've done a pretty good job on balancing both and still am able to perform well at my current job. Just concerned on whether this is a plus or a con to a recruiter. I would love some feedback on this and my resume overall. Thanks!resume: [https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu](https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu)",

IMO working with these tools will become just part of the job over time.As someone who took a deep tech / architectural track over the last 10 years, I think the product / marketing side is actually the better focus for the next 10 years.I would guess that something like 70% of the work done by humans in the last 10 years will be accessible to non-technical vibe coding folks like PMs and leads now. What used to be a PM + 5 engineers in the future might be 2 PMs vibe coding + 1 super deep engineer supporting with human effort. There will still be a need for hardcore deep tech people to do truly novel / hard things. But there will be so much opportunity for people who actually have product / business skills to create prototypes and find PMF before that point.For you as someone who doesn't currently have those deep skills, this is a fresh slate. On the tech side you would be competing against people like me who DID spend 10 years coming up the old way, hands on. Whereas on the product side, I think a lot of the engineers are hopeless and even demonstrating luddite behavior as they see their jobs threatened. That seems like the path of least resistance for you.It does depend on your nature a bit also. Personally I have always enjoyed both the product and engineering sides. I gravitated to the tech side because it was more valuable and the limiting factor. I very much feel that shifting now the other direction for a lot of types of software products.",

I would still require a visa to live in the US, but I've had multiple points in my life where I could have chosen to move to the US permanently. I chose to move to the UK.Dublin, Paris, and Berlin don't, imo, have a better tech scene. You get a lot more jobs and variety in London. The pay also doesn't compare and you usually have much more growth opportunities in London. I speak about Dublin from experience, I moved from there to London. The other two I've mostly seen from a distance and talking to friends. Berlin is probably the one that gets closest, but the truth is that FAANGs all have large tech offices in London, they don't all have one in Berlin. Add that to the language issue (I don't speak German) and it doesn't make much sense to move there.The US tech jobs are a much more interesting problem. The Bay Area and Seattle have objectively better tech scenes, higher salaries, and more variety in jobs. My problem with both of them (but especially the Bay) is that I do not enjoy or want to live in either of those places. I enjoy living in a city where I can walk places, where there's public transport, where there's a museum, culture, and arts scene, where it's easy to travel to other countries, and where not everything is tech.NYC would be a good option, and while the salaries aren't as good as the Bay, they're still likely better than London. I think it provides a good mix, and if I were to ever move to the US I would go there. I do still not like living in the US generally though. As I said, there's certain aspects of how European cities work that I enjoy, and to add to it, I enjoy getting plenty of days off to enjoy my free time and I feel like I have more breathing room while still finding interesting things to work for good pay. Between that and the fact that I've now established myself here and I have a friend group that I'm happy with and a flat I own, I'm unlikely to want to move.Edit: another issue with the US I forgot to mention, the immigration precarity has always been an issue for me with the country and to a degree still is. In the time I've moved to the UK, got permanent residency and citizenship, many of my friends in the US haven't been able to get permanent residency status. In that period I've not really had any prolonged periods where I can't visit family or leave the country for holidays, whereas I've had friends who weren't able to leave for **2 whole years**. Most visas you can get to move to the US can put you in that situation if you ever want to turn your status into a long-term one, and you're treated throughout a lot of the process as if you're somehow doing something wrong. It's not a situation I want to put myself in",

Besides those what is there? Dublin, Paris and Berlin are downgrades from London in terms of volume of opportunities. There’s no single city in Europe, Canada or Australia actually that I think has more opportunity than London. Lots of other places are better to live in imo for quality of life btw, but if we’re talking strictly about volume of job opportunities there aren’t as many. Dubai and Singapore also have less opportunities and then India/China aren’t going to work for vast majority because of low salaries and cultural differences. I’m of Indian origin and just got back from a trip to India, it’s a fine place to live if you have an online business making an income to sustain your life there, especially if you like sunshine, but to work there, it’s not going to work for people born and raised in the west and for those wages your lifestyle would be very poor.The reality right now is tech jobs are in a precarious position all around. Outside the US, London’s probably the best, but that’s not saying much with the changing landscape with AI and lack of VC investment in anything other than AI. It’s the most stressful time to be in tech imo with respect to knowing what’s happening I’ve ever seen in my 20 year career.",

It really is a different job altogether.I think many people think being promoted is 'the way' and that is what successful people do. This is just not true, there are many more ways. Staff+ roles are full of people who shouldn't be there, burning themselves out.",

Next thing I know I'm doing R&D work in AI systems and AI agents. Then I'm promoted to manager. After that, I did end up leaving industry to join the military and from there academia. I have quite a few friends in management positions, and I will say a lot of times it is about the politics of it not talent. Becomes friends with the current management. Friends promote friends.

I had an interview with Apple recently for an IC role, but it’s a step down from what I’m doing now. So I’m already conscious I’ve gone too far into leadership to be considered fully technical.",

I don’t feel like I’ve reached the level, where I want to stay and settle down yet. Plus I live in an expensive area and government salaries aren’t as competitive as private. It might be the case I could do a sideways move into private and double my salary. The other aspect is, and hard for me to admit, but I’m probably at the stage where I’m growing rusty unless I move into a purely technical role. My CV at the moment probably is more suited to leadership roles. So I’m kinda like, I need to choose a path and commit before I niche myself.",

We know that if we can’t design stuff, fix stuff, build stuff, invent stuff, etc, we got nada. Why equate people management to leadership? That is naive. It is a form of leadership not the definition of it. I’m a principal architect/computer scientist at one of the best companies in the world. Data science/data domain has a similar track as does electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, IT and so on. The view that the primary source of value is management is antiquated and for most companies just plain old wrong. Management is a very valuable role in a company but if you are encouraging everyone to become managers for pay, value, and recognition in many companies that is just by bad management and bad leadershipThat doesn’t mean there are zero companies for which a primarily management centric view of advancement makes sense, just with the rising role of ai, technology, global competition, and flatter organizations, self directing team, etc it is becoming less and less prevalent",
