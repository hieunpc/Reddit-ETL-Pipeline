There's simply so many more people with those skills today then there was 10-15 years ago.10-15 years ago, finding someone who could code was more difficult than today, so companies took whoever they could find and gave them a good salary to do a lot of tech work. As smart phones and social media and e-commerce were still relatively new and starting to boom, these companies were just getting off the ground and needed someone, anyone, who could code. Those folks wore many hats in their job.5 -7 years ago, as more people graduated college with CS degrees or did online bootcamps in hopes of getting these coding jobs, these companies found that they could be more selective in hiring. Okay, they found plenty of people who can code, but how many of them can code and interpret all this data we have? Thus the hiring direction narrows the scope of candidates.In the last 5 years, we again see so many people getting CS degrees, learning to code, bootcamps etc. that companies can again be even more selective in their hiring. Okay, they found plenty of candidates that can code, can interpret data, and have AWS experience, now can we narrow the list down to candidates that have specifically our industry experience? The answer to that is yes, companies can do that now; there's just so many candidates.If you've been in the workforce long enough, you'll start to notice trends. The key is identifying the next trend before it happens.",

Understand distributed computing and the Spark framework, so you can compute large datasets across many machines. Understand CICD with git and Jenkins. Understand the fundamentals of GenAI and know what it’s good at (summarizing and analyzing large text or logs / finding patterns in data points, deciding next steps in ambiguous situation, generating boilerplate code) and know what it’s not good at (it often will produce incorrect code and may hallucinate so always triple check its work, and does not need to be used to do things that are deterministic - I see a lot of overkill with GenAI which wastes money and time).

Other types of certs, like a python/sql/etc cert or a generic data engineering cert, or even a boot camp mean next to nothing. You should have a portfolio or be able to walk through some project details to demonstrate the higher level knowledge that would be covered by those certs. For me personally, I would pursue a cert as a means to learn something new and to be able to brag about it online afterwards:squinting_face_with_tongue: kinda kidding. As an example, I’m using Fabric for the first time and would consider the cert as a way to guide and test my learning. I’d put it on my resume to validate that I can use the platform. But if I’m learning something like data modeling, I will probably try to find a toy project to add to my portfolio instead of a cert. If I saw a candidate with a data modeling cert, they better be able to back it up with some hands on experience otherwise it’s meaningless by itself.",

Beyond just practicing SQL syntax, focus on these data engineering-specific concepts for Shopify:1.​Performance thinking: When you write queries during the assessment, always consider \"how would this perform on millions of rows?\" Shopify deals with massive scale. Use EXPLAIN plans, avoid SELECT *, and think about index usage.2. ​Data quality patterns: Practice SQL for data validation, deduplication (ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY), and identifying data anomalies. Real data engineering involves catching bad data before it breaks pipelines.3. ​Incremental processing: Since you mentioned building pipelines mostly in Python, practice SQL patterns for incremental loads—using timestamps, watermarks, and merge/upsert logic. Think \"how do I process only new/changed data efficiently?\"4.​Set-based thinking: Coming from Python, you might be used to loops. SQL is set-based. Practice writing queries that transform entire datasets at once rather than row-by-row logic.5. ​Real-world scenarios: Go beyond LeetCode. Practice queries like: ​Detecting duplicate orders ​Calculating running totals/moving averages ​Handling NULL values and edge cases ​Transforming nested/JSON data​For Shopify specifically: They care about how you communicate your approach. Talk through your thinking: \"I’m using a CTE here for readability\" or \"This JOIN might be slow, but we could index X…\"​Good luck!",

        "body": "I prefer to build streaming first. It's not about the speed for me. First, it's about control and localizing failure. To use your examples; If I break up the CSV putting each row in it's own message, process each row one at a time, and one fails, that row fails, not the whole CSV. That way I know exactly where the problem is and my users have access to the data that is not wrong while the issue with the failures gets handled. Slapping a CDC implementation gives me a stream of all the changes to the relational database not just the end state when the incremental job ran. If the load drastically increases the streaming system gives me a buffer without having to scale my workers unless the load sustains past my data latency requirements. I've seen incremental jobs like that lock up a worker using all the memory because it was suddenly getting back much more from querying the relational database than it had been designed to handle. It couldn't process anything until those workers got scaled up.Second, I think you pointed out something with the fact that you're doing streaming on one system and batch on another. You now effectively have two different types of systems you're maintaining. If you go Kappa architecture as opposed to Lambda architecture you only have one type of system and that simplifies your operational overhead. Even if streaming is harder to operate, you end up ahead. I've never personally found a streaming system more operationally difficult but people do. If you're only going to have one kind of system, I think it's easier to put a batch of work on a streaming system than to try and micro-batch your way to approximating a streaming system.Lastly, and this is more personal, I like to think of data pipelines in a functional programming or even unix shell scripting model. Mostly stateless operations with pipes in between. Streaming tooling seems to map to this mental model better for me.",

        "body": "Think of data stores being in 3 separate categories:1. Traditional SQL databases (RDBMS) - MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, etc.2. NoSQL - MongoDB, DynamoDB, Neo4J, etc.3. Warehouses and data lakes - Azure ADLS, Amazon S3, Redshift, etc.They all store data, but for different purposes. RDBMS systems are used for storing application data that gets read and updated by users all the time (think of user profiles, posts, comments to posts, orders, etc.), and these store data in relational row-based form under the hood, and have their own internal mechanisms for data processing related to application business logic, constraint and transaction enforcement (OLTP for application data).NoSQL systems also store application business data, they're preferred in the use cases where RDBMS' strict constraint, transaction, schema enforcement and strong consistency become a bottleneck - mainly, data partitioning. It's a big and complex topic to explain in one sentence, but generally speaking, NoSQL systems sacrifice those perks to some degree to achieve native and easy horizontal scalability across multiple servers in a cluster (don't confuse with read replicas), which is a tradeoff that's OK for many modern use cases.Warehouses and data lakes is where that application data later lands to from the main database(s), for the purposes of analytical workloads, BI, AI/ML (OLAP workloads). The reason data is placed in a different place for these workloads is because it needs to be organized differently under the hood to be efficiently queried for these purposes (keywords to look up - columnar data format, parquet, OLAP) - while application database needs to be fast for lots of small individual writes and reads per row, warehouses need to be very fast at batch querying, big scans and throughput. And Spark is a data processing tool, that does distributed processing for warehouses and data lakes, not for OLTP workloads. Also to keep in mind, if your data is not that big and you can process it on one server without any problem, you don't need Spark, a custom Python script using e.g. Pandas dataframes for transformations will do the job without the overhead of setting up a cluster.",

        "body": ">What's the motivation to still pursue this field ?As somebody who went into this field from a different field, if you work in IT/programming, don't suck at it, and work for a decent company, GOOD LORD is it a sweet deal.Life as a chemist:* There is no such thing as remote work. You are on-site 100% of the time. I used to have to commute 1.5 hours one way if it was a quick journey. Made me give up all of my hobbies post work. Standard working day was around 12 hours (wake up at 6, get home at around 6). Yeah, I could have moved closer but I'm glad I didn't because it meant I'd have moved to bum fuck nowhere for a job which ended my contract during the pandemic* Labs are often in shitty locations. Good luck if you want to live near a city and have a reasonable commute time. Didn't pack a lunch? Budget 20 minutes of your lunch time getting to and from somewhere to get something to eat* People think lab work is a refined art where people stand around in pristine labs and discuss how the universe works. In reality, the labs are freezing cold in winter, swelteringly hot in summer, and poorly maintained. Half of me isn't surprised because if there is an explosion/fire, it's not a huge amount of damage cost.* No windows can be quite common in buildings. Somewhere I used to work, during winter there were days I'd see no natural light (get in before sun rise, sun sets at around 4 pm)* It's also a lot more physical than people give credit for. Lifting large/heavy vessels into/out of your fume cupboard as well as transporting large quantities of materials isn't easy on your back as you get older* I worked in organic synthesis where if you don't have a PhD in chemistry, it's incredibly hard to not only break into the field but succeed because you're talking about the vast majority of people have a PhD, thus use it as a stick to beat you with (quite fairly, tbh). I do not have a PhD and was usually the only person in the lab who didn't have a PhD* The work environment is a lot less forgiving than tech. You can't google and hit the right answer easily. You really have to know what you are asking the internet. Even then, the answers are likely not widely published. People are a lot smarter on average and a lot less willing to accept bullshit answers* Salaries are not remotely comparable although you do get a much better pension. For reference, I used the chemical companies used to pretty much double your contributions. I have never seen that figure in ITLife as a DE:* Work from home is an option. If you have to turn up, at least your office is likely somewhere accessible and temperature controlled* A much lower barrier to entry. The idea you \"need\" a Masters degree is, in my opinion, complete bollocks. DE education requirements are not standardised across the industry whereas chemistry absolutely is. It's not possible to get into chemistry without a chemistry degree, although you can definitely get into data without a CS degree* Difficulty isn't anywhere near as close. If I ruin a reaction in the lab, good luck getting that shit back. I guess it's like dropping a DB without a back up, although it's much easier to back something up than it is to make an extra X amount of material in case, I don't know, you drop your flask on the floor, somebody knocks it over etc. You live in a world of glass so breakages are inevitable* General working is a lot easier. Synthesis of a product can take a long time. A long one is multiple days if not weeks. You can turn something around quickly and have almost unlimited tries at it in DE* Stakes being lower means it's not as stressful although it does mean you get a lot more bozos because people are less careful. The introduction of AI has massively exposed who is and isn't a fraud (anybody who struggles without AI or \"has to\" lie on their CV is absolutely a fraud)* Zero manual labour. Much much lower chances of dying - I used to make novel pharmaceutical compounds which were definitely biologically active although since it has never been made or tested before (publicly), nobody has any idea how toxic the compound is. So, it could either do nothing or murder you on the spot. Fun fact: I once made something which was over 30 times more potent than fentanyl* Salaries are way higher on average. After 2-3 years of being in DE, I earnt double what I did as my final salary as a chemist after around 10 years in the industrySo what I'm saying is life is relative. If you have only ever worked in tech, then yeah, the grass will always seem greener. As somebody coming in from the other way in, it's definitely greener within the IT industry.",

I get that it's a huge paradigm shift, and a lot of our careers are in danger at the moment. But (imo) AI is proving to be the ultimate floor-raiser so we as engineers are only shooting ourselves in the foot by not trying to integrate it as best as possible into our toolkit. AI should help us with all of our lower level tasks (boilerplate code, cursory analysis, test case writing). All of the other tasks that come from experience (sniffing out bad code, identifying bad architecture, optimization) will grow to be even more valuable.",

But as a general rule, the difference between any individual contributor (IC) role and a senior IC role is the demonstrable ability to basically manage yourself. Identify and execute projects that support company objectives, develop relationships within the business, that sort of thing. This is why: the next step from senior is often a lead or manager, so to go from junior to senior, you need to demonstrate capability, then when you’re a senior you’ll be refining your capability and starting to demonstrate that you can apply your skill to leading others, which gets you to the next place.And obviously that varies wildly from company to company :grinning_face_with_sweat:",

Once you know the basics of SQL/Python/basic Data Engineering fundamentals (CDC/Data Governance/OOP/Security/Statistic/DevOps/BI/etc), the questions one can be asked in this industry is so vast that practicing for it may be in vain. Esp in the high pressure screen share environment of difficult questions one might be asked. The longer you work at that job the more senior one can become. Avoid working in/applying to industries/for companies that intentionally use older technologies. By that I mean if they list older technologies in their job positing or the company inherently keeps themselves ancient like Intel/IBM/some pharmaceutical companies/some government jobs/etc. This approach may not be for everyone but I applied to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs in a year. Which, like reading 20 pages of a book a day, can be the simple consistency of a few jobs a day. And when my current job stopped challenging me enough during the pandemic I joined a start-up to challenge myself further. They just wanted SQL which is an easy requisite and through that process I learned Snowflake, and through that start-up/Snowflake experience I later got another job in Snowflake/GBQ/GCP, and through that job I later got a job in AWS/Databricks.I never practiced code tests for any job. Many jobs didn’t want me for many reasons outside my control and it still hurt on a deep personal level. Many jobs I didn’t want because the interviewer was rude/the company didn’t seem fun. But for the few jobs that worked out I have seen a bunch of different problems in a bunch of different contexts in a bunch of different languages in a bunch of different industries. Those things, and factors about one’s personality, seem to govern good Senior/Staff level positions. It’s more about the patterns one has seen in real scenario's and one’s temperament - that’s hard to train for.",

The rules don’t apply any more. Here’s what I would do (as a leader.. this is what I’m looking for). I don’t know if its right - only time will tell:-1 - get really good a defining and documenting for AI and business. How do I get an Agent to accelerate my work via context and not code. How do I show others the value I’m generating via acceleration of skills and effect using LLMs. Outcomes are all that count - 99% success but no value to business or customers doesn’t count as a win. 2 - the technology moats will come down. Oracle tech stack isn’t going to be a thing in 2 years. You’re a plumber of data and the stack/implementations matter less as the coast of replacing them is coming down at a huge rate. Tech debt suddenly has way lower interests rates. 3 - get good at big data again. Small stuff is gonna be usurped - that’s light work for a LLM. Big data is going to be hard because of cost and time. Start with YouTube - it’s a mess of influencers and hype men but there is some gold in there. Microsoft have a bunch of free GitHub learning on AI, ML, Big data on their repos. https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners is one. But they gave many. One thing to remember - the AI coding hype cycle has been around for 2 or so years of any value. You are still smarter than AI for sure. It can just type and think faster than you. So figure out how to make it your puppet, you will win. You WILL have an aha moment after 2-3 months and it will kick in. You will feel like you have a new superpower and feel like you have new energy. Every engineer I work with internally and externally has this moment if they break through the initial inertia - but it’s exhausting for those who have been grinding for years. You got this!",

The fundamentals are still the same, so once you are able to figure out what the parallels are between the old and new tools you'll be in good shape.Learning Python is highly recommended, with maybe Go or TypeScript as a backup language. Learning how to use Pandas and later PySpark will help too. Data pipelines are now typically coded by hand in a programming language, or else configured in a tool like DLT or Bruin (ingestion tools) along with other tools like DBT for transformation. Definitely not impossible to transition, but be aware that it's a very different world than ODI, DataSphere, Cognos, Talend, or Informatica.",

We've had a long hiring phase and let me tell you what I've seen from interviewing:\\- Most larger companies get \\~1000 CVs in a day. Most of them are trash tbf, but recrutiers won't take much time to scan your resume. Make sure it's easy to read. Make sure there is impressive stuff in there. Look at your CV and compare yourself with 1000 random people. Is there any way you can change something to make it better than your competitors?\\- THEN work on the technical details. You'll most likely have some of these 3 interviews: SQL/Python, Data Modeling, Data Architecture/System Design. If it's not a startup they'll most likely ask you concepts and not directly questions related to a platform like AWS. So understand frameworks: Orchestration, Deployment, Quality Testing, Monitoring etc. You can learn those directly with Airflow, dbt etc. or even build it by yourself in Python. Cool project to show btw.\\- At any seniority, people suck at SQL. At least for an Analytics Engineering role, this should be your best mastered skill. JOINs, GROUP BYs, Aggregations are the most basic skills. People failed so frequently on rolling averages, knowing when to use a window function and when not, how to filter by year or month, not knowing anything about how queries execute etc. I still can't believe I've rejected \\~70% in a simple SQL round. Here's your first spot to shine.\\- Be a cool person. If we had a laugh and I'm between reject and pass, you'll likely pass.\\- For Data Architecture questions, learn tradeoffs: Correctness vs Latency, Storage vs Compute, Reliability vs Velocity, Efficiency vs Capabilities, Cap Theorem etc. When to use what + example use cases.\\- For Data Modeling its the same answer: Ingestion Layer (Event Logs, Snapshots) -> Facts (out of events)/Dimensions (out of snapshots) -> Aggregations/Data Marts -> KPIs. Understand what happens in every step. This is a usual dbt workflow, learn it by just moving some messy tables to create a final cool KPI.\\- If you want to add a personal project: Have a URL, let me click it and let me be able to explore it and think \"cool\". I won't ever use your project. But having something I could use already would make you stand out by a lot because you prooved you can deploy stuff.",

In my current setup (airflow + spark sql) we built a framework for the boring 80% of ingestion. Basically ever source gets a config file that defines things like:* source location and fromat* expected schema and key fields* load mode (append vs merge)* basic column-level transforamtions* partitioning and retention rules* data quality checks such as nulls, uniqueness, etcAirflow just reads the metadata and generates the DAG tasks dynamically so adding a new table is as good as adding a new config and redeploy. That works actually, better than what I was expecting.Where these frameworks usually die is when people try to stretch them into solving the hard 20% - business logic, weird timestamps, broken upstream APIs, one-off edge cases,. At that point you are building a DSL inside YAML, and nobody wants to debug YAML on friday.The happy middle ground is metadtaa drives ingestion and standard bronze/silver handling. Anythign complex gets real python module with tests. Configs stay declarative so cannot do programming in configs (which is good).Funny enough, I’d love to open source what we built but cororate legal treats sharing code like i am smuggling beer.So yeah - do it as long as you are focusing on the repeatable 80% boring stuff. Good luck!",

If they all come from csv or txt, that makes it a lot more feasible. If it comes via API, well that is much more difficult to normalize as authentication, pagination rules, etc can be so different.

        "body": "Agreed with other comments that this comparison doesn't make much sense, but just to go into a little more detail as to why...BigQuery and Athena are both serverless cloud offerings. BigQuery abstracts away storage *and* compute. Athena abstracts away only compute, as you need to connect it to your object storage, but fundamentally, it's at least a little similar as an offering. You're not managing infrastructure with either of them, and they'll scale up parallelization to whatever level is necessary to ensure you get query results back in a reasonable amount of time. Because they're both built on serverless billing models, costs are very high on a query-by-query basis, but this can still be competitive in a real-world scenario if you have relatively low daily utilization.Compare that to DuckDB, where you're using dedicated hardware with an embedded, columnar database. It abstracts away nothing - you're providing the hardware for storage and the hardware for compute. This is radically different. It works well at small scales, and because you're managing everything, it's great for heavy utilization and is extremely cost-effective on a query-by-query basis. It's also not distributed at all. Once you scale up past what a single machine can handle, you have graduated from DuckDB and need to move to something that can distribute the workload and handle scale.Fundamentally, they're different tools solving different problems. So when you run a benchmark with 20 GB of data, you're using a very small scale of data that DuckDB is built for and which BigQuery/Athena are not. Because there's no downtime in benchmarking, you're also simulating what is effectively 100% utilization, the least favorable scenario for a serverless billing model. Of course DuckDB is going to end up looking good.The way to meaningfully compare them on cost, at least, if you were for some reason trying to decide between these different options, would be to look at a simulated full month of usage. The hardware you're running DuckDB on costs \\~$1500 for a month on EC2, or maybe \\~$7500 in up front hardware costs if you have it on-site. You'd need to run \\~1700 queries a day on BigQuery to get a similar monthly bill, or \\~13500 of the narrow queries on Athena. You could certainly cut your hardware costs for DuckDB by a lot for this workload, but also, are you running 13000 queries a day?",

Scaling concerns are real but manageable at current volume. We are considering moving out of R2 to dedicated storage servers with appropriate redundancy. This is decent amount of initial engineering effort that's not documented in the study.Your break-even math is useful context though. At €500/month fixed cost, the question becomes: can I deliver better latency than BQ/Athena while staying under their per-query pricing? For warm queries, the answer seems to be yes.",

At their core, both are infrastructure companies, and it’s incredibly difficult to pivot from building developer tools to selling verticalized business solutions.Their entire reputation is built on technical leadership. They won originally by outperforming legacy players. Think about how they effectively outmoded Redshift and Vertica by simply having a more modern architecture. But the most successful \"vertical\" companies aren't actually technology leaders. Nobody uses Salesforce, Adobe, Intuit, or Docusign because they have the best code. They use them because those companies understand specific business workflows better than anyone else.I'm skeptical that companies that big can change their product DNA that drastically. It is hard to move to selling finished houses when your entire culture is designed to build the world's best power tools. This reads like they are overly capitalized and their core businesses aren't growing fast enough to justify valuations. imo shareholder value will probably get destroyed as they chase revenue in spaces they don't understand deeply.",

Its less about job title at a certain point if you find the ebb and flow and can learn tools to do what the business needs. I did that for 2 years before I considered my self good enough to be called a professional and not a junior. Maybe you move faster than that. Also Migrating from an old system to a new system is a part of the cycle. Snowflake and Fabric are current generation cloud tech, so you are getting a free education on how to use them, take advantage of it!Ask yourself, How would you build this whole system? What does the whole system look like? Data engineering isn't just ETL, its a big part of it but the data modeling and being able to serve the overall system is the important part. Do you understand the whole system?Timeline to understand when to move is kind of irrelavent. Actually understanding and being able to apply those skills is when you make a move. You don't just set that to arbitrary 6/12/24 month timelines. When you gain the capability and understanding thats when you can think about moving to the next thing. There is always a next thing. Back when I started there was only MSQL 2000 and Crystal reports or SSRS. Now there are 50 different technologies to do the same with python , Java, or C#. So tools have gotten more sophisticated. Pick a path, learn that path, maybe use claude code/Code assistant of choice to help you build one, then read and understand how its built. Look up tutorials from youtube and compare that to your solution. Read the libraries and documentation that make it work. Then go from there. Build a whole program that takes in data to do something useful. Kaggle has a bunch of examples for this. The only way to get better is to build things.",

It's easy to say they're always blaming others but let's be real, without them the company would earn way less and you wouldn't have a job there. So let's make their work as easy as possible.\\- EVERYONE in their team should be aware of your current data infrastructure + its limitations. They should know your roadmap/sprint board/whatever, so they don't think you're sitting on your asses and do nothing. \\- If they have recurring issues, create a ticket, let them follow it. Whenever they try to blame, ask them to tell their lead to discuss with your data lead to prioritize it. If your lead declines, they won't annoy you because they know why they don't get it. \\- Block urgent ad-hoc requests. Every request has to be a ticket with a clear description + impact + what happens if they don't have it within the next . With the last question a lot of urgent things will not be urgent anymore. Most of the time it's just a blocker they want to get rid off asap. \\- Sometimes they actually don't have the data to do their jobs. Can you provide an interim solution by pulling raw data without implementing it into your data model? So they can run simple queries.Know your people, try to be seen as an overworked ally who wants to unblock them. Data Engineering in business teams is one of the most stakeholder-management intense jobs. The better you get in that, the less stressful your job will be",

Even though the cloud technology you use doesn't matter much to learn the concepts, it's still better to start with what you are interested in. \\- Zoom Camp is semi-structured and felt all over the place with some GitHub content, YouTube videos, past Cohort links, etc. For someone like me, it's very easy to deviate and lose interest. \\- Joe Reis's course is well structured with a lot of optional material and paired with the Fundamentals of Data Engineering as the course's textbook. The assignments follow a similar structure to other Andrew NG's courses. Not too tough to pass. But, still a lot to explore and learn. \\- ZoomCamp is free but uses a sponsored orchestrator. The deeplearning course uses Airflow, which is considered standard. Of course, there is Dagster and a few other tools gaining traction. So, this is not too significant either. \\- ZoomCamp is tweaked and updated every year. But the DeepLearning course stays the same. But since it's a very recent release, it still covers the most popular tools and concepts, such as Lakehouse architecture, dbt, text data processing for AIML workloads, etc. \\- ZoomCamp has a strict deadline to get the certificate. You will still achieve it if you start now. I assume the score weightage is mostly on the capstone project. For the Deep Learning one, you can keep paying and extending as long as needed.Overall, I tried to finish Zoomcamp multiple times and was distracted, but I am in the final module of the Deep Learning course.",

Some of the others are less so, but overall it's pretty solid. I'm half way through Joe Reis's Deeplearning and I'm torn on whether to finish it or not. A lot of the videos are reiterating a lot of content from his book (Fundamentals of Data Engineering). It goes over a lot of the soft skills that a good DE needs, but less so on the technical side. His class spends a lot of time within AWS and you do pick up some skills with it, so it's not too bad, but I don't feel like it was sticking with me after the class was done.Personally, do a few of the DataTalks zoomcamps - it has you writing and doing more than the other courses. And since the zoomcamps can occasionally miss some steps, it will force you to either interact with the other students or hone your research skills in order to make things work correctly.Lastly, you can go back through the DataTalks github and look at previous cohorts - they change up their tech stack some. One year used Airflow for their orchestration, the next used Dagster and they might be using another one now. Most orchestration tools are similar, so getting the basics done and then being familiar with other tools is a good thing.",

The main python asset imports those helpers and then executes the actual logic of batch processing the extraction and loading to our datalake (hive configured).For transformations, we have mostly moved away from python to sql since we can directly query external tables created from our hive datalake. But we still sometimes use python for the first layer where the data is weird file formats (like grib, netcdf, etc.) that require special processing - in such cases we read the files, convert to a dataframe, and then materialize it in our dwh. Our data platform's own built-in python materialization automatically handles incremental strategies and variable injections.There are also very rare cases where data needs to be processed in a way thats not possible with sql - for example decoding airport weather reports like metar/taf, which require special python libraries to decode.To answer your question about frameworks - we write functional code with very minimal object-oriented programming. For my team the rule of thumb is that a single python file/asset should contain all the logic tied to a single data entity/table/model. We never use notebooks (unless for quick local testing and adhoc stuff). In some cases, we extract different data from a single API endpoint, so for those cases we create a separate agent/helper to connect to the API and configure the parameters - this is the only case where we use a bit more oop.",

It’s just sloppy, bad practice from either citizen developers or backend developers who either don’t know how data is used on the front end, or who don’t understand architecture and are happy to spend all their time writing new views every time a user wants to see things at a different level of detail. It’s not “spending more time driving value for the business” vs “spending time battling tech”.It’s putting actual thought into your design to your solution can be scalable and flexible to maintain rather than brute forcing a solution that requires you to build another standalone view every time someone needs a new report.

We originally used abctl on a VM and that maxed out with a few db to db cdc connections. Now using it on k8 with a dedicated Postgres db and blob storage for logs. Performance is better but not much. It’s honestly been a very janky product. Random bugs, successful runs that silently failed, sporadic OOM errors when there is 64gb of memory available, and the list goes on. Shoot we are on azure and abctl would randomly crap out because of a missing AWS env var. It also didn’t integrate well with the rest of our open source stack - dagster, dbt, open metadataI don’t know if I could recommend it for anything other than db to db CDC syncs. It’s been problematic at best. We are in the process of migrating the workloads to dagster python using debezium.",

But even then, the Snowflake destination connector would be so slow to write, running into a bunch of timeout issues.Ultimately, we decided to keep it for lower volume connections e.g. consuming Zendesk data. Even then, we had to use very huge EC2 instances to still avoid issues (r8g.2xlarge).Ultimately, there aren't a lot of good free solutions that don't involve orchestrating a bunch of Python scripts.",

So it doesn’t do transactional bi-directional sync, where internal Ids generated on each endpoint, when a new record is created on an endpoint, don’t get messaged back to the other endpoint, after create, during the same sync job. This is why popular HubSpot connectors in the marketplace, like HubSpotSalesforce don’t make multiple passes to retrieve internal ids on newly created records, because they were already messaged back in the same transaction that created them. My recommended IpaaS vendors for performance are Boomi or MuleSoft, which do true transactional bi-directional sync w/ record level error handling and use triggered polling instead of schedules",

Another gotcha is that querying performance is very dependent on how you order the data (it’s one of the required configuration when building the table). For example if you order by ID, but then query by let’s say first name, performance hit would be be significant.I would say it’s a very good and cost effective engine, but even the cloud version, there are several “quirks” that you might stumble upon, compared to like snowflake which I would say works out of the box. You’ll extrapolate from this info what that means if you do self hosted.It’s a great, cost effective engine (i can go along way with TB of data with a single 16gb instance), but the skill bar is higher in terms of management.",

Its a great idea, I would definitely make a new collection.\\* I do plan on making it a more dataset exploration tool, for data scientists and others. \\*",

You can even retrieve the results for each node in the computation graph if they're still in the cache.

I would still invest heavily in some external observation process though.  When it comes to reproducing/rerunning a result that’s not in cache anymore that’s harder and you need to be extremely disciplined with your data and have it versioned properly everywhere and synchronized to your versioned code. I don’t usually bother with trying to do a full from scratch historical rerun like this. Usually long term storage of the main intermediate results that I care about and various scenarios ran at the time to capture future possibilities is good enough.",

As an example, I have worked for a few SaaS companies where the data collected was never viewed across clients and client insights only required a semantic layer for self service analytics.

The goal/requirements/project/product scope always dictate the finer details and necessaries to the modeling strategy imo. My first healthcare spot was extremely traditional in arch approach (dim_/ fact_ preceeding EVERY table in any schema) and honestly it limited the operation (analytics consulting). In that scope, we couldve benefitted from a bit more abstraction/generalization (in product offering stage, with a bit of a feel-out necessary at initial consult stage for new clients (i.e. if we felt their operation was broad enough in scope to benefit from such modeling early on, for a later down the line upgrade/full solution)). The other side of that scope (modeling) consideration was that we were working with similar agencies, but across states so usually encountered different underlying base data structures so that complicated things. (Slightly, i was able to develop a \"first launch/load\" python program that ripped and matched different categories/structs/data types to our main model for analytics into sisense). Long story short, depending on the application and requirements and potential (even longer term) scope, a strict dim/fact modeling is absolutely not always necessary. With that said, the principles of joined/normalized core aspects are still very critical if latency and compute are a determinant factor to the solution.",

In your free time you could try to copy the Foundry with Open Source tools to understand what is going on step by step: Ingestion -> Transformation -> Analytics -> BI Dashboards (+ Orchestration) etc. 2. A basic understanding is enough in 9/10 cases. Focus on getting sensationally good in what actually matters: PySpark, SQL, Transformation/Testing Frameworks (dbt), Deployments, Architecture Decisions etc. I you want to stay in consulting, ask your manager what they'd like to see for your certification. Afaik your company gets paid more if you have specific certs. Outside of consulting, nobody gives a shit about them. Work experience is the only thing that matters. Just get good without relying on AI.",

We are using polars and this means that for management tasks we have to use delta-rs, which is a package I like. But we tried Iceberg first, and hated pyiceberg package so much we decided on DeltaLake. Spark works with everything but is a truck of an engine. If you would be only processing gigabytes or low terabytes daily it's probably overkill. Stuff like AWS glue and similar are quite expensive for what they are (IMO)",

Instead, we want a read-only, normalized analytics DB that’s simple for an LLM to reason about with SQL.Our main Postgres DB is very OLTP-oriented (lots of JSONB), and cleaning that up in-place isn’t feasible right now. So this analytics DB would be periodically synced (batch/CDC), disposable, and used only by the LLM.On joins: we plan to pre-materialize join and window-heavy tables, so the LLM isn’t doing complex joins at query time.lmk your thoughts.",

Courses are an introduction to a topic. Not a complete solution. You do not do a course and become a complete programmer in the same way graduating with a medicine degree makes you ready to carry out complex, life threatening surgery.A common misconception is that all you need is a course. Personally, I did an online courses. I did a few actually. 6-8 months later, I got my first DE role with no experience whatsoever. Without any further detail, this makes getting into DE sound really fucking easy.What isn't included is all of the work outside of those courses. I was literally writing code, watching videos, reading blogs, writing stuff down, and generally thinking about programming for 60-70 hours per week every week for around 6 months. And when I say writing code, I wasn't following tutorials. I was googling the fuck out of the internet on how to try and do what I wanted to do. As you can tell, that's a lot more than 70-90 hours.On top of that, what's also not mentioned is my career before being in DE involved interpreting data on pretty much a daily basis. Sometimes, stuff which you can't even measure, test, or see. This makes working with data which travels between two places quite straightforward relative to somebody who hasn't had the same background as me.>I need to know so I know if I'm simply wasting my time. If they are nice additions that reflect skill, but at the end of the day, not enough on their own, and businesses really want a college degree.I'd be lying if I said a university degree doesn't make your life easier. Of course it does.That being said, you are only wasting your time if you think the course is \"enough\". There are lot of soft skills which you can't really measure and they are a lot more valuable than the degree itself. You have the massive benefit of not being time gated with what and how you learn which is balanced against not having a traditional degree.My recommendation is work very heavily on your soft skills. How you come across, how you analyse problems, present findings, and ultimately implement solutions will take you somewhere. How long it will take, I can't possibly say.",

I am sure recruiting practices and circumstances are vastly different.I assume recruiters are going to weed out non college grads unless you have something going for you.

For da ad hoc querying from api and then analyzing data in notebook, Pandas (or better these days to future proof yourself, Polars) is more likely to be a go to. It is a discreet analysis engine. It is great for flattening api json to tables quickly, it is modular so you can do step wise analysis, it is very quick to export from.But for proper oltp or olap based de pipeline dev with traceability and db centric design, sql will be your bread and butter much of the time. I have moved from da to de and have been using more and more duckdb as my sql engine lately. It is olap so it doesn't have schema registration reqs as ready to enforce, but it can lazy process parquet from s3 VERY efficiently without significant memory required. The thing about pandas is that all ops are in memory, which is fine if your dataset is less than your available system RAM, but when you work with larger data or cloud based flows (and associated costs) limiting memory dependency is an important optimization. Polars also can help with this because it has lazy loading ops.At this point for data collection i pull from api and collect as polars then pass to duck to write raw data as partitioned parquet. If I can do transformations in duck I do it all in duck directly querying the parquet. If there is something messy that I have difficulty doing in duck, I will do what I can with duck and then take it back to polars for lazy in memory vector ops. If I need to quickly inspect data I use pandas converted tables because I am more well versed on pandas. I also use pandas where iteration line by line is necessary (like api lookup). Ultimately I will typically then write processed flattened consumable data as partitioned parquet. Then depending on case I use duck to query for analysis myself, or I serve flattened data as csv somewhere that it can be consumed by end usage app like power bi.",

This could be through negotiating with the vendors or pricing out the infrastructure for self hosted platforms.I don’t think there is a product to be built to solve it. Even if you build it, it’s the trust that will be hard to gain. There’s already websites like G2 or research companies like Gartner and IDC that do this type of thing.",

That is, in a client-server environment where the client runs on a machine controlled by somebody other than you, you must always assume that the client can be compromised.That means the client can do whatever they want with everything in your static files and everything that's returned from every API endpoint. If there are particular kinds of data that only specific users should be able to read/write, then that **must** be carefully enforced on the backend.When you write any kind of frontend code, you're essentially sending it to users and asking them nicely to run it as-is. Ordinary users will do so (or rather, their browsers will). Attackers will ignore it and do whatever they want.(Corollary: if the user themselves is not malicious, but their client machine has been compromised by somebody else or by malware, then there isn't much you can do to protect them. The best you can do is protect yourself and other users from their attack.)",

For all of you who are learning, if you're ever using a service and that service gives you an api key, token, or other secret to use in calling it... it's time to learn proper practices in using secrets.Here is the OWASP cheat sheet for secrets management [Secrets Management - OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html) It might not be totally comprehensive, but it's a good start!Give it a read, if you're still confused about anything come back to this subreddit and ask a question.If you're the type to be writing tutorials or guides on how to use services that have api keys, please add warnings for your users. It's so easy for a new developer to be tempted to rip insecure code out and put it into production.

They caught on as a workaround to the inadequacies of languages like Java at the time, but that's about all they ever were. In functional style, they are mostly not applicable, and dynamic languages like Python have easier ways of doing things. OOP has always been a poor fit for the current multicore paradigm. It's still widely practiced due to historical inertia and only caught on in the first place due to lucky timing, not on much real merit. I read the Gang of Four book. It was interesting, but I rarely use them, or when I do it's because it falls out naturally, not because I had a named pattern memorized. Design patterns are mostly a waste of time.On the other hand, algorithms and data structures were much more important to learn about. If you're not doing systems programming, you mostly won't be implementing data structures yourself, but you still need to understand their performance characteristics (and what that even means) to use the library versions correctly.If you want to know about some other topics that will actually be useful, learn refactoring patterns and unit testing.",

You get really good at searching for code fragments. It can be anything; an error message, a UI string, something to get you to some file / line that is related to the bug.3. Call graphs. Once you find some relevant code, then you start branching out from it to find the exact components involved in your task. Hopefully your language has a strong type system so you can just right-click and \"find all callers\" (my biggest gripe about Ruby was that this never worked). Or else you use a debugger to break on that line and inspect the callstack while the code is running. I feel like these 3 things explain most of it. Give yourself time. It's a whole skill that takes time to learn.Oh wait, I forgot one more:4. Ask people. So many people are shy, or want to prove they can work independently. But this is so wrong.

In python, a variable can hold anything, and it can be updated to hold anything else.E.g.```pythona = \"hello\" # a is a stringa = 5 # now a is an int```Java has a static type system. Once a variables type is determined, it can't be changed. There's some flexibility with casting and umbrella types, but you can't fundamentally change something.```javaString a = \"hello\"; a = 5; // this won't even compile var b = \"hello\"; b = 5; // this won't compile either```Also read up on compiled vs scripting languages.Compiled languages often require you have to fix certain types of issues before you can run the code. Scripting languages tend to be more forgiving of certain issues, but can hide bugs that should have been caught sooner. It's quite easy to write python code that will blow up at runtime and your IDE won't tell you. It's also possible to do this in Java, but between the compiler and IDE tooling, it's harder to have this happen, and you likely have IDE warnings about it.",

Write everything that you want the program to do down. Specify it. Every feature, every function. First, in a coarse overview and then flesh out each feature/function in detail.This document is the base for your programming. Everything in there is what you need to do. Not more, not less. If you have an idea to extend it, *append* it to the document, but do not yet even think about implementing it. Get the basic functionality working first. All that you append is \"optional\".The key to everything is the FDS. The more time and consideration you spend on it, the better you plan, the easier it will become to implement.Vague specifications help nobody and lead only to the block you describe.> someone suggested tools that help you plan before coding. tried verdent and a few others.Dedicated tools are not necessary. A simple text editor, or a proper text processor (like Word, Libre/OpenOffice Write, Google Documents) are all you need to get started. Don't overthink the tooling here. The more specialized a tool is, the more time you have to spend *learning* it, the less you can focus on the actual *content*. Simpler is better in that case.> theres so many decisions before you write a single lineAnd this is exactly what is necessary. The better you plan, the better your outcome.*Code* is the unimportant part of programming. It's only a necessary evil that we need to tell the computer what we want it to do. The *planning*, the *decisions*, the *considerations* are what really count.*Code* can be implemented by every \"code monkey\", but *planning* is what makes a *software engineer/designer*.I can give a well prepared FDS to somebody who can write code, but doesn't understand anything about the type of software I want to make and they will be able to program it.Yet, there isn't a detailed FDS, even the best programmer will be completely lost.-----Where you actually start, at the database, at the main functionality, is a different matter and often preference.I like to start with the database so that I have my fundamental construct.Then, I work on the main entry point of the program - this is the very first actual *code* that I write - it's sort of the \"ice breaker\".The biggest hurdle is always the first line, the first few statements. After that, the flow becomes natural. Yet, of course, this requires experience, and it will get easier with gained experience.----As always with similar posts, some books to consider:+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V.

You already made a partial \"list\" in your post. And then implement these one by one. Does not matter if you make a UI first, a database first or a backend/API first. Then it is just however you test that the thing works, it differs. With database you have to use SQL queries. With API you have to use REST calls (unless you use something other besides REST). etc. The order does not matter in your case.Yes, there is a system design and architecture and such in real life projects and some things do have an order, but you are just figuring out how to implement a thing and how a stuff works. Do not consider how the things are done in the real life. Before you haven't made a working app.And yes, there are many decisions before you write a single line. The same way there are many decisions before you lay the first brick when building a house. You can't just lay bricks anywhere you want or however you want. Software development has a planning phase. But this is where the splitting it all into pieces and putting into a list comes in. Why I mentioned it in my first paragraph. Create a list of achievable micro-goals and start implementing these one by one. Your app is an \"app\" (e.g. a mobile app)? Cool. Pick some totally random tutorial for getting the most barebones mobile app up and running. If it is not an \"app\" as a mobile app but a web application then pick a simple \"Hello world\" web application tutorial, to get it to return \"Hello world\" when run. If your application has a graphical side then get whichever \"canvas\" type working first. And then just add features on that canvas.",

It should be detailed and specific enough that you could hand it to an experienced programmer and they’d have enough information to start implementing.I’d also suggest having a concept of an “MVP”, or “minimum viable product”. What’s the absolute minimum set of features that constitute a version of the idea that you’d be happy with? Start with that, add the rest of your ideas afterwards.I personally find that it’s easiest to start with something that I can actually see working, so for example in your budgeting app you can start with a page that displays your budget overview. Where does the budget information come from? Don’t worry about that yet, just add some hard-coded numbers. Once you’ve done that pick a number that you want to be “real” and build that, hooking it up to the UI. Now you have one real field and a bunch of fake ones. Pick another field to actually implement.

The other day I was coding a game and about halfway through I realised that the graphics library I was using was too slow for the game I was making. I had to swap to a different library and luckily (this time!) my code did not contain many assumptions about how the graphics work, so the swap was relatively pain free. **Write down sentences that are simple statements about the process you are trying to automate:** E.g.: * The app tells me how much money I have left. * I enter something I have bought.* I enter something I wish to buy.* What I have bought has a name and a price.You can think of these as questions you need to answer. If you were the budget planner for a large organisation, there would be questions people would continuously ask you. If you wrote those down and for every question you wrote down how come you know the answers, you would have the beginnings of a system.Real processes used by real people can tell you a lot about what your app must be able to handle. If you start with \"I would like a steak cooked by a Michelin level chef\" you are probably going to get there slower than if you start with \"what goes into a really good steak and who can tell me this?\"**Identify then build the core functionality first:**If you want to start a website that can handle a billion requests per second, start with the code the takes then dispatches the requests (load balancers). For a much quieter website you would probably tackle other tasks first.If you want to make a game in which you fly a space ship, fight pirates and trade goods, make sure the ship handles well (i.e. the interface in which the user spends 95% of their time). Figuring out what the core functionality is though can be the real brainteaser.If there are parts of your app that are a known quantity (i.e. others have already solved this bit and documented their solutions) and parts that are not, the latter might be a good candidate. What is your USP, what makes your app stand out from the others?Example: [how the video game Lemmings was designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5-lH3lZqrg) (YT, 4 mins).",

I've been assured by every exec ever that anyone can build apps with LLMs now... /sAssuming we're talking web applications, after I've got the spec/requirements down I've always liked to start with the data. So I will usually design database schemas to 3NF and write the DDL. I can then use this to bring up a database instance. Then I write a quick DML seeding script. Then I put together a server application in whatever language I've chosen. I've been around a while so I've written a good few auth/perm systems so I have code for that in JS/PHP which is usually what I'm using. Then I work on the back end API, adding things I need as I go (e.g. job queues, caching, etc.) Finally, I put the client together (personally my least favourite part, maybe why I do it last if it's me doing it). There's usually no reason you need to do back/front in any particular order and it's common to do them in parallel too (different teams etc.). I do think that starting with the data, which flows through the entire app, adds a certain clarity and certainty to things, but really anything goes if you don't mind lots of going back to revise.My \"plan\" is usually my thinking beforehand and any diagrams I've doodled, as we don't create formal design docs as part of our process. We gather requirements, write software, document the result. I will put effort into writing a technical design doc if I'm handing it off entirely though. I basically short-circuit the written spec part if I'm also the implementer.For a personal project, I think the answer is to just think, and make whatever notes/doodles you feel are necessary. How do you want to distribute/deliver it to users? What data is needed at what point? What interactions? How do you want interactions to go? How do you want it to look? Do you need common things that a framework would be able to provide? Etc.Things that you haven't considered will usually present themselves. Things you have considered will change. If you understand how everything works it all comes together as you work on it more, so my main advice is to be clear enough about what you want that you can start work, and then start writing code.",

It doesn't truly get the \"whys\" (though it may occasionally trick you into thinking it does). An LLM can never look at an existing codebase and properly analyze why certain decisions were made, it can never get to the heart of intentions, and it can never make truly creative decisions for itself. Presented a unique dilemma for which it has no model, any solution it came up with would be based purely on other solutions for other problems. It has no capacity for true creativity. Of course, even actual engineers can struggle with this (especially the most STEM-brained ones), but ultimately a human will have far more capacity for it than a machine.

        "body": ">\"A been studying on Free code academy and TOP but I fell like I'm not getting anywhere\"Based on that, you won't have career in programming. When you figure out your studies and you feel that the studying process is going well, then sure, you'll have a chance. Not right now.And even when you figure it out then you'll have an uphill battle ahead. Why a company should hire you over a Bachelor degree holder, a vocational school diploma holder, an ex-intern, a Junior developer changing a company, a desperate mid-level developer trying to find a job? How will you stand out?The current job market is difficult even for professional developers. And even more for fresh university graduates. People without a degree have little chance.So, you'll have two obstacles: figuring out the study process itself (as you are stuck right now) and figuring out why the company should hire YOU.My advice would be going for a degree. Like this you'll have a structured study plan made ready by people who know the industry. You'll have more options available. More doors opened for you. And you being 36 does not mean it is too late to go for a degree. I did a career change when I was 28-32. Got my degree when I was 32 and got hired then. Followed it up with Master degree studies as well. We had guys in their 30s studying with course mates 10 years younger than them. No issues what so ever. Some few were also in 40s.If, for some reason you are not going for a degree then you have to start building real life projects that will be taken into a real use either by you, your family and friends, or by somebody else. That will make you stand out. But if you make template tutorial \"projects\" that just sit in your Github and nobody will use these, then you'll have very little chance.",

I went in for a Bachelor's in computer science and am now on my final course of a Master’s degree in computer science.

Backend development: serversWhat makes python great is its community and the works they've produced. Some of the best libraries for data science are PyTorch, Pandas, numpy. For backend, you have django, fastapi. Learn languages via courses teaching about these fields. If you simply want to learn about python syntax then codecademy is a great place to start at. Get a basic grip on the language and move to its practical applications in the fields instead. For example, you can start with the iris dataset classification in data science. It'll yeach you about the basics of machine learning and about python programming. Using a library like scikit-learn will abstract away the algorithm and allow you to do plug and play approach. Data science is a much easier domain to start for since you can see its result right in your terminal or notebook.",

I spent so long doing boring tutorials and then quitting because I had no interest and the combo of boring work + difficult work made getting into the flow very difficult. So what I did was start a new project (it's a console-based resource-grinding game with some light story set in The Elder Scrolls universe) and starting very small with just some dialogue and choices. I set up a Trello board and broke all my tasks into \"main quests\" and \"side quests\" (things I'd like to do but are on the backburner) and broke them down into SUPER small pieces. That has given me nice dopamine hits when I get to check off those tasks as complete. It's also way more interesting to me because I love games, and this is something I actually look forward to playing myself when I get it into a more complete or at least MVP state.Also, (this may be controversial) using AI to talk through the issue or design I'm thinking off. Not ***ever*** using it to solve the problem or make me code, but rather \"I want to do X in my project, give me a word or two I can google to start my search\" so I have something specific to look up on Stack Overflow or the Ruby docs. That way when I get stuck I'm not just banging my head against the wall because I'm not even sure what to search, I have some breadcrumbs that get me started but I'm never actually relying on the AI to code for me or even give me the full answer.I work at a large tech company and those are the tips that a programmer friend gave me and I've been finding so much more success in the last few weeks than ever before :)",

It will return the entire website if you don't add that to your web headers.Here is code in [VB.net](http://VB.net) to process that data. Now to correctly process that data, it comes over the internet in UTF-8 but was originally encoded in ASCII 7bit. You will need to translate back to ASCI 7bit for the data to make sense. Every item with a :T is a text entry the hex numbers after the T is the length of text. This becomes important as there is no end of line at the end of the text and the next entry after is usually important to scraping data/files/video from that site.",

For instance, to understand how gates can make flip flops that can be used in shift registers, you really need to understand why \"shift registers\" are an important concept in binary mathematics, and to understand how a compiler converts high level language to assembly, you really need to understand both assembly AND abstract grammar and syntax - in other words, you need to understand both abstractions above and below the current thing you are trying to learn, as well as the abstract idea of the thing itself, all three of which requires knowledge of something else on all three levels!!Don't let that discourage you though - you should still be allowed to learn everything, but just don't fool yourself into thinking that there is a \"perfect\" order to learn them in, like go from the silicon to the CPU to machine code to assembly to compilers to higher level languages to abstract concepts - or indeed the other way around. Best suggestion is to start where you are, e.g. learn some Python, and work your way down, look at some assembly, then work your way up, towards more abstract programming concepts, data structures and whatnot, then back down again to another language, maybe C, and understand memory management, up again to understand garbage collecting and compilers, down again to understand addressing and registers in the CPU, and so on and on - not necessarily in this particular order, that was just a random example I made up on the spot.But take a look at \"**Code**\", and try to write programs in your chosen higher level language that handles binary conversion, and select topics based on your current interest.Also, if you are interested in the human history behind the computer, check out \"**The Innovators**: H*ow a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution*\" by Walter Isaacson.",

A paid,but arguably more complete alternative is the game Turing Complete (on steam)In both these games you start from a simple logical gate, meaning that two inputs, with either of them being true or false, result in a single true or false output. From there you learn how to use these to form more complex logic (like adding numbers, conditional logic, making memory etc.).Combining these elements together you will eventually build yourself a 8 bit computer. I believe that in the NAND Game you dont really do anything with it, but in Turing Complete you solve some simple problems with them. It also has a sandbox mode it which you can use your own creation to do your own things or take a look at community creations. I think both give you a good idea of what a computer in essence is. From there you could look into more of the hardware side of it with the 6502 computer playlist of the YouTube channel Ben Eater, or more from the software side by diving into how compilers work, data structures etc. For languages you are mostly looking at assembly and C.Looking into computer science degrees might also be an option, and im sure there are a lot of different textbooks on topics you might be interested in.However, be aware that all of this might not help you that much for becoming a programmer/developper. Also, you could go crazy trying to understand every single why and how if computer science. Pick a goal you would like to achieve, pick some topics that help you achieve that goal, but try to avoid to study everything at once. You will gain more from selectively learning some topics rather try to learn a bit of everything.",

Believe me when I say my brain does work in similar ways, and I understand why you are trying to create these abstractions, but be careful because they can be misleading.For example, in your model, a web application might be a bunch of separate \"flowcharts\" that share parts of their path. It really does depend what you are building.The problem of, \"how do people keep track of all these branching paths stretching out to infinity\". Well, I don't do that.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but in the real world, software can be *quite* complex. Yes, it doesn’t branch infinitely in a literal sense the way a fractal might, but there are almost always far too many twists and turns to keep in your head all at the same time. Most real programs are more like a circle than a straight path, and the only reason that thats even true is that we write them to work that way so that we have some chance at reasoning about them.The good news, though, is that you don’t need to keep it all in your head at the same time. Programming is a never ending exercise in abstraction. To do the work, you only need to worry about the one piece that you’re working on at any moment. If you’re writing a function that computes a value based on its parameters, you don’t care where those parameters came from. If you’re calling another function, you don’t need to worry about how it does what it does — you only care about *what* it does (and sometimes how long it takes). Considering (and especially depending on) things outside the function can even be a liability.I’m glad that you’re sticking with it! Just don’t get too disheartened when you start working on larger programs snd start to see a lot of complexity.

I believe in starting small and focusing on my goals. For example, I want the program to ask the user for two integers, sum them up, and print the result. I wrote the code and displayed the answer—that's it. Once the program meets my expectations, I'm satisfied.Most textbooks are straightforward, but I sometimes wonder what would happen if I input a character instead of an integer. I experiment and then learn about input validation with the help of GPT and jump learning by referring to the relevant chapters in my textbooks.",

If that sounds useful alongside your course, feel free to tweak it for your use case: [https://github.com/justin55afdfdsf5ds45f4ds5f45ds4/timealready.git](https://github.com/justin55afdfdsf5ds45f4ds5f45ds4/timealready.git)",

Use three variables to do this.Then add a third number. Oops - you will need to run through the list a second time, so use a loop.Keep going in little steps like that and the code will become more complex - but you will understand each step and what it's doing, and your knowledge will increase.Use functions (or methods) to separate out different functionality. Java is designed to be modular, so use it.Finally, practice practice practice!

Don't study a tutorial for how to process a series of values, learn how the \"foreach\" system works. etc. Learn the language features, learn how to use the different programs that process your code (version control, build system, editor, etc), and learn what the features allow you to do. Once you learn those things, then you can follow a tutorial and see how to use different libraries that allow you to apply what you've learned. You'll then know the language to know how to modify what you're presented to make it do the things you want it to do.Lastly, don't read how tos or tutorials first, read the documentation.

That said, if you did do changes to your code without these before, you can improve code quality without. I am saying this, because it can seem that you are not allowed to improve code quality before you learn about two or more different things. (But since unittest is build into the standard library, maybe give it a try and write some simple tests for the functions you change!)\\- \"but I’m worried that even then it will still feel messy\". Yes, it will still feel messy, but thats just the first step, that enables the next ones. Its a journey and while the goal \"tidy code\" can be helpful as motivation it can also be overwhelming. \\- Talking about \"proceeding in steps\": A simple technique that can help is identifying sections in code, lines that belong together. Give these sections a comment saying what the section does. Then try to pull out that section into a function. The function name now can take the task that the comment had: It tells what happens, without the need to reading the whole function. Try to make the function only rely on the parameters you pass to it instead of \"global state\" (also called a \"pure function\"). This makes the function easy to test and to understand. This might not always be easy, but at least check if its possible. \\- There are a lot of helpful texts there – [https://refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru) is a good online resource, Fowlers book \"Refactoring\" is also pretty helpful. Initially read them as inspiration, like browsing a cookbook, don't force yourself to use the methods immediately. Most likely, you will stumble upon a problem soon and be reminded of a section you have read. Then, find that section and give it a second read and try to follow its advice.",

Taking a big function and then making functions out of it often means that you're just switching between different functions, but have the same complexity. That's often actually worse.Breaking things down into \"input, process, output\" helps dramatically, especially if you can then extract the \"output\" to a separate method/object. If your big function makes a call to an API, does something with it, makes a call to another API, etc? Try to separate at those boundaries, or push things to the end. A useful pattern can be to gather up all of the changes you want in your function, and then apply them at the end.One strategy I've often used is to \"chop the tail\". What that means is finding the very last thing the function does, and then creating a new function at that point, taking all of the data it needs as parameters. You can then work through the function as a whole. This differs from the \"substep\" method because you can, when you make that final call, basically forget about what happened before that. If you call that last function with the right parameters, then the previous function was correct. That's also where things like mock objects come into play.",

Took 1 year to find first IT job, 2 years to find first dev job. I was in similar shoes and my advice is what i've done.>I started posting on Twitter and committing to GitHub, but obviously nobody is watching. I don’t know if I’m supposed to keep doing this until someone magically finds me or if I’m doing it wrong.Is networking just talking to people online? Is it internships? Is it Discord servers? LinkedIn? Meetups? Or is it just something people say for the sake of saying? Networking is getting out and talking to people, not shooting messages into the avoid and hoping someone looks at your social media and goes \"this kids a genius\", thats not networking.You need to find meetup groups in your area and start attending, meetup.com. This is a good way to get out there but with networking, you get out what you put in.If you just go, attend, and don't talk to anyone, no ones going to know who you are / what you are doing tech wise and what you're looking for. So if you aren't socially outgoing, start working on that.>I kind of feel like I wasted most of college procrastinating. Now I’m doing DSA and web dev, but its late-very late and I know it. Also I’m from a tier 3 college and people keep saying if you’re from a tier 3 college you basically HAVE to network or no one will even know you exist, so no one will give you a chance.I had similar experience, didn't do internships, didn't really hit my stride until my senior year of college when things started clicking for me and i felt like i was finally getting it. So the issue is jobs currently want experience / proof that you have some semblance that you know what you are doing. You're not going to like this but my suggestion to you is to work for free for a while.You can either keep shooting resume's into the void for months / a year plus on end hoping for the best or you can get the experience you need to set you apart from your peers at similar points in your career.Sure, you'll find the rare hiring manager that says \"i dont care about experience, i just want them to be curious\", in reality a lot of hiring managers are kind of dumb, don't know what they want, and just pray they don't hire an idiot and the best way to do that is to find someone that has proven experience.Assuming you can build / deploy an app (i tutored college students online and you'd be surprised at the number of students who could barely build something in their senior year much less know how to deploy it), I would start with chamber of commerce website for cities near you that you'd be willing to drive to if necessary. So call it a 25-50 mile radius.From there, look for non-profits and call up their volunteer coordinator and see if they have any needs / opportunities to build software / automate something that they don't have the money/expense to spend on. Off the shelf software / monthly subscription based software isn't as expensive as it was when i graduated these days so maybe they are more inclined to pay for services these days, but you'd be surprised the shoe string budgets some of these nonprofits operate on.Often times they are taking paper applications and manually retyping it back into a computer which wastes time. They setup temporary shelters and take intake on paper where if they had a laptop there, they'd cut that part out.Look at rec leagues in your area and see if any of these rec leagues have a need for software to manage teams/schedules/rosters. Some leagues barely have enough money to run the league itself much less any extras so they manage the league in spreadsheets. 1/2",

Well usually that's because they know how to charm people into getting what they want. Although some people use that maliciously it also works for your general life.How to do this? Well, join clubs.

Every one I've ever seen was at least a good intro.I wouldn't be too worried about being embarrassed in labs about beginner mistakes; that's what class is for. If you already knew C, the class wouldn't be helpful.Relative to other languages, it helps to understand C's memory model, because it's a lot closer to what actually happens under the hood in the computer and getting confused about it is the source of a lot of errors. So, in C, you have two places data is stored in memory: the stack and the heap. The stack is where any variables in your functions live. If you say `int number = 5;`, that puts a `5` on the stack (hey folks who actually know C: yes, I know about registers, keeping it simple to start with, yeah?). Generally, stuff on the stack lives there until the function returns, then *everything* on the stack for that function goes away. That's all the variables you declared in your function and everything passed into the function (all the stuff passed into a function, the function gets a copy of).The heap is where longer-lived stuff goes. You get a chunk of heap by going `int* pointer_to_number = malloc(sizeof(int));`. That gives you some int-sized chunk of memory somewhere, and what `malloc` actually returns is a *pointer* to that memory. Now, `pointer_to_number` is a variable (on the stack) that holds an address of something in the heap. You can treat the pointer like a number (if you try to print it and tell print \"it's a number,\" for example, it'll just be the memory address where the data is stored). If you want to modify the data on the heap, you can go `*pointer_to_number = 13;`. The star there means \"I want to mess with the stuff pointed to, not the pointer itself.\" If you wanted to change what the pointer points to, you could go `pointer_to_number = pointer_to_some_other_number;`. Note the lack of a star.Now here's the place where people get messed up most often: C has no way to know when you're done with the memory `malloc` gave you. It needs *you* to tell it that. So when you're all done with the memory you got handed, you call `free(pointer_to_number);`. That will say to the memory manager \"Hey, that pointer you malloc'd me awhile back? All done with it; something else can use that memory.\" If you forget to do that, when your function returns and the variables holding the pointer go away, the pointed-to memory can't be found anymore and you \"leaked\" it; that memory is stuck with a 'used' flag on it and nobody else can use it.The other thing about C is that it's a language with few 'guardrails' and makes it very easy to screw up the memory model or machine state. If you call `free` twice on the same pointer, you probably just break the memory manager and it'll do screwy stuff in your program from that point forward (modern operating systems give every program its own copy of `malloc` itself so you can't break the *whole computer's* state that way; worst-case-scenario, you can always quit the program and when it terminates all the memory it was using is properly given back to the operating system, including anything `malloc`'d). If you `malloc` a small amount of memory and then try to cram something big in there, C will cheerfully write the big thing past the end of the memory you reserved and clobber whatever's in the next chunk of memory. If you take a pointer to something on the stack (using the `&` operator) and then try to hold onto that pointer and then return from the function where that stack-thing lives, it'll get freed but your pointer will still be around and now it's pointing to the wrong thing. And probably the biggest foot-gun in the language: strings are just pointers to the first character of the string, so if you `malloc` some memory to hold a string and then forget now much you malloc'd and write a longer string than will fit in that memory, you will rip right into some other data in memory squirting random characters into it and you'll have a bad time.In a lot of ways, C is *way* simpler than other languages. That simplicity puts a lot of complexity on you, the user.",

        "body": "Some advices:\\- Don't get stuck on the \"learning new languages\" cycle, SPECIALLY on high-level programming languages. It's fine if you do this for a while, but the diminishing returns become heavy after. This is because newcomers don't yet have the necessary exposure and knowledge to do \"new things\", therefore they just fall in the trap of: learn new language -> learn basic syntax -> pretty much do nothing actually minimally important (to your learning) with this language -> get bored because you pretty much did nothing -> learn new language.\\- Try to diversify your initial learning over several areas of computing: graphics, distributed systems, embedded systems, operating systems, application development (web & mobile), and so on... Quick extra tip: place your effort into learning operating systems more, everything nowadays use an operating system as a basis, and therefore having at least a minimal understanding of how they work is important.\\- Try spending the majority of your time in an actual low-level programming such as C. I wouldn't recommend C++ just yet, because it won't give the same effect to a beginner as C does, this is because since C++ abstracts some stuff, beginners are prone of thinking about some features as an \"API\", which is not really what is happening, and this creates the exact opposite effect of what we want, since APIs in programming are usually perceived as a black box, and you don't want a black box, you want to actually understand what is going on. Just an additional note: I'd recommend coupling low-level programming learning with your OS studies.\\---------I'd take my advices with a grain of salt however, because it really depends on what stage you already are, and what type of approach you have towards your learning process. I also think it's pretty important you start recognizing early on what is holding you back, and what isn't, because believe me, it's very easy to stagnate when learning programming, and it's very hard to get out of that hole as well.",

        "body": "Tutorials work up to a certain degree.Once people have learnt the fundamentals, people should simply stop using tutorials and start building. Yet, that is the tricky and difficult part. Since in current times, people are hand-held all their lives they don't want to give up being hand-held and spoon-fed. They don't dare to let go and less know how to stand on their own feet.This was very different in the old days when there were no tutorials. You learnt by experimenting, by trying, by failing. But there also was more time and less competition.Now, fast is key. Which is completely wrong. Speedrunning learning leads to nothing.Well back to the original topic:There are good, mediocre, and outright rubbish tutorials and there are *courses* - this is an important distinction.Proper *courses* are e.g. the CS50 series from Harvard, the MOOCs from the University of Helsinki, Algorithms from Princeton, and countless others. Common to all of them is that they have a proper, educational curriculum, are approved and battle tested, and never pre-chew and spoon feed solutions - they all make the *learner* do the work.Now *tutorials* on the other hand, generally pre-chew and spoon feed. They *give* the code and only expect the learner to type it in - which is the totally wrong approach to learning. This is not learning.Worst tutorials are *\"How to build X in language Y\"* tutorials. They are plain useless. You, as the learner will not learn anything from them, not even the skill to build X in language Y on your own. All you will learn is to copy the code.About *proper usage* of tutorials: if you really go through a tutorial (not as a complete and utter beginner - as such, you should take a *course*), try to predict the code. Once the task following is explained, stop the tutorial and try to write the code on your own. Try a good amount of time and make different attempts if your first fails. Then, once you have a solution, or can't think of any other way, continue with the tutorial and compare - this way you train *your thinking* (which is far more important than your *coding*) and the coding plus, you get the final code to maybe learn the one or other thing from.I still think that the best approach to learning is first a solid *course* and then (and along with the course) program, program, program, program. Experiment, try things, break them, fix them, play around with the code. The more you struggle, fail, and play around, the more you learn.",

        "body": "> ...nobody ever explains what “right” actually means...This could mean a lot of things - and your question is somewhat vague on this regard as you don't identify any potential problems.Here are some possibilities:## misguided.People often ask what language should I learn?That is the wrong question. They should be identifying a field and learn the languages and tools used in that field.If you just learn a random language, you could be stuck in tutorial hell because once you are done learning that random language you may well find that nobody actually uses that language in the field you are interested in.e.g. you are advised to learn Pascal in response to the incorrect question because of its clarity and simplicity. Then you want to work in robotics. Sorry, go back and learn C/C++.## watching/reading but not doingA common problem I see is people complaining that they slogged through the entire series, but then can't do anything.That is because they slogged through the series and everything that went in one ear, got pushed right out the other side.People need to regularly press pause on the tutorial (or bookmark the book) and try out what they have seen. Experiment with it. Try to get it to do something else. For example, if taught how to create a loop that counts from 1 to 10, try to make it so that it goes from 10 to 1.## AIThis will be triggering for some - especially the AI propaganda bots. But AI is a double edged sword.If used correctly, to search, consolidate or explain it can be a useful tool.But if it is used to generate code - especially on anything more than an occasional basis then the risk is the same as my previous \"... not doing\" point. But it is more insidious. IMHO.In another sub that I moderate, we get a lot of posts along the lines of \"I used AI to write the code for the lessons and some basic things, but now I'm trying to do my own unique thing. It doesn't work and I don't know how to fix it.\". Even worse, because they have been copying and pasting the AI gibberish, they often don't have the vocabulary to clearly explain what is going on nor understand the changes proposed (unless someone rewrites it for them).The solution? Go back to the basics, ditch the AI and actually try doing stuff yourself.---These are just 3 common and hopefully easy to understand examples that I have observed over and over. In my career I've seen plenty of other types of mistakes but these are a bit more subtle and complicated to explain.---You also asked about:> ... and still can’t build anything without hand-holding (after doing the tutorials)This one is a bit harder and probably is an it depends scenario. Again from my experience, I've seen the following:* The person is perfectly capable to do it, but lacks personal self confidence.* The person is new to a project and needs help becoming assimilated with the organisation of the code and the standards used in the project.* Some people have learned the technology by rote without understanding how it works \"under the covers\". Example, they know that they can use a `long` or regular `int` and can't understand why sometimes both work and sometimes one might get weird negative values unexpectedly (and I'm thinking C here, but also some other languages).* When joining a new project, people are often on probation and part of the probation involves mentoring.There are other possible reasons including \"they didn't do the tutorials correctly\".",

What he said really changed my perspective for my career: “Yeah, problem solving and running have a lot more in common than it might seem… Anyone can run a marathon. It’s just a matter of how much pain you can put up with.”The same is true when learning data structures and algorithms, especially high level AI techniques like genetic algorithms, alpha beta pruning, simulated annealing, etc. I truly believe anyone can learn these concepts; provided they are willing to endure the pain and struggle it takes to get there.",

If you were learning to program as an undergrad CS student, there'd almost certainly be a course in your second or third year that would involve writing a simple HTTP server in C (hint: implement HTTP 1.0, not 1.1, it's way easier).There's something really cool about having something you're already familiar with, like your web browser, having a real, successful conversation with an app that you wrote from scratch, and displaying some cool result.The exact mechanics of how to implement will wildly vary by language, but really understanding what ports and sockets and addresses and listening and such mean is very helpful, and the concepts will transfer as you move between languages.There are lots of famous textbooks in this space. The Tanenbaum is probably the most famous, that's \"Computer Networks\" by Andrew Tanenbaum.There are also many great college courses covering computer networking with all of their lectures and assignments posted online. Simply going through one at your own pace may be a great way to get an expensive education for free (excepting the benefits of being able to ask questions). Good example: [https://sp26.cs168.io/](https://sp26.cs168.io/)One thing to be aware of: writing HTTP servers quickly starts to involve parallelization and running multiple threads, and then it becomes partly about memory sharing and memory management, and then you're learning about mutexes, and pretty soon you'll find that learning networking quickly begins to overlap with learning systems programming and operating systems. This is a good thing, but it can be somewhat confusing how books on operating systems will often seem to be about web serving, and vice versa.",

        "body": "Honestly if you haven't studied from the stand point of Computer Science you are not ready. Here is the thing, there is a good chance the job you get has nothing to do with C#. You need to have enough experience and understanding to adapt quickly to the development techniques your new job uses. Ask yourself this, if the new job is Python or Rust based can you adapt quickly to use those tools. Frankly I don't see much of a future for C#.The other side of this is how much have you developed completely on your own. If you successfully have completed the design and implementation of a novel program or two you are off to a good start. Frankly you should make this code available for review by the community. Code reviews can be painful but they can keep you on the right tracks as your skills develop. To put it another way if you haven't had your current programing reviewed by a third party you might not be as ready as you think.Now how quickly you might get hired depends upon demand and in many cases experience and knowledge outside of programming. You mention \"office Job\" but that does not define much. What I'm trying to say here is that sometimes other knowledge can be a factor in getting a job. If you have in depth knowledge of part of a business it can make programming a lot easier to adapt to because otherwise as a programmer you have to understand the business logic before you can even write code. I'm not having confidence in how I'm expressing this but if you have warehousing experience that can directly help in writing a business application to support warehousing software.",

Don’t be afraid to look things up online if allowed. I’d expect you to use the Python docs You’ll be sharing your screen so make sure you don’t have anything inappropriate open / nsfw desktop wallpaper etcIf you’re given a coding task mock out what you plan to do in pseudo code first. Throw some empty functions in etc. just do what you need to outline the problem and what you’re going to build so it’s clear to youIf they give you a task which has multiple parts get one working then the next. Don’t try do everything all at once. I’d rather see a candidate get 2/3 problems solved and miss one than have 80% of all 3 and nothing working. Say to yourself make it work then make it better. And say to them that’s what you’re doing. If you have a short amount of time prioritise what you have to do and talk about the stuff you would do. Like you won’t have time to write perfect error handling or unit tests but say where you would add them and why. The biggest thing to remember. Interviewers usually aren’t assholes. They aren’t looking to trip you up it’s just an assessment of where you’re at so try enjoy it as much as you can.",

Almost everything else uses some version of a List or a Stream, so it's better to accept something like that.So don't do: void myMethod( String[] names ) { for (String name : names) { System.out.println(name); } }but rather: void betterMethod( Iterator names ) { for (String name : names) { System.out.println(name); } }And if whoever calls your method actually has a real array, all they need to do is: String[] days = {\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"}; betterMethod(Arrays.asList(days));Usually the code inside the method would be the same - unless you actually need precise indexes or mutate the array, then you might want an actual array!",

But the opposite is not the case. To turn a list into an array, you need to copy all the elements (which is _relatively_ cheap since all the elements will themselves be pointers, but it's still O(N)).Two two main reasons to use arrays are:* If you're using varargs, because that's just how varargs work in Java.* If you need performance (for example, `int[]` will be higher performance than `List`).",

How much tome should I spend on a problem before looking for the answer?It’s not about not looking for an answer, it’s about finding it through the documentation.Documentation, documentation, documentation, documentation.If it’s really complex (like GUIs or networking) look up the appropriate libraries for your language (often the fundamentals of these are the same, just applied to the philosophy and syntax of their respective language, i.e. the concept of an onClick event). No need to reinvent the wheel.3. How do you turn an idea into code when you have no idea where to start?Look up the appropriate libraries, and start thinking about how things will be structured. It will change, it’s impossible to forsee everything, just get a vague idea and start.

Most of the time, we only have a vague understanding of how they even work. But sometimes we have to dig in and read its source code.When you're familiar with enough programming concepts, solving typical problems isn't that hard, but that doesn't mean we know how to do everything. There are math problems that are centuries old that we still don't know how to solve. You don't automatically know how to solve those just because you became a programmer.For typical problems, you could try top-down design: Describe, step-by-step, how to solve the problem in the ideal language you wish you had, then implement that language in the ideal language you wish you had for that, and recurse until it's obvious how to do it in the language you actually have.But that's just one approach.

Each project teaches more than any course, and every completed project becomes proof you can show future clients. That’s how I went from zero to my first paying freelance clients, and it’s the fastest way to start making money while still learning... good luck!",

        "body": "Hi, I'm an engineering manager, a self taught coder, and a sometimes entrepreneur. Here is my legit recommendation if you want to start earning money as a developer:First off, forget applying for jobs. The junior engineer market is brutal right now and I don't think it's going to return in the way that used to be traditional. You need to cultivate real full-stack development skills, a product mindset, and the ability to deploy apps. You also need to learn to use AI coding tools. 1. Go to Laracasts and do their Intro to PHP (stay with me) and Intro to Laravel courses.2. Do their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses. 3. Do their Blade and Livewire Course4. Do one of their SQL courses. MySQL or Postgres.Laracasts has courses of the correct length. Not too long, not too short. While you're doing them, build some small projects. Todo apps and such. When you're done, build a non-trivial site manually. It doesn't have to be too crazy, but you DO have to deploy it and you need to have things like two factor authentication and a few routes that require authorization. Something like a blog engine for yourself would be perfect. Your tech stack is going to be PHP, Blades, and Livewire, so keep doing those Laracasts courses.Then, go to Udemy and get Max Scwartzmuller's course on Claude Code. This will teach you one of the most important AI coding tools available. Because the days of us hand typing out code are gone, and they aren't coming back. Yes, you still need to know how to read and think about code, and you need to know best practices, but AI tools aren't optional anymore. Once you've got the skill set above, you'll be ready to start hunting down clients and doing professional work. If you're good at it, there is a living to be made. Don't freelance. Consult. What's the difference? About $100 per hour. In consulting you find a niche and market to it. No need for Upwork or anything like that. It's hard to get those first clients, but if I were starting over today, this is the exact path I'd follow. That said, I doubt many people on this forum are going to agree with me, so take it for what it's worth.",

        "body": "Depends on the engine.Firstly: If you've never programmed before, learn that before touching a game engine. At the very least, learn1. What variables are (ints, floats, booleans, and strings)2. What functions/methods are (bonus points if you can tell me the difference)3. What for-loops and while-loops are4. What objects are5. What data structures (at least: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, Stacks and Queues) are.After that, then you can go to the game engine.If you mean the whole \"getting used to your environment\" - start by following a short game tutorial, and then adding functionality to it (make flappybird, then add a coin collecting mechanic - or extra life pickups). This will teach you where things are, and how to get there. When following the tutorial, don't follow line by line, but section by section. Watch for a few minutes, and then repeat it on your own trying not to reference the video. This will teach you how to maneuver.After you understand the 5 basic windows most editors contain (scene view, game view, project files, hierarchy/scene tree, and the inspector), and you've followed maybe 3 basic tutorials, move onto making simple games on your own. [I recommend The 20 Games Challenge](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=82257b40e0c0ad322422c1a739ab848cd655250585883297a44bb103ee62ed7aJmltdHM9MTc2OTczMTIwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=2c6d9a75-b7b3-6591-338f-8c84b639640d&psq=the+20+game+challeng&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly8yMF9nYW1lc19jaGFsbGVuZ2UuZ2l0bGFiLmlvL2NoYWxsZW5nZS8) \\- it's an amazing teaching tool simply due how it encourages repetition.Between the games you make, try creating some basic systems - like an inventory, or a healthbar. Small things just to learn how to abstract these tools away. Better yet, make them on their own, and reuse them in some projects to learn how to make things modular.As for healthy habits:* In general, you don't start a project in editor, you start with the notepad/whiteboard: Plan. Think about what you want to accomplish, and quantify it. If it ain't quantifiable, explain it as a story that gives quantifiable metrics. We call these Functional & Non-functional/Quality Requirements. Define and prioritize those first. Once you know exactly what it is you want to make, start to break that thing down into identifiable entities, their components, and their relationships to everything else. Think about how the game works, and the major parts of it.* Look up SOLID programming principles, and Object Oriented Design Patterns. They are incredibly helpful in game dev, because they teach you how to arrange ideas in a way that's typically useful for simulations like games* When in doubt about how certain things work, read the docs. They are dense, but they're by far the most useful resource at your disposal.* Follow a consistent coding style. Your code should look the same regardless of where it is - this makes it easier to parse over later. Don't flipflop between \"snake\\_case\" and \"CamelCase\" for example.",

The easiest way is to read about it for a bit and then implement something that tests a feature so it make sense to you. If it has a physics engine, you could loot at how you make an object not be affected by gravity. how do you make an object adhere to gravity, what happens when two objects hit each other.Build a single screen game Start with something simple like Pong. What do you need for that, break it down to the individual components of your game. Two independently moving paddles, a ball that moves and bounces around, and a pair of scoring zones, and a score display for each player.1. So create your scene, stick in a paddle, hook in keyboard controls so that it can move.2. Create a scene, stick in a ball and give it initial momentum so it moves in a direction, hook in the scoring zone and make the ball score if it enters the scoring zone, keep track of the score, display the score3. So create a scene, stick in a ball and a paddle and make the ball bounce off the paddle if it is hit.4. Create a scene that combines all of the above into one, and you have your game.The advantage of this approach is that those first three items also give you your tests cases for your game. If you make a change to the game, you can see if you broke something in regards to the gameplay.Look at the information about the various Game Jams to practice. So these might have a \"phrase\" or a couple of words your game needs to be about. So \"light & dark\", which could be a game about shadows, a Grue, or a battle of good vs evil.",

For me the benefits of learning to code is that I work in an industry that relies on electronics and embedded electronics.. and when those components fail or i cant get parts today.. I needed a way to \"make it work\". indirectly and through many years of rabbit holes related to coding is how I utilize coding for income. there is no wrong language to learn.. but learning it for the sake of learning it could be problematic. identifying is solving problems is more important especially if you want to make money from it. sometimes income from coding can also be from saving you you time and money. I pay a lot of money for customer management software. recently I decided I can make my own software that is good enough for me. once i am finished with it.. i no longer need to pay for someone else's.. mine is good enough.. for me. I suppose i could build a complete software solution to sell.. but then I need a team. I need to make sure its bug free. I need to market it.

A collection of classes and functions that are included by default with compilers.If you're eager to dive into C++, tutorials on the standard library are a fantastic starting point. They offer a wealth of knowledge about the language and can set you on the right path. Most tutorials cover this and that’s all. But why stop there?Building your own projects is an equally powerful way to learn. As you work on real projects, you'll naturally encounter the libraries and tools you need, turning challenges into opportunities for growth. No need to learn about “cout,” or “include.”I’ve found that hands-on building truly accelerates understanding.Happy coding!Resource: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/standard_library.html",

Since you lack that and rely on motivation, you're cooked if you don't change yourself.Hold yourself accountable. Get a big wall calendar with the whole year on a single page. Get a red marker. Cross off every day you learnt. Do not break the chain. The longer your chain will become the more motivated you will be to not break it.

At first we don't know that there's thing called Virtual Memory which controls every aspect of memory access. The executable .data section is baked into a file (.exe on Windows, elf file format on Linux) so its size is static/constant, never changes its size when the process is running. So it's not that suitable for allocating new memory for data in the future. So the OS have a mechanism (heap) for requesting new memory pages in order for a program to be able to create new objects while it's running. If not for pointers we wouldn't be able to refer to objects located in heap because we don't know beforehand where they would be located, the compiler knows only about variables on the .data section. You can read from a books or ask AI about all these stuff and it would explain to you in a level understable for you.

Like this you can try try it out, to see what it does. If your PC has enough space in it then you can also consider making a dual boot (e.g. you have an option to boot into Windows, or to boot into Linux). You can pick Ubuntu for your Linux distro. I think it is the most general-user-friendly.Now, in Linux you'll be interacting more with a terminal / command prompt. So, try out things like updating your Ubuntu, via a terminal.

With nested loops, j moves up through *all* the letters each time i moves just one letter down. Try and see whether you can use just one loop rather than two. It's possible, using just a single loop, to have both i and j update together in lockstep just like you want.",

So that i can check if the right index of a number is the same as from the left, if so, return true, if not, return false. But from what i could get from your comments, nested loops dont work exactly like that? My understanding was that i gets -- everytime the nested loop ends, so that1. i starts right2. j start at index 03. compare the charAt i and j4. true if correct, continues the block5.gets to the end of the 1st loop j++ and gets to the end of the 2nd loop block and i-- 6. restart with i length -1 and j at 1, compares again. 7. does this until i hits 0 (which i should change to >0 and not >=0,) and for j until it hits length-1This doenst seem to be what happens tho, according to your comments.Thank you very much btw! :D",

There’s basically just one action, where an arm goes up, pauses, goes down, pauses, and then repeats. The arms are divided into two groups that are half a cycle out of phase with each other. If you can write the code for one arm, applying it to a dozen or more should be straightforward.",

As for yours statement that C++11 really fits, I'm not sure how you can come to that conclusion. C++ isn't perfect by any measure but you can argue that it gets better with each standard release. It isn't unreasonable to say that if you start a C++11 project today, that by the time it is stable and \"finished\", it will have been written to a 20 year old standard. That means supporting it in the future will be problematic.Beyond all of that If you stay with old technology you loose the advantages that show up in new compilers and support tools.

Best thing is if everything is functional you can seperate it really well with AI. Or if you prefer manuallay. After that the next step is to check for performance and how the existing logic works , it will be much easier to understand if you have it in chunks and clearly seperated boundaries. You will notice a lot of slop. perhaps N+1 queries , caching not implemented where it's needed. Build a list of quick wins you can get.If the code is very complex which more often it is because of AI , you can rewrite the complex parts and abstract them in declartive functions this is really useful.If the classes are intertwined you need to decide how to seperate the existing componentes , will you use DI or perhaps there is some oppurtinites of inhertince where we can reuse code.

Even a clean console banking app or task manager with decent README looks way better than “I finished a course and now I’m stuck”.And don’t stress about the English – your code editor doesn’t care about accent or grammar, only syntax. Keep posting, keep shipping tiny projects, and your “basics” will quietly turn into “intermediate” faster than you expect.",

        "body": "Yea I wouldn't spend big money on a bootcamp. I would try to setup a study schedule where you are programming every day however. I see you mention wanting to be proficient in AppSec and AI, then it is important to understand that there is more to this than just the language. Many times, when in comes to the language it is just the tool you use to apply logic and with that said AppSec and AI both rely heavily on the fundamentals of Computer science concepts. Discrete math, Data structures and algorithms, operating systems fundamentals, networking basics, databases, etc. With all that said, the one thing you can look at that credentializes you while teaching you all the relevant concepts is a Comp Sci degree. Especially with your stated goals. If you can't get a degree, then focus on first building the foundation for a self made CS curriculum. Appsec in particular isn't just finding bugs in front end code, it includes threat modeling, devops and other infra principles, tons of code review, database management, etc. AI security is emerging in 2 forms. The first being red/blue team tradecraft oriented security. So hacking the models through prompt injection, data poisoning, first order attacks etc. The second form is securing the models themselves, which is actually more inline with the AI/ML engineer/MLOps skillset, the best way to get into this is to pursue a traditional AI focused CS program. Notice, how everything comes back to CS fundamentals. Not assuming you want to jump into a senior position, but security isn't really a beginner focused field. In order to do security properly, you need the knowledge of an engineer and the knowledge of someone who can actually break the app and recommend remediation. Lofty goals is what keeps us motivated, but I would break down your goals in meaningful steps and a meaningful timeline. To answer what you would use to learn programming and CS fundamentals, the only course that ever stuck with me was a \"bootcamp\" I took last year for $150 from exercism. They didn't even use a real language for the first half of the course, yet the fundamentals they taught have still stuck with me today. The biggest benefit from this course however was their discord where mentors were there to help guide you to answers on your own. After that I recognized my own shortcomings when it came to algorithmic thinking. I focused on the math and discrete math fundamentals, before jumping back into doing algorithm problems to improve my thinking. Point being AppSec and AI are long roads, try to set yourself up for that journey.",

I think one of if not the best resource for a beginner is the Odin project, and its free. It requires getting your hands dirty though. If you want a gentle introduction to coding without having to worry about set up etc, then yeah codecademy could be actually be good (one of the few times id actually reccomend it), just keep in mind you won't really be learning much compared to books or more hands on resources, just gently introduced to concepts. You could do that as a way to explore different areas of coding though before deciding what to pursue more seriously later once you have more of an idea.If you want something that will more likely immediately benefit you and your work, then automate the boring stuff is a great book. If you then explored analytics then you could carve yourself a nice little niche at your job. Its unlikely doing a full stack course will help your career at all compared to this approach.",

        "body": "Think of a keyboard as three stacked realities:1.Physics – switches, rows, columns, diodes2.Time – scanning, debouncing, state transitions3.Language – turning switch states into USB HID reports, layers, macrosQMK is just a very thick sandwich around those three ideas.If you want to build “your own QMK,” you don’t start with keyboards. You start with microcontroller firmware and USB.⸻Step 1: Pick a microcontroller and read its datasheet like scriptureMost custom keyboards use:•ATmega32U4 (classic Arduino Pro Micro)•RP2040•STM32The key requirement: native USB device support.Before writing any keyboard code, you must understand:•GPIO configuration•Timers / interrupts•USB endpoints•Flash + RAM limitsThis is not optional. QMK hides this pain; you’re choosing to feel it.⸻Step 2: Implement a matrix scanner (this is the soul)A keyboard PCB is usually a row × column matrix.Algorithmically:•Set all columns as outputs•Set all rows as inputs with pull-ups•Drive one column LOW at a time•Read rows•Repeat fast (≈1 kHz)You will write:•GPIO init•A scan loop•A key state bitmapThis alone teaches you more embedded thinking than most app devs ever touch.⸻Step 3: Debouncing (time becomes real)Switches lie. They bounce.You need:•Per-key state•Timestamp or counter•Stable-state confirmationClassic strategies:•Integrator counters•Time-based debounce•State machinesQMK has multiple debounce algorithms. Rewriting one is a rite of passage.⸻Step 4: Build a key event pipelineAt this point you have:•Raw matrix state•Press / release eventsNow you design your own internal API:raw_scan → debounced_state → key_event → actionThis is where you can do things QMK doesn’t:•Probabilistic chording•Pressure-aware timing•Contextual layers (editor-aware, app-aware)This is where creativity lives.⸻Step 5: USB HID from scratch (the dragon)Now the hard truth:USB is the real boss fight.You must implement:•USB descriptors•HID report descriptors•Polling interval logic•Key rollover handlingYou can:•Write USB by hand (brutal but pure)•Or use a thin USB stack (LUFA, TinyUSB) without keyboard logicThis is still “from scratch” in spirit—USB is a protocol, not magic.⸻Step 6: Layers, macros, and remapping (language emerges)Layers are just:•Lookup tables•Stackable keymaps•State-dependent resolutionMacros are:•Event playback engines•Timed HID reportsNothing mystical. QMK only organizes it well.⸻Where to actually learn this (non-obvious sources)Not “keyboard tutorials.” Those are downstream.Study instead:•USB HID specification•LUFA examples (keyboard + mouse)•Bare-metal MCU tutorials•Old AVR keyboard firmware (pre-QMK era)Then read QMK last, like reading a cathedral after learning how stones are cut.⸻A sharper insight most people missQMK is not a keyboard firmware.QMK is:•A hardware abstraction layer•A policy engine for input•A build system that normalizes chaosIf you rebuild it, don’t clone it.Design something smaller, stranger, and opinionated.For example:•A keyboard that adapts layout based on typing entropy•A keyboard that changes layers by time-of-day•A keyboard optimized for African language input patterns•A keyboard that treats macros as code, not sequencesThat’s how you go beyond “my own QMK” and into new instruments.",

It makes the transition 10x less painful. There's many frameworks and libraries for doing frontend work, but you should start with React and Tailwind as they're by far the most commonly used and demanded on the job market.HTML and CSS: Use freecodecamp to teach you these, you can have it learned pretty quickly and competently. Javascript: Get a udemy course for this. Wait until they're on sale for under $20. I personally used Jonas Schmedtmans course and can vouch for it. React, TypeScript, Tailwind: Use Dave Gray on youtube to pick these up.

In simple terms you write TS, you hit save and then under the hood something like Vite transpiles your TS to JS for the browser to understand. The main difference is that TypeScript helps future you (or your teammates) read your code easier. All of the knowledge you learn in JavaScript is transferable. You’re not wasting time learning JS. In fact, you may understand the value prop of TS better if you continue to focus on JS. What should you learn next? Idk. I usually get the most value out of building something. Maybe try to build a website using Node Express. That’ll put your JavaScript, HTML and CSS to the test. If you really want to go crazy (and can spare a few bucks a month) see if you can automate deployment of your website to a VPS on AWS or Digital Ocean via CI/CD. Hope that helps!",

I’m mostly familiar with inline assembly in C and Rust.But in general inline assembly is used in one of two contexts: either a snippet that’s embedded within a function, or at the top level (Rust calls this naked assembly). If it’s within a function, then you have to make sure it’s compatible with the rest of the function — you have to tell the compiler if you clobber any registers, for example, so it knows to avoid that registers or save/restore it.If it’s at the top level then you have to make sure you’re handling the function prologue and epilogue, as well as the calling conventions so the code can be called from outside. But, it means that you can define things like interrupt or system call handlers.",

Plus, specializing early can help you build expertise faster.On the other hand, full-stack roles are great if you're interested in learning both sides, though as you mentioned, they can be more demanding. Since you're already doing full-stack projects, you might want to consider whether you enjoy front-end work enough to invest in it long-term.Ultimately, both paths will give you valuable experience, but if you’re leaning towards backend and feel more confident there, that might be the smarter choice to build depth in one area before branching out later.",

As I said, early in my career I was prefering frontend and invested a lot of time in javascript and related frameworks, was interested in UX design even (real full stack back then :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: from db schema design, backend to the html and css). Years later I was focused more on backend. Then the natural things in career growth - managing teams, where soft skills are way more important. But turned out that was not really my thing, being too far from creating things and instead, doing hiring, budgeting, such kind of boring stuff. Now I am in architect role - mostly talking and drawing, but way more connected to development teams, although not writing code. Don't miss it. Only occasionally I get to code something by myself helping teams in hard situations and I like it so. My point is - you shouldn't overthink it that much. There is no right or wrong, every decision comes with mistakes and lessons. Whatever you choose, you will learn something. If you do a mistake, you will learn more! And with years you will eventually get bored in something. One more important advice - stay there, where there are better guys than you - to compete with them and learn fron them. If you notice you aren't learning and progressing - change the job and even consider shift in technology or role. It's not that big of a problem to shift from c# to java .. or python. Having the basis and experience makes it really easy. (A lot of words I've wrote, sorry for that! :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:",

We are turned off by things we don’t understand, and there’s only one thing that can push you through that…**Incentive** — whether it be money, passion, fame, notoriety, a family that needs you to succeed, a boss breathing down your neck, having no other options and just trying to survive, or a combination of any of these and then some — *something* needs to push you to keep going. I will assume that in your stage of coding there are few things that keep you coding for long periods of time and at consistent frequencies *eg; Monday - Friday, 9 - 5*Find a point to motivate you to keep going, take breaks when you’re confused but COME BACK as soon as you feel it’s tolerable. Practice, refine your skills, and prepare to be (at the very least) a satisfied cog in this world’s big machine, with a decent paying job (maybe better if you try hard enough), a happy wife or husband and a happy life.**NO ONE** goes to work every day, consistently, for a fixed amount of time because they *have a lot of energy or a positive mind* as you say — they do it to survive, and if they’re lucky they have a passion for the field in some way, shape or form. If you even have a *small* notion that you think you’ve found something you’re good at, make that your rock and refine it.But hey, you could always try something else and see what happens — it is also a natural part of life to go a different path, maybe you like it and never come back to coding, maybe you don’t. The important part is that you’re thinking about it critically.— College Dropout, Formerly in Healthcare for 10 years, now Software Engineer at a Bank.",

It's how I got my start in the industry, although apparently recruitment standards are a bit higher these days than when I started back in 04. The computing a-level is good though, it's a good introduction to coding and also teaches a few of the concepts you'd learn in your first year of a CS degree.In terms of your degree have a think about what kind of job you'd like to get, computer science isn't the only degree for coders.

If you're in the U.S. the pay is excellent.If you build indie apps, games, or websites, then the barrier to entry is very low. You can make a website or app after learning for less than a month. You could even make a few dollars. However, the chances of making a living are tiny. The top 1% of indie developers make nearly all of the money.The third option is freelance / consulting.

AI can't replace all programmers, only the ones that don't understand what they're doingCoding is still worth it, even if you're not a genius, you can still get paid well, ship games and freelance, maybe build some other tools if that's what you end up interested in and it also opens a couple doors to tech roles Even if you're \"pretty good\", understand fundamentals and know how to debug and optimize, you'll find a spot on the market, the top of the top make real good money, the middle top still live very comfortablyCoding has good money if you stick with it long enough to get good and specialize in something and if you actually build stuff instead of only learning theory, your value as a developer is mostly indicated by your portfolio so especially work on that, ESPECIALLY in game dev because I feel it's generally more competitive than other IT sectors, knowing how to really optimize is a rare skill and rare skills get paid better (generally speaking)Speaking from my own standpoint as a game dev, there's luckily some benefits that help irl too :) Learning to code helps you train structured thinking, breaking down problems, I've also especially noticed I've gotten a lot more patient and persistent, this might be because of debugging? might be the cause? idk? on top of that, you'll understand computers more if you don't yet and you'll learn that ideas in your head can actually very quickly become real things that you, yourself can make instead of waiting for someone to invent it for you If something is broken, you can understand and fix it, is a mindset I often see return in IT and it carries around in every fieldLearning it obviously takes time, there's no shortcuts but you don't have to rush it and you don't have to master it all right away at the same time and you don't have to do it for the money instantly either, if you're already feeling interest, that's a big sign it's worth learningIf your goals are to make games, optimize systems and working with 3D and web (and understanding how things actually work) then coding isn't just something useful but rather foundational, making a game without code or little code (especially if you go into more complicated games) is nearly impossibleEven if you don't become a full time programmer, knowing how to code helps you in general and gives you some kind of leverage in pretty much any tech related fieldtldr: Yes, it’s still worth learning to code now especially if you’re into games, optimization, 3D, and web but don't do it cause \"coding = guaranteed money\", it also has benefits outside of your specific goal",

If you're working on a project with other people, it probably makes sense to talk to those people and agree on how to format your commit messages. For example, [\"Conventional Commits\"](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is one example of a consistent way to format your commit messages. But for a solo project, it really doesn't matter at all whether you stick rigidly to something like this.As far as the *types* of information you should be putting in your commit messages: it should be enough to explain both what you changed and why you changed it, to a level of detail that you find sufficient. Commit messages are a form of documentation, and there's no one \"right\" level of detail for your documentation. It depends on how much time you're willing to spend on it.If you want some inspiration, you can take a look at the Linux, which generally has very detailed commit messages. Often the messages are much longer than the corresponding code changes. A Linux kernel PR won't be accepted if the maintainers don't think the commit message is clear enough, even if the code itself is fine.For instance, [this recent commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/76ed27608f7dd235b727ebbb12163438c2fbb617) has 31 lines of text (plus footers) to describe a 13-line code change. The first line contains just the most crucial details: the change affects performance monitoring (\"perf\") in the scheduler (\"sched\") subsystem, and it fixes a potential crash. The rest of the message goes into detail about exactly why the problem is happening and how it was fixed.Again, you probably don't need to go into nearly that level of detail for *all* your commits, especially if you're working on a project that's less critical than the Linux kernel. But while you're writing code, you should be thinking about how you would explain what you're doing to another programmer. And then you can decide how much of that explanation you want to put into the commit message.----Note also that deciding how to *describe* your commits goes hand-in-hand with deciding *what* changes to include in each commit. In the example I gave, it's straightforward to describe the commit's purpose because it's a very small, self-contained change. If the commit included other bug fixes at the same time, it would be a lot harder to write a good description.You might think that carefully breaking up your changes into multiple commits is just creating more work, but if you do it properly, it can make things easier for you in the long run.",

Then again everyone has their own style— but definitely do not do `git add .` — source control is your friend, it’s one of the icons on the left hand side of VS code that looks like a merge request icon IIRC. Commit a message for each file, and make it a habit to commit frequently until you get a feel for appropriate checkpoints.Edit: `git add .` is fine for initial project template / codebase, or overall changes — just don’t work on something for several hours and then be lazy / cut corners with it. Proper documenting of ongoing and frequent changes is essential if your goal is to eventually work with a team at any level from small to enterprise. Some teams have a specific recommended standard for commit verbosity and frequency as well!Edit edit: If your mind is searching for a statement for a commit and can’t find it— you can describe what you did to any LLM and it should be able to help you. Eg; “I added a variable that is part of my useState into the array at the end of a useEffect” becomes “Added a dependency to useEffect hook that refreshes the state of the page should that dependency change” — these are equally concise but one is more *technically accurate*.",

Then you would call the function in your main block five times, one after another, with the unique data in the argument each time, for a total of 11 lines of code, drastically reducing the line count. Another big factor is let's say you found a bug or want to make a change to how you insert the row into the spreadsheet. Without the function you would have to fix that bug five times (which opens you up to five more mistakes) but the function you just change once, drastically reducing complexity. On a lower level, a function is just a jump to another area and then a jump back to where it was before, basically: go execute this code over here and come back when you are done.",

But you can also use them as a form of documentation - as a way to give a name to a chunk of code and say \"this particular operation is done by this code and nothing else\".Imagine you have a program that reads in a bunch of grades and computes the average of those grades. Nothing complex here and you could definitely write that as one function. Except... think about how I described it. It does *two* things. It reads in the grades and then computes the average (and prints it. Maybe three things).These two things are *unrelated*. You can read in a bunch of grades without computing the average. You can compute the average of just about anything - it doesn't have to be grades that someone typed in.That might be a good use for functions. Have a `read_grades` function that returns the grades. Then have a `compute_average` function that takes a list/array/bunch of grades and computes the average. Then print the result.This gets close to what people mean when they talk about self-commenting code. Instead of having an opaque block of code, you have program grades = read_grades() avg = compute_average(grades) print (\"The average grade was {}\", avg)You've made this program a little easier to understand.

A few ways to explain this.1.) baking: your inputs are eggs, milk, baking soda, etc., as well the temperature you bake at. The body of the function is what you actually do, like mix the eggs and milk together, preheat the oven, etc., and then the output is a cake.The definition of this function will look like “def bake(num_eggs, cups_milk, temp): do stuff; return cake” and a call to the function would look like “cake=bake(2, 3, 400)”2.) simple addition: you want to add two numbers, your inputs are the two numbers, the output is the result, so “def add(x,y): return x+y” and a call would look like “z=add(6,7)”. Under the hood, Python says “you gave me 6 to plug into x, and 7, to plug into y, so I’m going to add 6 and 7 and give you 13”.3.) taking the math analogy further: programming functions are very analogous to mathematical functions. “f(x)=2x” means you input some number and multiply it by 2. So f(2)=4, f(6)=12, etc. In Python, this mathematical function would be written like “def double(x): return 2*x”.Start very, very simple, and add little pieces. It might feel really slow at first, but there’s a point where it clicks and then you’re off to the races.",

For me, it started because I desperately needed to keep the job. Im a Software Engineer and it took me a year to get my first career job, felt like every day stuck working at Walmart was a hit to my hireability. I was terrified of not being able to get my foot in the door and not being able to keep it there. If I failed, 4 years of college would have been pointless. Plus, I knew id be taking care of my Ma once Dad retired. After graduating, I only had 2 years to get a high enough salary to support us both.Once I got hired, I felt I had to prove myself with failure resulting in a dead career. Got out of that mentality, but every now and then I still feel that dread of \"I can't lose this job\" and have to remind myself im okay.",

To be honest with you if you're asked why you left your role at amazon, I would just lie and say your whole team was laid off, that makes it clear that it's not a situation where your performance was a factor. I would just focus on early career or new grad positions and keep learning new things in between applying for jobs, your library probably has a udemy subscription you could use to start studying for certs if you think they could help in your role as well",

I actually stepped up alot on my knowledge. i did the backend + front end alone. almost finished the project but they fired me for performance. I was alone on this project never had help. the manager estimated the time it would take in hours. this guy never programmed in his life.got hired a year after in a small company. they hired me as a python dev... they lied it wasnt python it was a low code platform that i fucking hated. i stayed for the money + unemployment, but it was again a hour based system, working for reallyyyyy cheap clients. they hired lots of contractors that were working for free when client complained and trust me i heard about clients being really mad twice a week. shitty place. they were giving me it work that i know nothing about and sql work to an it guy that knew nothing about sql..........now im back to searching",

That was easy to outsource even 10 years ago.I'm a 2020 grad and recruited before all this AI bullshit in a supposedly better job market. Yet, I had a <1% response rate on applications before I actually got a big tech name on my resume.You know how I got that 1%? I countered the predominant internet advice from people like you and put effort into these write ups explaining, not my \"values,\" but instead how I understood their business model, customer base, etc. and why I could contribute. I had a much higher response rate for those apps. And you know what? After I got hired, I actually performed and got top tier performance ratings every time, even though I was a dumbass on paper. Most code, even at FAANG, is just CRUD; low level technical skills are shockingly unimportant.That's why they care about this shit. It's not woke nonsense like you seem to think it is. **You will help them make more money if you actually understand how things work. It's not just political. They're screening for your ability to be productive and YOU ARE FAILING due to this attitude.**Going back to my original comment. There are PLENTY of high IQ SWEs with great technical skills. If that's all you have, then you're not worth big tech salaries. Those types of engineers need every decision micromanaged and defined by tech leads. Even fucking product managers end up suggesting better technical solutions than they do.When you're clueless about how corporate environments work and how companies make money, your decisions are poor even if they're technically perfect. Your code scales, but not in the ways the business needs, so it just ends up needing to be refactored in a year and you're a net 0 to productivity...",

You're simply making assumptions about the input or output that are not actually stated in the task.You're not anticipating lists to be empty or unsorted, numbers to be negative, zero or repeated.> and a couple where I just have no idea, I'm just stumped.Pick up a book on data structures and algorithms. You're trying to learn by doing the test over and over again until you pass, rather than taking the class. Not only is that a highly inefficient way to pass the test, it also means you're not going to learn the material on the way..> And I'll have to do two of these in under an hour?!?! Am I really just this completely awful at the job I had for so long, in the field I'm stuck in?Unpopular opinion: Yeah.Algorithms and data structures are an integral part of our craft. Just because we can often get away with not paying due attention to them doesn't mean that produces quality results, or that there will never be situations where they don't matter.If you were an accountant, I would expect you to be able to do so e basic math, whether all of your actual work was fine with the aid if a calculator or not, too.Furthermore, it's a test. It doesn't aim to, or need to, be a perfect representation of your work day. I would ask you to look for the video of Gordon Ramsey being able to butcher a chicken while blindfolded. Other than a stunt done for TV, it is a test of his raw skills. And even though few chefs will ever find themselves having to perform that particular task, I'd trust anyone who can do it more than anyone who can't.The good news is that any competent chef should be able to learn to perform this trick fairly quickly and easily. So, if companies decided that this is what chefs should do to get hired, no real chef should have a problem. (And, therefore, the test would work as expected: Filter out the vast majority of really bad chefs.

The emergency fund is critical, but make sure you are in a location where you can find another job in your field (with those numbers I’ll bet you’re close). Either way, maybe you have to move, shrug. You appear to be doing very well, good luck with the house hunting.Edit: yapped right past the question. No we did not hold off (obviously) and it was a great decision for us.

My answer would be different if you were a fresh new grad or still in school, because there's a good case to be made that you still need to build up the manual coding skills before learning to rely on AI. But if you're an experienced engineer already, you should absolutely be taking advantage of the most recent tooling. You're only going to see skill atrophy over the long term if it's truly not needed, and you can always refresh your manual coding skills if needed.**One very very critical thing, though:** It's trivial to prompt AI agents and get output that *works,* but that's not enough. You should be aiming for code quality that *exceeds* the quality of your prior manual output, and you should always understand the details of how it all works - neither of which are very hard if you leverage the AI to do this (e.g. get it to refactor when needed, use other AI tools to review the code, ask for explanations).Most \"vibe coders\" don't do this, and that's where tech debt problems come in quickly. Serious professional engineers are leveraging AI in a very different way, keeping the AI on a short leash and ensuring high quality output just like in the manual coding days.",

Leadership has a dashboard that shows every employee’s AI usage weekly and if we don’t use it we get a talkin’ to. Even non technical folks are required to use it for something. I’ve found it’s great for doing the mundane, monotonous tasks that I find boring. I love it for testing, documentation, building quick scripts to mitigate manual processes. I still do most of my own coding, but if I’m doing something that requires a lot of duplication of work I let copilot do it",

It's enough time to reset your body and mind from the real changes that burnout has on you. Two weeks off just really isn't enough time for that, I think it's just the beginning of the healing process.The only difference between switching environments or not seemed to be when I come back as an existing employee people expect me to hit the ground running at full speed just like I was before. This can be stressful, but it's balanced against already knowing people's expectations and team dynamics and office politics and how to do the work. In fact the times I wanted to quit my job the most were in those first couple months after a sabbatical at a new job. Combining onboarding with a new company with suddenly becoming a corporate slave again is especially painful.

If everyone is spending months grinding leetcode, the only way to get a 1% pass rate is to dial up the questions to ridiculous difficulty. It's become a \"how badly do you want this job\" test more than a matter of ability. The interviews are so hard that the only way to ace the interview is to have practiced that exact question before. Then it's a dance where you pretend to be solving it on the spot, when you actually have memorized the answer already.",

Just a month ago I landed my first SWE job. There are definitely go guarantees, and it will likely take a while but its definitely not impossible. My advice would be to focus on 1. Projects: Building projects that you can talk about and show in some way, whether it be a demo of the project, a blog, or anything else. With AI you can pretty much just pick any topic you are interested in, find something that seems interesting to build and is within a reasonable scope and build it. Bonus points if its a product that solve actual peoples problems, product thinking is highly valued at startups. The goal is to show people that you have actually done stuff, and to be able to talk about it.2. Network: The most universal thing I learned after a year of searching for jobs was that pretty much everyone I knew got their job through some sort of connection and is also how I ended up getting my job, and this is doubly true in todays market. Network as aggressively as you can (not annoyingly but just a lot of people) and reach out to your own personal network. The cost is basically nothing other than maybe your ego, and the upside is tremendous, you never know who could be the one that has the connect, and people are very often happy to help. Definitely still apply to companies but don't spend too much time on it especially if you aren't getting much positive feedback. Your first job will most likely be from just knowing the right person (networking) and actually having something to show for your skills (projects). Good luck, and message me if you have any other questions I think my experience has made me somewhat of an expert in the subject lol.",

For example, by suggesting what to say during a sales call to help close the deal..So I also get the vibe, entirely in my personal opinion, that InterviewCoder (and really any other tools) are kind of a gimmick to get attention, and that its kind of working haha.",

For example:1. B2B setups are very common, and in their current form they are extremely beneficial for companies, but not really beneficial for employees.2. I’ve had cases where companies wanted me to work on my own computer and install their software on it. In three other cases, I simply rejected the offer because they explicitly stated that the role required 50–60 hours of work per week for a below-median salary.So my conclusion is this: if you have low expectations, I think it’s relatively easy to land a senior position. But if you have standards—like a decent salary and a healthy work–life balance—it’s extremely tough right now.",

        "body": "Traditional engineer here (chemical, not that it matters)... turns out, USA vs. Europe area engineering or not that makes little difference. It looks like, checks the replies, a lot of software developers are just toxic regardless of where they live. A lot of you all are really arguing about stupid shit. Software development isn't a zero sum game, for US developers to win, EU doesn't have to lose, and vice versa.Do we chalk this up to people just being young? Do European posters in /r/cscareerquestions ALSO skew young and NOT actually employed as software developers, just like the US counterparts?Anyways, unlike many people here, I regularly during the course of my work, engage with large teams of European engineers. Primarily engineers from Ireland, Poland, and Germany. Ireland is unique, in that it also has a large diaspora of engineers from OTHER European countries. These have included multiple engineers from England, Spain, and France, and Architects from Ireland, Italy, and England.Two things that have helped dramatically, are: Persistent and clear communication. Both parties need to be patient, and be \"clear\" with their communication. English will be the lingua fraca, but all English is not the same. Focus on using COMMON, more likely to be known, phrases, words, etc. Avoid idioms that someone not from your country isn't going to know. It's REALLY common for native speakers/writers to go crazy with this and communicate in a way that is very difficult to understand. Simplify it down. Assume positive intent, if something SOUNDS off, it's probably a bad translation. Every language has it's own difficulties in translation to English. Above all else, patience by BOTH parties.The other, is absolutely when working with counterparts in other cultures, you HAVE to learn and understand what their leadership and accountability paradigm is, relative to yours. Do NOT assume it is the same way, at all, to yours. How people are led (do people DEFER to leadership, or INFORM leadership), how people are mentored, how people are held accountable, differs WILDLY between cultures; and, even within that culture, particularly in Poland I see big differences between junior and senior engineers. I suspect in that country there's a divide there too; if I had to guess, it's roughly the 15+ and above vs. the newer peeps. But, I don't fully understand, despite how much polish interaction I get.With that last one, comes ASSUME positive intent. Assume they WANT to get the job done, and done well, and seek to understand how and why they're behaving the way they are. A metaphor I like to use borrows from the old American story about the cherry tree and the axe. If \"Culture A\" was going to cut down a tree, and had 10 hours to do it, how many hours would they spend sharpening the axe?\" The polish would sharpen the axe, and a backup axe, for 9.5 hours. The Irish? They cut it down last week. My point? The spread between preparing for the act, and doing the act, varies wildly, and can be a VERY common source of frustration ALL around.Anyways, good luck. I've both enjoyed at times, and hated at times, working with various European engineering cultures.",

They want employees to be in a constant state of fear, anxiety and subservience to their manager.The solution is to have a huge 1 to 2 years of monthly expenses saved up. Then you dont have to give a fuck about your performance while you wait for the inevitable layoff. I keep $100k in hysa just for a layoff scenario - it took 5 years to accumulate, which was tough at the time, but my anxiety level was greatly reduced. This hysa stack is seperate from stocks/bonds/401k/529/real-estate etc - those are not your emergency fund. Some people say $xxx in cash is too much - but thats not my problem. This is what I need for my mental safety net and you may need more or less for yours.My last layoff, I got $20k severance and 2 months where I was paid salary but could spend the time searching - and I luckily got a job lined up before the clock ran out. The time before, it took me 2 months to find a job, but severance was only $10k. So I had to dip into my savings, despite unemployment checks. You should look up the weekly max unemployment benefit for your state and factor that into your plan. TLDR: Layoffs are inevitable. Stressing and extra effort will not save you from it. Fuck your employer. You need to stop worrying about stack ranking and layoffs, and instead worry about reducing your expenses and stacking your emergency fund. Use your anxious energy to plan and prep. Once you are prepped and have enough stacked, your anxiety will go away.",

I'm scrambling to upskill but I'm starting to read the writing on the wall, we need the market to get better and asap. Or for current development practice to blow up in most companies faces. It requires so much more manual control/oversight and I bet 90% are taking shortcuts that will eventually cause everything to collapse. Although if they can just limp it along another 6-7 years they can once again blame current devs (who were forced to make bad decisions due to agile) and get another consulting project to redesign into whatever flavor of data structure is popular at the time. If we just stepped back and talked about responsibilities and how to best structure the work we could really build some awesome stuff but it would require two teams, an agile and a core team. Agile works it so far but eventually tossed it back to the core team who properly builds it out (now that the nitty gritty details have been identified) and the cycle continues",

Note that this DOES NOT mean going back to school. If it doesn't interest you, then you still have a 4 yr degree. Most people don't even end up working in their degree field over the course of their working life. It still gets you through the HR screen of having a degree. Ultimately, though, you need to determine what you are good at and how to align that with career opportunities. First get out of that house tho.",

If you want to break through it you'll need to take some risks and really push yourself.If you can, find a new team in the org to work in. What would be better though, if possible, would be to get a new job entirely.Most people move jobs for a salary increase, but another big part of it is the ability to sort of \"start over\" from step 1. Obviously if you're coming in as a senior engineer or something they'll expect you to onboard a bit faster, but you'll have that opportunity to start off asking those clarification questions and gaining that deep understanding without feeling like you're desperately behind. I've talked to other engineers about this exact feeling before and while some people boil it down to things like \"imposter syndrome\" the cold hard truth is usually that you actually aren't good enough at the moment. There have been critical mistakes made early on in your career that have stagnated your growth as an engineer and sometimes the best thing to do is simply acknowledge that you're in a position where growth is no longer possible and move on.Aka, you can try and fix the soil or you can just plant your seeds somewhere else. Both options are perfectly valid, but I've found that most people find it easier to improve with a small do-over period. It's a daunting prospect though I won't lie.Keep in mind this only applies if you want to be one of the giga-nerd seniors who seem to solve every problem and know every code solution. There's nothing wrong with just doing your job. Not everyone wants to grind it out and become an SME. You can also take your knowledge and look to pivot into management now that you're a senior. Less technical and more people heavy if that's your style. I just think you'd benefit from a new perspective is all.",

Don't try to get it perfect the first time, because it's impossible. Just mock something up that you think is what they want, take the feedback, and iterate as needed.

I know people without certifications who know their stuff, and I know people who have certifications who don't seem to know anything. Of course there are people with certifications who also know their stuff. You'll never be in a perfect scenario where you're evaluated exactly as another candidate, and the only difference is one has a certification. The other thing to factor in is that hiring isn't a simple, one-person process. There are various filters you need to get through. A certification will mean less to a lot of technical people, but it may mean more to a recruiter. You need to get past the recruiter to get in front of an interviewer and a hiring manager. If you already have lots of cloud experience and knowledge, they won't really add much for you. If you don't have the experience, then they can be helpful for you with some companies.",

A higher level cert might get an interview, but real world experience is still needed. It also depends on circumstances - if a company is starting their cloud journey and current employees lack upskilling, having a cert is more valuable. But if there are already team members that \"know cloud\", I might be willing to let a teammate ramp up and learn on the job.Personally, I've only pursued training/certs when it was paid by my workplace. That being said, I've worked with a ton of contractors that are basically useless yet have a bevy of certs, so clearly people are getting hired.",

They tell me whether a candidate can memorize things (or cheat!) well enough to pass a test. All I want is to sit down and write some code with the job applicants. Structured thinking, the ability to break down a problem, and the discipline to write clean-ish code are the hard parts. If you can do that I'm confident you can read AWS documentation and figure it out.[Edit: I guess I don't ignore them entirely. If you claim AWS experience or you have AWS certs, I'm going to ask questions about how you'd decide between two different AWS products. For example, when would you use a lambda vs an ecs task? How would you decide between the two? If you claim to have experience I'm going to expect a sane answer.]",

Even if they're not part of your specialty, you can start to get familiar with them to help out more in the future. Look through the code for any TODOs.2. Scan the code for vulnerabilities. Depending on your stack, there are several tools out there to use. Even if you dont have access to any tools, you can double check no vulnerabilities are associated with any dependency versions on your project.3. Upgrade project dependencies. This one can be tricky and requires a lot of regression testing.4. Update, create, and improve junit test cases and test case coverage. Create/improve mock services5. Improve CI/CD. Add quality of life features6. \\^Build internal tools to help with automation and testing such as a data generator.7. Improve dashboard and alerting capabilities. Check if there are any metrics you can track that will help alert you of any issues with your project. If none exists, create a metrics dashboard or try to get your team/company to adopt one from the various providers. You could even keep it simple and create a cron job on a linux server that executes a script daily to pull metrics from your logs and database to alert you of any issues. Though there better solutions.8. Study anything related to your job. Learn what you need to in order to eventually help your teammates with their load. Learn more about intricacies of the languages used in your stack. Research tools and libraries that may help your project. Sometimes you can be the one to introduce new technology to the stack that improves something you already have or completely replaces it for some benefit or another.9. Update project documentation. You could also create guides for any new people that may join the team in the future10. Innovate. Maybe you can figure out a good way to leverage AI in your project. Don't immediately jump to an LLM. You might not even need AI and an LLM might be overkill if you can use traditional AI/ML.",

I was working a quarter of the time and doing three times the workload.Turns out everyone doesn't instantly go \"oh I remember how to do that\" and fix it on the first try. They had to make multiple attempts and took much longer. Granted there are times I too get stuck and it takes me a bit.Turns out I have autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or audhd and at every job I leave, they have to hire three people to replace me and they still can't get the work done.They will not do it right the first time, they will not automate something if they have to do it twice.The result is that I constantly am able to get much more work done, and consistently keep getting more free time because I keep automating things.There's close to a hundred thousand people in our organisation, there are six of us like this in the company. We were specifically asked to join a new team, in addition to our regular roles, and we just solve problems no one else can understand. We automated that too.I spend a lot of time learning.Edit:Sorry, kids started fighting. I'd recommend you spend the time learning, first; whatever you are interested in, secondly; things that would benefit your career, third; things that will benefit your company, fourth; think of any way to automate literally anything you have to do and see if you can automate it. The \"saving ten minutes a day\" automations really start to add up.",

There seems to be a pattern here, you need to look into career coaching and figure out any gaps in how you are handling your jobs.Keep the AMD role on your resume. Removing it creates a gap of twelve months between graduation and your next role. Most hiring managers view a one-year post-graduation gap as a greater risk than a short stint at an established firm like AMD. The brand name helps confirm your technical skills.Your current challenge is the total number of jobs you have held in a few years. You must change how you present your history during interviews. Instead of justifying why you left, explain that you have learned that high-growth startups do not provide the structure you need. State that you are now prioritizing stability and long-term projects.Focus your search on large companies in the automotive or consumer electronics sectors. These industries typically have the HR resources and management training that startups lack. You need an environment where the requirements are documented and the management style is predictable. This shift will help you break the cycle of short tenures and build a more consistent professional record.",

All of the interviews were semi-position agnostic meaning I could get an offer for mid-level or senior if offered at depending how the interviews went. Ended up getting a mid-level offer, which feels somewhat lateral if not almost a step down in responsibility, but was a jump in salary. With my previous org facing impending layoffs it wasn’t anything to wring my hands over. Frankly, cold applying doesn’t feel super great right now. If you get the opportunity to connect with a recruiter (mine reached out to me via InMail on LinkedIn) take advantage. People are definitely hiring, but the open positions don’t exactly match what they’re posting on the internet from what I’m seeing.",

Contracting companies put in a bid, one gets the contract, and then they have a cutover date when they will take over.Stupidly, many seem to think they can do the same job with half the people, half as qualified, find out they can't and then they need qualified bodies at a discount price.That's where you come in! You get to go pee in a cup and see if you can manage to get to a drug test without being drunk or high, and if you can, you get to go replace keyboards that aren't broken, screens that work, and generally throw out a lot of good equipment that \"nobody wants\" because someone else used it for a month.Once they figure out you can think, you will get called to \"blue screens if death\" where you turn on the second monitor and wonder why they are still running windows XP with all this corporate data, and in the network.You will get calls to figure out what is wrong with the computer that has some error on it that no one can tell you what it is, it says \"no ram detected\", but they can see the RAM in there, so it should be working, right?Don't forget the calls to unmute the executive microphones, dial phone numbers on touch screens; and turn on computers everyone said were on, but they were off (even though the blinky lights by the phone cable in the back are on).Make friends, hop jobs, hop contracts, (always sign the contract for the job you want regardless of what your current boss says they will give you, you can always decline of the boss comes through {but they won't}).After you've been doing that, look for work in your neck of the woods doing point of sale support and general IT for contracting companies.When you finally find the job you want and get, great, you will have lots of experience.If you are lucky enough to work at a place that has commute and they bus the workers in, bring a laptop and work on personal projects on the bus to and from work.",

This company is also nuts to expect a single developer to fully manage 4 different software projects.If I were in your shoes I'd take this as a learning opportunity and move on when I can. You're not a bad developer. You're working for a non-technical company that is in over their heads as a relatively new developer with 3 years of experience. Software engineering is one of those things where you think you know something but you're constantly realizing you know nothing at all.I'll also point out that this early in your career it's extremely beneficial to work alongside other developers so you can grow your skills via osmosis. It's important to work alongside experienced people who do things the \"right\" way. From my own experience lone wolf engineers usually pick up a ton of bad habits. Usually because they're on their own and nobody can help them learn and apply proven techniques.\\- Senior engineer, 20 years experience.",

Acknowledge that you understand they cannot give specifics, but what you're looking for is identifying if there are any general themes in your performance that you may have a blind spot around.I've had a shockingly good response rate from recruiters who hopped on a quick call with me and told me what exactly went down. I've actually had recruiters read me the interviewers feedback a couple times. I've also gotten zero response or a generic answer, but it never hurts to ask as long as you acknowledge and respect that it's standard policy at most companies to not give specifics and you don't expect that.That makes you not sound like you're going to be all salty and bitter and are going to argue with them about the feedback and so on.

I'd recommend looking for contract work for projects in resource extraction areas. Think big mines that have 2000 computers that need to be maintained and also upgraded every few years.Having your degree (?) means you will have no issue with the software side and you will be able to learn the hardware side better. Once you have a few years experience there, look for jobs back home with contracting companies or actual companies themselves that support point of sale devices for merchants, do a few years of that.Then you have software, hardware, and point of sale support and you can do some social networking with local tech support companies and you might have better luck back home.The problem that I encountered when I was trying to break in, is I was competing with all these 40 year old people with 15 years experience that were moving back, and I just couldn't stand up against them.Now as it turns out where I am it is super rural, good help is hard to find, I found a great job, 20 min from my door to my desk, and it is a nice town; so I stayed, but I prefer a more rural setting. I know lots of people that got their experience and moved back.Heck, I know of a few people that got hired on with internal companies, did a few years in town, then went home and supported things there.Good luck!",

It sounds like you have no internship/apprenticeship experience, so that's the sort of role you should be looking for. Seek out contracting firms and recruiters, there's one on Michigan named Blue Chip. I'm sure your state has something like it.Finally, contact any careers department at your college.

The same way being the cream of the crop of marketers can be lucrative but it’s not for everyone. And as markets condense, squeezing out many, you’re unfortunately left with few roles, with cheaper pay, and likely more cause for nepotistic hiring.The difference is unemployment rates are sky high for CS atm, less jobs, and more applicants from senior positions from layoffs at big named places. So you have juniors and mids competing with seniors for lower paid roles. Ignoring these factors during a transition in the market is like saying if you’re passionate about being a lift operator you can stick it out while the industry changes? No, you move before it affects your life personally. (Before the pedantics, yes I know lift operators aren’t the same, pick whatever you like though, I just mean a role that becomes harder to attain and lower pay as companies believe they don’t need them. Maybe creative writing currently, or basic web dev that you can just get some web generator from many hosting sites when you only need a simple single page site)",

Then slowly introduce help as you progress, you’ll know when as you’ll feel more confident over time.I’m expecting this to be a “hot take” opinion but imagine a surgeon “not understanding biology and just vibing the surgery”.",

Don't be afraid to use it in the right manner.For example, I typically try to come up with the solution to an unfamiliar problem on my own until I have a working solution or an almost working solution, then consult AI to confirm if my code snippet is doing things optimally. Oftentimes, it is not. Understand why the optimal solution works, and then implement it. Next time you run into a similar or the same problem, tailor it according to what you learned without using AI as a crutch.If the problem is way too complex for you to understand at all, ask an experienced or senior dev for a high level overview of what you need to do.",

We can't do much in the way of asynchronous agents, because all of our non-github code and python packages are hosted internally, and github-hosted agents can't access internal resources.

Try to make your apps conform to this \"template\".I recommend to read these books in order:1. [The Missing README](https://a.co/d/eVMjgII)2. [Scalability Rules, 2nd Edition](https://a.co/d/j0dQVbm) (no longer being printed, but can be found in PDF online).3. [Building Microservices](https://a.co/d/c3i06pq)4. [Release It!](https://a.co/d/5Gg1CBt)5. [Designing Web APIs](https://a.co/d/c7I3WTH)Don't learn CI/CD \"by hand\". Learn the Infrastructure as Code approach either using Terraform or AWS CDK.That should take you pretty far. It'll take around a year and a half to finish everything (could be less depending on how much time you put into it).Good luck!",

        "body": "Your resume has significant room for improvement I have some recommendations that could make a major difference in how recruiters perceive your candidacy.The most critical issue is your experience section. You have too many bullet points per role (standard is 3 to 5 maximum but since its one company around 5 is okay, maybe 6 if it’s really really worth it), and more importantly, they lack substance. When you write something like “Diagnosed systemic product-line defects, implemented robust fixes,” you’re not telling recruiters anything useful. What defect did you find? What made your fix robust? What changed as a result? Right now you’re describing tasks instead of demonstrating impact.Every bullet point should follow a simple structure: what you achieved, how you did it, and ideally with numbers to back it up. Instead of listing what you did, show what happened because you did it. Compare “Implemented automated testing” to “Cut deployment time from 6 hours to 45 minutes by building an automated testing suite in Jenkins that caught 80% of bugs before production.” One is forgettable, the other proves you deliver results.Your summary section needs to go entirely. It takes up valuable space without adding value, and it creates a wall of text that makes recruiters skip to the next resume. Remember, most people spend under 10 seconds scanning your resume initially. Every line needs to earn its place.With that space freed up, add more projects. Keep a rotating collection you can swap based on the role you’re applying for. Tailor them to highlight relevant skills for each position. Your current project description is far too vague and you’re missing an opportunity. If university teams are actually using what you built, name them specifically. That transforms a generic claim into proof of real-world impact.If you want to preserve some of the context your summary provided, move your skills section to the top. This immediately tells recruiters what you bring to the table and helps them understand everything else they read through that lens.Your formatting also has problems. Company name, job title, and dates should all be on one line for ATS compatibility. Include months with your dates, not just years. Separating projects from education will also improve scannability and make both sections easier to parse quicklyHope I don’t come off as too harsh. Good luck!",

That DO-178 niche is a double-edged sword – supper valuable in a few places, but feels like it looks you out of everything else. Also totally get the \"not passionate about coding anymore\" thing after dealing with all that documentation and process.A couple things that helped me pivot:1. Start looking at adjacent regulated industries ASAP. Medical devices (FDA stuff), automotive (especially with all the autonomous driving safety standards), even some fintech. Your experience with rigorous development lifecycles is a HUGE sell there, way more than generic web dev skills. I framed my resume around \"safety-critical systems\" and started getting way more bites.2. For the interview problem – if you're bad at LeetCode, stop banging your head against it. Seriously. I started targeting smaller companies and non-tech-first industries where the interviews are more practical/take-home based. Still technical, but less \"reverse a binary tree on a whiteboard.\"3. Lean into your Agile/Scrum experience. Look for \"Technical Project Coordinator\" or \"Scrum Master\" roles at tech-adjacent companies. Your SWE background + people skills is a legit combo there.Honestly, what helped me make sense of the whole message was reading this guide called \"AI Layoffs: The Complete Survival Guide for Job Seekers in 2026\" by Careery. Kinda cringe title, but it had a solid section on repackaging niche experience for other industries. Made me realize my aerospace background wasn't a dead end, just needed different framing.For sanity: limit Job apps to 2-3 hours a day Max. Network informally on LinkedIn with people in Target companies (just ask about their work culture). The rejections are brutal but they're not a reflection of your worth – the market's just genuinely terrible right now.Hang in there. The aerospace mindset (systems thinking, risk aversion) is actually valuable in way more places than you'd think.",

It's a *lot* of money with the Canadian dollar as it is, but in terms of quality of life, I see it as a point where more money won't do that much while the environment will do a lot more. My sample size is too small to say if this is \"lots\", but certainly it stood out to me. I do know of at least a number of people not moving who have stated positions similar to mine, but that admittedly doesn't mean much, as they probably weren't the types to move to the US anyway (I certainly had no desire even before 2025).",

That, combined with the really low pay, make me think it’s probably a pretty small company that kind of doesn’t know any better. They’re probably going for someone early career who is passionate and knows their stuff. If that person were smart, they wouldn’t stay long. A single person could do the work, but their pace would be slow from being stretched so thinly. I’m skeptical of the environment given some of the assumptions, but it could be a decent early job from a resume-building perspective. It lists as part-time and internship among the job types. This job sounds a lot like a couple part-time jobs I had while in school. My hunch is their expectations will be lower than what you’re expecting from the job description. Could be a small business or a university. If you hit the top-end of what they’re offering, that’s over $60k a year. That’s on the low-end for a dev, but given some of the posts you see in this sub, some of those people would kill for this job. Not every job is part of an enterprise software team, and it can be an opportunity for someone to start.",

Most software devs have to be at least a little \"jack of all trades\" and doing whatever it takes to get things done is normal and a valuable skill to hone.> I failed every single deadline.Honestly, for an intern working solo, that's kinda par for the course. I don't think that says that much about you. And for that matter, often times, issues with deadlines is not an individual dev problem, but a management problem.> And more than once, I had to (not by my choice, but it did sort of help once) go on weekends to catch up.I know the pressure can be hard to avoid, don't work weekends. It's common that deadlines slip and stuff takes longer than expected. It shouldn't generally be a \"work extra\" thing, particularly not for no extra pay. From a practical standpoint, I understand it if your job is on the line (the economy and all), but resist the pressure under normal circumstances.Overall, sadly, intern positions on solo projects aren't that uncommon, yet are obviously bad for the intern. Mind you, you also don't fit the typical case of an intern, as you are actually a new grad. I think the biggest thing to get used to is the idea that it's okay for work to not be finished. You're not actually being paid by task. And yes, solo projects are strictly worse for a new person (or arguably any person) in pretty much every way (hard to get help, isolating, more likely to have incorrect estimates, etc). You'd probably have a better experience working on a project with an actual team, though I'm not sure how realistic of a possibility that is for you on the short term.",

Maybe not about technical best practices (since those are best learnt while working with a team with seniors directing development and giving you feedback in PRs), but you end up coming out of this with a healthy fear of forced estimates, you learn how to communicate with people who disagree or are displeased with you, and you'll generally perform much better when the inevitable crisis hits at your next job.

But once you're burned out, that's it there's no going back. The most you can do now is manage what you can at work and take care of yourself better and hope you get better over time or if there's not much in your control then you probably need to leave the situation.The only other thing you can do is reexamine the situation to see if there's an end in sight. If there is maybe you can stick it out. But if it's not caused by a specific situation but rather the environment there may be no end in sight and spinning your wheels hoping it'll get better will just lead to worse burnout.To me it sounds like you're in a bad environment where they're trying to take advantage of a cheap intern. Internships in the dev industry are supposed to be intros to the company so that an intern can decide if they want to take a job there or not, or they might be part of getting college credit. Smart companies don't make long interns manage a whole giant project with moving parts and deadlines, that'd just be idiotic of them. They should be showing the interns that \"this is a nice place to work and you should come back after you graduate\".You now have some good experience now though, I'd say you should cut your losses and take that experience and start hunting for your first full time job.",

I can count up to 10 projects that I would begin and then never have the motivation to want to finish them. I struggled immensely with backend development. It was so hard to pick up and start that when it came time to work on any backend stuff (after finishing the frontend) for my projects, I would just cave in and give up. I recently picked back up on application that I sort of gave up on around a year ago and have been implementing new pretty lengthy features in terms of getting endpoints implemented and a SQLite database because of what I have learned at work. This isn't the same for everyone, but I have definitely started to enjoy working on projects more at home.

Planning includes design, functionality, technical requirements, etc. Feel free to use AI as well, but don’t get in the trap of using it for everything. Side projects should be treated like goals. To be successful with goals, you need to have both short term and long term goals.

If you got a few frameworks/common libraries under your belt, along with DB knowledge (ORM is common these days), testing frameworks, being comfortable with git etc… then at that point, it’s just a numbers game and landing that first role which is always the hardest.",

As for Django vs FastAPI, I think (?) Django is more common in industry, but id advise you go on LinkedIn and look at job postings yourself and see whats in demand, especially so that you know what other relevent technologies there is to learn (e.g. docker and AWS).",

More OT the longer the slack off. I also give my people the slack off time. Example is hard push, release out it is ok everyone be available, respond on slack if need be but dont worry about anything else. That means I will most likely be playing a video game with my phone next to me. I have gone to the grocery store, took a nap, built a lego set. Largely I refuse to do to much work and I have clear boundaries. Even during crunch time I sign off at 6pm and will not come back until 9pm to get any extra work done and I dont start my day early. Most of the time I sign off at 530-6 and I am done until the next day. I walk out of my home office and dont walk back in.For most of my over 13 year career I work a normal 40 hour week, dont stress about deadlines and do my job. it is done when it is done.",

Your hospitality and freelance background is a big plus.Keep labs practical (Linux, networking, basic cloud), document everything on GitHub, and learn how to explain what you built in simple terms. A basic cloud cert later on would help. Yes, this is enough to apply for help desk, IT support, junior sysadmin, or NOC roles in London.Salary wise, £26k is realistic, and £28k is possible in London, especially with strong communication skills. In 2 to 3 years, you can move into cloud support, junior DevOps, or SRE adjacent roles if you keep building, certifying, and switching roles strategically. Good luck !",

I was confused when he told me the job title because i did not remember applying there.

Most people that I see super concerned about a bump in pay or quality of job find that this degree will disappoint (both in time management during it and career results after). You'll have a better career because you are a better engineer but that connection doesn't immediately translate to a bump in compensation.This degree is great if you're targeting a specific area to break into (I'm learning a lot in ML I wouldn't otherwise) but many people in the program already have the job they want and are just trying to expand the ceiling long term or learn for the sake of learning.",

You simply become another statistic that complains about the job market, because you put in 3,500 resumes and got 4 total responses, 3 of which declined you and one got you through. In my experience so far just doing it by hand I have yet to have a job completely ghost me and I am currently sitting at 12 applications. Mind you these were all declines still, and I will have to hunt for a little while. I do use Ai, specifically for cover letters though, but more of a guidance than fully copy pasting. Everything comes from me, but using Ai to get the thoughts flowing rather than sitting there and spending an hour on each letter that nobody will read just makes sense. I can get the creative juices flowing and type away the letter in about ten minutes or so. So, there is certainly a usefulness to Ai.I also certainly do not want to tell you which way is better over the other. It is literally a matter of do you want to manually apply to 50 - 200 places and have a higher chance of hearing something back? Or do you just want to apply to every job on the planet and not hear zip except for a couple gold mines? Believe me, there are a ton of people out there not using Ai at all or even experienced it, so they get a letter that sounds like a robot typed it (if they read it), it is going right in the trash. So it is really just that, quality vs quantity, they both can win, and in this situation they both win at the same time and lose at the same time.",

The ones with thousands of applications, hundreds, and the lucky ones with just a few, though they aren’t really complaining. I explained what the difference is clearly, low quality quantity vs lower quantity quality. You’re going to be in the trenches for both regardless, I’m not saying one is better than the other.Also, people always seem to have something to blame for not being hired. It’s almost as bad as New Year’s resolutions. Can’t wait for spring, maybe then the market will open up! Can’t wait for end of summer when interns leave! Can’t wait until tax season is over! Practically anything besides Christmas there are tons of jobs posted. Huffing the copium doesn’t make the economy any better or worse.

        "body": "In my opinion,You sound like me, 18 years ago. I kept chasing the dream and kept burning out and crashing. I wish I had been less stubborn and willing to listen to a mentor.I would recommend making the game development a hobby, make it for androids, and make it to fix specific table top game editions, like D&D.But I found that the more I worked at the fun, the less fun it was. Turns out I have a.d.h.d. and autism and if I had been able to be medicated through school, I would have been unstoppable.I was pretty bitter trying to find work in 2008-2011 in video games while learning and programming in C++ for \"the game\" I had in my head. Then once I would know what \"the game\" was, I would do some research and find out that someone else had the idea and had already done it.That's when it hit me, the ideas are a dime a dozen, and everyone has them; it's being able to make it into a reality and get it to market faster than the competition that gets the money.The secret, kookily enough, was watching the movie \"the secret\" and saying to myself \"If I am always saying that I am burned out and there are no jobs, then that is my reality\". So instead I said \"I am a positive person, pleasant to be around, I love people, and there are lots of jobs I would enjoy (each of those was a lie)\".I just had that mindset and I just flipped the job search rules on its head and I just applied for everything that looked interesting. I had one resume, one cover letter, a few letters of reference, and then I just \"cold job applied\", or \"shotgun approach\". I just stopped looking at the job, the description, the requirements, and instead of stressing about if I qualified for a job or tailoring my resume and cover letter for one hour and then applying for one job in two hours, I did a blanket google search, opened up the top ten results in tabs, and just went through uploading my resume and cover letter to sites and applying for as many jobs as I could. Some were an email, some were uploading documents, some were transcribing into their web fields, so some took a minute to apply to, some took 20 minutes. I just applied and applied and applied.I \"knew\" everyone else was going to be tailoring their resume to the job, so instead of me doing that for each one, I wrote the cover letter like it was a personal conversation between friends and I sold myself as an amazing worker and someone they wanted on their team.I'd been applying for about a day before I got a call for a job where they were looking for a permanent full time position (but I didn't know that cause I hadn't really read the job listing). I had a 2 year technical diploma and had just finished my 3rd year of a bsc in computer science, I was on summer break...So I went to the preliminary interview and fucking nailed it with my positive attitude and my honest answers of \"I don't know what that is or how to do it, but I honestly don't know what I am doing with most things. What I know how to do is know when I don't know, I know how to look something up, and I learn fast\".They ended up hiring me for a summer rather than any of the other full time applicants that they had. I fucking love automation and I get bored easily. It was a tech support job for a software development company, so everytime I answered a question, I templated the response. There's really only 20 questions anyone could have about this software, and I knew what they were cause I had been doing templated responses from May to July.In July I asked to get some screen recording and captioning software to make some tutorial videos; I made basic, intermediate, and advanced video tutorials, published them, and the calls stopped.I had automated myself out of a job, and then I went back to school and finished my fourth year.I had a competitive job offer from them half way through the year, full benefits, to come back and work for them. It was a great company, it got acquired during covid, but I did basically the same thing for them for 3 years before moving on.I just kept looking at something that had to be done more than once and figured out how to automate it.The moral of this story is sometimes you have to run before you can walk. Successfully selling yourself and taking initiative to do your job and improve everything, rather than just collecting a cheque allowed me to develop a specific set of skills.I work for a much bigger company now, \"work\" is a strong term. I do tech support and am on a team with other people where we get sent problems no one can figure out how to fix. We figure it out, fix it, and automate it.I never would have figured that out without actually doing it.",

For related art stuff I’ve made some animations recently (2D hand drawn digital animations) such as a basic looping character walk cycle from one angle and a few other simple animations, and I’ve also drawn some 2D digital art for a very brief unfinished game demo group project in university too but I didn’t end up doing any of the code for that one.

My only worry is the possibility that having formal diagnoses could lead to issues if I want to move out of the U.S. or cause discrimination based on having that on my medical record (more worried about autism as opposed to ADHD for that knowing how autistic people often get mistreated, seen as incompetent, and infantilized).",

Some are even training or fine tuning models and deploying that and using it in their apps. Some run models locally. I think the world is moving in the direction fo a full stack eng who knows all of the AI side as well instead of 2 separate teams",

You generally still defer to ML people if there's data set training or what have you etc.And like I said, IME full stack isn't really a know-everything role in practice, candidates for these roles simply don't have that level of depth. It's in fact hard to find people that can do well in DS&A and frontend specialization loops, and just about zero that can do both well and also be able to implement ML basics like k-fold.",

I don't know that I agree fully with your perspective on what it's nice to learn, but intense interview prep is absolutely not mandatory.Zero prep is pretty stupid, though, as then your first few interviews will just be your prep. Everybody in every industry needs to prep for interviews.You don't have to go crazy with months of leetcoding, but you should craft your stories about your past work. There's a big difference between a story that you actually wrote and one that you tell off the cuff. That's the important stuff, once you get out of the entry-level zone.For some companies you need to do leetcode, but it is very far from mandatory across the industry. If you want to work at a high paying big name tech firm, then you play by their rules. If you want to have a job that still pays pretty good and is maybe kinda chill, then don't worry about it. Prep like anyone preps for any job. Don't jump through the tech hoops.I've done less than 5 hours of leetcode across 8-9 years in the industry. It absolutely cost me offers, and in turn has definitely extended some of my job searches. I've failed plenty of tech screens that I know I would have passed if I was studying DSA. But I've liked all of my jobs, and I never felt compelled to pursue the algo grind.",

You can ramp up on that stuff in a few months when you need to or want to. I used to feel like you do, and I did not want to spend time making myself more marketable or worrying what recruiters thought. I just tried to do a good job at the job I had. Eventually I realized I was unhappy there for reasons that weren't going to change (in my case, it was extreme boredom, but it could be a lot of reasons.)I had a strong history in... C++, which even then was waning in popularity. Plus several weird proprietary languages and a whole weird proprietary stack and tools, so none of it was transferrable anywhere else. I had also failed to make connections outside my immediate co-workers, so I had very few connections at other companies or even people to serve as references.

Taking on IT roles in this manner is more of a matter of addressing the urgency of having to pay bills.Some people do manage to transition though, and it pretty much always boils down to acquiring the necessary skills and then proving them out in some manner, be it demonstrating internal impact via work that leverages SWE skillsets or by positioning oneself in an attractive manner when looking for jobs outside of the company.",
