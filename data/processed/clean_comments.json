Often I would concede to a different design, and after some time the team would arrive at what dimensional modelling advises. E.g they wanted to mix detailed data with aggregated snapshots in one table. I did not wantnto argue. I said \"well Kimball advises against this because its trouble\" and let them build it. After some time they split the fact tables into transaction and aggregate.It is not Kimball's ideas in the book, but experience of a wide industry practicioners over years of working with data. Now we have the cloud and storage is less limited. Our mental capacity still is limited, so it is easier to reason about facts and dimensions in separation, rather than a 100-column big table....and what about many to many?",

Since people are going to suspect LLMs anyway, I used one to try to reorganize it.I would probably add some testing too.---# Data Engineering Pipeline Checklist## 1. Requirements First- **SLA**: How fresh? (minutes/hours/daily) Daily reporting → no streaming needed- **Impact**: Cost of being late/wrong?- **Consumer**: Dashboards, ML, reporting?## 2. Architecture**Single source of truth**: One storage layer (warehouse/lakehouse/object storage). Everything reads from it.**Batch over streaming**: Streaming adds complexity (ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills). Default to batch unless real-time is essential.**Design for backfills**: Parameterized date ranges, versioned transforms, separate raw/modeled layers.## 3. Reliability**Idempotency**: Jobs must be safely rerunnable via partitioned outputs, overwrite-by-partition/merge strategies, deterministic keys.**Orchestration**: Use Airflow/Dagster/Prefect for retries, dependencies, visibility, parameterized runs. Avoid \"cron spaghetti.\"## 4. Observability**Minimum to prevent silent failures**:- Row counts/volume checks- Freshness checks- Schema drift alerts- Job duration tracking## 5. Performance**Optimize last**. Most slowness comes from bad joins, file layout, or moving too much data—not lack of Spark.**Fix basics first**: Partitioning, columnar formats, filter pushdown, avoid cartesian joins.## 6. Simplicity Rule**If your SLA is met with**: scheduler + Python/SQL + storage + basic checks**Then distributed systems add unnecessary complexity.****Use distributed systems when**:- Volume exceeds single-machine capacity (hundreds GB–TBs)- True real-time requirements (sub-minute)- Complex streaming aggregations- Multiple concurrent consumers need isolation",

Something lighter like Liftbridge (Kafka semantics, single Go binary, no JVM/ZooKeeper) or just NATS JetStream covers 90% of cases.On the storage side - totally agree on \"one source of truth, columnar, object storage.\" We're building Arc with exactly this mindset: DuckDB for compute, Parquet for storage, S3-compatible backend. No distributed cluster to babysit, SQL interface, handles GB-to-TB scale without the Spark tax.The line I use: if I can run the query on a single node in acceptable time, I don't need a distributed system.

For the first three months or so, while building the team, everything was smooth. But after that, I started feeling more or less the same way you described. When you’re the decision-maker, from system design to the nitty-gritty details, you’re also the one who gets blamed when things don’t work out. At one point, I even felt that juniors were contributing more than me because I was stuck in a loop of wrong decisions. But that’s okay. We are engineers, and we are supposed to try, fail, and learn until something works out. It can feel overwhelming to be your own north star at the beginning. I hope you start figuring things out soon. During my own period of doubt, my CTO once told me, “I’m happy that you’re demotivated. It shows you’re serious about your work, and when things don’t work out, you feel disappointed. That’s a great engineer trait.” So you do have a great engineer trait.

I’m certain that you’ve encountered that situation.This is why I generally caution younger engineers to avoid startups; it’s intriguing to potentially build everything from the ground up, and the money sounds great, but it’s just not a good fit for anyone who hasn’t done that architecture and design work in a more controller environment before.",

This is why we do proof of concept work - to try and gain significant confidence architecture/design will work before building it \"properly\".For what it's worth, being a solo DE is way harder than being a senior. Seniors traditionally work under tech/DE leads, and often with architects. Whether your title reflects it or not, you are actually doing the job of a **lead** DE.And of course, being solo, blame never spreads - it's all you. Teams I've been on as a senior have definitely fucked up, but nobody could blame me because I had very little decision-making power (just over my own lil' design pieces really).

Use draw.io or something like that to draw your architecture, and share that with your team before building it and review it to see if it is foolproof. Then go build your application to that architecture. Things will fall into place, and you’ll have a documented trail of why you made decisions. And for streaming itself, just use Spark structured streaming. And if you need to do a backfill have a classic Spark job set up for it. But put these things into a design doc before you even write one line of code, and you can review that design doc with your leadership or other engineers",

Back in January 2025 was when I was first hearing about ontologies and context engineering at conferences, and now in December 2025 I'm seeing a lot more articles and thought pieces on this. What typically follows are enterprise POCs where vendors will get first signal of adoption before you start seeing case studies that drive further adoption (if it shows success).So I argue 2026 we are going to see a huge emphasis on data modeling for AI, specifically for unstructured JSON data and vector databases.",

Unfortunately, nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution, and things often languish in MVP stage far longer than you’ll ever expect. Often the MVP is the P, and you’ll have to live with whatever architecture was originally built. Spreadsheet for a POC? Maybe… but MVP? Often a bad idea. For a website just displaying some data… probably a fine solution I grant you. But for anything more complex, no. How are you handling pushing the data? Do you have a Dev/PPE/Prod spreadsheet? Do you run tests to validate the data before it gets pushed live? How are you managing the schema of the spreadsheet against your application layer? What if you need to roll back? If your client can’t handle using git or some other workflow to update the data, I’d want some substantial guard rails in place if I am letting them edit production data. At least some type of defined deployment flow with validation and integration testing. A cloud hosted DB has pretty minimal costs. Databases have tons of advantages, but the one of the most important is they are robust and conform to a design standard with means that the next guy who comes along wont be stuck unpicking a bespoke spreadsheet solution.Also, DBs are not the only solution. I often favour config files in a git repo for dynamic data that I need to let clients manage. That way they can be CI/CD integrated, with any necessary deployment, version management, and testing built in.",

Protobufs are solid for data contracts. platform work is also really good experienceimo id lean toward offer 3. having a team means you can actually learn and grow instead of just firefighting all day. aws + python is the most transferable stack and platform engineering is a good direction. the solo DE thing in offers 1 and 2 sounds like a burnout speedrun tbhDatabricks is cool but not worth being the only DE on a team at 2.5 YOE.

If you want to grow fast and learn good patterns, I’d lean to Offer 3: AWS, protobufs, and two senior DEs is a really nice combo. If your heart is still with Offer 1 for stability, take it, but keep doing small Python projects on the side so you don’t drift too far into Scala-only land.",

We would not accept anything into our pipeline that failed the tests.The vendor knew of any issues immediately without one of our team members having to be online to qa.To implement, we basically kept track of what we expected the schema and checked the file against those expectations. If that passed, we loaded the data into Duckdb, ran our dbt source layer testing, then parsed the dbt results into something they could work with.

So if CSV has 15000 rows then the staging table has 15000 rows,Then based on the entity name, a lookup for biz rules to apply to import into the \"real\" staging. It's a PITA the extra step but it works. Once in a table, you use SQL syntax to parse the good data and flag the bad, to send back to the origin what was rejected and thus not loaded.Please test with a column called FirstName and put this inside: GREYBUSH,'\\\\Then see what happens. It made Snowpipe (python language) go KaBoooooom as the backslash is the escape character. It the Snowflake file format with a bunch of options, nuke the escape character so that there are none.Currently in Snowflake we have File Formats with a unique name for every vendor + every entity we receive.That dog cartoon \"What a mess?\" yup.Why we load as a blob? The biz units **DemandeD ThatT We Do PartiaL LoaD**, not to reject the entire file, if there are any bad lines. Like a carriage return + linefeed inside a column, text columns not wrapped in double quotes when they should be, a comma instead of a period for Decimal columns (French format), dates that are not YYYY-MM-DD, again, Europe/Quebec versus English North America. I get DD-MM-YYYY in these files, UTF-8, and French accents. It all works.So if you load in a \"binary\" way you maintain whatever UTF-8 or Iso6500 the file was sent as, and parsing is easy with sub-selects on every column. I run the biz rule analyzer first, and only for IsValidData=1 do we import. Then we use DB\\_SendMail function to the appropriate biz unit of the invalid data.Honestly, the code quality of SaaS and input forms have taken a serious nose dive since 2020's. What happens when you use the lowest bidder to build your SaaS system.HTH",

So, about 30% of your waking hours spent on work.Add in it being an SWE role, and you're effectively being paid to use your brain, engaging some creative and problem-solving skills, while sitting down for that whole time. You may even be able (depending on situation) not even have to travel to work most days.Pay may not be great in your country, but I'm willing to bet you can get away with not having to ruthlessly budget ... and you should slowly but steadily be building up a big enough pension to see you through decades of retirement.To be clear: this is perhaps the cushiest situation to have existed for someone subsisting on their own labour (rather than pre-existing capital) in human history.Not trying to be harsh here - I want to give you this perspective because I think it will ultimately help you.Get-rich-quick schemes are a pipe-dream: startups can be done, but you'll have to work far, far harder than you are right now, with less than 50% odds of success even under ideal circumstances ... and often for far longer than you may expect (I've worked in two successful startups that remained unprofitable for _a decade_, running off fresh rounds of investment until scale made the economics work).",

How is it not for so many people? What the hell do your employers demand of you? If I do \"overtime\" (lol fool me, I'm on a salary, but I can swing it as take a few hours off another day) it's because I have some weird compulsion to do so: something playing on my mind, something I want to progress or finish off; or some training/learning/research. Sometimes I'll feel a bit behind, or making up time for going in a bit \"leisurely\" in the morning.I enjoy the work I do - most the time - the tech is cool to use, I'm loyal to my employer to an extent (they've been fair, decent, and flexible) but I'm not particularly interested in the actual business or industry. Or the goal. Basically help the owners/shareholders/whatevers make more money? Cool, man... very fulfilling.OP, are you more entrepreneurial , do you want to work for yourself more than some company? I don't have first-hand context of that, but I can't imagine it would be easy, or even highly compensating - at first, at least. It's not me, but if that's you, more power to you!Is it the DE angle you've lost interest in specifically? And because the lag in landing a job, your interest simply waned? What is it you actually enjoy? Creating, problem solving, fixing or improving something? If you don't go out to work for yourself right away, is it realistic to keep looking for something else that fits better?Edit: Unless there's some radical shift in society and economy, we work because we need the money. Since I spend 40 hours of life a week doing it, I may as enjoy it enough. Find something you'll enjoy doing.",

I wanna practice and i have a good base that i can build on, I think working on projects would be a good start for me. I wanna begin with something simple like extracting data from an api and transform then load them into a db ,dw or snowflake for example, and automating them using airbyte/airtable for example, so the thing is i dont know where to start or where to find the ideas of projects, or should i just find/think of them on my own ?anyways i read the comments and i kind of agree with some who say that might just need to bear the boring and repetitive tasks that you dont like, and try to find the little things that you like or enjoy doing, till you find something else better.",

The job is to solve problems and achieve real-world objectives. Sometimes to do that we have to consider other constraints on the problem space, such as:- \"this technology is inferior, but it's battle tested and has loads of technical support staff backing it; we can't afford the risk of a new system going down and having no way to fix it\"- \"this technology is old, and therefore I can easily hire people who already know it, and there is a lot of documentation; the new one is great on paper but we need experienced staff to maintain it, and they are hard to find\"- \"this new technology is better than what we currently have in terms of technical performance, but we've rigged up enough custom ameliorations around the existing core tech that we will realise hardly any real world gains from switching\"- \"we would benefit from switching technologies in a measurable way, saving £50,000 per year, but it would take this entire team six months of work to move all our legacy code onto it. They have other, more pressing priorities and the benefit doesn't outweigh the cost of hiring a team of contractors to do it.\"But let's say you think there's a big pool of potential adopters for whom SQLMesh II would make business sense. It's not so easy to take a slightly superior technology and turn that into a going concern. dbt has mass adoption.Are you personally planning to fork SQLMesh and spend a substantial chunk of your time maintaining it, if Fivetran strip the original for parts? Perhaps you will fund this via a hosted version - will you be picking up the phone to pitch it to companies yourself, or will you use your own money to pay someone to do that?What will you do if Fivetran freak out as soon as you get traction and throw a bunch of engineers at making dbt good enough to kill your competitive advantage? Unlike SQLMesh-original-flavour, you don't have proprietary code; Fivetran have access to the same stuff plus a lot more resources.Remember, you _only_ get acquired if it makes business sense to them to spend the money on buying you out ... instead of on using their own engineering team to outcompete you. If that happens it's very good news for analytics engineering, but _terrible_ news for you as a founder. Typical outcome: nothing happens. The incumbent has no motivation to improve, and would-be founders have no ability to realise the gains for themselves, so do nothing to change this.",

Stop loading raw json into Redshift. You can probably try integrate.io and put it in front of Redshift. This means you connect the source APIs/logs and flatten the json arrays in flight.

        "body": "I'm doing a similar role, although at a very small firm - similarly no data culture to speak of, messy and fragmented processes and systems etc. I wouldn't have chosen it necessarily but some life circumstances have led me to it as a necessity at least in the short term. I'm also a humanities graduate who did the same pivot about 6 years ago.The major problem really is having zero reliability on upstream data which makes all analytics really difficult to do well. And cultural transformation is as important as technical in that scenario so you need to ask yourself if that's something you're willing to engage in - personally I feel the payoff is too uncertain versus the effort. On the generalist vs specialist question: you could stay a generalist if you want to go down one of 2 paths: 1) moving into management as quickly as possible or 2) carving out a niche as the 'first data hire'. In the second case, companies with no data team want a full stack data engineer / analyst / scientist who can do a bit of everything without investing in a whole team.If neither of those appeal, I would figure out what you enjoy most and focus on that. At least that's what I'm doing at my current place:1) building pipelines to move data around - focus on data engineering2) transforming data into usable, analytics ready data sets - analytics engineering3) speaking to stakeholders, answering business questions and building end user visualisation and analysis - data analyst4) building statistical / predictive models - data scientist6) strategy, leadership, management - project management, productI'm figuring out what I like most about the job, focusing efforts for the next 6 months on building stuff for that role specifically. Then I'm job hunting. This can be quite difficult given the demands of your firm might not align with what you want to do - e.g. if you want to be a data engineer and learn how to set up airflow on AWS but you've already got a vaguely usable set up using different tech, saying 'I want to learn this' might not cut it as a business case. You might have to figure out a way to be creative with the truth to get your way in that scenario, but honestly that's where your humanities background kicks in lol.So my personal take with these kinds of roles is that they rarely make sense long term. Use it to get the experience you want and feel you need and then move on to something else.You mentioned you like the architecture and design piece of the job - that's a good starting point and probably puts you more in the data engineering camp of the 6 roles above. Unfortunately 'architect' roles tend to be quite senior and you need to have some grunt work under your belt before unlocking those, but I imagine data engineering is the right place for that.Your tech stack is already a great starting point and tbh a good team will see python and SQL experience as enough - anything else is just learning tooling and reading the docs. I also think hiring someone who has stood up a serviceable stack on a shoestring budget with some creativity should be a more interesting profile than someone who just sets up Fivetran and Snowflake and calls it a day. But it might be worth just thinking through a simple pipeline and making sure you can talk credibly about all components of it - e.g. an orchestrator like airflow, a warehouse like BQ or Snowflake, etc. I think a good resource could be something like the Zoomcamp data engineering course - you could take a look at their materials and see if you can implement some of it at work.",

I'd say that's true of pretty much any role that's not the 'prototypical' FAANG data engineering role. It sounds to me like you're doing quite a good job given the situation. > Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?This is just my opinion, and there are many opinions on this topic. I personally have always leaned a bit more toward being a generalist, and it has served me well. I also pivoted from a humanities background (linguistics), and whether this is true or not, I've internalized that I'm never going to be the whiz kid of hard coding skills and deep mathematical and algorithmic knowledge. I do think a humanities background tends to help with communication, asking questions, and defining a problem, especially compared to many of the pure CS grads I've worked with. On some level the tools don't *really* matter too much, you're solving a similar set of problems and you'll have to use whatever tools the company you work for has available. I lean on my ability to learn when I've had to pick up new tools, workflows, and programming languages - so far so good.Obviously it's good to have a few areas where you build deep expertise, but I think this happens as a matter of course for most people anyway. I think there's probably some trade off where deeply specializing early on can net you higher pay sooner, with a somewhat higher risk of getting really good at something that doesn't exist in a few years. All of that being said, we're really talking about two extreme ends of a spectrum. Most people are going to end up de facto specialists in little sub niches over the course of a career, even if they are relative generalists in data tech.",

Data people are being Data&AI Engineers or full-stack data people.I also see, most of the companies are removing lots of their dashboards, keeping only the very fundamental ones. For the rest, you should build your data model & semantic layer. AI is doing the rest.Edit: Also, I forgot to say, maybe you should hire a data consultant for 1 day a week to check your data models & give you recommendations on architecture.

Probably as other have said around a title similar to analytics engineer.My guess is we end up with 3 core engineer roles - AI, Platform & Analytics. With the other key areas being governance/data management.Id just suggest starting to specialise in a function rather than focussing on an individual tools, after all, Excel will probably be flavour of the month again in a year or two :face_with_tears_of_joy:",

Note that through the majority of the history of data warehouses the principal platforms were general purpose databases like db2, oracle and sql server. In fact there's very few features in say snowflake that you can't find in the general purpose databases.A few considerations: * It all depends on your total data volume, the data volume your queries will be scanning, the number of queries, etc, etc, etc. * But a 10-20 TB data warehouse using Postgres can work absolutely fine. * Partitioning is critical * Summary/aggregate tables may be critical if you want really fast queries for dashboards, etc. I like to monitor my use of these like one would monitor buffer space / caches for transactional databases - and try to get 95+% of my queries to hit them. * Certain queries will benefit from the use of indexes. This can provide a significant edge to performance. * Configuring your database to support query parallelism is also critical at volume. * Database constraints are just as important in OLAP as they are in OLTP - and postgres can provide a ton of value here! You may need to turn them off on massive fact tables, but you can also use them at least with summary & dimension tables. * AWS RDS has pretty slow IO, but other hosting options can provide blisteringly-fast servers. But you may need to have postgres dba skills. * All the above assumes vanilla postgres. Adding extensions for duckdb, columnar storage (hydra), etc can provide faster performance in many cases.FYI: I migrated part of my snowflake reporting to postgres on RDS a few years ago in order to save a bunch of money. IIRC it was about $20k/month saved AND my queries were much faster. So, while I would not propose that a single node Postgres instance will always outperform a distributed database, there are absolutely scenarios in which it will.",

Installing pg_duckdb extension doesn’t change how the data is stored in Postgres it just allows you to query Postgres tables using the Duckdb engine. The main point of the duckdb extension is to attach to external tables in a lakehouse. Like read/write iceberg tables in s3. This allows you to query data across your lakehouse and Postgres db. BUT if your Postgres tables are getting bigger duckdb extension will not improve the query performance as the Postgres DB will be the bottleneck. If your data volumes are low 1000s of rows vs millions or billions of rows you can get away with Postgres.If you plan on high data volumes you can use duckdb to aggregate Postgres data with a datalake in s3 and then use ducklake or duckdb to query it.So no pg_duckdb doesn’t turn your Postgres DB into a data warehouse.",

Asking someone to “go faster” without fixing deployment order issues, data gaps, or validation rules is not actionable feedback. It is just pressure.If anything, the fact that you are documenting discrepancies, rebuilding inherited messes, and validating edge cases suggests you are doing the job correctly, not slowly. The risk is that you are absorbing systemic chaos personally instead of it being acknowledged as a team or org issue. That is not sustainable long term, and it is reasonable to say that out loud.",

As this will change the comments, based on your constraints.DuckDB for olap processing, easy install on a Linux-VM, only heard great things about it. Microsoft has the free SQL Server Express for OLTP - perfect for staging area - 10 gig limit per database - so have a DB per source and ingest, you'll have 2 cpu peformance and decent ram usage (16g I think, check Microsoft's web page).So what's nice with SQL Server Express is it plays nice with your AD and talks easily to other MSSQL systems, so you can avoid flat files when flat files don't make sense.If you want history of all changes, without the hassle of CDC, flat files on a massive file share dedicated for this, you basically emulate a datalake. If this file share system is Linux, there's probably Datalake compatible open-source you can use so you can do SELECT directly on the CSV/Json/XML flat files, just like a real cloud datalake. But I haven't done it - I'm sure someone here has.In any case, Google Big Query and even Azure Datalake are not expensive. Probably on-par with dedicated hardware costs internally adding a 4TB mirrored fileshare system, when costed and budgeted over 36 months.It depends on CAPEX versus OPEX, your boss should know this. Internal hardware adds inventory, and small companies can rent-to-buy-back over 36 months, even DELL offers this for hardware.",

Use pgvector to do vector inside Postgres.Or use ClickHouse instead which also fills those roles. Fast enough you can just do the transforms in the database, supports vectors, has an in-process engine called chDB if you need it which also doubles as a data science data frame lib.People always default to wanting a big bag of tools, but it just makes it more expensive. Most of the time, a database works just fine until you actually need to go wider.",

Anything that involves replication, multiple server coordination, especially a server that’s far away, etc etc is going to push you out of 15ms range. I’m pretty sure you can’t even publish a record to Kafka and consume it back in that kind of time if the Kafka cluster has standard replication a and lives in a data center a hundred miles away.Given what little you’ve shared, I might suggest getting a beefy machine, loading all the data into memory, and using something low level in Rust like [differential dataflow](https://timelydataflow.github.io/differential-dataflow/) or [DBSP](https://docs.rs/dbsp/latest/dbsp/).I don’t see how you break 15ms end to end latency using conventional stream processing tools.",

It’s a hassle at first, but if it means less business logic is owned by your team and is shared by analysts or other stakeholders it’s worth it. I’d get this written down though (been there done that and still end up owning business logic) or else it’s kinda just busy work, although still a great modernization project.Because at the end of the day if your team is still responsible for those transforms, why do any re tooling?

        "body": "> in this AI age, code production is a very cheap commodityCode production is actually easy on AI age. Good code paired with good engineers that understand the code and know how to locate issues, fix them, support customers and add features on what they have without disturbing what they did before is not.I've seen lots of junior engineers using AI tools as fit for all tools which result in many of them being clueless of what's going on. That's a tremendous risk for a company. When something goes wrong things goes wrong in a big way. Tools have no accountability or responsibility but engineers do. Tip for engineers out there: AI tools are a game changer but NEVER deploy code you don't understand.> Unit tests and component-specific tests are worthlessMaybe if you miss what's the purpose of unit tests. I see lots of engineers using unit tests to give them coverage or just as a way to look responsible but mostly the tests are so tied to the components that are not testing anything specific. If there are edge cases on potencial user inputs that should be tested to guarantee that no one removes the actual piece of code that does the validation or fallback on the inputs. So I would say: bad tests are detrimental, good tests are amazing guard rails.> Dependencies has to be explicitSounds like a no-brainer but it's actually hard to enforce that because many teams/engineers lack the discipline to do so and only value that once the s* hits the fan (somehow similar to skipping the tests)> nowadays you can build something in 1 hour and wait 2-3 days for reviewBad engineering culture drives that. Mostly people are valued by the litres of code they add or the features they add (even if unbaked). Code reviews are good for aligning, learning and guaranteeing some standards. Running pipelines costs time and money so it's not the case they are free. So maybe code reviews investment might be something people should lean on.> REALLY GOOD data engineer (that can communicate well with business, solid data modeling skills, deep technical expertise to design efficient storage/compute, etc) rather than hiring 5 “okay” data engineersNot that linear. You need good leadership that knows what's implemented, running and what your customers want. You need to make sure that everyone understand what's going on and why the things are the way they are, that's essential part of leadership. When it comes to ambiguity and a decision needs to be made you need someone that is a good leader and has a strong sponsor (CTO, VP, Director...).If there is no leadership, sense of direction and accountability/responsibility is something exoteric even the best engineer will not be able to do the change and in that case maybe the 5 cheaper engineers might ship out more (despite risking shipping the wrong things at the wrong time with arguable quality).So, in other words, your 5 cheap engineers are not an alternative to the \"good\" engineer but rather a combination of both.",

Even though they are some differences and additional features the price tag is not low. I think $100 / user / month.

Is the framework any better, or do you like having more control over the process?Save your raw data to a more modern file format with proper data types (e.g. Parquet, AVRO) - do you need to do any transformation on the source data to make it fit? Are there any unexpected issues with the data that you have to handle?Load your data into a local database, either directly from source or from your raw files. Then you can start running proper SQL queries against your data and get some practice with querying databases in general. DuckDB comes to mind, it's powerful and lightweight with good support across many languages.Do some transformations on the data - consider cleansing data quality issues, perhaps normalising the structure, or transforming it into a better shape for Data Science modelling. You could do this with some bespoke code, or look into transformation tools like dbt or SQLMesh.Build some visualisations of the data to build more of a story around the data than just raw values.In each case, try out multiple tools. If you're using Pandas, consider trying Polars or Ibis, or leveraging DuckDB's APIs. What do you like about each one? What do you dislike? Even if you're achieving the same goals with each, its good to get a feel for the differences in each tool and form your own opinion.",

Infra is difficult as it’s usually cloud specific which is expensive as a student. Ingestion is the easiest entrypoint as it’s available (oauth2, reading from databases, building ingestion framework as software etc). The business modeling is difficult as a student as it’s very business and kpi centric so you likely need to learn it at a job. So focus on ingestion/orchestration.",

Specifically what helped me the most was knowing1. Some basic statistics like: * Mean, median, mode * Variance and standard deviation * Probability distributions * Confidence interval2. Some linear algebra like: * Vectors and matrices * Matrix multiplication * Eigenvalues and eigenvectors * Dot product and cross product3. Some basic calculus * Derivatives and gradients * Integrals * Chain rule4. Some discrete math like: * Sets and set operations * Logic and Boolean algebra * Functions and relations * Trees and traversalsNow these are the things that I need to perform my job at my organization but the most important skill is SQL. Our organization uses Google Cloud so infrastructure building with Terraform was also a skill I had to pick up while working.Hope this helps :)",

This is mostly done with dag selection methods too and not actually looking at the graph as unpronounceable mentioned.When responding, it makes it so much easier to handle comms and prioritization when you know what teams or services will be impacted, but definitely depends on how expensive outages are for your team. Second big thing that comes to mind is with respect to performance and cost.

Your ability to be a good junior engineer isn’t pinned on a specific technology, so I wouldn’t worry too much about that. A company focused on Snowflake today could switch to Fabric or Databricks tomorrow. Now as you get more senior, you’re going to want to specialize in something which does narrow your focus but it’s way too early to worry about that now. So net/net…I would go with your internal role and learn everything you can. Focus on your skills being transferable and you will open quite a few doors in a couple years.",

There are plenty of rich learning opportunities with Fabric. Yes, it has paper cuts. Yes, sometimes picking the right tool feels like deciding whether to eat your meal with a grapefruit spoon, a butter knife, or a plastic spork. But I am learning and growing, no regrets at all in that regard. I'm writing PySpark every week (with lots of help from ChatGPT Plus :grinning_face_with_sweat:) and learning more about delta tables than I ever wanted to.And if I wasn't a massive, massive Microsoft shill, I'm confident that after this project is done I could hard pivot my career to Databricks if I wanted to. Snowflake slightly less so. So, I can't give you a neutral opinion, but I'm happy to answer any questions.",

Fabric is as popular as a fart in a spacesuit in this sub, but it is data engineering. The technologies you mention, Python, SQL, pipelines etc are all transferable to other \"real\" platforms. There are a lot of opportunities just now with people migrating from Power BI and Synapse to Fabric, so it could also be a good career move financially.And with AI, the ability to write pipelines and code in Databricks or Fabric (or anything else) isn't going to matter so much. I'd concentrate on really getting to understand your data and building relationships with your user base, translating requirements into actual deliverables.

The exact DQ checks you need to implement depends on your use case, but the ones that you’re listed - will be already a huge step forward if you have none now. For the love of God don’t event try to build your own DQ framework, so many teams make this mistake. Instead use some of the already available open-source solutions, some of them are very very good. Testing is also very important part of pipelines, which are unfortunately neglected by most of the DE teams. It will make sure that your commit editing “pipeline A”, won’t alter the logic of “pipeline B”. End-to-end Testing is the best thing you can do for your Data Architecture. Create a small sample input dataset, dozen of rows usually is enough. Create expected output dataset. Run pipeline on using sample input as source and compare your actual output with expected output. Do it on every merge to main branch. Very simple, straightforward but gives you a lot of confidence in you data pipelines. It requires some simple CI/CD pipeline and probably separate env to run the tests but data quality always comes with a price, like all good things in this life :)",

IMO it’s an extremely hard problem to solve if you want to get beyond basic questions like how much did client x spend in q4 or whatever.I think the approach you are describing is probably as isolated and secure as you could possibly need to get, and may not be flexible enough to provide real business value. But it depends on what sort of questions you want the agent to answer. If you want agents to do things actual human analysts are currently doing, I think allowing the ai to explore the schema and basically do multi turn “deep research” with access to a large portion of the warehouse plus a semantic layer explaining tables and data relationships is probably going to be needed. My current opinion is that if I was going to something as isolated and controlled as what you are describing I might as well just build a dashboard with those curated views available.",

We’re not trying to recreate a human analyst doing open-ended exploration (yet). We’re aiming for safe, repeatable workflows first.. the stuff that’s painful today because it’s frequent + operational (support, RevOps, CSM, finance ops), not really deep research or exploration. 2. Dashboards are great when questions are known and stable. Agents get interesting when the question is variable but still bounded, e.g. “why did churn risk spike for these 20 accounts?”, “summarize anomalies by segment”, “draft an escalation note with the relevant context,” etc. The way we're thinking is that these sandboxed, curated views/tools are guardrails - the agent still does the synthesis + narrative + next-step suggestions.3. We’re also treating schema exploration as a separate (higher risk) capability. I agree that to do real analyst work, you probably need: semantic layer + table relationships + multi-turn exploration. But letting an LLM roam your warehouse is also where we foresee getting: cost blowups, accidental joins into sensitive tables, hallucination and more. One more reason we’re starting constrained: **repeatability.** For some of the agent tasks we're aiming for, it’s almost mandatory for teams to yield the same answer for the same/similar questions (or at least the same underlying definition/query) every time. So our plan for now is: **start constrained → earn trust → expand surface area (curated views + sandboxing allows us to do that)** ideally with a semantic layer + policy checks as the expansion path. If you tried doing this in prod: how are you handling this tradeoff? Do you allow wide read access and rely on RLS/RBAC + logging, or do you gate it behind a semantic model / query planner / allowlists?",

Those are the level of questions i was thinking of when I mentioned needing schema exploration and multi turn deep research.The only approach I'm using in 'prod' is stuff that heavily depends on a human in the loop. What I've experimented more with is snowflake's 'cortex' ecosystem which allows you to do RBAC on curated views with semantic layers. It's still in the data warehouse environment but the agents can only access those curated views. What I found with this though was that I couldn't answer questions on the level of what you are describing very well, which is why I think if it's ever gonna work a much more flexible approach is needed.",

Record X isn’t in staging (CST is Jan 3), so it gets lost.As I’m typing this though, I’m thinking a buffer day might solve this? E.g., rather than extracting just 4th and 5th, extract 3rd as well.

Maintaining data integrity and reliability at scale across platforms can be a very tough challenge, especially with any reasonable volume. All that to say: you're right that it's a real and difficult problem to solve.I'm biased (I'm one of the founders of Prequel, where we do something similar to what you're talking about), but hopefully I can also be pretty helpful on the topic -- let me know if there are any questions I can help with.Also, the Pontoon team put together a helpful feature comparison matrix among the players in the market (though they recently discontinued work on the project): [https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon?tab=readme-ov-file#pontoon-vs-other-etl--reverse-etl-platforms](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon?tab=readme-ov-file#pontoon-vs-other-etl--reverse-etl-platforms)",

No one expects you to know everything on day one.2. Is DP-700 a good certification to start with?DP-700 is a solid certification, but it’s slightly more valuable if you already understand the basics of:* Data modeling* Spark* Azure Data Factory* Synapse* Delta LakeFor a complete beginner, it can feel heavy. It helps, but it won’t magically land a job unless you pair it with hands-on practice.3. What should you actually start with?Here’s the order I recommend (I use this path for mentees transitioning from non-tech backgrounds):1. SQL basics → intermediate → analytical SQL2. Python for data tasks (Pandas, scripting, file handling)3. Cloud fundamentals (Azure AZ-900 is a good starter)4. Data engineering concepts (batch vs streaming, data lakes, warehousing)5. Spark (Databricks or Azure Synapse)6. Then consider DP-700.By the time you reach DP-700, you will understand why you are learning each topic instead of memorizing answers.4. Other certifications worth considering* AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals): great starting point* DP-900 (Azure Data Fundamentals): perfect for beginners* Later: DP-203 : this is the most recognized DE certification on AzureYour background isn’t a limitation. Your willingness to learn is your biggest advantage.If you take it step by step instead of trying to \"jump to the end\", the transition becomes not just possible, but achievable.You have already taken the most important step: asking the right questions!",

Generally Snowpipe will be cheaper, but your time is worth something too. As you mention, Snowpipe can support schema evolution with ENABLE\\_SCHEMA\\_EVOLUTION = TRUE. But if you need more granular control, I could see scenarios where you might want to do it your way. Bottom line, get an understanding of GB/hour for data coming in so you'll be able to answer the cost differential between the two approaches. If it is a lot of data, the difference might be fairly small. Good luck!",

The salary I'm on at the moment is good, I get that but I'm mid 30s, I probably have 30 years left in work, it makes sense to consider what my future look like. When I think about progression there's a lot of stress and long hours that come for positions of more seniority as a DBA. Depending on the company, as a Head of/ Manager you can almost always be on call if that makes sense and I'm not sure the value is really there for me.I should clarify there are no plans to immediately transition, I'm on a good salary, it's remote and there's low demand, but when I think of 30+ years of working, I need to consider my options. I realise if I looked to move tomorrow I'd need to take a pay cut. I was thinking I'd be looking somewhere between £50-£65k though I think with my role changing I should be able to do a bit more of a hybrid role for a couple of years.",

In a worst case situation you might work 24 hours straight to bring systems back online and still would need to be back in the office on time the next day. As a DE, depending on industry itnis much more common to get a pipeline failure alert and deal with itnfirst thing in the morning. Fixing a production pipeline is alsonalmost always easier than something like an emergency server migration / DR rebuild. The actual easiest way to make the switch is find a hybrid role as a DBA. Find a role whwre you have to do both jobs. Half 6our day is spent doing the normal DBA tasks. Other half is sepnt writing pipelines, architecting solutions, database design, ci/cd, etc. Then look for a role that is almost exclusively DE work. That said you will still be used and leveraged as a DBA in a pinch because very few pure DE's have enough SQL / server knowledge to help out at the same level you can.",

In my current role I still wear both hats fairly regurlarly. In fact I was hired more for my DBA skills than my DE skills.That said I found all the following skills very helpful in making the switch. 1. Expert level Powershell knowledge. This comes in handy both on prem and in thr cloud if you regurlarly work with Microsoft stacks. If not Bash would be more useful. 2. Intermediate Python skills. I learned python after powershell and the knowledge transfers easily between them. Somethings when you know both get hard just from do pythonism or powershellism in the other language. In Python focus on learning the common DE packages like pandas, polars, SqlAlchemy, pyodbc, requests these will get used constantly when writing pipelines for rest api endpoints. Dont worry too much about getting into the weeds with oop as most pipelines are not written that way. 3. If you want to go one step further learn Pyspark which is hugely useful in cloud pipelines and datalakes. Azure data factory, Databricks, etc is just spark underneath the sheets. 4. As a DBA for 10 years before making the switch. I was very familiar with On Prem / runnung SQL on VMs. A big switch for me was learning PaaS offerings like snowflake, databricks, Azure SQL, Azure data factory. So spending time learning the basics on these helped. I got lucky and was dealing with vendors / clients using these services so got paid to learn on thr job as it were. 5. Many older DBAs still have yet to embrace source control. If you are in this boat learn source control, ci/cd, and managing databases as code. If you get these under you belt it will make life better as a DBA and a DE. 6. Communication skills. I have to communicate with non technical and business staff more frequently as a DE than as a pure DBA. As a DBA we are kept locked up and kept away from business / non technical / dats analyst types. We are a bit like wizards who only send ravens when you have really fucked up. Being a DE is more meetings and requirement gathering.",

As an analytical database, it might help you if the analysts are experiencing timeouts and/or slow queries Depends on how much data you have. Are analysts experiencing problems when they run queries on MySQL? And if they are, are you sure this is a problem related to the amount of data or could it be due to a bad-indexed db or small ec2 instance used to query?By design, Snowflake is not made to be an operational database. There is a new table format called Interactive Table, which according to the documentation is basically the way you would use Snowflake for transactional data (low-latency + high concurrency). It is, however, also written that you get best performance by querying that table with a Interactive Warehouse, which - and here's the catch - is by default ON all the time (which will sky-rocket your costs)If the analysts are experiencing slow queries, then replicating databases in Snowflake will definitely (most likely) help. In this case, I would leave the MySQL database as your operational database and replicate them in Snowflake, where analysts would only query from there (given that they are ok with some delay in the data compared to the data in MySQL). You'll spend a bit less with the AWS instances used to query data, but I'm pretty sure your Snowflake bill will more than compensate that decrease.Btw, I move data from MySQL to Snowflake doing exactly that: lambda -> s3 -> Snowflake (using Tasks) + PowerBI. Very quick to get it up and running (with a first load done with DMS), but given that lambda is not really made for this kind of task (there's a 15min hard timeout in the lambda), I'm on the process of moving that into fargate.",

But snowflake have launched snowflake postgres which can be an alternative of my rds and we can have our data on snowflake totally.If you know something related to snowflake postgres please help me out with that too.",

I’d honestly go with a direct message from the pipeline itself. Email, slack, whatever service makes sense. Delaying the message means more time for more data submissions to cause breakages.

If you already have the experience, then I say the data eng cert tests could check those boxes for recruiters if you really needed to... but this is something I would want my job to pay for.Like others stated, I think the big win for your career is moving off on-prem. Not because it's less valuable, but because you already have 5 years of experience in it, so getting exposure to other domains can help build your \"career portfolio\".Also agree with others that choosing Azure or Databricks is a moot point.

For pipelines like this that have been stable for decades, the biggest risk is changing logic that no one fully remembers the edge cases for.What I’ve seen work better in similar situations is a phased approach. Keep the Pro C transformations intact initially by containerizing or running them in a controlled environment, then focus on validating inputs and outputs aggressively. Once you have parity and confidence in the data, you can start peeling off pieces of the transformation logic incrementally instead of all at once.Modernizing is valuable, but preserving correctness first usually buys you time and reduces risk, especially when the business depends on this pipeline behaving exactly the same way it has for years.",

        "body": "All excellent questions.1. Cost and speed - I’m in the process of running benchmarks against progressively larger databases. So far, I’m seeing a maximum 10% overhead in storage for the VCS on the database. Cost is dependent on your architecture, but if we’re going with Aurora RDS, it’s dependent on IOPS. This solution uses Copy-on-Write, so there is an increase in IOPS over just running against production, but less than simply copying all the data. Since it’s also delta-based, the IOPS are only upserts, but those are ran twice (once on the branch, once on the merge into main).2. Difference with Git - generally, you don’t store data in Git outside of small test sets. This is a branch that essentially allows you to run your code in production without ever actually touching production. You connect to the same database, so you don’t need to modify your connection (beyond minor branch variables with can be set via environment). Subsetting your data can result in edge case failures since a subset by definition doesn’t include every case. 3. Blame - you can track blame for every record, every column and row, every constraint just by querying rather than digging into the CDC or building a proper SCD pipeline. 4. Silver bullet solution - that right there is the reason behind this post. I want genuine feedback from the community. I have worked at several jobs where this would be incredibly useful, but that’s only my limited experience. I know there are other, more targeted solutions for the various problems. I wanted to get a sense of others’ experiences to see if this addresses a genuine broad need, or if it’s overkill for the majority of problems. One issue I’ve faced constantly is the introduction of bad data into the production database via improperly structured code which might look fine in git but fails in weird ways when applied to the entire database. This allows you to not just review a PR of the code, but also a PR of the data changes at the same time.",

We also have dev data flow into our data lake so we can validate and iterate dev data before production so it doesn’t break or mess anything up.This has taken a while to get into strong place for a lot of teams such as buy in from stakeholders, value output and context around what the code does so we can advise on the change, especially around the logger and implementation.For the case of having it tied to git sounds interesting, but we are large org, hundreds of repos and already well defined process for releasing code changes (not necessarily tied to data) so to add have the data change linked to PR would be difficult I think for us to introduce as the there’s a lot of teams, infrastructure and processing for us to validate. Ways we have gone to improve the feedback loop is to get the data show back to people as possible. So getting dev data back, tools to view logs as interactions happen and pushing to be advisors/partners on the logging side. Also running QA checks and validation on dev data to catch drift early has been a massive help to catch things. This is generally through strict types like struct types in spark or pydantic etcThis generally means data engineers try to partner with teams for a log change and setting guidelines and docs on best practices to follow for teams to be self serve. Once a change is implemented, DEs integrate and transform data for other downstream teams and analysts to consume.Definitely not a perfect solution, but has worked well for us. Starting over tomorrow, would I consider a data vcs? Maybe as a trial to experiment but probably not. Data is generally later phase concern when building a product/service unless the data is your product, but usually not the case.Having had to built a service for users and already a key stakeholder of the logging implementation, time spent on data logging was tough to prioritize as needed something built and out the door and made more sense to do after release as a follow up.Having typed structure really has been the biggest help. Working with developers, have a well defined data type not only helps data products but also helps developers to work with. This means everyone is all largely speaking the same “language” and centralizes the source of truth like what a data vcs brings",

Async mechanisms in languages like Python and JavaScript use single-threaded, event-driven, queue-based mechanisms. They help to simplify the design of asynchronous systems where you send a lot of time waiting on network traffic, disk reads, or user input. Async does not run anything in parallel, and you will not see any performance improvements from in; in fact, overuse of async methods in tight loops can significantly harm performance due to the added overhead of the event queue.Part of why async design is popular in Python and JavaScript is because threads really suck in those languages. The existence of the global interpreter lock in Python <3.14 severely limits how well threads can perform, and worker threads are a huge pain to manage in JavaScript. There's much less incentive to use async in languages where threads are efficient and the language has good thread management mechanisms.",

Request came in, and as we processed the page, we'd make database requests, wait for the response, build more page, do more requests, etc. Not great. If you had a long loading page, it might takes 20 seconds or more to load.So we got async. Async was cool because now when a request comes in, I serve you a template and give you some URLs in my API to query. Each makes its own specific action and on completion does something else. Page loads in 0.5s, most of your data is there in <1s, and that one long 15-second query stalling out the old page eventually loads in when ready. Great!However, we ended up with edge cases. Your page loads a complex tab that needs data from 5 dynamic drop-downs that it also has to load data for. That's 5 requests that all get triggering in serial using async or .thens (aka callback hell), or you could hope for the best and occasionally end up with a race condition and a failed load.So we got promises. Honestly, for >90% of use cases, it just improved handling with then, catch, finally, etc. But it also enabled us to use Promise.all where we could cleanly write code, where we could call some nonsense like: function foo() { Promise.all([ getUserDropdownData(), getCityDropdownData(), getStateDropdownData(), getDepartmentDropdownData(), getSomeOtherData() ]) .then(values => { //doesn't execute until all of the above data is loaded const [userData, cityData, statedata, deptData, otherData] = values; buildUserDataDropdown(userData); buildCityDataDropdown(cityData); buildStateDataDropdown(stateData); buildDeptDataDropdown(deptData); buildOtherDataDropdown(otherData); }) .then(() => { //doesn't execute until we're done building all the dropdowns refreshTableData(); //...might have to add a 1ms timeout to grab default values accurately }) } /* disclaimer, I half tested this real quick with timeouts, may or may not work, example only */You would literally be tearing your eyes out to do that without promises; I'm talking 3-4x that many lines of code to sync all of it up. Also, with overhead, you might be waiting \\~200ms for each request, so your drop-downs load in \\~220ms instead of \\~1000ms. Now we can cleanly make those requests in parallel without fear of race conditions, and request our table data even faster.We also got web workers; because Javascript is single-threaded it just executes whatever is at the top of the stack. If I have to do something that counts to...1 billion, that'll block the top of the stack while it counts, locking the rest of the page. If I assign it to a worker, the worker gets a separate thread from my main JS thread to do its task.And that's all I'm gonna say because I took way too long typing this.",

        "body": "> Is multithreading considered “legacy” or risky now?Depends on the use case. Async doesn't help with CPU-bound work. Multithreading can.> Are async/event-driven models actually better for most scalable backends?Async is just a way to have a suspendable function. For backend, the theory is that we spend a lot of time waiting for slow IO. OS-provided threads tend to be heavyweight (e.g. every thread reserves memory for its call stack, and that tends to be O(MB) for each thread). So using them just to wait for slow IO is wasteful. If we instead move all that into userspace, we can avoid a lot of that overhead.> Or is this more about developer experience than performance?It's both, although async/await also has some downsides (mainly [the function coloring problem](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)). Some languages / runtimes (like Erlang, Go, and Java) manage to avoid the function coloring problem.> A lot of blogs and talks make it sound like classic multithreading (threads, locks, shared state) is something people are actively trying to avoidI maintain that async is susceptible to many of the same issues that multithreaded code is susceptible to, but at a more coarse-grained level. If you have shared data that is being operated on by two in-flight `async` calls, then they will interleave with each other in unpredictable ways. You still want tools to e.g. block one async function from resuming while a different async function is busy updating some shared data.Because async/await has well-defined preemption points, you're not going to have a single memory location that is being read from and written to at the same time. But you _could_ be in the middle of updating a complex structure. Perhaps it's in an inconsistent state, but you need to call an async function before you can put it back in a consistent state. That's basically the same problem that exists in classical threading, with the same solution - you want something like a mutex.There's a reason that Go and Java (with virtual threads) both have mutex types, despite both supporting colorless async. Even then, you are encouraged to use higher-level tools if you can. But sometimes, you just need a mutex.",

From everything I’ve seen about the game, I truly believe you have achieved the best educational game I have ever seen. Most educational games have some clunky mechanics around the “learning” part and just aren’t fun and I feel like they justify themselves as “it’s boring but it’s educational”. Your game seems to be really fun and the mechanics around “programming a robot farm” is genius in my opinion. I wish I was starting my programming journey to enjoy your game with fresh eyes. Overall, really nice job!!!",

Yes, Fortran in 2025. It's not about the language you started with, but about you. In any case, everything will be unclear, because this is programming, and it requires passing the stage of discomfort and lack of understanding at the initial stage. Those who passed this are wonderful people, and they can tell everyone that their path and sequence of learning languages were correct. And about those who did not become a programmer, we will never know - a typical survivor bias. Therefore, the most correct and adequate option would be to choose a random language based on your goals, and then, if programming is yours, and you do not quit it, you will definitely reach the moment when you can decide yourself: stay with it or change it. No one argues about which computer game is better to start with to become a gamer. Everyone always starts with a random game, and then everything works out by itself. I suggest doing the same with programming.",

The theory often comes after the exposure, if at all. My dumbass didn't know that about programming, so I spent a few years locking in on CS with no real programs to my name.

(I don't know if anything has changed recently on that front.) Also using list comprehensions when possible, or libraries like collections.Counter. It's a combination of official recommendations and common practice.",

There are times when this is obvious, but it's frequently used as a way to lend more force to someone saying \"I don't like this.\" So when you're going to tell someone that their code is un-Pythonic, you'd better provide an obviously superior implementation.> Are there good examples of non-pythonic vs. pythonic code?Yeah, the ones that get trotted out the most are C-isms. In C, you have to do a lot of things explicitly that are handled implicitly by Python's stdlib classes.* A lot of resource handling (files, sockets, etc) can be done with context managers.* Loops can usually be handled as iterator algebra problems rather than by fiddling with indices. Nested loops can often be turned into non-nested loops with `itertools`.* More broadly, unless you have a really good reason not to do it, stateful manipulation can often be replaced with list comprehensions and some basic functional programming concepts.On the other extreme, just because you can code-golf some problem into a deranged one-liner list comprehension expression does not mean that you should.

It is just a way of formatting your commit message so that automated tools can process commits in an easier way. Read about it from [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) An example would be \"fix(ZOO-123): Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" There the fix() keyword shows that the commit was for fixing something. A feat() keyword can be for adding a new feature or for working with some new functionality. For example \"feat(SCHOOL-23): Add Japanese language.\"The commit message itself is often in imperative present tense. For example \"Fix to\" instead of \"Fixed\". The commit should give a summary of the change. What was done. Keep it concise and clear. Do not add a whole essay. But also do not just write \"Added more changes.\" Which changes? Why? Read about it from [https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3](https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3) Avoid frustration and all kind of nonsense in the commits. Yes, when the stuff does not work and your earlier commit did not fix it then writing \"Get working already!!!!!\" or \"wgo8g7tfwo82w37fdto238gd\" is not a rational way how to deal with the issue. It is unprofessional. In the previous company I worked at, we had one guy who raged in his commit messages.Avoid adding too many details. Instead of writing \"Fix to UserNotificationIntegrationTest, BillingIntegrationTest, BaseIntegrationTest, RabbitMQPublisherIntegrationTest\" better pick \"Fix to integration tests\". Which tests, that can be seen from the git commit itself. Neither go with \"Added an email support to UserNotificationService by introducing emailSender() method that uses angus-mail library\" just write \"Add support to send user notifications via email\" Some good and bad examples are in [https://chris.beams.io/git-commit](https://chris.beams.io/git-commit) Also, it does not really help when you finish your whole project and then add it via a single commit that has a commit message of \"Initial commit\".",

Mindlessly asking AI to generate code for you teaches you nothing. But using AI to explain documentation, recommend improvements, provide examples, and break down code can be immensely valuable. There's nothing wrong with asking AI to clarify and teach. That's exactly what a professor does; to accommodate curriculum reading.What I'll do when trying to pick a new project I'd like to do and ask it something like this: \"I'd like to make an app or program that does xyz. What stack would you recommend and why?\" It'll spit back a bunch of recommendations. Then I'll pull up Google and read a bit about them and pick one. Then I'll pop open the documentation and ask the AI: \"Let's start from the beginning. How do I render zyx? Or how do I get a basic function abc working?\" Then I might ask it to explain the code and reference the documentation. I'll sometimes ask it for a list of the most common functions from the API and what they do, etc... but once AI helps me get the ball rolling I gradually transition to doing things myself. Once I understand the code the AI generated I'll apply it myself. This approach can take awhile but has gotten pretty functional at learning new skills. While I'm doing all this I'm also checking documentation and taking notes. AI is like a tool box but you shouldn't drop the toolbox off at the job site and trust it to build everything itself. Learn to use the tools and apply them properly.",

On the other hand, I know a guy who is a mediocre employee in general, never really put any effort into their work, and he got a senior role much faster than others, as he kept apply frequently until he got one, and he did land one eventually.Probably the people I know who advanced to high roles fast were the ones that were very persistent in some sense, looking for opportunities every moment until they got a desirable offer, and being in dynamic environments. (Dynamic could mean a growing company)(Doesn't apply to the US where if you are exceptional, you can be a founding engineer at 23 but that comes rather from \"fame\", if they look at your resume and don't know you or any of the tools you built, you will still be evaluated more based on YoE.)",

LLMs can write code, but they can't do your job, because your job is likely going to involve attending meetings, understanding business requirements and what people actually want, etc. A big part of my job as a backend web developer is being responsible for several projects and ensuring they run smoothly.I would NOT want to be an amateur getting by with an LLM when shit hits the fan, and I suspect we'll see that story continue to play out more and more over the next few years.As long as you're learning, you're becoming more valuable. That means knowing when to write code and when to use fancy auto-complete with an LLM, and even then it's not necessary. Sure someone might say \"you'll get left behind if you don't adopt the latest tech\" but that doesn't mean you have to vibe code everything. Also...its not hard to learn how to tell a computer to do something. I have GitHub Copilot. I sometimes use it to write a comment about a thing I want to do with a query or whatever, and it does it, then I check it and move on.Coding is really just 90% maintaining code, and 10% writing it. Making that 10% faster does not matter nearly as much as your inherent ability to do the rest...and you'll be better at that if you don't rely on LLMs as a crutch.",

You can try the beta of [File Pilot](https://filepilot.tech/) to see the difference to Microsoft's File Explorer and how much of a deal this difference makes when it comes to user experience.Any future product that puts an emphasis on performance will easily beat any market leader that has worse performance. People will just switch to the faster product.This change is supported by the recent development of new languages designed to make performant software easier to write. So you'll see more products written in C, Go, zig, Odin, and Jai. This also means that OOP will become less important and you will see paradigms shift towards Data Oriented Design (DOD) and architectures like Entity Component Systems (ECS) or even \"fat structs\".",

A lot of experienced programmers actually bounce off game-like tutorials once they are past the basics. What tends to work well is a small project with constraints, like recreating a simple game, automating something he already cares about, or modding an existing system he uses. That gives him feedback loops, problem solving, and room to explore a language deeply. If you want to support it as a gift, hardware, books with real projects, or even just time and encouragement to build something slightly ambitious often go further than any dedicated learning game.",

You could him some nice books PLUS something 'fun', like new clothes, a PS5/Switch 2/Xbox game he wanted, a new game controller, or cash.2. A Rasberry Pi!If he is into hardware programming, [https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/), maybe he would want a Rasberry Pi. It's a small micro-computer he can use for personal projects. May take a bit to deliver.. It could cost a 'bit' depending on which micro-computer you get.3. Games & SoftwareRealistically, there aren't many that could serve as a Christmas gift... Most of those types of resources are already available for free online! If there is a Coursera or Udemy course that's paid, or if he would like a subscription to a learning platform like [https://www.boot.dev/dashboard](https://www.boot.dev/dashboard), that could fit your question, but maybe that wouldn't work as a Christmas gift. These types of softwares are often subscription-based, so it might run up your bill...You could get him one of these softwares if he asks, but maybe that's something for another time!\\---Me, personally, I would get him a nice book. You could use one of my suggestions, or something else. A raspberry pi is also a nice option. Make a nice gift basket, get him some nice books, put in some plushies if you want. Place in some gift cards to his favorite mobile / console games. Maybe some new clothes. Books + fun stuff, it would make a perfect gift. :) Merry Christmas, thanks for helping your son's learning.",

And that learning process never stops, no matter how long you've been doing it for. Programming is much more about learning to systematically decompose big problems into small problems, then solve those small problems in isolation, one at a time, to get to a desired end-point, and that's what separates good programmers from bad programmers. I've known people who have been programming for a few years who are great at approaching problems systematically, and they're great programmers even if they don't know every language feature or design pattern and sometimes do goofy stuff that's not exactly the cleanest or most efficient way to solve that particular problem. Then there are people who never learned to approach problems systematically, and no matter how many years of experience they have, they're still just flailing around and frequently solving the wrong problem in the wrong way, even if they know every esoteric language feature and their code is clean and efficient.",

Some people have learned the \"single return\" style and stick with that.Others prefer the \"return early to handle error conditions\" style, which has its advantages.Most people seem to miss that the two styles are not mutually exclusive. It's certainly possible to handle errors early without an early return. Though, it usually means that we need to do one of two \"not nice\" things stylistically: (a) we need to increase indentation for the non-error case, or (b) we need to use a goto at the error point (or throw an exception), which many people find not nice, but rarely say the explicit reason for their aversion to it.In your particular example that you cited, the early return is not really an \"error case\", though, so in this particular example, placing both the returns at the same indentation level (i.e. one within in the \"if\" branch and the other within the \"else\" branch) would make the \\*intent\\* slightly clearer.Now, suppose you wanted to amend the function and include some kind of \"error condition\" like for the value 0 (which is mathematically neither even nor odd). In such a case like that, then in my opinion it would be clearer to use an early return for that, since doing so \"idiomatically\" expresses the idea that this kind of situation is an unexpected or unusual case. I.e., maybe the caller made some kind of mistake by asking whether 0 is even or odd, because logically that may make no sense, so maybe it's a mistake that it was asked.Once the \"error returns\" are taken care of, the rest of the code can basically assume (correctly) that the value in question is \"correct\" in terms of logicality. I.e. for this function it means the rest of the code can assume we are dealing with non-zero quantities, which almost always helps analyzing the correctness of the algorithm.",

What happens if an email address doesn't match the \"`isValidEmailAddress`\" check?It's a bit easier to read, both in terms of lowering mental strain and indenting depth, if you take simple cases and pull them out like this: // Try to guess the user's first name, return a generic name if it can't be inferred String guessFirstNameFromEmail(String emailAddress) { if (!isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress)) { return \"Alex\"; } if (username == \"\") { return \"Sam\"; } if (username.contains(\".\")) { return username.split(\".\")[0]; } if (hasUpperAndLowerLetterMix(username)) { return username.splitBy(SplitMethod.CapitalLetters)[0]; } return username; }In the lower case, it's more of a series of deductions - you're considering your assumptions first, and it reads more like getting \"weird\" cases out of the way first (bad input, empty string, etc...).",

If you have to allocate some hash memory at the beginning of the function, or open a file handle, or whatever, you want to be damn sure that you close that handle or free up the memory before leaving the function again. For that reason, we'll have one return at the end of the function, and use a temporary variable to store the return value. You don't need to have a crazy nested if-else structure for this. Just set the temporary return variable to some value (like null) when you create it. As soon as you hit a return situation, set the variable to some non-null value.

Also , you mention \"mastering\" my experience is that you don't master a programming language by learning it, you will only master one once you have developed some code and this code is now live online.Because of this , l would suggest that you don't try to \"master\" GO or whatever else.Learn GO, learn Python, Java well enough to honestly being able to check the check box when you apply for a job. Once you know one good enough to write and debug some 1,000 lines of code, it is not so hard to do the same with another one.If your goal was different , like developing your own application my recommendation would be different.I have used many different different languages, even developed my own, written compilers, schedulers , garbage processors and more Do not hesitate to ask me more questions if you want , l will be happy to help.And, finally, if anyone tells you this xx language is the best, run away from him!",

I think it could become a pretty standard language for webdev in the future but it might not.What matters most is if you pick up the basic concepts of what programming does, and can apply that knowledge to other ones, so that the question goes from \"what is a pass-by-reference\" to \"how does this language handle passing values to and from functions?\" or \"how does this language handle error propagation and exception handling?\"Go does cool stuff with structs that get really close to Object Oriented Programming concepts, so if you stick to learning programming, you might decide to start thinking about what happens with other actual OOP languages like Java (a standard language despite what a lot of people want to believe)or you might start thinking about how lower level languages like C handle memory stuff differently.After a few months of programming you are probably still in the \"finding out what programming is all about\" stage and haven't gotten to more complicated stuff like the concepts behind things yet.If you are super unsure about continuing with Go and want to look into another language to maybe hammer down the essentials with, I recommend either learning C or python if you can. Python because it sort of does a lot of the heavy lifting for you, and C because it makes you do most of the heavy lifting yourself.",

        "body": "The basic idea is: every program consists of objects that have properties and do things. Sometimes they interact with each other. Sometimes they even make more objects.Then there are four \"pillars\": encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.1. Encapsulation is when an object's properties are hidden to the public, and optionally only exposed through some kind of filter. These are most commonly seen as `get` and `set` methods.2. Inheritance is when one type of object is a \"subclass\" of another (\"superclass\"), so every property and method of the latter also belongs to the former. 3. Abstraction is when you hide the internals of how something works, and just expose the inputs and outputs. This is far from exclusive to OOP; chances are you're already used to this. 4. Polymorphism is when you refer to the same object using different types to get different information from it. In the same \"subclass\" relationship used for inheritance, every object of type subclass is also of type superclass.That's it, that's OOP! Now practice those ideas with C++ since you know the basics of it already. It's very conducive to object-oriented programming - in fact, in college, my advanced OOP class was all C++. If you want examples, just ask, I can help.",

Think about a struct having pointers to functions as fields instead of functions receiving pointers to structs as parameters. It's a bit more complicated because the pointers to functions are stored in a separate v-table, but it should help you understand the idea of objects.OOP has a lot of downsides, starting with inheritance not working out at all as it was thought it would. I would recommend watching [The Big OOPs - Anatomy of a 35-Year Mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo84LFzx5nI) before learning OOP, so you approach learning about OOP knowing that it's not a good idea.",

There are mini projects on github how to build with JS and its frameworks. And then build a good CV or update if you have one. Also linkedin. And when you finish or land a job upskill all the time.

Didn’t have a great experience and only just received my diploma two days ago, felt very disorganised and due to it all being online myself and the rest of my cohort felt that nobody from the course or associated college were taking any accountability. There were staffing issues that postponed the course but the communication throughout was terrible and we were often times left in the dark. I have heard similar stories about other online bootcamps here in the UK but someone else might have a more positive experience with them. In hindsight I should’ve paid for the more expensive courses that included in person classes/exams as I think there would be more structure. Either that or should’ve gone with something more well known (Lewagon for example). IMO the most valuable thing I gained from the experience was due to the project based assessment, it gave me a git history, portfolio and talking points in interviews.",

Any bootcamp that is not happy to share placement data by year with you - STAY AWAY. It doesn't matter their excuses, the context of the data, etc. The truth is the majority of bootcamp grads since then have not been able to land employment.  (Note: this is assuming you are in the USA, Canada or an anglophone country.  Things might be quite different in like spain or something).",

        "body": "I was in the same position a few years ago and was looking at General Assembly, but I wasn't willing to go into debt. I was signed up to NuCamp's newsletter and got an email that my city was offering a retraining scholarship, which meant I'd only have to pay $600 for 7 months of classes. Hard to pass that up.I did NuCamp from September 2024 to March 2025. It's designed to be a part-time program that you can do while you have a full-time job, but I'm not sure how realistic that is. I quit my job and went all in when we started React. Before the BootCamp, I was in tutorial hell, having done Free Code Camp, Harvard CS50, Odin Project, YouTube, and Udemy classes. I'll say that even with all that prep, the BootCamp was a firehose of information, and by the end of it, I was exhausted. I liked the classes. Most of the teachers I had were good. The Jobs class they offered was total trash IMO, but that could have been because of the teacher, who felt more like a social media influencer. That class did force me to finish my portfolio website, so it wasn't all bad. Their Discord is actively shouting out jobs. I ended up taking a few more months after class to wrap my head around React and get better at JavaScript by building projects and doing CodeWars. Over a year after starting, I'm now studying Front End Dev questions I pulled from GreatFrontEnd and dabbling with LeetCode, which has been incredibly frustrating. At best, I've probably got another six months of practice and projects before I'd be hireable, but realistically, I'm thinking I've got another year. I'm an artist, so this stuff comes slowly to me. Since you're already doing analytics, I'm guessing it will be faster for you.If you do the BootCamp, my advice is to do personal projects with people in your cohort. That was probably the MOST beneficial part of the BootCamp. Looking at my group's code and trying to make everything work together really forced me to understand it and broke me out of tutorial hell.Another tip I'd give is to grab a BootCamp class off of Udemy when it's discounted and work your way through it to see how you do. Just make sure you're doing your own personal project after every tutorial project.Hope this is helpful. Good luck!",

Java has a strongly implied folder structure. Holy shit the directories: com.foo.bar.domain.entities.baz…Look at other projects and try things out. Use a nice IDE (IntelliJ) that makes it easy to refactor and move things around when you realize you don’t like how you organized it (I have been doing this the past few days).As for when to break up functions: as much as you can. Some early advice I got from an AWS engineer was: “if you want something to scale and be maintainable, it has to be made of small pieces.”Good codebases grow. Good codebases eventually become mazes. As a programmer, I try to imagine another programmer (likely myself later on) landing at this function as if being dropped in a maze: how long will it take them to understand where they are.I can’t really give them a good, complete map. But I can try my best to make it so that at each intersection (at each function), it is obvious which way to go. I can make it so that they do not need to spend time looking around, exploring, reasoning, guessing, and backtracking. A good function is understandable immediately, either:- accomplishing something simple in relatively few lines of code- or listing a series of other functions (each doing a simple thing in relatively few lines of code) like a recipe in relatively few lines of code.There are no points for being clever or obscuring what your code is doing. Boring, obvious code is good code.There are certainly times where it makes sense/is easier to just have a big long method.But I have found no predictor for how many bugs a function will produce more accurate than its length. I have gotten paid many dollars to debug big long methods and break them into manageable, readable, *unit-testable* pieces.",

Placement rates are in the toilet, a huge percent have shut down, and quality has diminished all around (though even if instructional quality was excellent they'd still be a terrible value). More and more bootcamps have pivoted toward bullshit AI certifications out of desperation. Selling shovels to selling shovels.The bootcamp era is close to dead (good). The only \"legitimate\" one left imo is Launch School, and once people see how long that route takes they'll be off to look into career switching to accounting or trades or whatever. Outside of maybe 2 programs in the whole country, there was never a sort of good vs bad boot camp distinction. Employers never respected any of them, they were just sometimes willing to hire in spite of them since they needed bodies.",

I use a simple inbox system for fleeting notes that i may or may not turn into \"real\" permanent notes later.I also have a rule that a single note should fit almost entirely on my screen as a rough guide for when i should cut down on the information or create a new note.i use obsidian because notion is way too slow and bloated.",

If you're building a calendar or scheduling app where the primary goal of the app was to schedule things, then rolling your own might be worth it to deliver an amazing experience and have full control over it. If it's just one tiny feature, it probably makes more sense to use a good existing library.Second, what are the costs of using an external component? Let's say I need a matrix multiply function. Adding a dependency on a huge linear algebra package like BLAS or numpy might increase the size of the build, add a new license to check, and just overall add a lot of complexity to the project. If the only thing I need it for is to multiply some small matrices and performance doesn't matter, I might implement it myself and use another library to verify that my implementation is correct.Last, is this something that needs to change/update frequently or is it stable? If it's parsing a data file that's internal to my project and not user-generated, then that code might not ever need to change. Writing some custom code to parse it might be fine because it's not likely to break. On the other hand if it's parsing user-generated PDFs, a third-party library probably keeps getting new bug fixes and improvements over time, so it's probably way better to use a library.",

But we also had a ton of niche cases and requirements. Sometimes management wanted a summary of the table, and it may need to sum, average, or count the number of times a certain value (or range) appeared in a column.Some cells also needed to provide a link, multiple links, or color-code text in some way. Some cells needed to reformat data in a certain way - for example, if we got a timestamp, did we need to show just the date, just the time, seconds since time, etc. One manager always wanted us to separate date and time as two separate columns for Excel reasons. Oh, yeah, and it needed to have a one-click download CSV export of the data in-browser (so, it couldn't re-send the data to the server to generate a file).Wrote one, it worked great, used it for about 8+ years and it got copied to several of our different systems. Eventually one of the juniors asked why we were using my library, and not some npm library he found that did \"the same thing but better\". My answer, after looking at the library, was that I wrote mine 4 or so years before the npm library was created according to its github history. It also didn't support all of the features, or at least not in some of the specific use cases we had. So it *wasn't* something that existed when I needed it, and it also still didn't technically do everything we needed it to do.Similarly, I'll also \"engineer\" extremely simple things from scratch if I feel like it would take me longer to find a library to do the thing than it would to write. This case was we had a dashboard for a monitoring tool that just needed to show groups of \"top 10s\", so 10 rows, each containing a bar, another bar (with a definable color) inside of it with width based on a percentage, and a text value (that could also be a link). Easy enough: div wrapping a div and p or a, a dozen lines of CSS, and a function to manage it, took 5 minutes to write, 100% localized code I don't have to rely on a library for.",

For a more recent example, I was messing around with Simplex and Perlin noise to generate procedural earth-like maps. Didn’t look great, so eventually I found an online map generator that happened to have the source open to anyone. I made an API to call its C functions that generated a height map I could use in C++.If you can legally use it in your source code, then use it.

All of these routes are valid options and many self taught programmers were made from them.I found Udemy better fit for me because it explains the theory in videos with examples and then puts you into test with an exercise or a project (at least in the courses I had).Like others said, In programming you are going to need to read in order learn something on the go more often than not. Not from the comfort of your room, but in the office while you work for example. You won't pull headphones to watch any videos there. For now it looks like cs50 or a Udemy course would be a better fit for you. But in the end it doesn't matter much. After the tutorials is where the hard part begins and there are no videos there.

        "body": "Just a bit of advice and perspective:First, you can access the videos from Free Code Camp's Concepts [here](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecampconcepts/videos) They have said they may be removed at any point in time, so look into a YT Downloader or some such. Their main YT channel also has several long video tutorials and crash-courses to my knowledge.There is also lots of videos all over YouTube about most programming topics / concepts, computer science, as well as specific tutorials on projects.Second, unfortunately, reading is just a part of programming as I am sure you're aware. You're going to have to read requirements of projects and their documentation, as well as write it. You're going to have to read code and genuinely try to understand it, both the functions and the larger whole. You're going to have to read documentation of the programming languages, tools, and APIs you're using.I'm not saying that to shame you, God knows, I barely read books. But reading is very much a part of programming, from the learning to the actual process of doing.Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp are both what I have experience with. They're both solid platforms, and I'd probably complete FCC first, and then circle back to Odin Project and see about the gaps and more advanced knowledge it covers. One of the big advantages is that it is fairly unguided and gives you a set of objectives to complete. This forces you to think about what you're doing, how and why, as well as forcing you to acquire knowledge and documentation just like you would on any real project.At that point, I'd probably just try making projects. Maybe dabble in a game engine like Godot because of its lightweight nature, GDScript which is very easy to read and write, and ability to do web exports for Itch.IO. Hell you can even use it to make applications / tools, not games, but I digress.I'm just not sure what to suggest that can fulfill that video requirement, besides trying a hybrid approach. Try to at least read the highlights and general idea of a topic, and then look for some videos about it, maybe practical examples. Don't force yourself to deathmarch paragraph after paragraph, but I don't know if you can truly avoid reading either.I'm sure others know more, I mostly learned by messing around modding games, reading books, nibbling on these tutorial sites and such. Best of luck.",

Otherwise I'm using it for boilerplate code which rarely needs comments, or just having it spit out a few examples of something I haven't used before, which I rarely use in production without significant modification, if at all, so again, no comments, just a good prompt. With AI, I find it much easier to look at 10-50 lines at a time and make sure it doing ok rather than having to stare at a ton of lines all at once and try to redirect it after it's gotten way ahead of itself.If you're using an in-ide agent I can see where the comments could help it continue on to fill out the function/file, but I just personally prefer to keep my AI on a short leash.Plus, I tend to work with a lot of aging code that needs to be refactored and it gets touchy.

I've also used React for my jobs over the last couple years, which was always my goal and why I eventually moved away from Vue.

Something like \"as an admin I would like to be able to see a list of orders so that I can quickly see the status of current orders\". In any case, user stories are also not acceptance criteria, which are more specific things which must be present in order for a ticket to be done. Sometimes things are vague and you have to fill in details based on your understanding of the purpose of the ticket; however, if things are too vague you need to have a discussion to make more detailed ACs. ACs should cover: inputs (clicks, path parameters, query parameters, etc), authentication/authorization (which types of users can do this, what happens if it is not authorized), outputs (status codes, formats such as JSON/XML, schema), how to handle error states (bad inputs, server errors, etc.), validation, navigation (what happens after a user clicks a thing). They won't necessarily cover everything, but everything that they don't cover should be \"dealer's choice\", i.e. they shouldn't matter to the end user, if they do, then it should be in the AC.For your example:AC1: Make a GET endpoint /orders that returns a JSON response matching the schema ... AC2: It should take the following query parameters AC3: It should only be accessible from Orkes in the web service, authenticated by ... AC4: If query param is invalid it should return a 400 status with an error message matching ... AC5: If not authenticated, it should return a 403 status with an error message matching ... ...",

This is bad because it means the story can't be worked if Geoff is on vacation, but it can be good in a way because if Geoff writes too much detail, he might cross over into dictating design and implementation details and you don't want that, either.My middle ground is this: the lead (or a designate) takes such a story while it's still on the backlog and attaches all the subtasks that dev can recognize, including the design step that includes getting details from the people who have them. The lead can do this accurately; a junior dev probably can't, but repeating this process is part of the way they learn about the system and the organization.By the time the story gets to the top of the backlog, if there isn't enough information to actually start the work, there should at least be enough breadcrumbs in it that a junior knows what to do to get that information.",

Those “amount” of repetitions will really hone your craft in the long run. Keep building your portfolio. That is your green card. It will speak for you, especially if you wanted to go serious on things and wanted to explore how to render service for people.Actually, thats one way as well on how you can further build your skills. Meeting real world projects. That may sound overwhelming to you since you are still in high school, but who knows ;)",

I also spent several years in a job which was glorified tech support and my skills were pretty rusty when I left that. You won't learn it all immediately and you won't remember it unless you do it a bunch. Don't be afraid to refer back to those tutorials. With respect to googling, IMHO, trying to code without an internet connection is madness. I myself often google the basics when I haven't used them in a while or to confirm I am remembering things correctly. If you switch languages a lot, you might start using the wrong syntax and I have to check that from time to time.When watching tutorials, hopefully you're coding along with them and then trying to do something a bit different which isn't in the tutorial and adapting what you learned to your problem. One little project that I would do using different web technologies was a little contact manager. That's not a typical tutorial example, but it's not much more complicated than a lot of them. Perhaps you could go into a little more detail about what you're trying to do. Going into specifics might help you learn something or at least how to find the answer.",

The best books are often out of date in some ways, and although they are a great resource for \"How\" and \"Why\", you will also need an up-to-date source of information. I have been using w3schools, and although they may or may not be the best that can be found, my hope is that it will bridge the gap between the great books on the subject and the recent changes to the language. I know and use HTML and CSS pretty well, and I am to the point where I can look up the raw features of it to figure out how to do what I want (when it is something I have not done often or at all); I am sure there will come a point where I can get to where I do not need the book (or lessons) to figure out how to do something with the language. So...short answer, it is just part of learning. Do not feel fake or inferior. And, definitely, you learn by doing. Watching videos can be interesting, but they do not help me really learn. Whatever the language you are learning, get a compiler/IDE. Type the code you are learning and experiment with IT. In other words, make the code you think you are learning work in an environment separate from the one that is teaching you. And don't copy and paste. Type it out. I use Code::Blocks and highly recommend it (it is free). Slight\\_Scarcity321 gives some good advice a little ways down this page.",

I dont think you do. Sure, you understand why it \"can\" work, but do you understand why it \\*must\\* work? if you only consume the tutorial, your only getting one side of the story, you need to question it. ask yourself \"why did they do this?\" \"how does that work?\" \"why does that work?\", be critical, dont believe the tutorial at all, \\*prove\\* the tutorial with external research, who knows? you might just find out the way theyre doing things isnt how you should be doing things (which happens way more than you think) this way, you trace a possible path from the problem the tutorial solves to how they got to their solution, and such is a path you can take when you go to implement it yourself.if your given only the starting line, destination, and a single path, youll never learn how to make a path yourself, you need to know why every other path \\*wouldnt\\* work, instead of just why this one does work. try to think to yourself how you would implement something if placed in the tutorial authors shoes. something i like to do is read a part of a tutorial, guess what the next thing is, implement it in a project specific way (i.e., a tutorial is not your project, you use a tutorial in your own seperate project so of course you code must look different to fulfil your own project requirements) until i hit a wall, and look at the tutorial again, but crutially dont worry about doing it wrong, as doing it wrong will actually make you understand more why the tutorial does it a different way when you hit a certain wall and youll gain more understanding. once your done a section, delete it all and re-code it. write down or just make a mental note of all of the places where you get stuck, those are the things you dont fully understand (note, sometimes i do this, other times i dont, i get lazy, it happens, but whenever i have done it it has helped clear the fog, so maybe if nothing else works you can try this)",

I've heard good things about WGU.The main thing I'd be cautious about is stopping work for 6 months. That's not nearly enough time to be job-ready, and quitting work will just put immense pressure on you, which is the opposite of what you want.Learning a completely new skill takes time. Trying to rush it and squeeze more learning into less time rarely works in practice. You need time to rest and get comfortable with new ideas.I think cutting back on hours or finding work that's less stressful, but that keeps you employed, would be ideal.Take courses, learn to code, but most importantly build stuff. Make real, useful stuff and launch it - that's the best way to prove you're job-ready. In this field, \"entry-level\" doesn't mean you're still learning to build stuff, it means you've already built real projects on your own, you're only new to doing it in a corporate environment.",

I have b-degree in business administration, never worked in related role. 2 years ago I was 27, applied for a second university, 2 years course which teaches programming (qualification at the end). I already had bachelors degree, I didn't need 2nd one. Before the school I learned some coding already, so the course wasn't that hard and I had a bit of experience already. I only had experience with frontend, today I can build full-stack applications. (junior lvl) I got scholarship for being the best in class so that helped financially.2 years later. I'm still looking for job since June. Yes, I'm a bit picky of which role I want. I don't want to work as administrator in a bank and answer old grandmas calls. I want to do something programming related cause I know I have a knowledge and experience more than some juniors today. And I will be hard working and learn as fast as I can. But I had mby like 4 interviews in 6 months for the roles that I was not really happy about so let that sink in.What I think: Bootcamps in todays job market sucks. 5 years ago they were worth it, cause you could learn fundamentals in 4-5 months and company was happy to hire you and they would teach you on the job without any experience or knowledge. Because to be real, nobody can learn advanced things in 6 months. You will only learn some simple things. You won't learn to build advanced full stack applications with best practices and high security. And today company expects you to know all of that, which takes 8 hours a day for 5+ years of doing real job.I will be completely honest. If you are not a genius (so that goverment can hire you) or you don't have a relative or a very good friend who can hire you. You won't get a job. There are already 1k devs with so much more experience, knowledge and skills applying for the same role you want. AI doesn't help ether, seniors can do 3 jobs now, generate things fast, they wont need juniors to fix buttons for them anymore. (You already know it, based on your generated post) While there are more developers than jobs available it will stay like this and I think it will only be worse. My hope is that AI will become so expensive without improving that it will be more rentable to hire juniors instead. Or companies realize that they need juniors to learn and become seniors one day.",

        "body": "The core idea of OOP is to associate data with behaviour. E.g. instead of having a `sort()` function that sorts a list of data based on an algorithm, your data has it's own `sort()` method, so it kind of sorts itself instead of getting sorted.On first glance this sounds very powerful, because a list of strings may be sorted differently than a list of numbers or a list of pointers. What OOP allows you is to have a list of any type, just call `.sort()` on it and the correct sorting method will be used automagically.This idea was then further applied to other things like a Date. Instead of using a library of functions and a collection of structs that the functions work on, you now get an object and have all functions directly associated with that object, so instead of writing `dateutils.to_string(date: Date, ...)` you now have `Date.to_string(...)`. In the early days of OOP this was used for code reuse through inheritance. Inheritance just means, that you define a new class and tell the computer that this class should have all the features of that parent class plus the new stuff you define and except the stuff you redefine in the new class.However, it turned out that Inheritance doesn't work well for code reuse, so nobody sane recommends it any more for that. It also turned out that it's more common to have different behaviour than different kind of data, so people started using \"Composition\" instead. Composition just means that your objects has other objects that are used to perform different kind of behaviour. For Example, you may have a class `Animal` and the animal is supposed to have different behaviour like walk, run, speak, eat. Instead of using Inheritance to create new subclasses of `Animal` and implement different behaviour, you define small interfaces `IRunner`, `IWalker`, `ISpeaker`, `IEater` (or similar) and write small classes for each interface. There might be a `Bark` and a `Meow` class implementing \"ISpeaker` and there may be \"BipedRunner\" and \"QuadrupedRunner\" implementing \"IRunner\" and so on. You then create different animals using the Animal-Constructor:```pycat = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Meow(), CarnivoreEater())dog = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Bark(), CarnivoreEater())horse = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Whinny(), HerbivoreEater())cat.speak() # \"meow!\"dog.speak() # \"wruff!\"horse.speak() # \"neigh!\"```This is what \"Composition over Inheritance\" refers to. So we're almost back to having functions applied to data, but instead we call a method of an object that then looks up another object and calls one of that object's methods (for each individual method call).A big downside of OOP is that contrary to its promise it makes code harder to maintain, because you create a compile time hierarchy that matches your domain model and with that you create boundaries around things (objects) instead of creating boundaries around properties (e.g. positions, prices, ... ). Maybe that helps a bit.",

Although, i rarely use the laptop, and only on LAN, e.g. when i'm tired, and want to lay in the bed but still do some coding.If you want to sync across e.g. home PC, and use laptop in school, i guess it's time to commit to remote repo, and pull from there.Edit: ofc, when you want to show your project in school you have to sync local copy on laptop anyway, but, at least you don't have to sync during development, when you switch machines often.",

What actually helps is learning how real teams operate, not memorizing rules.If you want a solid foundation, start with how teams actually collaborate. Read a few well maintained open source repos and pay attention to their README, contribution guides, commit history, and pull requests. You’ll learn more about Git hygiene, reviews, naming, and decision making there than from most blog posts.For API keys and secrets specifically, the rule is simple. Never commit them. Use environment variables, config files that are ignored by Git, and documented setup steps so another developer can run the project locally without guessing. Almost every production issue I see around secrets comes from shortcuts taken early.Books like “The Pragmatic Programmer” and “Clean Code” are useful, but treat them as guidelines, not law. The real skill is knowing when to apply them and when to keep things simple.Best practices come from context. Build things, read other people’s code, get your work reviewed, and break things a few times. That’s where the lessons actually stick.",

I know it's important to research on your own, and not rely on \"spoonfeeding\", but it gets to a point where it's absurd. My best learning experiences where when the lectures had streamlined content where all course assignments and exams were heavily or even completey based on those lectures. I always felt like I came away with something positive and felt a lot more skilled. Also, it depends on the professor but some will outright disregard any questions. And when so much rides on the assignments and with so little support and resources, you tend to focus on the lectures less and are scrambling for the assignments to the point where there's hardly any retention of what you were supposed to learn in the first place. Your frustration is highly justified",

I am a music producer that posts my type beats on YouTube and Beatstars (beat selling website), and I found that uploading things is starting to become increasingly annoying as I need to click through a ton of menus and upload files and such, so I wanted to streamline that. The idea is a desktop GUI app that uses web automation to upload to Beatstars, and then Google's API for uploading to Youtube.>What I've done so far is defined Pydantic types (I'm using Python) and started work on a setup wizard screen, but I feel like feature creep is really hitting hard so I wanted to step back and plan more. Any tips?Sure, start with the most essential functionality and build outward. That would be uploading your data to one service or the other. I guess Google's API is probably better supported if not simpler, so you might wish to start by automating YouTube uploads. Then, support uploads to the other one.Do types + a setup wizard, if necessary, once you know enough about your program to know where typing will help you and what sort of setup is necessary.",

The fact that you are stuck shows that you haven't hit that point where you are not learning anything any more. Now, I have no experience with Beatstars so I do not know but does it have an API? Perhaps you can skip all kind of menu automation and send direct POST or PUT requests to its API, instead. Sure, menu automation and such has its place, in frontend testing and such, but first try to get it done by using the API endpoints of Beatstars. Because any and all menu clicks and dropdown selections in the end send some HTTP request to Beatstars server. Or SOAP requests or websockets or something. Open the developer tools of your browser and see which requests with which information are being sent to the server. And then reverse engineer it from there. Unless Beatstars has an actual API documentation. Then you do not have to re-invent a wheel.",

From my experience and talking to professionals degrees like cybersecurity, information systems, and data science (do a stats major instead) are not as good.As for knowing what you want to specialize in I don't think there are any shortcuts besides trying stuff and seeing if you like it. Either take a class or build a project and see if it's cool. You can also research online about the different cs disciplines. If you decide on embedded systems I think computer or elctrical engineering is a better major, but it prob depends on the school.Regarding how economically cooked the different cs subdisciplines are, they honestly aren't that cooked. What's (or rather who) is cooked is the person who graduates, has no extracurricular experience, and is only interested in the doing bare minimum to get money.The truth is that cs isn't an easy path to 6 figures. You either need to genuinely like it or be very disciplined because the degree is only like 30-40% of the puzzle. Join tech clubs, do competitive programming/leetcode, build stuff, and give it your all! It's such a cool subject that touches all the sciences, math, and unifies it under this neat idea of very clearly describing a process.PS: Maybe it's just personal bias but it seems that web dev is the most vulnerable to AI. There's hella ai tools like replit and loveable that can already handle most basic-intermediate apps. Also if you want to be immune to ai get a job writing like cobol for a bank or visual basic for some unc company.Now specifically regarding some stuff you asked: You should stay general until you know what you like, at least until like you finish your first year or two of uni. You'll have enough time to skill up specifically for your interest. Focus on fundamentals and you'll be flexible enough to pivot. Also, even if you end up going into like embedded, building a website will still make you a better and more well rounded programmer.",

AI is the latest hot thing today, but who knows what will be the next thing a year or two from now? Maybe the AI bubble will have already popped by then, and if you specialize in AI early on, based on current trends, you'll be left on ice.So be a generalist in your studies and only specialize once you enter the workforce. That way you will have the skills to quickly and efficiently learn any niche you want, and have the knowledge of which niche is in demand at the time you'll be looking for work.",

However, I said that is stupid because normally that caused more harm than good.3) to elaborate on 2, even MUI is stupid because of this.

You can learn programming with any language, no matter how outdated or obscure that language may be. Their role is to provide broad enough knowledge so that you can then specify in any branch of CS that you prefer. And teach you the key concept of programming that applies to any language.As you said, it's a begginers class to programming. What you are learning is programming itself not a specific language.

If necessary then lower your work load while doing your studies. It won't be easy. I did my studies while working part time. And I had no free time of my own. Just learning multiple coding languages will not merit you. Software development is not a Pokemon catching. No point to learn a new language when you can't make anything meaningful with it. Also, no point to learn a new language when that language is not in demand where you are living (forget remote jobs as a beginner).Go for a degree, concentrate on gaining knowledge and putting it into a practical use. And on your own learn these languages that are actually in demand in your area. And then not just learning a new language for the sake of learning it, but learning it to solve some real world problem with it, by building an actually useful project (no calculator apps. Nobody will use these).",

We make useful software for our users.So, when you're starting to get adept with some particular tech (in your case js and python) your next step is to use that tech to make somethihg useful. The whole creative process has more steps than just laying down lines of code. Planning it, packaging it, deploying it so others can use it, are just as important.Simple games are a good choice, because they're inherently useful: people play them for fun. Sure, you can learn another language. But, if you do a couple of projects first, you'll get more out of your effort to learn that new language.Also, it has to be said, in your programming career you will probably need to learn new languages or othe major tech at least a dozen times. And that's a big effort. So, now, early on, your task is to learn the WHY and HOW of the effort of learning a new language. Doing projects helps with the WHY.Welcome to our great trade.",

How to make processes work FOR people, or at least not totally against them.And now you’re thinking of leveling up in your ability to DO that kind of process-assistance stuff. One thing that comes to mind is a custom web app that prints QR codes on stickers, then associates the stickers with the, I dunno, orders or devices or pallets they’re associated with, then, when somebody scans one with a phone, shows them something useful about the thing. But only if they’re logged in.You can code that kind of thing. Skills-wise, look into figuring out how to use the APIs for systems like QuickBooks to look at data that lives there. And how to make QR codes (hint: there’s a good Javascript package that runs in web pages). And figure out how to put data into a database like PostgreSQL. The point is to learn to imagine what is possible. As you’re doing that you can put together a nice consulting biz doing those kinds of things. Some people call this stuff “line-of-business apps”.",

Learning how to test your code and think about failure cases will also separate you fast from hobbyists. Since you already touch data and automation, a light dive into APIs, authentication, and how systems talk to each other would pay off quickly.One other thing worth developing is comfort reading other people’s code. Pick an open source project or a decent sized internal codebase and try to understand it without rewriting it. That skill maps directly to professional development work. You are already valuable because you bridge people, process, and code. The next step is making your solutions boring, reliable, and understandable to the next person who inherits them.",

The one you choose is going to be largely personal taste and probably doesn't matter if you're asking this question, but usually it's going to be Windows, Linux, or OS X if you're on a Mac. Linux is kind of an umbrella term for a lot of similar operating systems. Every OS has a program called a kernel that deals with how much CPU time or memory to give to different programs. The Linux kernel is the thing that links Linux operating systems. From there, there are different \"distributions\" that pack in different software, like desktop layouts, ways to install software, and other tools and programs. Each distribution can feel different so it's worth experimenting a bit to find what you like. If you're trying to think what to use before you start to learn programming, it's not worth thinking about. Whatever's on your computer now is good enough. You'll learn more about operating systems when you need to.",

        "body": "Other people have explained the difference between an operating system and a distribution pretty well (and the distinction typically only applies to Linux - with MacOS and Windows, there is really no distinction between the concept of the operating system and the distribution).If you really want to learn about what operating systems do and how operating systems work, there is really no better way than to use Linux: with Linux, it's much easier to have access to the way that the operating system actually works and how the pieces come together, and the code of the Linux kernel is open source, so you can actually look at it if you want to. I would recommend making a USB drive with a Linux installation you can boot to if you don't already have Linux installed (Puppy Linux, MX Linux, and Slax are all good choices for this - a Linux distribution you can use from a keydrive and save your changes and files), or have a virtual system with Linux installed on it, or if you're really determined, install Linux on a partition, which can be a bit difficult to do. Another option could be to buy a Raspberry Pi, which is Linux-based, and play with that for many of your tasks.You can get books on Linux that will teach you plenty about how the operating system functions:\"The Linux Programming Interface\" by Kichael Kerrisk is viewed by many as a definitive encyclopedia for understanding how Linux works. You'll learn about making system calls, OS library functions, and the relationship between applications and the kernel in detail. You'll come away from that book with a whole new appreciation as to how OSes work.\"How Linux Works\" by Brian Ward. It really covers the glue that holds the OS together, covering the boot process, how the kernel manages hardware, and how networking and devices actually function under the hood.\"Modern Operating Systems\" by Andrew Tanenbaum is also a great book. It's not exclusively about Linux, but it will teach you the fundamental theory of OSes, such as process management, memory, and file systems that Linux is built on.Keep in mind that you don't **need** to really understand your operating system before you can start learning a programming language. Most programming languages these days run on all operating systems (with a few exceptions). Pick the language you want to learn, and there's a very good chance it will run on whatever operating system you already have installed on your computer, and will abstract away the differences between operating systems, which is one of the main functions of a programming language: that way, programs are portable, and can be run on any operating system.",

        "body": "Is the newest thing also stable and reliable? Older thing can have its issues worked out and fixed. Perhaps only some very obscure corner cases are still generating Github issues. But other than that, the thing is stable and \"it just works\". Whereas the newest thing can have multiple open issues.Is the newest thing actually maintained? Recently I had to make a technical analysis for a new microservice and had to come up with an architecture proposal for it. I considered different alternatives. There was a library A and a library B. Library A had been around for many years. Sure, it had a lot of bloat and stuff, but it worked. Library B also seemed to work. Less bloat. Promising. BUT the maintainer/developer/owner of that library had abandoned that project. For 2 years there had been no commits. Github issues were abandoned. Yes, that B was newer than A but it was abandoned. Whereas A was older, did have more bloat, but was in active maintenance. Recent commits to update versions. Recent commits to fix vulnerabilities. etc.Is the newest thing that you should consider in the current geopolitical world? Let's say you are a developer in the US. Will you use a library made in China, in Russia, or in Iran? By itself the library can be newer and perhaps also better. BUT the decision makers can start making decisions where they tell the developers to make the library close sourced and you won't have any overview of the changes. Decision makers can introduce kill switches or backdoors. Or, the developers will collect data and send it to their data brokers. And then that data will be used in a competitive manner. One of the many reasons why one should think twice if he should use Deepseek AI, for example. Technically very promising LLM model. Also, it introduced many changes to other LLMs in the world. But, it follows the political agenda of China. It is not neutral.Does the newest thing have enough documentation? Older stuff can have massive documentation compiled by many developers over years. A new thing can have close to no documentation and you have to be one of the pioneers creating that documentation on the go.How is the new thing fitting in the existing infrastructure? Perhaps it does not even work? Yes, stuff often is meant to be backwards compatible, but not always it is the case. For example Spring Boot 2.x vs Spring Boot 3.x and different libraries. Some newer libraries expect you to use also newer Spring Boot version. Also newer Java version. You can't just throw the newest library in the code and hope that stuff works.Do you have resources (time, budget) to make upgrades to support the newest tools and the newest versions?How will you balance constant upgrades with adding new functionality and maintaining the project as a whole? A new library version can come out every month, for example. Will you concentrate on version upgrades over working what the client actually cares about? It is difficult to \"sell\" version upgrades to a client. You have to prove that it is needed. Yes, Dependabot is a thing but some time will still go into reviewing its MRs and doing smoke testing to ensure that untestable stuff (for whichever reason) works.With you updating stuff, will you break something that external service providers are using? You can't expect them to update their stuff because you are doing constant upgrades.",

It's not like a full scale backend infrastructure, but for smaller web apps this is often enough, because most times all they need is a way to hide some stuff, like API keys, from the client, make a hand full of database queries and calculate a few things here and there. It's called a 'Backend for Frontend', because all it does is usually all you need as a Frontend Dev. If you plan to only learn Javascript as a proper programming language, Node.js is a popular choice for backend development, if it gets more complicated than that. That's totally doable. For many things, expecially small to medium scale solo dev projects, you can totally get away with just JS, yes.At some point this no longer scales very well, but you can always cross that bridge when you get there and notice JS is limiting you. You can't build a 'Facebook' scale Project on just JS.. But Facebook started with just PHP, because that's what they knew how to write.Bottom line is - yes you can build useful stuff with just JS. Sure.VSCode the IDE you are statistically likely using - is entirely written in JS.",

Use proper variable names, var0 tells me nothing. Same with folder1. 2. Use less comments. 3. Split your code into functions, this together with proper variable names makes your code easier to understand and will lessen the need for commenting everything. Make sure to use the local keyword on variables to limit the the scope of your variables to that function. 4. Use \"#!/usr/bin/env bash\" instead of \"#! /bin/bash\" as this is considered best practice as it makes fewer assumptions about the underlying system. 5. I'd prefer you created the Bookmarked and Originals folder after the colour definition, but this is just my preference as I'd expect definitions to come before commands. 6. Implement error handling and have the script clean up after itself if something fails. 7. Avoid shadowing your variables by naming a variable the same in nested code, see file. 8. Less nesting, use function calls. And that's all I've time for.",

For completeness you should also test that any global variables were, or were not, changed as expected. It really doesn't matter how the function accomplishes the changes, whether it calls `f()` internally or not.And BTW, the word \"unit\" in \"unit test\" refers to the test itself, not what it's testing. The test itself should be executable as a unit, independent of what other tests may have run before it, or be running in parallel with it.",

I'm glad my feedback could be useful.Hopefully you found this new code to be easier to read and to possibly extend in the future, at least from my perspective I would feel that way lol. If/Else statements are very powerful, but once you start chaining tons of them, it is always a good place to stop and ask if you can do it in a better way, whether that be with a match / switch case (some languages call them switch), or using a design pattern like a state machine.Good example of that would be a video game character with multiple states like crouching or jumping. Someone could string a dozen if/else statements, and check nested if/else statements inside those blocks... Or they could use a state machine.On that note, I hope this [website](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) all about design patterns can be of use to you.Happy I could help, all the best and happy holidays!",

        "body": "I like the TODO application as a first project because it is a small thing you can grow one small thing at a time as you learn and grow with it.What I mean by that is start with a good TODO tutorial and get that into GitHub as your first project. Run it on GitHub Pages so now it is on the Internet too. Good stuff to learn to get that far. Then add the next small thing by adding a backend server and modify your TODO application to POST tasks there instead. POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE are REST verbs you can learn about. Just print the tasks to the console for now. Once you have that working add a database and save a POSTed task to the database using SQL. INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE are SQL statements that map directly to the REST verbs and they are often referred to as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Fill in the GET (SELECT) request to retrieve your tasks, the UPDATE, then DELETE. Now your application is full stack.Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn, when you need to learn it. MDN is a great resource for the frontend and there are many great resources for whatever backend and database you choose.As you build this, you are doing all of this locally, frontend, backend, database, and committing changes to git and pushing those changes to your GitHub repo as you go. To get your GitHub Pages frontend to talk to your backend running on your local machine you can learn about CORS (allows your frontend to talk to your backend) to add that to your backend then use \\`ngrok\\` to temporarily expose your server and port to the internet (only works while \\`ngrok\\` and your computer are running).Now that you have a full stack application running on the Internet, time to learn about authentication to make it so only registered users can access your server. You will add login/logout to your frontend and backend as well as user management. More REST and CRUD stuff to add for that too.Cloud stuff is next to get all of it running on the internet. That is a later topic.Whatever projects you pick, build projects as completely as you can. Make them full stack if that is your thing. Take TODO and add subscriptions/payments, member management, calendar schedules, email/sms reminders, single-sign on, SaaS deployment (cloud), whatever else you can think of. If you just do frontend, touch every angle of it in your projects.This is a possible roadmap for you that will keep you busy and hopefully motivated for a while. Once you can do this, you can pretty much build anything.Start small and keep adding small things to it.I hope this helps.",

Do you want to work on a very niche part of robotics in a large robotics firm (maybe focus on C or other low level languages), or can you see yourself building your own projects and maybe even launching a startup (in which case the TypeScript/React ecosystem might be a good focus)? Whilst having a broad understanding of all of the above is certainly useful (basically what a CS degree is for) having an end goal in mind will help you stay motivated and focus your learning towards something",

While software engineering in the U.S. currently doesn't require a license, the ongoing learning is similar - once you have some experience, you can spend a few weeks a year or a few hours a week keeping up with new skills.There's no hard requirement of a degree to get a job in the field. I work with some people who are self-taught or who switched into the field after getting a different degree (often in the sciences).However, since the market is tight right now and competition is high, realistically it's going to be extremely hard to get even an interview if you don't have a degree. When applying for a job you're competing against people who have degrees, so you'd need to be exceptionally good to beat them out for a job.Finally, you're completely wrong that what you're taught in school is outdated. The fundamentals of computer science don't really change. I got my degree 25 years ago. Half of the programming languages I used in school, and all of the frameworks, are dead now. However, nearly everything I learned is still useful. The fundamentals of DS&A, of operating systems and networking, of databases, of compiler theory - all of that is just as useful and relevant today.The goal of a college Computer Science (or Software Engineering) degree isn't to train you to be a technician, it's to teach you fundamentally how computers work and the mathematical theory behind programming. With that knowledge you can pick up new languages and tools quickly on your own.You expect a doctor to prescribe the latest drugs and use the latest medical devices. You expect a lawyer to be familiar with the latest case law. Their degrees weren't useless because they earned them years ago, the point of the degree was to learn the fundamentals, so that when new drugs or new laws come out they're equipped to understand them.",

You might find that you like doing it that way better, although it doesn't really help much with efficiency beyond tightening up the revision cycle. You can also use it to write your tests if you're the type of person who hates doing that. But then you actually need to review the tests, so if you hate code reviews it's still not a great idea.

Telling others to do the same without first establishing the conditions to have any leverage is basically just asking them to risk their future for nothing. Particularly people like you would be required to join and lead this effort for collective action, but often times the devs with actual leverage will not do so for perceived personal gain.",

If you look at the statistics by program group tab and you filter for 2024 in one box and 2025 in the other, you can see that there has been a noticeable drop off equal to approximately a 25% reduction not just in applications, but also in acceptances/confirmations for CS programs. Although these are only statistics for Ontario, I have no reason to believe that the same would not be happening elsewhere; I doubt there's anything special about these statistics compared to any others. And clearly, this shows that the cat is out of the bag regarding how CS is a more competitive field than it used to be, so there's no reason to suggest that enrollment won't keep decreasing for the foreseeable future.",

Developers in the west in general are obsessed with code quality to the point where it clashes with business outcomes. As long as the functionality works as expected and performance/stability is decent that’s all anyone on the business side of things and the customers care about. Code quality only matters to devs really. Let me reiterate functional testing is important to everyone, but code quality only matters to devs. A lot devs in India (and other off shore locations) aren’t paid enough to care about code quality but they do as a matter of pride care about the functional output being correct - the part their management and customers will see. Ironically this matches exactly with what the business and customers want. Why deal with a bunch of “overpaid” people complain about the need to refactor and take care of tech debt all the time perceived to be moving slowly and being difficult to manage when you can get others who will accept less pay and just do what you want them to do.",

Good engineers can debug systems without seeing any of the code much less running it in a debugger.There's lots of tools to help with diagnostics, but it's the process and the experience that really make the difference. Bad engineers have the same access to logs, metrics, tools, etc that good engineers have...and yet bad engineers often can *NEVER* find a problem that a good engineer will pinpoint in minutes.And \"debugging\" doesn't just stop at software: Once you develop the mindset and practices you end up applying it everywhere. After all, building software is really about *debugging people's problems* and patching them with software. Bad engineers write bad software because fundamentally they can't diagnose the problems users are having that they are hired to fix as a software developer.How do you get there? Have a talent for it helps a lot. After that it's lots and lots and lots of debugging of everything, everywhere, all the time.",

Even as a jr, document everything you do. Just finished a big project? Most jobs use a documentation system where you can just look up how to do things. Even a simple \"how to run this test\" can go a long way and is proof of what you did. \\- When you finsih something, give yourself credit and post it somewehre or mention it in standup. This is somethign many of us struggle with, giving ourselves credit. To get promoted you want the higher ups to know what you did and how you participated in that. \\- Take 10 minutes after standup to present anything or even show a doc. Again, you want to be recognizable. You want your boss to say \"OP had a good presentation post-standup that was really interesting\". \\- It's better to do 5 tasks and shwo your work than it is to do 10 tasks and keep quiet. This was my biggest issue. Id do tasks but never really wanted the praise or to present it so i kept quiet. My coworkers thought i wasnt doing much and in review seasons i didnt have much coworkers to sing my praises. \\- Dont be a passive engineer. A lot of engineers are good but are very passive. In stand up they dont really say they are stuck, they only say \"i continued working on X and investgiaging a small issue\". Nothing else. Nobody is going to help if you dont say \"im stuck\" and trust me engineers get more mad if you spend a week stuck on the same issue then if on day 1 you say \"im stuck\". Time is money. Reach out to coworkers and talk to them about issues. That conversation could lead you to getting close with a higher up engineer. If you as a junior can get a principal engineer to back you up, that goes a far way.",

I’ve been at my current position (my first one since outside of college) for about a year and 10 months give or take. From working there so far, I have worked with two really good engineers. Both of them have had two totally different experiences, but surprisingly, both have ended up in the same place doing the exact same thing. One of them was a self taught developer who tinkered with programming at a young age and learned many languages. Unfortunately, he didn’t pursue a CS degree because he grew up very poor but is in the works of getting one right now. This dude had many personal projects under his belt and worked extensively outside of work getting tasks at work completed. He had around 15 years of experience working with software and loved programming. He knew embedded programming really well too including how PLCs work and loved learning new things about programming. The other had a CE degree from Michigan Tech and has around 15 years of experience. He worked with embedded programming for the bulk of his career at GE Aviation. He really enjoys learning about new technologies and currently is helping us bring into the modern era an older application. This dude is my current mentor and has taught me so much in terms of how to program and ultimately, how to go about architecting and designing programs. He is a monster, he designed a completely new product from an older application at my company and reverse engineered the way it works so that it translated properly to a new language and environment. My coworkers had told him that the old project was a mess since it was written with a very old version of C++ (to most of us it was a mess lol). But he straight up in the interview said “nothing scared him”. My bosses laughed at him but he proved US ALL wrong. The thing about both of them that made them really good engineers was that both of them explicitly stated to me that all they did was “breathe and live” code. They programmed on all their free time and worked many hours outside of the usual 40 hour work week perfecting their craft. They read books, watched videos, they absorbed so much information on their free time that it clearly showed when they came into work ready to start their day. Like I feel helpless sometimes just seeing that they can take on so many tasks (especially tough ones) and my tasks I complete are mediocre at best. But the thing is, I am absorbing the knowledge they give to me. I’ve learned so much from starting my position that I don’t think I would be anywhere near where I am in knowledge and experience without either of them.",

        "body": "Yes, live interviews require a separate (but complementary) skill-set from the problem-solving & knowledge acquisition which are typically the key take-aways from private self-study. It may take less time to develop than technical skills, it depends on where you're at with things like handling stress, communication etc. It feels longer because people tend to, unwittingly, neglect it until they've bombed several interviews.The key thing is that self-study conditions are radically different from real interviews. There's no one breathing down your neck while you problem-solve. The time pressure, high stakes, and interviewers disrupting your thought process aren't simulated. This is often why people brain freeze in interviews.Do mock interviews alongside your self-study to identify your weaknesses, and ideally start them early so you have more time to fix issues. Here are two relevant resources: one on [getting truly interview ready](https://www.coditioning.com/blog/11/complete-tech-interview-prep-roadmap), another on [key interviewing skills](https://youtu.be/V2czxOT_hwU). You'd probably never feel 100% ready, but at least tick all the necessary boxes before stepping foot in interviews for jobs that you care about",

Even if problems seem similar it may show up with a different constraint and you the solution you'd normally do for that problem might no longer be effective or even feasible. Basically you get an increased scope of knowledge on top of the hindsight of knowing what approaches works well in a situation of multiple approaches being \"correct\".In the example you gave the big thing is scope. You can design and architect a website or microservice but also remember generally thats an extremely small scope and more than likely is a solved problem. Like anyone could go on some system design prep site and know how to design and architect twitter or facebook or some trading site. Where the seniority in that comes in is knowing why you may want to take some approaches vs others based on needs because you've had prior experience making such calls. Often time what you think in your head or what works on paper doesn't play out the same in reality and there tends to be a lot of edge cases that are missed.What makes the big n experience so valuable is because you get exposed to a unique scale problem. Because they work around stuff so big they get to see the extreme edge cases a little more frequently even if theyll never directly work on it but just that visibility is so valuable especially to similar sized companies. But you can turn around and see big n employees might not do well at a smaller company because the breadth of tools they need to know how to use might be something they never even have had to touch or think about previously. Or that scale isnt the big issue and theres another type of problem that needs to be solved.Like if you can crank out a business/ecom site effectively without much help or guidance (this includes truly understanding the business reasons behind what your developing) you are probably a senior at a non tech non super huge scaled company. But you wont be a senior at a company where scale matters and vice versa.You could be a senior level expert at CUDA programming and then be junior at cloud stuff. Thats why again id put senority to yoe/overall exposer and it changes depending on the scope.",

Harden your alerts, metrics, and your tests and you will *reduce* the chances of an outage. In my experience I've categorized outages as unforced errors and just being unlucky.Was the system down because of an unforced error? Lead a technical review on it. Why did it get to that point? How? How can you prevent it from happening again and how can you apply this to OTHER cases in the future? Reduce unforced errors to 0.Unfortunately. there will be times that you will need to put out fires. That's part of the job. For example, [Log4Shell - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) was a week ruiner for many. AWS, Azure, etc. outages have caused fires at work.Also fwiw if you're not really needed in these meetings, you can really just go to the concert and attend chats through your phone if you want.",

But me helping you above and beyond the normal agreement is a favor, and sometimes I'm not in a position to grant you that favor. Boundaries are important.However, I'm also going to try to be accommodating within reason. In a situation like that, I'd offer to check in when I get back from the concert. If the issue's still ongoing, then perhaps some responsibility could be handed off to me so that others can get a break. This is probably really helpful as a junior, because while you might not be the best help for the initial incident, there can often be follow-up work that is less intensive. Like someone needs to run a database query every five minutes and make sure A stays less than B, until we can get the alert automation in place. And if I'm on the primary crew and I've been at it for six hours and a junior comes in at midnight and says, \"How can I help?\" you bet I'll hand that over and get some sleep.Finally, there's also the issue of Emergency Theatre. Do we really need all hands on deck? Or do we need the appearance that we're busting our butts to get it working again? There's not much you can do about this in the moment except recognize it and deal with it later. Figure out why this is the case. There's usually some failure in the management chain - some mid-level director with more power than sense, who has to be appeased. Or maybe a high-profile customer. Recognizing this and knowing it is very important as you navigate office politics in the future.",

The business would like to address that need on the timescale defined in the needs assessment. Maybe that's \"right now, ASAP\", maybe it's \"sometime before Q4\".

E.g. maybe the job description says 6+ YOE but candidate has 4 YOE and has a Senior SWE title already, or it says looking for embedded C but candidate has several years of embedded Rust experience and has C listed at least somewhere.- If they wrote a cover letter, do they actually understand the kind of role they're applying to? If it's generic or looks like AI slop that's an anti-signal.- Does the resume indicate a clear understanding of WHY the info they list is important or worth mentioning? I do not want a laundry list of every task a candidate has ever done, I want the highlights that indicate skillsets and ability.- Have they articulated previously done work that's similar to what we're looking for, or are they just regurgitating a tech stack? For strong candidates I don't care if they have exact tech stack matches, but sometimes more junior or otherwise weaker-signal candidates will get to a screen for having rare tech stack matches.- Do I recognize their university, prior companies, or anything else on their resume (e.g. notable open source contributions, math or programming competitions, publications at relevant venues)?And frankly at the end of the day I am wildly overloaded and am one person making a quick judgement. I also put significantly more weight on candidates that have been referred to me somehow or who have a shared connection.

At my last job I was involved in hiring, and we would always get at least 1,000 applications in the first 24 hours after posting, usually we'd end up with 3-5k. We started with a code screen, basically a couple LC easy questions, that usually got us down to a few hundred. Then we'd divvy up the resumes and mark them as reject or pass. It was a quick glance maybe 5 seconds each resume to see if they had the basic qualifications, the vast majority of those failed. Then we'd be down to \\~20-50 people and we'd have our HR do a phone screen, basically ask about their basic qualifications, make sure they're interested in the job at the salary range we're offering and the tech stack they'd be working on. We rarely rejected anyone in this round but many took themselves out of the running so typically we'd be down to 10-20 at that point. Then we'd have the hiring manager have a phone screen with them. If they made it to this point they had something on their resume we liked, so we'd typically ask them about it and really drill down and ask for excruciating detail to make sure they actually did it. Spoiler alert, most people are exaggerating and/or lying about their specific contribution to a project on their resume, and it's super easy to weed out. That got us down to \\~5 which we would invite to interview.Once we selected to interview them, I would then read a cover letter if they sent one, although I think a lot of other folks didn't even read them then. This is also the point I would look at their github if they had one on their resume or anything else they included as side projects. I think I was one of the few people involved in hiring who did any of that most would just look at the resume 10 minutes before the interview. Then the interview was with a few folks, we had one do a tech screen where we give them a sample problem and watch them code, change requirements and see how they adapt. One does a culture fit interview where they ask questions related to soft skills, how do you handle conflict, those types of questions. One is a business round where our product person asks them some questions related to our business and some basic logic questions to see if they can reason through product requirement type things. Then everyone meets and ranks the candidates, we come up with a consensus order, and send the offer out to the first one, if they decline send the offer to the second one, etc. It's also possible at that point that some people just get a fail so even if they're the highest rated candidate we'd rather restart the process than hire them, although that's rare most people who've made it to this stage are at least getting hired if they're the best candidate interviewing for that role who accept because as you can see it's a long and painful process and we'd rather not start over.",

In what world, and from which perspective, is that even remotely close to ideal?Skills and execution. It doesn't fucking matter if you like doing it or not, so long as you actually do it, and do and do it well.I'll happily admit there is some correlation between the quality of your output and how much joy your work brings you, but it's not 1:1.>but I heard already from some managers that they completely don't look at cover letters due to lack of time, CV is more optimized. Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.If you're submitting an application, you are selling yourself. No salesperson in the history of ever has tried to get their counterpart to just read the product description. They want face time, to tell the story of their product, to make an emotional appeal.Do you think they send out empty e-mails, with just the technical specs attached and the words \"for your kind consideration\"? Or do you think they will use every sentence, every square inch of screen real-estate that they can get to make the other side interested in a conversation?Why on earth would anyone believe that the proven process would work differently when the opportunity you want them to grasp is yourself?For what it's worth, I currently going through my first hiring process on the employer side - I am sitting past an HR filter, so I don't even know if there were any cover letters; I wasn't giving any. But I can tell you this: The majority (of a very, very small pool) of CVs I have seen would not get a pass from me; there's too many slightly reddish flags, and as desperate as I am to work with a larger team, I simply don't have the time to allow someone to correct the misconceptions that their CV has created in the first place.But I would have read a cover letter; I would have read a slightly more detailed CV, and some of the things that tripped me up could have potentially been explained away. Who we invite is not entirely my choice, but I do get a say.And your problem is: I don't aim to be fair, I don't give a damn about giving you a chance. I care about filling a vacancy with someone who primarily has the right skills, enough experience and who I can stand having to talk to a few times a week.And if I know one thing it is this: Once we do hire someone, I lose my voice. I can't get them fired if I think they're a dud, or hard to get along with, so - for my own sake - I have to be very careful and weigh working in a team that's too small vs. working with someone I don't want to work with.And then, neither a CV or a cover letter take eons to write, or to customize for a specific position. Make your documents modular; have blocks that you can shift around if needed, and templates that you can remove or include.Believe me, I write cover letters when I apply for jobs. I have zero proof and no data to show that they work - but I really don't see a world where it's not worth the bit of extra effort.",

So what I decided to do is turn that boring work into something exciting. Even if im not getting paid more for spending extra efforts on it, I felt pleasure in the work from praises by upper management. Just getting your name recognized at the top can be a motivational aspect that turns something boring into something exciting like: \"how can i surpass myself even more next time?\"For example, I worked a few years ago on a feature to create some key vault. So its a process feature, literally no programming, you could get it done in 1 hour by click click click > done. But I decided to present it on a review meeting and instead of the typical boring power point slides that engineers talk through to present their work, I decided to make it dramatic. Kinda like a thriller. I looked up articles on what happens if Secrets arent stored in a key vault. And I got a couple news articles about Uber for example or some other companies in which their credentials like API keys weren't securely stored and thus a breach happened. So basically I took these examples, added ominous bgm, and started narrating it like its a thriller movie lol. The meeting turned from boring to everyone quickly locked in. Their reactions were priceless. In the end i got all the engineers to store their credentials in the key vault. This is just one example of how you could turn something boring into something thrilling and exciting. Upper management started inviting other managers whenever they saw my name on the presenters list. They became like my fanbase \"I wonder what he has for us this time!\" Lol Personally that became my passion for a while! That has bolstered my mental outlook even if it wasnt a monetary incentive involved. Money isn't everything sometimes (in terms of satisfaction/happiness), and in a way, it actually unlocked a skill in me: story telling. Thats a skill of product managers, so it opens up more career options!",

And since you're living paycheck-to-paycheck, this would make things more financially difficult for you.From a purely mental/emotional perspective, leaving your job gives you more peace because you don't have to stress out a job that you honestly hate and does not give you any value. You have more time to yourself to plan your next move, or take some time for self-care. So this would benefit you.Ideally you would have F-you money, so that you could take the mental/emotional route without the stress of wondering if you have enough to meet financial obligations. My personal opinion: if this job is really affecting your mental health to the point where you don't care about getting fired, then you should feel empowered to let it go. The importance of mental health is vastly underestimated in this sub",

It produced a ton of products used in homes, and even had a massive research wing. Getting a job there was seen as being set for life. You had a job for life and a nice pension for retirement.In 1981 a new CEO came in. He cut any non profit part of the company. Every department was expect to fire the bottom 15%, no matter how they did compared to others. I think he removed the pensions, but not sure on this one. GE’s stock price soared.Jack Welsh’s tenure at GE was the catalyst that set corporations to become what they are today. Also a CEO’s job is to increase share price. They can be removed and fine (woe is them /s).If you want stability and to be appreciated for the work, and you’re in the US, go govie. Maybe not right this second, because the current admin is anti-government worker. However, you won’t make big tech money, but you can still get over 100k a year pretty easily. More if you go contractor, but you get more replaceable (being good at your job or having a clearance will still play a big role).",

Helpful for people who forget to track their work throughout the year.  3. Manager-side summarization - Some companies are experimenting with AI to help managers synthesize feedback from multiple sources.The biggest shift I've noticed isn't AI doing the reviews—it's AI making it harder to hide behind vague statements.

If you know the Spring Framework, learning Spring Boot should be pretty easy. It’s supposed to make things easier. - more daunting, but if you learn React, you will hit more position requirements.

DevOps and CI/CD tooling are becoming titles, so if you're interested in maintaining software ecosystems you can take some courses on them. Likewise, React and VueJS have largely replaced vanilla jQuery. If you like web dev, pick either one up. Keep your jQuery sharp, it's still relevant while working with those frameworks.But it looks like you're primarily specializing in C++, going by your projects? It might be worth doubling down on that angle and perhaps picking up Rust as well.Either way, you should tailor your resumes to the platform(s) you're applying to work on. A resume that says \"I do everything\" isn't going to catch eyes the way that \"I'm your C++ expert\" can. Resumes are brochures of what you can do in the posting you apply for. Using a one-size-fits-all resume is not the right strategy if a company is one of your dream employers.

Here are some platforms that connect businesses with candidates: [https://pathforward.org/returnships/](https://pathforward.org/returnships/) [https://www.reachire.com/returnships-for-business/](https://www.reachire.com/returnships-for-business/) [https://www.irelaunch.com/relaunchers#get-started](https://www.irelaunch.com/relaunchers#get-started)I did not find work through that, but through some of the resources I found on these websites, I was able to learn how to frame my career break for future interviews positively.

For example, looking at latency of virus scanning for images. However, the cutoff is much more \"is this too slow at the scale we expect to matter\" instead of \"is this the absolute best option\". Also, we don't have free reign to choose whatever stack we want. There are languages that our developers are familiar with, ones for which we have tooling (e.g. Terraform modules), and for which we can easily collect metrics. I got in a bit of trouble for using Python for a cloud function script because it wasn't an \"approved language\". IMO, you can absolutely build something that would scale to 100m daily users in Python or Ruby (not that I would want to), as the language matters much less than the architecture and actual implementation. I think there is this idea that you need to use C or Rust to get the \"absolute best performance\", and that is probably true on a micro scale, but on a macro scale, you can just use a native extension and get the same performance boost without actually writing low-level code.",

At my last job my manager actually had a whole meeting with me about gold lining and 80/20 rule. What i really gained from that convo is that in business its super hard to value \"mental work\". You cant really put that into a metric and more specifically if you have story points to your tickets, that'd be the only real way to show mental work in the stuff you do. You have to be your own advocate in that regard.

My teams (also at “rainforest”) have all of the juniors working on infra at some point, and I highly recommend OP taking a step back and looking at the “meta” tasks. Explicitly “building AWS infrastructure” without seeing the patterns is a gap worth focusing on. I know life at that company suck and people will ghost you, but there are many people who WILL bend over backwards to help you figure these things out given you’ve done some digging yourself and can ask informed questions.In my experience pretty much all feature work at all levels is going to have to consider business logic and deployments to a service that runs on compute, extend or create DAOs that write to databases, add routing rules for new APIs to an LB, and update front ends — the foundation for an application; lambdas and queues and ddb streams are all very common patterns too. That alone is a really good place to start researching trade offs, which is something you can do very intentionally while building, or even by looking through low severity system issues during oncalls. If you’re on the hook for LLDs, there’s even more room to dig into trade offs and alternatives.",

I don't click Accept unless I've had a conversation with the person or they're connected with someone I know who can vouch for them.

For example, home automation is one of mine.Most \"smart home\" tech is incredibly stupid and as a result if you really want it to do smart things, you need to get into the weeds of the tech. That work needs to run somewhere, so that's an excuse for building a home lab. Having a home lab also opens up other wishes, like a Plex media server or backup solution for the family's computers, etc.If I'm building a home lab and building/running all these services, it only makes sense to build it all with IaC and keep track of everything with Git, just like I'd do in a professional setting. Maybe I won't PR myself and yolo it all right into main, but otherwise I'm building things out for my home with the same tools, tech, and patterns I use professionally.Because of this I'm very often doing \"POC\" work for my job on my own home lab first. *That's* where I built my skills first for example, in building and running k8s clusters and all the downstream details that brings for how I structure my code to run on k8s, how do I handle CI/CD cleanly to deploy, etc.When it comes to actual software, I'm coding a lot of family management apps to help track kid chores, keep our finances in order, etc. I'm also coding on robotics and drone projects, including some with/for my kids to run their Lego robot creations. Beats the hell out of building yet another \"pet store\" tutorial app I'll never care about.But always building my own stuff as \"professional grade\" and not just half-assing it because \"it's just for me so who cares\".",

That's a little tongue in cheek, but it's worth having some perspective: people that work mining coal a mile underground don't do it for fun, don't study coal mining as a hobby, and don't participate in miner meetups. We all need to keep some perspective on how lucky we are that there's even a question there.In that vein:> I enjoyed going to the office, using my split keyboard, having triple monitor setup, cool desk decorationsI don't mean this to be discouraging at all: but you need to get more out of things than that. Not that there's anything wrong with enjoying better tools and environment - but careers are long and tweaking your setup isn't going to keep you motivated beyond the next few months, let alone decades.But all that said - you aren't entirely wrong. This is both a job and a career, and if you're not learning stuff or getting growth opportunities then that isn't good. You won't always have interesting things to build, but if you never get that then you're going to stagnate and that's where people run into trouble finding new jobs.You should be able to work with your manager to identify some growth areas and find some tickets where you can learn something. That's a perfectly reasonable expectation. But the key is to focus on what you can learn and what new skills you can build: it being \"exciting\" doesn't really enter into it.",

Mind you, I started out working on build systems at FAANG, and it was very different than what it is today. The trick is to find platform teams that are hiring SWEs where you can build tools that take the pain of infrastructure off of the product teams.There are a lot of DevOps/SRE roles that intersect this space and are 90% config-writing (infrastructure as code), but if you can get into writing custom Terraform modules and Kubernetes controllers you'll be highly sought after. I had a recruiter recently tell me that they pay their platform SWEs more than their backend or frontend SWEs because they're more specialized and harder to find. It's not for everyone, but give it a solid try, you won't be boxing yourself in (at least this early in your career). I have specialized in this role for 10 years so I show up in searches for senior positions. Recruiters that find me for product teams will usually end up having the hiring manager reject my resume because I haven't worked on product for a decade. But I'm not pursuing those types of roles at this point anymore. I think you've got a ways before you're in that position. At your level it's normal to jump between domains to figure out what you like.",

For instance a meeting was scheduled for 3:50 every day even though I clock out at 3:45 with a comment that we shouldn’t leave until 4.

They're both the same. I went to college in Virginia and every recruiter came to the state's #1 Engineering + CS school (Virginia Tech) and almost every recruiter went to #2 (University of Virginia). I'm talking over 200 companies at alleged #35 Virgina Tech's [expo](https://www.sec.vt.edu/expo.html) where I got internship offers. We interviewed on campus in rented rooms.What matters is #1 work experience in the form of internship or co-op. #2 is university prestige so rankings but, again T30 vs T50 is fake. #1 or #2 in your state is fine. Like University of Wyoming has garbage rankings but companies in Wyoming will recruit there. After first job at graduation, university prestige matters much less, if at all.",

If you get past the sentence above, then think like an investor and ask them the hard questions. Do not hold back. Go hard on them. If they're competent and experienced entrepreneurs, they should welcome these types of questions from anyone they want to bring on board. After all, they're effectively asking you to be an investor, not just an employee:* Does either founder have any past experience running any kind of business?* Has either founder ever founded a startup before? If so, what was the outcome?* Ask to see their pitch deck, for them to give you the pitch.* Are they already seeking investment? I would imagine they must be if they don't have any cash of their own to invest. Ask to get a detailed report on their efforts so far and why they haven't found investment yet* Does either of them have any connections to people with capital (VCs, angel investors, etc.)?* Ask the hard questions: How soon do you expect to get funding? What is your contingency plan if that gets delayed? (funding often takes longer than anticipated even for companies with a good product, previous investment, etc.)There are a bunch of other more specific questions about early stage startups that should be google-able.

Sure, working with others is better than doing projects on your own, but I would not hold my breath since realistically for now (and possibly forever if they don't get investment) it'll just be a few desperate juniors such as yourself (\"You get what you pay for\" will be their guiding principle). I can guarantee they won't hire a senior or CTO until they get funding. Also, good engineering practices cost money: licenses, infrastructure, etc.--not a lot of money, but they seem kind of short on money, which would be another good question to ask: if they can't even afford laptops, how will they afford AWS, etc.Good luck. I just want to make sure you approach this with hard realism: it's something to put on your resume, maybe you'll learn a few things. Anything else is like winning the lottery. Hell, I treat stock options at funded startups that are hitting their milestones as lottery tickets. If you want my labor, I work for cash, not promises.

You're better off just getting a MS degree to strengthen your resume and trying to land a regular job again. Because - unless you are brilliant - what's actually going to happen is you're going to get a PhD, then you're going to be a postdoc for a couple of years making mid money, then you might get a faculty positon at like West Texas A&M University and you get to decide if you want to move to the outskirts of Amarillo, TX for your career.

Then some basic devops implementation choices, ie ec2 server with nginx, api gateway with lambdas, how you'd handle scaling.I think system design is really just knowing about what the available tools are, and why you'd make one choice over another and the drawbacks and benefits of them. Using react or just plain javascript or nextjs, SQL vs NoSQL, lambdas vs EC2, ECS vs Kubernetes, client side rendering vs server side rendering (ie maybe you dont want server side rendering with immediately important information like financial data or medical data, but otherwise you'd want it especially publicly facing applications).",

Then after that is really the beginning of the more \"cool\" stuff like operating systems, cryptography, robotics, databases, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, computer graphics, compilers, algorithms, etc.>If programming makes sense, which language suits a math student who’s learning for understanding, not employability?Python (due to amount of resources online)>I want to keep learning mathematics If you have never taken Number Theory, I recommend the Intro to Number Theory book by Mathew Crawford from AoPS. I did that when I was in elementary school and it's a phenomenal book. And like all AoPS books, challenging.For Discrete Math, it's Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications, Kenneth Rosen.Those are the more \"CS\" sided part of math. Math majors of course would be: Calculus 1, 2, 3 -> Linear Algebra + Diff Eq -> Real Analysis 1/2 + Modern Algebra 1/2 -> Topology/etc",

I started learning C# early on in life because I loved video games and wanted to make them, there were two primary languages you could accomplish that with back then (this was about 20 years ago) C# with the XNA framework, or C++ with a library like SDL. XNA transitioned to monogame, and SDL is now SDL2. I believe Unity was around but it wasn't popular yet, unreal engine existed but the commercial license was expensive. I went with learning C# because I wanted to make games for the Xbox 360 and monogame was free to use, which I did, I launched two games before finding work in the industry doing web development. That was my path and it worked well for me.In your case, because you have a heavy math background and you're only interested in learning id try LISP or maybe Python. Those are less marketable languages but have heavier focuses on Math.Any mainstream language to start is a good one though. Game programming is fairly math intensive which you might enjoy but it's very labor intensive and requires a knack for art , if you don't mind trying to make your own graphics and aren't all that concerned about design philosophy then id still recommend C# and monogame. Maybe you could start by building pong and then transitioning to a game like tetris. Good luck!",

He was a passionate engineer that was always working on one creative coding project or another outside of work though so it was probably easy to demonstrate that he hadnt left the craft behind to pm.Ive heard from others that its really difficult to go back because its hard to show that you havent lost your skills, dev mindset. From my understanding for them the difficult part hasnt been the coding challenges of the dev interviews because they stayed sharp but more like hiring managers look at them as a pm and dont want to interview them for an engineer role. So i guess it comes down to maintaining a stream/timeline of projects coding that you can use to say \"see this? I am still a dev i havent stopped building things\"",

I personally include tech stack for each position, but you could include the tech as you describe what you did. I think a tech stack list is easier to read quickly, though. The idea is rather than saying, “I did x,” you say, “I used Y to do X.” May make a difference. Right now, I don’t know if you just know SQL and a little bit of python. It were you manually fixing data by inspecting stuff individually? Most likely no one is doing that, but your resume feels kind of generic/shallow. There’s potentially missing stuff. Did you run this all locally? Were you involved at all with deployment or setup? You must have used some other services or libraries, right? Maybe not libraries, but hopefully you get the idea I’m suggesting. Good luck!",

My biggest recommendation would be to reach out to recruiters, though the state of the industry right now makes that a little rough. But every offer I've ever received aside from my first, I got because a recruiter was advocating for me. Also, connections in a company help a ton. If you have any friends from college, or friends of a friend, who work in big tech, there's usually a way they can endorse or refer you. That should get you fast-tracked. Good luck. Like I said, the industry is rough right now. Recruiters got hit pretty hard in the last round of lay-offs and the ones who are left don't have many positions to fill.",
