A common loading pattern we have been using is:- for streaming: source --> Kafka --> snowflake (snowpipe streaming to tables)- for batches: source --> AWS s3 (~lake) --> snowflake (external tables)- in both cases once in Snowflake: raw staged tables (bronze) --> structured, type-cast, deidentified views (silver) --> Kimball/star/mart views with metadata (gold)I've been liking this system so far. The key difference with streaming and batch in the above cases are that the batch method keeps the raw/bronze data in s3 via external tables, so I guess that's a \"lake\", while the streaming method loads the CDC events into a table resting in the snowflake data warehouse. We use dagster to orchestrate and dbt to run the jobs. The technologies are good - the challenges are behavioural in nature.There's probably a more consistent way to do the above, but it does work. I guess the lake/s3 component just exists because it is simple and cheap to read from some provided s3 dump than to add a \"copy into\" step. We would probably would have done the same for streaming, but snowpipe streaming is a good enough solution at the moment so we can skip a redundant intermediate load to s3.",

Model the infrastructure (make it modular and scalable), create some processes, and give power to the people within some defined boundaries. It’s more work, but I feel it’s easier — after inital cost I can go do streaming, swap out tools, optimize DB tables, create alert systems and stuff.Plus the experience managing your own files, metadata, debugging fucking notebooks is atrocious. But maybe that’s just me. I like sitting in my black terminal with a box cursor….",

I had a similar thought about a candidate that was clearly using AI to answer questions. My initial thought was to pass, but the more I thought about it the more I realized that it was old thinking and pretty hypocritical to judge someone for using AI when we as a team use it all the time and I used it to cross reference their resume to the JD and produce the questions they were answering. Ultimately I set up another call to just chat. Told them that I use AI regularly and asked what they used. I asked them about using it to help answer questions. I told them I'd like to talk about some things and just wanted their answer in their own words. It became clear that they knew what they were talking about but there was a confidence issue. I have the same thing in interviews, I often freeze in my thoughts when I should be able to easily answer. I don't know what the right thing to do is, but as of now the use of AI is so ingrained in business life how can I dismiss its use completely. I think these are conversations we need to have with recruiters and recruits.",

Here you learn to be good, while the first is where you learn to be a consultant :face_with_tears_of_joy:But my experience, the business starts by hiring data science / “ML” experts and then they find out they need data. At this moment the salary of the experts is ticking, so when the data engineer comes in, he/she is already behind schedule.

        "body": "I've been in 3 different roles as a Data Engineer, and they've all been so wildly different to me and without knowing more specifics without your role, I can't give too specific advice. But here are some general pointers from when I first started that might help.\\- Learn general data engineering practices / lingo. You're going to hear things like: Data Governance, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage, Data Warehouse, ETL, ELT, Data Lake, OLAP, OLTP, Data Mesh, etc. You don't have to learn everything all at once, or even fully understand everything the first time. Start with who / what you'll work with, expand from there.\\- Learn SQL VERY well. Two sides to this: learn a dialect VERY well and learn a database implementation well. The former will help you with your day to day job as a junior. Learning how to solve common patterns, use common functions, solve common SQL problems, etc will help you for your whole career. For the latter, you would want to really be able to explain things like indexes (which ones to use, why), data storage internals, how to read execution plans and optimize, etc. This is something you should be picking up gradually throughout your career, and I would only expect more mid level / senior engineers to know more and more about these things. For a junior, just begin learning it slowly, but don't stress out too much. \\- Lots of companies are now on the cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP). If your company is one of them, you should learn the stack. Learn the services that your company is using, what role / problem it solves, and how to configure/work with it. Whatever your company uses, be it Azure Synapse/AWS Redshift for data warehousing, ADLS / AWS S3 for object storage, learn that tech deeply, learn how authorization/authentication works on your cloud platform, and those two alone will carry forth across cloud providers. Once you learn what you work with, you can slowly expand outwards if you so desire. \\- Additional point to the above, lots of companies also use Databricks / Snowflake. If applicable, learn what each of those companies provide in terms of offerings or services. IMHO learning either of these opens the door for more data engineering roles in the future.\\- Maybe a controversial tip, but as a software engineer turned data engineer, I personally still apply software engineering principals just through a data engineering lens. That means following best practices when writing clean code, working with things like CI/CD, git, code review, etc. This may seem like a no brainer, but not every shop hires data engineers from the software engineer / CS grad pipeline. Lots of DEs I knew came from data analyst or scientist positions, and had no clue of the SWE fundamentals. I think treating this job as a specialized SWE position will help you a LOT with the menial stuff, and it'll allow you to pivot if you ever want to.I omitted a lot, but I think this is good to start, and I think these are general enough to help you no matter what kind of DE position you're put into.",

I am not sure about your proficiency in either, but try to solve some difficult problems in both without using AI (or may be ask AI to generate questions for you to solve). In SQL, try to build common patterns in data engineering with some sample data - MERGE INTO, SCD Type 2, some small star schema design. In python, know common patterns used with data structures - list, dict, set and iterators. These will help you in first few months. You can slowly move towards understanding the bigger data engineering architecture - SQL Optimization techniques, ETL, Data Vault modelling. I recommend you get 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering' book and read it once in a while. Re-read the concepts again once every few months as it will add new perspectives as you gain experience. Once you master SQL and python, tools are not going to be difficult for you. You will get to see that irrespective of tool - Spark or Snowflake, Airflow or ADF (or any GUI based orchestration) - the build patterns and outcomes are almost exactly same. While you master technical things, also try to be curious about the business problem you are solving. It doesn't matter if you know 4 different tools, if you cannot answer what business problem you solved. For this, AI would be immensely helpful. Let's say someone wants to build a CRM dashboard for which you are building data model - You might hear terms like Sales Funnel or Conversion rate - Try to ask AI and get an overall perspective of the problem you are trying to solve. You will work with lot of business analysts who will be more than happy if you talk their language. These should be enough for now.",

The key is to make sure that the genai app generates SQL queries that are logged so that the data scientist and data analyst can review them later if need be. Even with a great gym AI tool in my experience a client is only going to be able to explain about 80% of the queries they want in layman's terms. There's certain things that the client won't be able to explain without a deep understanding of the table structure because they wouldn't know to ask. It can move us as data analysts and data scientists away from the simple monotonous queries that probably make up 80% of the work, into more interesting queries and working more as a consultant/advisor to our non-technical business partners. What's going to be critical for this is that the data scientist or data analyst needs to have excellent communication skills, specifically being able to take technical subjects and communicate them clearly to non-technical people.",

Your current plan (Dagster+dbt on ECS) is the right tool for this scale.The real problem is not technical. A senior analyst from the parent company does not know how to use your stack and wants to replatform because Databricks has a schedule button he understands. That is a political problem not a tooling problem.Before you rip out six months of work, try this. The analyst needs a UI to schedule SQL. You can give him that without Databricks. Set up Airflow with the UI exposed (or use dbt Cloud if you have budget). Show him how to drop his SQL into a dbt model or an Airflow DAG. If he still cannot work with it after that, then the real conversation is whether the parent company is going to force their tooling choices down regardless of fit.Sometimes you lose these battles and the decision gets made above you. But make sure the tradeoff is clear before it happens. Databricks at your scale is expensive and you are not going to use 90 percent of what you are paying for.",

Your manager has likely built his career and secured his position by, as you say it, running the corporate playbook. He is in meetings you are not in and has access and built in authority in a way that you do not. This gives managers a natural political advantage over their ICs - so you need to tread carefully. I would not risk overplaying your hand by going to the CTO to break out from under him unless there is a clear business need you can point to - even then this is even harder without your manager on side. I’ve worked with managers like this before, yes they suck to work with. But judging on your post and responses I think it’s very likely that your manager has marked you as someone to keep an eye on and plan against. You’ve tipped your hand by openly having conflict with them. A coup at this point will fail. This person hasn’t made it to this point just to let an IC who wants to do things their way ruin their career. If you go to your CTO and effectively say “I can’t work with this guy because he doesn’t let me operate the way I want to”, what would your CTO say? You need a better way of framing it. Also you only get one shot to pull the “change things or I’m leaving” card and you better have an offer in hand that you’d be ok taking if things didn’t go your way.",

We create connections declaratively using terraform and orchestrate them with airflow. We barely touch the UI, only for logs and maybe the occasional manual sync. The open source and number of different connectors are worth it. Only con for airbyte is that in our opinion the normalization step from having the data in json blob to a RDBMS table takes unnecessarily long. It stupid. Therefore, we are pivoting our RDBMS sources to ingest them with Trino. Where we use dbt to write models that serve as ingestion with no transformation. So, Trino + dbt = ingestion. With dbt incremental models you can handle all sorts of ingestion patterns. For our other sources such as sftp, API, sharepoint etc., we keep using airbyte. Around 90% of our sources are RDMS though.Additionally Trino can handle reverse etl easily to another database. Moreover, we can also write them as dbt models maintaining full lineage from ingestion all the way to Reverse ETL and other exposures.",

Fivetran can get expensive (high MAR usage) when you have cases of large datasets (SaaS or on-prem) that need to get ingested each month but also have low number of updates (meaning you cannot save MAR if rows change may times per month).

The official Docker docs are solid, and TechWorld with Nana has good intro videos if you prefer something visual.For Terraform, Terraform: Up and Running by Brikman is the standard recommendation for good reason. Work through the first few chapters and deploy something real, even if it is just a storage bucket with IAM policies attached. The plan/apply/destroy muscle memory is what makes it click.For CI/CD, GitHub Actions is the lowest-friction starting point for most DE projects. Build a pipeline that runs your dbt tests and deploys on merge to main. Once you have done that once, the concepts generalize to Jenkins, GitLab CI, or whatever else you run into.Raw Kubernetes knowledge is rarely needed for DE work specifically. Most orchestration on GKE or EKS you interact with through Helm charts or managed Airflow, and the k8s internals stay hidden. Docker and Terraform solid first.",

I did most of my time writing scrapers (as I just scraped the web of my last company, it was easier than that dumpster fire of a schema), experiments in jupyter notebooks, ingestions to embeddings for vector dbs, API with fast API, and Dockerfile and compose yaml, and the rest of 80% of the times debugging my prod python microservices and reading docs.So it is not like it's lost time, you still have the skills and they won't atrophy, no matter what happens to the field and you'll pivot to something else successfully.I am actually mostly worried about my DE stack knowledge but hopefully i'll pick it up again in a month or two.",

It's actually ridiculous how quick you can get things done. I'm currently playing with agentic systems - I have a bot that looks at some market indicators, asks an llm about it, and either buys, holds or sells Bitcoin based on the answers and provides the justification. I have another agent working on an old piece of software I wrote to refactor it and in future add/update features as my business partner comes up with ideas.If you can demonstrate the AI skills and have the background of data engineering etc you'll land a good job easily.

You can't make up for the tech debt and disorganisation of some places.Documentation is a mess absolutely everywhere and those consolidation projects take years and fail every time, in that there will be N+1 repositories. And then they will do it again. It's the biggest boondoggle in the business. Funnily, they always go hard on permissions on that latest repository and will require multiple panel reviews and checkins for literally anything you want to put in, to the point it's impossible to use. So don't think about that anymore. Focus on building your own documentation silo wherever it is and however you want to. The goal is a foundation for your own work, not a general thing for other people. And you've got other responsibilities? That's also common. Try to see it as a good thing in that you get some extra job stability. That aside, are people complaining? Have you looked around and realised there are others who have been there for years or decades and not pulling their own weight? lol. They probably created most of these problems too!This is all extremely common. If you move on now you will likely experience the same thing and worse, so my advice: seeing as you are not fully invested in this job, try to see it as your personal playground to try some other working and thinking styles, until you find something that lets you function there without the anxiety.If anyone ever asks something you don't know, you're not the expert on that, but will try to find someone (and often, people will just forget it entirely!) If anyone calls you out on not knowing every atom in the universe, just repeat the same thing. Some people are aggressive like that but it's not you, they just have it in for easy prey. You'll do okay.",

(This approach is useful because you get repeated sign off that your manager is aware that these projects are not moving forward as capacity is allocated.

That is all irrespective of AI.I do agree with your idea of treating metrics like APIs, that’s a really key thing to get right for AI, and you’ve got some other really good practices in there too. I just think what successful teams are doing now is evolving data governance, rather than rejecting it. It’s still governance.",

But to answer the part that has not been answered here yet, normalization does save space when contrasted with raw data entering the transactional system, e.g. displayed or entered at Point of Sales terminal, as well as with denormalized data in a DWH. That is not the point however, as storage has grown and cheapened even for on prem systems, since normalization was invented. The point is speed and scaling the write operations. When yoyr transactional (e.g. sales) system has to record hundreds and thousands of items scanned, or ordered online every second, it doesn't have time to repeatedly write the customer address, or name in each row of a big table. Rather thatbinfo is saved once in a normalized table and its id is used in each row representing item bought.In analytical (dwh) workloads, in contrast, you want fast bulk reads of whole chunks of a table, and each join is a burden for the analytical system, while storage and write speed are more relaxed",

The other is to think about distinctions between: abstraction, generalization, opacity, and other similar \"operating at high level\".Usually abstraction in engineers context means finding a simplifying solution over otherwise individuated problems. Example, any math theorem you learned in school, or theory in engineering. So the abstractions applicability is limited to the details covered.Thus how abstract is your problem space and what are the details, in rough terms it's variety. Then do the solving & problem abstractions vary in requisite ways?So to answer, if you are truly lost in core syntax and implements like debugging, you don't fully know the abstraction. But does not mean anyone cannot use the abstractions, just being general to a problem or solution. With all the abstractions these days, you won't know everything and a general knowledge is often where one starts.Lastly your final questions around AI model roles, my feel this is opacity not (your) competence. The core vector and matrix abstractions in AI and context models are not that deep, nor new. But given they're \"cutting edge\"-ness often these models are purposefully opaque. So if you simply cannot see detail, don't blame your abstraction skills lol",

The \"interface\" changes with model updates. Your DBT model doesn't randomly decide to restructure itself, but your AI-generated pipeline might.The debugging question is real. When traditional abstractions fail, you trace through layers until you find the bug. When AI abstractions fail, you're often just... prompting again and hoping.

You can explore using duckdb/bigquery geospatial functions. Learn about Apache Sedona and maybe try to set it up and get AI to help guide you along and learn. Use tools like OpenCode or ClaudeCode to start building and then ask a lot of questions and make it explain things to you. Then you can have some projects on your github and start applying for the smaller geospatial jobs.

Add explicit executor level signals, structured logs, per partition failure metrics, and batch level health metrics like lag spikes and sink write ratios. Treat executor errors like distributed telemetry, not exceptions. Few things like Data...Flint can help by turning raw logs and metrics into actionable observability so you actually see where things fail instead of just hoping the driver surfaces it. Once you stop expecting the driver to be your source of truth, the silent failure problem mostly disappears.",

When devs can crank out features with AI help they sometimes skip the part where they talk to you about how the data should flow. You get surprised by schema changes or new tables that were not designed with downstream use in mind. Documentation does not keep up either.What helped us was requiring a data impact checklist before any feature launch and making schema changes part of the same PR review process as code.

If that’s the case, then your business needs to find or create a way to enforce data contracts with the source data properly.

Row count diffs, null spikes, value distribution changes, schema mismatches. Alerting on those meant we caught issues within minutes of ingestion rather than days later when someone noticed a dashboard looked wrong.The other thing was making rollback trivial. If bad data gets through, can you restore the table to its previous state in under five minutes? If the answer is no, thats probably higher leverage than trying to make dev look more like prod.Still doesnt solve the underlying chaos of user uploaded files, but at least you stop pretending your lower environments prove anything about production behavior.",

I would recommend considering DBT Cloud as the one add-on.To answer your question more directly:Azure Fabric with DBT.https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/fabric-setuphttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-setup-dbt",

It is an alternative to “high water mark” determination of changes (usually via some sort of timestamp column). SCD means “slowing changing dimension” and is a concept coined by Ralph Kimball to denote capturing versions of a dimension. In most respects CDC and SCD are not related conceptually but you would / could use CDC processing to help drive population of a SCD dimensional table (like a customer dimension).",

The math is nontrivial. Linear algebra, especially rotation matrices and quaternions for coordinate transforms, and the Newtonian equations you'd learn in a 1st year calculus based physics class, and also a bunch of other stuff that I had to learn/relearn to work here. (I have an undergrad degree in math.) I don't have to *implement* everything, but I do need to understand what's going on conceptually and use appropriate mathematical libraries correctly.2. The folks I work with are PhDs, so a lot of building a pipeline is listening, very carefully to what the (let's say) rocket scientist wants and building exactly that. No creative metrics here. The physics is the physics. I ask a lot of questions about what is supposed to happen through a series of calculations. What does a good result and a bad result look like? Where are the best places along the way to spot-check things like an intermediate matrix becoming ill-conditioned?3. The PhD's are not hired for coding ability. I need to detangle messy MATLAB code to turn into data pipelines that I actually want to own and maintain over time.I work on the \"easy\" stuff that still fits in a Postgres database. So, I use python and other fairly standard tools. I want to upskill into rust/pyO3 which I'd hope would make some of the calculations complete faster than numpy/scipy. I suspect I do a lot more software engineering than my retail data engineer peers: There is a lot of custom code written specifically for our particular uses/devices that just isn't available in open source libraries or even as a commercial product (besides the stuff sold by my employer and our direct competitors).",

It is also easier to grow into management at a more organic pace.* If you are taking a \"team lead\" position without a raise to your current earnings, you are essentially increasing your workload without being paid for it and getting a downgrade.* The team lead title might soothe your ego, but in big companies team lead is not a very high position. It's not a pure management role, nor a pure technical role either.* Only you can decide whether going to the office for one additional day per week changes your mind.* I think if \"AI Proofing\" is on your mind - you should pick the startup. In a big company it's very easy for some Muppet in a board room to decide that AI can do your job. On the other hand a growing startup usually knows exactly why they hired you and will retain you irrespective of AI.",

Everything else is differentThere is no way in SQL editor to safely know what actual Postgres instance you’re in besides the compute name at the top which may not line up with the database name and also if it’s too long will be abbreviated spelling trouble whether you’re in dev or stage or potentially even prod.

It allows you to virtualise the parquet files (and other sources) as a single db table (recent iterations also work with Delta tables with limited features, but I believe pushdown and partition pruning are supported) which removes the need to have the separate staging layer. I then just set it up with ‘staging’ model files which query the external table and set the right column types because it will do things like read your columns that are supposed to be CHAR(8) as VARCHAR(MAX) since most flavours of parquet that I’m aware don’t have that extra column metadata, and the rest of the project builds from there as normal. I had a similar thought process while I was designing this in terms of it enabling an easier transition to a proper lakehouse architecture in future, and it does help a bit with managing schema drift, but for an established DWH I’d be doubtful about whether the juice is worth the squeeze - the only reason I did it is because everything is new.",

We wouldnt want to even retain the data in a lake forever and usually aim for a retention period of like 7-30 days depending on the source. I have another question then: if we wouldnt use linked servers what else would you propose so dbt in the dev environment has the same data pretty much at the same time as the prod environment. We also have 20-40 api scripts through azure functions ingesting to bronze prod. And a couple of bigger source systems that ADFs copy activity handles. But i wouldnt want to clone stuff and insert everything twice. Also the DDL statements to create and prepare th tables for dev ingestions would be needed twice too. Should we backup and redeploy the prod bronze db maybe after each time? Is Linked Servers really a bad option and what do you mean with cross env drift and permission weirdness? I would give the dev server read permission to the prod bronze only",

Backend is 5x more interesting, but if you are simply doing CRUD, it’s as stale as building pipelines. I enjoyed backend more with stuff like stream/notif, auth, jwt, cache optimization. It actually makes me write better code when doing DE stuff, though nowadays copilot writes 95% of my codes. I use fastapi and mysql so maybe different than what you do. Job wise, backend interviews are more competitive in my experience. Not because it’s harder but because there are a lot more people applying and surely you wont be the best",

There’s an enormous amount of money invested into AI right now, which means that these companies providing it are feeling serious pressure to make it profitable. So far, nobody really has. We all see at this point that it’s a huge bubble similar to the .com bubble, and we’ll probably see similar result - AI is likely here to stay, but it probably won’t be used very differently than how it’s being used today and the demand to put AI into every app or service will die down. In the programming world, that means that we’ll probably get used to tools like Claude Code or Copilot and adopt patterns where we let it write the boring parts for us, but skilled programmers will still be valuable when building complex software while using these tools. We’ll likely see a knock-on effect of even cheaper compute as all these data centers are built to meet a demand for AI will inevitably to drop off.In the short- to medium-term, there’s probably a pretty penny to be made by contractors who can untangle the mess of code written by companies who went overboard on writing their software with AI.So I guess TL;DR is that if you’re a total AI Luddite you should probably at least experiment with AI to get used to where it’s helpful and where it isn’t. If you’re an AI hype beast, you should probably make sure not to let your actual technical skills atrophy because the future where AI writes 100% of the code is just not coming.

        "body": "I think that's awesome and most of the calculator apps out there are badly in need of an upgrade from Texas Instrument days, which they all strangely seem to still emulate.I wrote my own CRM in and now it's fully customized to a sales workflow, has dynamic scripts that populate for each client with name and info from the lead source. I can easily add or modify these scripts using a regular text file and put the fields I want in with {{ label }} tags and it will replace them with customer record data. I can just add a template file to a directory and it'll use it. That builds the texts I can bulk or individually send out. As I work, it dynamically keeps track of my availability across the day and updates the scripts for me on the fly as my schedule fills up.Although it has some required fields in the single SQLite table it uses, like first name, last name, phone, status, but other than that, it can import any csv file with at least those field names into it and it'll just slurp up whatever and show the fields from the csv in the GUI. It also has a customized note taking page where I can put the customer's data into a UI and it'll save is as a json document in a directory and attach the name of that file to the client record. That document is also a json document, so I can modify it without coding anything and those fields in the notes are not on the client record directly and they don't need to be. I could of course add them later to any data structure I want if I want to.Also, now I can parse PDF files for data, match them to a record and update the database and attach the now renamed pdf file to that client and open it in a window from the gui. I can also create a new record if one doesn't exist, or just fail and spit out a not found. Whatever I need it to do at the time.That pdf view window dynamically changes to the corresponding file if I change customers in the gui by selecting, hitting the next or previous client or page buttons, and doesn't break if it's not there, it just happily displays there's no pdf file found for that one.It also has color themes, a dark, light, slate, blue and pink themes. These are CSS files and if you want to add one you just drop it in by the name light.css, dark.css into a config directory and it'll pick it up and let you select that from the menu and save it so it always uses that theme until you change it again, with all the other config options that you set as well. They all stay active until changed across runs.It can build lists I can use for bulk texts or anything else I can dream up for it. I can just code that in.As I built it and made changes, I just kept adding the ability to customize it from the way it used to work, to the new capability. So, it basically just gets more and more powerful over time. Everything it could ever do, it can still do perfectly fine.It's awesome and it's 100% mine, 100% free, and 100% not on the cloud, it doesn't even use a web browser either, although it easily could, but I like that it doesn't for now.Would it pass corporate IT coding standards. NOPE! I wrote them so I know, NOPE! and I like it that way.Is it easy to use - Yep.Is it user friendly - Nope.Is it well documented - other than the code is clearly written - NOPE. lolThat's (Hell\\^Nope)Did I vide code it? Kinda. I've got plenty of experience writing software. Big software. No direct experience writing anything quite like this before. It's got the simplest data model I've ever used in any DB lol. There's a lot of room for more things it could do here in the future if I get around to needing it. For now, I just don't.I started with free AI because I didn't know a some of the available API's and I wanted to try them out. I went through a few of these before I found one I liked and wanted to work with. AI got me off the ground with them,I got amazingly far down the line of a prototype and before I knew it, I had something basically working. As I kept adding more capability however, it quickly ran out of context area and now gets lost and makes so may errors and just poor coding choices I rarely use it anymore. The cool thing is I don't really need it now. I learned the API I landed on and I'm comfortable taking it from here. I also got a very good idea of what AI can and can't do these days as well.Replace coders and people with technical skills? Maybe some junior slog roles. It can be used to write slog job automation that would have otherwise been way out of scope and not cost effective.What are you going to replace them with? Don't even tell me business analysts. Don't even think about telling me corporate executives or nepo babies. They don't know their ass from a hole in the ground and AI isn't going to help for that. They can't bully a robot caddie into ignoring that extra swing and a miss. I wonder how they make it through the day without dying.",

In many segments you focus on one solutions such as git. However you should make a point to highlight a number of similar systems. The idea is to make students aware that there are many options. Covering the common solution is find after highlighting that students have lots of options. I actually like that GIT and VIM coverage as good introductions.2. I'm still of the opinion that everyone needs to learn VIM, as a command line tool, to some extent. It is the VIM is everywhere base reality. However in the modern world using the command line environment with a GUI editor of choice might lead to more productive students. I'm not even sure students grasp that command line control can be mixed with GUI apps. This may be personal thing but I find GUI based editors far more productive. So in the same regards a paragraph that list out a few alternative command line an and GUI editors to inform students makes sense.3. A port for compiled languages or an additional segment within this package, would be useful for programs that don't use Python. A focus on C++ would be advisable as the use of GCC is similar for many languages. The idea is not to teach the language, but to teach how programs are built with compilers. Like I said only a very brief view of this site, but guys it looks like it covers much of which sidelines students at the start. In fact this sort of stuff should be covered in a high school prep course.",

People like you do not send your CVs, LinkedIns, Githubs, etc. Or they hesitate a lot before they start applying to places.Then there are people who do send but visibly are not confident during the interview. I do not mean that one should start lying and exaggerating things but I mean, be confident in what you know and in what you do not know. \"Yeah, I do not know frontend development but I'm considering learning it.\" or \"I'm a backend developer but having to do frontend tasks seems to be a good challenge.\" I have told these. Not during interviews but during 1:1s when I was moved to a fullstack position. And my boss was fine. Because she saw that I actually show an interest in improving myself. If I would be \"I'm worried about frontend tasks. I really hope I will not get any of these. Backend tasks are much safer bet.\" then that would be bad. Lack of confidence, no wish to grow, perhaps even stagnation.Then lack of confidence when being on probation period. Cool, you got hired! You passed all these interviews. But the next 2-5 (however long time period) months are also critical. Either you pass the probation period or the company has to tell that \"Sorry. We considered it but we do not see how things will progress from here.\" Perhaps different countries have different laws and such, but where I live, a person is put on a \"test period\" of a couple of months before his contract is finalized (meanwhile the contract is temporary). So, some juniors, they are not confident. They do not ask questions. They do not share their thoughts. They do not participate in discussions over new tasks and such. They get stuck and do not voice it out. They start comparing themselves with younger colleagues who have been in the field for longer time, then get some irrational fears, and let it affect themselves even more negatively.What I'm trying to say: this field indeed is difficult. But one should be confident in himself. Have a growth mindset. When you see you are lacking in something do not see it as a weakness but see it as an opportunity to learn new things. When you see that people are more experienced and more skilled than you then do not see this as a threat but as an opportunity to learn from them.",

Apply as you learn, doesnt have to be complex stuff, just get the reps in. Learnt arrays? Cool, now practice appending to the array, removing from the array, getting an item at x index etc. Basics.The stumbling block also comes in where the parts is all there is. Theres no holistic understanding of how to apply it all. I was there too. Guess what helped... Build shit.A learner needs to put it all together to make something work, it involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller actionable steps. Pseudocode can come in handy here where ou focus on the flow and shape of the code without worrying about methods and built-in functions. Once you have a plan then you can go into details.For example, lets build a lasagna. Ok, how tf do i do that, break it down into smaller pieces, stuggling, then google the steps, find out, look for solutions. Ok so we need 3 parts to build this, a meat sauce, bechamel sauce, and lasagna sheets. Cool cool how do i make the fucking meat sauce bro and wtf is bechamel... Google it, search, look for answers. Ok sweet so i need the following for a simple meat sauce but how do i put it together... Google it, search for answers....its all an interative process. Tldr: its all about, I dont know so i find out and apply it. Break it down into smaller and smaller problems until you can.",

        "body": "Professional software developer here, and I agree with everything you've said. Building on your post, here's an analogy from my own experience that I think supports your point:I learned to write code before I learned to cook. I was equally interested/enamored by each of these skills when I first started to learn them.One of the first things I learned to cook was [stir fried chicken with rice noodles][stir-fry]. For at least a month, I made this dish several times per week. This repetition afforded me space to observe and learn - I noticed when the color of some ingredients started to change in the cooking utensil (an observation I wasn't previously able to make). I started adding other ingredients to the dish because I had learned some intuition (which gave me confidence that even if my didn't turn out great, it wouldn't be terrible) over repeated exposure. Slowly, I was able to rely on visual cues without needing to set a timer (\"hey! the broccoli is starting to look like it's cooked\" instead of \"it's coming up on 3min, time turn down the heat\"). This is how I learned how to cook and how to understand what I was seeing on the stove. Prior to this, I had watched many cooking shows/videos and family and friends had even tried to show/teach me - all of this was \"tutorial hell\" and I never felt like I knew what I was doing. One lesson from this experience is that \"know what you're doing\" doesn't come before you build something for the first time. It's actually the other way around - you learn by doing stuff. When I say that, I am reminded of providing tech support for my grandma. She'd always be afraid that she was going to accidentally break something. This is a real concern with programming languages - you could potentially delete files or crash your OS through some bug. But starter/learning projects rarely expose you to that functionality. If you're still afraid, consider using a virtual machine. It wasn't until I read this post, OP, that I made the connection between this cooking practice and something else I did when I was learning to write code (back in 2007 - I'm old, I guess). After I first learned python, I would often (and for no real reason other than \"I like to write code\") write a decimal to binary function in python. Sometimes it would take me a long time to write (30min was not uncommon), sometimes I'd write it in a few minutes. The point was never to write it quickly to \"beat my personal record\". The point was always to practice this new skill. Sometimes I'd write it recursively, sometimes I'd try something different.But this repeated practice did for me, the same thing that repeatedly cooking the stir fry did. I was able to study different ways of solving the same problem and hone my understanding of how python works. Now, I didn't write my decimal to binary converter every day - I think the most frequently I did this was \"once a week\" for a few weeks (then, about once a month, and I eventually started to use it to test whether I liked a new keyboard). At the time for me, it was like re-reading my favorite passage out of my favorite fiction book (the was before Netflix, so that might translate today as \"rewatching my favorite episode of a TV show\").That's really the secret sauce - practice for familiarity. When I use LLMs today, the value for me is that the LLM writes the code. The time savings for me comes from not having to physically type out the code. The thinking that goes into it beforehand (what architecture to use, what algorithm to use, what data structures to use, how to model the data flow and problem solving, etc; If I haven't yet made these decisions, I have a conversation with the LLM to help me decide) - I communicate all of that to the LLM and let it do very little beyond writing the code I described.It does feel counterintuitive that learning to write code requires as much time and practice, because this learning time is often compared to learning other skills that require more time and practice to acquire and gain proficiency in. The key realization is that while learning to write code is faster than (say) learning to become a neurosurgeon, it still takes a lot (nowhere near zero) of time and effort. And while the proficiency threshold to make a meaningful contribution is lower than in many other professions, that threshold is not a plateau - the proficiency curve does go a lot higher and I think this might be one reason why beginners often get a wide range of feedback (from experienced developers with a wide range of proficiency levels)Ok I took a couple of rambling tangents (sorry, it's Sunday afternoon), but the takeaways are:1. repeated exposure and practice are the key to escaping tutorial hell1. the proficiency threshold to \"build something\" is much lower to escape tutorial hell than it is to (for example) contribute to an existing project in a professional or opensource capacity1. the probability of accidentally making a catastrophic error is very low1. the notion that repeated exposure improves proficiency is not new (my cooking story), thought that's maybe more of a \"hard truth\" than a \"comforting fact\" as I had originally intended it to be[stir-fry]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8f752SdeAI",

It’s possible the thing you want to build has never been built before or at least hasn’t been built before the way you want to. So you need to go out and find info about how to build the pieces and parts that you can, and extrapolate and experiment with the rest until it works the way you want. Along the way you have to make a myriad of decisions that will all teach you about architecture or storage or performance or what have you.

Imagine us telling \"Yeah, learn that Go.\" You'll learn it. Nobody in your area is developing his stuff in Go. Countries differ, job markets differ. What is in use in one place can be not in demand in another place.Now, to your questions:1)Backend is backend. If you are targeting web application development you won't be using any other math than some simple primary school math. And sometimes even not that. There won't be any difference between picking Python or Java or PHP or something else. If you have to add up your end-user's monthly bills you will use a simple primary school math.The only thing you do have to look into is Boolean algebra. AND, OR, NOT and the combinations of these in IF/ELSE blocks. To decide how the process flow will switch based on one or another criteria. But you should have studied it during your degree studies. In Discrete Mathematics course or such.You'll need more math in data science.2)Pick the backend language based on job offers in your area. Sure, you can pick some language that less juniors are using... but you won't be using it at all if there is no demand after it.3)If you are going to work in web application development you'll need SQL and git for sure. Linux can come useful when having to do some devops. But also useful in general. Stuff more often than not just work when working in a Linux or a Mac. In Windows you have to figure out how to get it working in your WSL and stuff.No idea about boot.dev. But as you already have a degree then whichever bootcamp you are picking, should just remind you what you were studying 7 years ago.You do need OOP and DSA but that should also be covered by your degree studies, already. It won't be anything new. Just a refreshment course for you.Now, when it comes to remote jobs then there you should be less optimistic. Better target local office jobs. At least where I live (a country in Europe) they are more often expecting the new junior to show up in the office. For onboarding, for mentoring, etc. It is a bit risky to let a new junior to work remotely on his own. Not saying that there won't be any remote jobs, for you, but expect to find an office job before finding a remote job.And when it comes to a saturation then a web application development in general is a saturated field. Does not matter if you are picking Python, Java, Go, PHP or something else. Because everybody is \"speedrunning\" and trying to get a job fast. And a web application development has its entry barrier lower than in data science and such, where one might need more theoretical knowledge in things.",

All the jobs. Every job within an hour of your place. Every new job. It’ll take time but hopefully someone takes a chance with you. Leverage your existing work into coding.

Is Python backend math, heavy? Would Java be safer?Backend Python isnt heavy on math at all. Most of the work is around APIs, databases, authentication, and business logic. The intense math in Python comes in AI and data science, which you can totally stay away from. Java isnt having less math than Python; theyre pretty much the same in this aspect.2. Should you pivot to Java to avoid Python saturation?Java is definitely a good choice in enterprises, but changing to it now would stop you from moving forward fast. What is more important is if you can build backend systems and talk about them. After your gaining understanding of backend fundamentals, it will be very easy for you to learn Java.3. Should you stick with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) and learn OOP, DSA, Linux, SQL, and Git?Yup... Those are good to have backend skills. SQL, Git, Linux, and backend architecture are the things used all the time in real jobs and will make you employable no matter the language.The most significant factor is practical experience. I usually give a junior candidate, who has built and deployed projects and can talk about them in detail, a clear advantage in comparison with one who hasn't.",

You'll have to make a choice for the coding language you learn, and none of them are bullet proof for you to have a great job and job stability. Getting in there and getting your hands dirty is all you can do.From what I've seen, the main positions that use heavy math are the AI, data analyst, and machine learning.

I don't really care if I learn anything from the tutorial or not, and the application doesn't really matter, except that it has to use (some of) the same libraries that I intend to learn.Then I convert one of my old projects to this new stack - e.g. I have so many CRUD backend and frontend applications, that I know all the ins and outs of, so I try to re-implement one of them. Looking at my old code in one editor, implementing features one after another in another editor, and every time I get stuck, I look for either documentation, stack overflow answers or even tutorials for that single part. I like to learn a lot allround about the new stack at first, and then only when something strikes me as interesting or different, I might take a deep dive into that, but I don't want to learn every single detail one step at a time - as most documentations otherwise seem to suggest.I have a few \"basic\" projects that I always implement, like a \"guess which number I'm thinking of\" game, a small shoot'em up game, a simple text-adventure, and a CRUD frontend as well as backend, and pick whichever looks most like what I want to build in this new language.Once I've reimplemented the old project, I begin my new, actual project, what I intended to use the new stack for - first by planning the features required, and which ones I already know how to implement based on my reimplementation, and which ones I have to learn more about - and then I learn about those things in depth if needed!",

Get error reporting setup. - From HTML, learn [templating](https://phptherightway.com/#templating). - Learn proper routing using urls vs direct file links. Introducing HTTP, like 404 Not found. - Learn routing with HTTP methods using forms (`GET /form` & `POST /form`). Starts the thinking in \"MVC\" & \"Restful\" like patterns. - Learn about validating (not sanitizing) data, returning early, sending error messages to the template with HTTP response codes. - Learn about databases (using SQLite, less setup) to populate & read data. - Next would be refactoring to smaller testable functions (Are you receiving the data (input or code to function) you need? Are you getting the output you expect?), - Then OOP and better project structure. - Try this out using the common beginner User Registration/Login projects and learn about password_* functions (vs md5, sha1, etc), etc.A beginner would then be comfortable getting into current concepts found in libraries and frameworks.See how this was more focused to learning based on experience?",

After that id start to expand. Something front end. Probably react / node. Then I’d hook that up to my back end thing I’d built. Learn things like responsive design by trying to run your front end in things like a mobile or tablet emulatorAgain have that checkin and deploy functionality all automated. And then I’d look at replicating my back end code with Python. So I can see the difference between the two languages. Then take all that database code and replace it with an ORM doing the same thing in a new branch. Compare how the two perform and the differences you get in things like execution plans etc. understand what the ORM generates vs what you did. Amongst that I’d study DS&A and Design patterns. Why all this?Because it will give you experience with tech that is used in enterprise and also in smaller startups, you get full stack experience and you have options then to deeper dive into either language if you want to focus on one area or another. Learning sql directly rather than just ORMs is something people miss these days and very important for debugging. And the cloud / infrastructure stuff is something which will help you later in your career and interviewing. It helps knowing what’s out there when you need to do system design interviews.",

There are tens of thousands of different APIs out there and while getting access to them is standardized (mostly), identifying what is being used and how that integrates with everything else is still a job that companies need. Then, to make yourself even more valuable, learn how to build a data warehouse and the pipelines involved in that.I still do a ton of coding. We do have engineers that use tools like n8n or SSIS to do basic integrations. But soon the permutations start to overwhelm those systems and you need code. You need people flexible enough to use different languages and are comfortable on different databases.On a parallel track to this - monitoring. Large orgs will want visibly into all of this. So, there are data pipelines that move performance data into monitoring systems. And in 5 years, a new monitoring system will show up with a “must have” feature so you have to redo it all.",

The fact that you're pulling it off doesn't make the expectations reasonable, it just means they found someone willing to absorb an unreasonable workload.The \"it builds resilience\" crowd isn't entirely wrong — you'll come out of this with real production experience that most interns never get. But don't confuse surviving a bad situation with it being a good learning environment. A proper internship gives you mentorship, code reviews, reasonable deadlines, and the space to actually understand what you're building instead of just shipping it.Practical advice: document every single thing you're building and deploying right now. Screenshots, architecture decisions, problems you solved — all of it goes in your portfolio. This experience, framed correctly on a resume, is genuinely valuable. Then when the internship ends, use that portfolio to land a job at a company that treats its engineers like humans, not disposable output machines. The market for people with real production deployment experience is solid, even for juniors.",

But yeah... it gets to all of us. Just don't let it get out of control. If you need to, step away, ask for help, there's nothing wrong with that. And I mean any help, mental, development, hobby, what ever it takes to not spiral out of control. Also, this is how you grow... by learning new things. That's why I switched teams a year ago. I felt like I had plateaued where I was after 7 years. I was afraid I had stagnated. When an opportunity came up to change to a new area, I leapt... with out thinking it through. Part of me regrets it because there was another opportunity that might have worked better, but overall, I'm good with where I am... I kind of like not having a ton of meetings. :P",

Improve on what your work-related issues are. Make a plan, to the things that will help you the most first, just to calm yourself a bit more at work. Stress is the worst thing ever to have when problem solving, so I’d work on whatever stresses me the most.Use resources to get yourself up to speed fast. This is one place I enjoy AI even though it might not be perfect. I can get a TL;DR version things, or have it question my planning.One of the most important things for me has been to split up problems at work into tasks and be organised.The difference between that and jumping into coding is massive for me, unless I do something I already know a lot.

It's was buggy, complicated, hard to debug, etc. I took a step back and told myself I was doing something wrong. I found a site that listed 10 books that every programmer should read and read Code Complete 2. It filled in a lot of gaps that I had missed around the process of software development. I then proceeded to read every book on that list. I mark that as the moment I became a senior. That was about 15 years ago.What after this? Nothing. I'm happy with what I'm doing. Management would just be more stressful for a marginal salary increase. Otherwise, I will shift where the IT winds blow me. Meaning, I'll do what's needed whatever that is. Which will be in areas AI don't displace.I have had dreams of returning to the motorcycle dealership.

        "body": "Assuming you're really asking for backend (low-level programming), there are so many ideas to chase. \\- Console emulators (chip8, NES, Gameboy) \\- Mini OS (OSTEP + OSDev) \\- Software rasterizer (bresenhams, projection, lin. alg) \\- Raytracer (ref: ray tracing in one weekend) \\- Graphics engine (OpenGL, etc.) \\- Mini language (ref: crafting interpreters) \\- Game using raylib (Tetris, Pacman, Bomberman) \\- Implement some pathfinding algorithm with 2D viz \\- Text editor (memory management, structures for undo/redo, persistence)You kind of have to browse around to find something that catches your interest. For me that was low-level graphics. I sincerely believe the exact technologies are not vital for internships, rather it's about showing your appetite for learning. Knowing OS fundamentals, and having practical projects with memory management, and cache-awareness in mind already knocks the majority of competitors out, especially for internships if you are targeting low-level domain (most go for latest and greatest shiny deployable frameworks).If backend is referring to servers, databases, and interfacing with web, I have no idea. For more closer to metal, I assume getting an Arduino starter kit and do some of the guided projects could be a good idea.It sounds like you simply need to do the reps with any type of project. I believe you don't really \"study\" programming. Rather, you start with something you want to create. Unless you are following a tutorial step-by-step (which I highly do not recommend), you have to be inquisitive and work your way backwards from the goal, to figuring out what's needed, and then figuring how to build those blocks.Naturally, based on problems you want to solve, you find that you want to express some computation, where you then realize that you need some language constructs to do so (just like normal language).As a personal aside, it wasn't until after Year 3 (of 5) in uni where I started doing any fully self-directed projects. I understand the \"feeling lost\" emotion well. My gateway was a 3D graphics course using Direct3D and reading various old and new blogs of seasoned graphics programmers, even when I barely understood most and half understood some. A million instances of trial and error from \"I don't understand this, let me try myself\" later and today I work with GPU drivers. You do not have to have it all click and figured out with bombastic portfolio by the end of Year 2.",

You have to learn to architect systems and break down work such that you can take the harder problems yourself and set your juniors up for success while also being responsive to your users.Another way to look at it is that junior and mid level engineers get their work from senior engineers while senior engineers have a more active role in defining the work. You have to do that in such a way that you carve out safe rails for junior engineers to work along and good bones to respond to often chaotic business needs. Don’t discount the degree to which that will strengthen you technically.It sounds like you are an experienced mid level engineer but a pure focus on directly improving your own technical skill will hold you back. Counterintuitively, you will grow more technically at this point in your career by taking on more of an ownership/leadership role with your people and learning to apply your technical skills to power everyone up.",

Don't identify problems that aren't really problems. For instance, if the code base is full of cruft and you say \"the code is bad and I'd like to clean it up, let me lead a team for 6 months to rewrite it\" then you're just stepping on toes.Instead, be ready to show the ROI and to show you've thought through the hard parts of what you propose and already have a feasible solution.One of the first things I did when transitioning to lead was identify a problem with our database. Every day we got an automated data feed, which triggered a program that dropped a large table, did a bulk data import, reindexed it, and ran a bunch of queries. Almost like clockwork, the DBMS would fall to its knees and one or more senior people would do a little fire drill, 45 minutes wasted every day. They were just used to it and couldn't think outside the box. I did a proof of concept that did everything totally differently and placed almost no load on the DBMS, studiously avoiding any hint that the people who came up with the original system were idiots, and my project was adopted with me as the implementer. My star at that company rose significantly because they could see I could be entrusted with more than run-of-the-mill tasks.",

Different build tools whether they are used in JavaScript, Java, C/C++, all follow some standard folder structure. Most Java projects are built with Gradle, Maven, or Ant and the Java folder structure is pretty rigid among these. Cmake for C/C++ is less picky about folder structure as your program's include statements control much of that. React, Svelte, and many JavaScript frameworks also use their own folder structure. Even Rebar3 for Erlang has a fairly fixed structure it uses.Build tools automate building of final product code so they expect certain files to be in certain places. These can be changed in the build configuration, but then working with a team used to standard structure can be chaotic. Also, many build tools will create the folder structure when you request a new project to be built.So, if you are building projects within a team or for a business, the folder structure will likely be mandated and essential. Even if you are planning to share a project, using a standard folder structure is still highly recommended. If you are writing custom code only for you, whatever works for you is just fine.",

If your goal is to become a web developer who also builds mobile (and desktop) apps, then I'd pick Tauri (personally) or React Native (which is technically better, since it produces real native apps, with real native bindings).If you're starting from scratch and don't really care one way or the other, then Kotlin with Android Studio is probably the more natural choice.Beyond that, you can also build apps for every major operating system using C#/.NET, which is a nice middle ground. Colleges are more likely to teach C#, and a lot of enterprise software is built on C#/.NET. The same team that created TypeScript also created C#, so the two languages play nicely together as well (and have a lot of the same features) - which is a good lead-in to web development.And then there's Dart/Flutter, which I wouldn't recommend (I usually recommend against it), but it is intended for making cross-platform development \"easier\", so as a beginner, it'd be easier to pick up (at first).Point being... you can build mobile apps in whatever you want. So, it's more about your overall interests/pursuits - they typically define which approach you'd pick.",

That said if you are serious about programming 90% chance you will have to learn Linux in some capacity anyways. - windows is easier for tool setup at the beginning, at a certain point it flips. The more consumery the tool the more the easy of use starts to favor Linux. In my experience windows has nicer GUI tools and Linux has (significantly) nicer CLI/TUI tools- windows + wsl. I write a lot of c# and play video games, so pure Linux is a nonstarter. Dual booting adds way too much friction. WSL is the best of both worlds - Linux cli + windows gui. - yes. A lot if not most server-based software runs on Linux via vms and containers. A lot of automation and build tools also run on Linux. Familiarity with the system is a huge boon. - it's good enough for me. I use it both at home and at work. Some tools I use, fwiw: git, tmux, c#, ts, python, rust, nvim, vs, vscode, docker, K8s, k9s, ansible, terraform. I use all of those in wsl except visual studio. Modern wsl networking is pretty seamless. I can run a postgres db in docker desktop, a .NET backend in visual studio and a next.js frontend in wsl and have everything talk to eachother just using localhost urls.",

The problem arises when you don't know exactly what N is supposed to be. But honestly, having to mutate an array while iterating through it, should NEVER be an excuse for using a traditional for-loop. Always use the foreach-version if you intend to iterate through an entire list, no matter the language. The only reason to use the traditional for-loop would be when you don't want to iterate exactly N times, but some other arbitrary number.And also you rarely want to mutate an existing array, most of the time you would want a new array with a different set of elements, created by filtering the existing array or something like that.And if not, most languages also have methods specifically for removing elements from arrays depending on certain criteria.",

Knuth, *Notes on the van Emde Boas construction of priority deques: An instructive use of recursion.*, March 22, 1977Donald Knuth is one of the grandfathers of our entire industry. He wrote the Art of Programming series, a seminal work that is something we all get to reading at some point, though it's heavy as fuck. He got into a famous dispute with Dijkstra over program flow control, and ultimately proved that `goto` is necessary as there are flows that are impossible to describe without it.And even he recognized that just because you know a program is correct doesn't mean it even works, let alone does what is intended or expected.So that you use a higher level construct to prevent lower level bugs, that only reduces your overall risk; you still are accountable for the overall program logic.> Is there an easy way to make sure your for loop runs properly and iterate exactly N times without running and testing it?

        "body": "This is why I often say programming is easy, at least at this level. The real challenge is taking a specification (word problem) and turning it into code.One thing I can suggest is to take everyday tasks, that a person knows well, and turn them into a word problem and then turn that into code. It might be as something as simple as checking the mail. That might sound simple at first but you generally have to open a door or two, walk to the mail box, open the mail box, grab the mail and return. The more one thinks seriously about what appears to be a simple task, the faster one realizes how detailed one needs to be to get software to do the job. Creating the pseudo code becomes a challenge of iteratively walking through the code until you can actually get the mail. The interesting thing about checking the mail word problem, is that you can check your work by physically walking through your pseudo code.In any event there are lots of things in real life that can help you understand the conversion of tasks into code. The more \"everyday\" the task the more impressive the complexity of what a person does everyday not thinking about it. Brush your teeth in the morning and start to think about how all those actions would be expressed in code. Would the stroking back and forth, be a function to simplify your code.As for the OP I have to point out that this is an extremely common issue. That is turning written requirements into code and frankly it often has nothing to do with programming. However it is absolutely critical to becoming a good programmer. In the real world many times your specification might not be well defined causing one to do some research. That might mean reading a manual to get a device into a mode that you wan work with. The point is your word problems become outlines leaving out critical information you need to fill in. In other words in school you are lucky in that the word problems are generally complete, sometimes you need to figure out what a department really wants.",

Flutter has a vast number of pre-made widgets for UI development, but you don't have to learn all of them right away. You'd need to learn the Dart language to use Flutter, but it's relatively easy to pick up if you have any programming experience.Another great thing about Flutter is that it's cross-platform and supports targeting Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Web apps, all from a single Flutter program and single UI.",

You unit test a function and you assert that when you tell it to do a series of operations and then save, it should write A, B, and then C to the storage layer.Now you change the code around and it outputs C, B, and then A to the storage layer. Your test fails because the mock was expecting calls in a specific order. Or maybe it's more complex, like now it write A and B in one transaction and then C in another transaction.It can be really hard to express in a mocking framework the idea that A, B, and C need to be saved, but the order and number of calls doesn't matter.So instead, write a \"fake\". A fake is a tiny, trivial implementation of the storage layer's interfaec, maybe it just keeps track of the objects that were saved in a HashMap or a sorted list.Instead of asserting that certain methods were called in a certain order, have your method write to the fake storage layer, then fetch the list of things written to the fake storage layer and assert that A, B, and C are in them.Now your code asserts that the end result is correct without being nearly as tightly coupled to the implementation details.

        "body": "I have done many lectures on this subject, which are difficult to summarize in a Reddit comment, but I'll do my best.**What to test**Each unit of code has a contract. Input: it expects specific parameters of certain types and/or a specific starting state. Output: it returns a specific type and/or changes states. When choosing what to test, you want to test only public methods, whose contracts are not expected to change frequently. Do not test private methods directly unless they contain something particularly complicated. In that case, try to refactor the complicated bits into separate pure functions to reduce churn during later refactoring.You also want to design and edit your code in a way that avoids changing contracts unnecessarily. For example, add new parameters to the end of the list and make them optional, preserving the previous behavior in which they did not exist.If you find your contracts changing all the time, this is a problem with your code design. Not only does it make unit tests fragile, it makes coordination with other people and new features far more difficult than it needs to be. Read up on clean code strategies and code architectural patterns. **How to test**The most common issue I see in fragile tests is allowing state changes to fall through from test to test. You must start and stop every test at a neutral baseline state, not allowing tests to affect each other. Every test should be able to run by itself or in any random order compared to other tests. In fact, there are many test frameworks that provide a randomized run feature to help you find and prevent this form of fragility.To do unit testing correctly with non-pure functions, you must make sure to create fixtures, which are state controls. Before each test, your fixtures set up the correct state. After each test, you tear down those fixtures back to a neutral baseline. Do this using the test framework's built-in services. In class format, these are often methods named like setUp and tearDown. In spec format, they are named like beforeEach and afterEach.Each test has the following pattern:1. Set up fixtures, mocks, fakes2. If state may change, assert beginning state3. Call the function under test4. Assert returns if applicable 5. Assert state change if applicable6. Assert mocks/fakes were called as expected, including the expected parameters passed in7. Tear down fixtures, mocks, fakes",

If the expected behavior is \"data A, B and C are stored\", then the test should check for that and not care about the order of calls.In the end, it all boils down to understanding what the contract on interface level states: \"This function saves data by calling the storage layer\" does not say anything about how this is done or in which order. So, one can only check that once the function has been called, the data has indeed been stored. \"This function saves the data from the given data array in atomic write operations for each element of the array from first element to last element\" as interface contract describes a different behavior to check for - here the order and amount of calls to storage indeed matters.

Have a consistent sleep schedule. Keep yourself hydrated (with water, not soda) and try to eat a well balanced diet. Remove alcohol from your diet. Do some sports, even just a light jog (search for c25k if you're a couch potato) and preferably do it in the morning just after you wake up.You're brain is all over the place so you need to create habits that give you structure and stability.

That’s exactly how you improve.A few practical tips that helped me:1.Stop comparing progress. Compare consistency. Are you coding weekly? That’s what matters.2.Focus on one path at a time. Git + Java + side projects is good, but don’t constantly switch directions.3.Build tiny projects you can finish in a few days. Finishing builds confidence.Programming feels hard because you’re literally rewiring how you think. That discomfort is growth.You’re not behind. You’re just early.Keep going.",

Turns out that very few companies actually need to hire random bachelors degree holders or lower that learned a bit of Python and SQL that have no specific industry expertise i.e. the overwhelming majority of people looking into the field.  The few people who do this work are highly specialized and highly educated and would never be caught dead taking a udemy course.The technical barrier was perceived to be a lot lower than it is for swe so it got absolutely flooded in the last five years even more than SWE has. Add universities everywhere opening data science bachelors degrees, bootcamps, certs, self learners to the mix and the uncertainty of AI on top of the movement away from hiring generic \"data scientists\" and the field is a total mess.  All this hype for an industry that doesn't even exist in its former state anymore.Many grifters that shilled DS have moved onto AI.",

C++ gives you primitives, you are expected to build up and composite layers of more robust and expressive types in terms of them, and then deliver a solution in terms of that. Ultimately you make your solution more expressive: if(name n; std::cin >> name) { use(n); } else { handle_error_on(std::cin); }An `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. All names are strings, but not all strings are names. Streams are themselves a whole system and style to work within.Unfortunately, there really isn't any good source material that teaches you use. Most code across the industry looks like people put their academic materials, picked up a compiler, and have written exactly as they had learned ever since. You have to figure it out.

Try to think of the questions they will ask you (like \"lemme see your code\"), and get answers ready so that you don't get the stare of death.Sometimes this is known as \"rubber duck debugging\", or simply \"rubber ducking\", because if you can explain your problem clearly to a rubber duck, then chances are you will stumble upon a clue along the way that will lead you to a solution. Many bugs have been solved by developers talking to rubber ducks in their offices. I have found myself in position where not only did I waste the senior dev's time, but he was the senior dev at another company we were working with so I made my entire company look incompetent because I didn't see a basic issue. Luckily I spotted the problem before he did and we were able to laugh it off... But please learn from my mistakes.",

Swing is popular for Java, AWT, etc.The toolkits contain \"widgets\" which are the components that implement buttons, etc.The X11 system sometimes called their toolkits \"widgets\", back when you were writing more of the plumbing. There's the Athena Widget Set, TK (from Tcl/Tk, repackaged to be used by other languages) etc.Some of the more advanced solutions (Qt, Swing, etc.) support \"look and feel\" which is an attempt to make one portable library look like the native widgets for different environments. So Swing can look something like Windows, OSX, or Gtk.So it's not really all \"it always looks the same. Often it doesn't, when one technology contains a different set of widgets, or a different toolkit. With some careful inspection, you might now start to see the differences.",

First, hardcode values directly where they are used.2. Then move them into variables3. Then combine those variables in classes - the same classes that handles objects in the game4. Then move then out of those classes and into separate data-classes, separated from the behaviour5. Then make it possible to read and write the data-classes to files - enabling savegames6. Then go further on with your online multiplayer-game, and transmit the data-classes across the network, or whatever :)The idea is that you don't build anything more complicated than you need at the moment - always remember the YAGNI principle when deciding to make advanced solutions - and that you only take small steps, always making sure that everything still works as intended, even when moved around in the code.",

I'd even go as far as to say that programming competitions often value things that corporations detest. That said, excellence in one area of programming often hints the ability to be excellent in other areas.Many of the programs in competitions (which is where leetcode gets most of its examples) are small, easy to implement, but challenging enough they are not trivial. However they rarely deal with most of the issues that companies use in programming. Additionally, they favor large computational efforts using arrays, which is rare in business.Consider it practice, and the companies that hire based on leetcode scores generally don't get better corporate programmers. It's like painting landscapes all day, and then hiring on to a company that paints architecture.",

If you want one topic from that class - [de Morgan’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws)As far as syntax, it’s something that you just need to get used to. If you’re running into the same syntax errors, don’t fix the problem right away, try to understand why you need indentation, colons.Syntax changes from one language to the next but the fundamentals generally apply. If you need help debugging, honest to god, you can do it on paper or a white board. I graduated from Uni not that long ago and my first 2 programming classes required us to take exams with pen and paper, so we had to learn how to walk through the code without fancy debugging software. It’s something that really worked well for me.Track your variables, update the variables as you walk through each line of code, keep track of what variables are in scope, etc. This should make using a debugger a bit more intuitive. Also, some of the debugging functions were confusing to me when I started:* Put a breakpoint where you want to stop the function* step over means move to the next line of code* step into means step into the current line of code; ex. if this is a function call, now you’ll be walking through each line in that called function",

But I also know plenty of developers who prefer getElementById, because they don't have to remember to add the '#' symbol every time. And then they only switch to querySelector for more complicated things.*Btw: I love all the arguments about one being \"faster\" than the other - and I'm willing to bet that if selecting elements is the bottleneck that hampers performance in an app, then you probably have bigger problems than that! Also, I'd like to see an example - a real world example, not a fake made up example of selecting 4 quadrillion elements - of one being slower or faster than the other :)*",

We have our own governanced AI so we can use it as well for making manual tasks quicker. I've noticed when it comes to stuff like data science AI is much more utlised compared to cybersecurity. I can't comment on full stack but I do know people who do full stack and learnt how to use AI APis and creating chat bots which has made them more relevant and not left behind. So id say it's up to you but imo AI is least likely to replace cyber compared to full stack due to cyber always being about protecting people's data and no matter how governed AI is people are still skeptical to let AI do the job.",

That is awesome for reasoning, resource bounds, and making performance predictable, but it also means you do not get general recursion or unbounded while loops without adding extra machinery. From a formal methods angle, that is a feature, not a bug, if you lean into it.If you allow unbounded loops or something like “loop until condition,” you are basically back to general purpose computation, and then the “loop centric” part is more about ergonomics and how you restrict or structure control flow.Two framing ideas that might help your design doc land with people: what is the smallest set of constructs you need besides loops (variables, arithmetic, conditionals), and what property do you want to guarantee (termination, time/space bounds, ease of verification). If you can say “Gamma Loop is intentionally total” or “intentionally resource bounded,” that becomes a clear conceptual advantage rather than just a vibe.Also, if you have even a tiny spec for the loop form and what is forbidden, folks can give much sharper feedback. Right now “loops are central” can mean a lot of different things.",

Its better to have a project that you actually want to make because you will retain the information much better when you are invested in it and have the reward of solving the problems for yourself.That said, I would always suggest whenever you find out about something and you have an idea about how it might be applied in a different sense go away and try to see if you can apply it according to your idea. That way you make mini projects from the things you learn.",

What’s wrong with me? ) is a core skill you’ll need to draw on throughout your career as a software developer. As you gain experience you’ll learn to recognize it and power through it.

Like sure i can pump a messy script that sort of does what we want for a precise thing relatively fast, but it might not be scalable, or adaptable to different scenarios, and having to rewrite actually takes more time than if i stopped, and thought how to build it well beforehand.",

Or do you just wnat to learn programming, as is the case more often when this questions is asked and the name of the sub.If you really want Computer Science, there is no quick fix for \"mathematical thinking, specifically just treating numbers and such for their own sake\". You will have to get through that. If books are to dry for you, I would instead suggest getting a university lecture for maths for computer science specifically. [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/) I think I skimmed this one for an answer here already, and it looked okay. (I mean it's MIT, it's probably not bad) From my experience, University level maths courses can be done without any prerequisite, except the willingness to spent a lot of time. Everything will be explained once, any everything is built up from the foundations (axioms). (at least that was the case at my university, I didn't actually watch this course in full)If you really only want to program and are worried that you need maths for that: don't. Just start, and if you happen upon a concept that requires maths, go and learn that, and only that.EDIT: Since you probably never had mathematics at university: It's hard work, but you don't actually need to be especially bright for the basics. It requires a lot of practice, as it basically teaches you a different way of thinking, which is required for computer science. Learning CS really is just learning a different way of thinking, and the only way to do that is to repeatedly bash your head into a wall until you break through. The wall is made of bricks. You don't have a helmet.EDIT2: Another advantage of lectures over books is that you get exercises / assignments to go with them. Even if they will not be graded for you",

Hidden non-noob features have no perceivable affordances, so users can’t discover them. When they are hidden behind the noob shield users can’t just gradually start to use more and more features. They have to remove the shield and then the UI looks entirely different than what they are used to.I don’t think the quantity of features even really creates issues. A powerful app will by necessity have a lot of features when it’s a tool for professional’s inherently complex work. That userbase can deal with having to learn the app’s basic functions while being exposed to the existence of other more advanced functions.The subscriptions maximizing UX focus of trying to make e.g. Figma accessible for every stakeholder is plain damaging to the core user base.

I mean, when you are using Figma as a power user, you have your component libraries and larger components build from components. Then the right place to make changes is nearly always way somewhere else in a component library rather than on the screen that the stakeholder is looking at. When stakeholders do their own edits, even just changing texts, thats a shitload work for the designer to clean up in a way that doesn’t cause confusion later on.As an odd mix of dev and design, I probably care about this last part way more than designers in general.",

I don't condone cheating in general but you and I know very well that our interviews are fundamentally broken to begin with, even before AI. They are designed intentionally to focus on CS concepts but not actual day-to-day software dev work. Examining someone on whether they can solve a leetcode style question tells you nothing about a candidate's ability to write and ship software. I have met people who work at FAANG that have been able to get there purely by memorizing leetcode questions but not all of them are actually good engineers and a good amount of them have never shipped anything.The people who are using these cheating tools are just shining the light on the bigger problem here which is that our interviews are fundamentally broken and should be redesigned to actually examine someone's engineering skills and foundations. If I am hiring an engineer to work on web apps, I would want them to know skills related to that not whether they can invert a binary search tree.I expect this trend of cheating to continue growing until companies begin to realize how stupid the current interview structure is",

        "body": "One thing worth remembering is *why* Ruby and Rails were huge. It goes something like:At the time, backends were *huge* clunky things built out of Java, maybe .NET, and sometimes mainframes and COBOL. That means tons of Java-isms -- better bake a serial number into all of your classes in case you use native Java serialization to save sessions, but also you need an ORM with fifteen XML config files just so the ORM knows to set the `email` property to the `email` column, and that the `users` table goes to the `User` class. Except wait, you don't set the `email` property, you call `setEmail()` on the `User` class. And you don't create a `new User()`, you call a method on a `UserFactory`, which you need to get from the AbstarctDefaultFactoryImpl or whatever. And this isn't even Java 8, even a *simple* Java list looks like: List emails = new ArrayList();Yep, repeat `String` twice and `List` twice and generally be the most verbose, repetitive thing anyone had ever seen until Go gave us `if err != nil { return err; }` after every goddamned line.Or, at the other extreme, there was the LAMP stack -- stupidly-sloppy messes hacked together with Perl and PHP, the kind of thing people were building blogs out of. Wordpress was maybe the state of the art. PHP is a whole programming language that grew out of a glorified template language, so any notion of separating the view from the model was not really happening -- this is a world where you're taking some static HTML thing you built in DreamWeaver, renaming `.html` to `.php`, and adding a mysql query right to the middle of it with `` tags. IMO this explains a lot of why Facebook is the way it is -- it grew out of a tool that was built for adding a guestbook and a hit counter to your Geocities homepage.So Rails did a couple things: It cut out a ton of the boilerplate with \"convention over configuration\" -- if you have a `Users` model class and a `users` DB table, Rails can figure out that those are supposed to go together, and you only need to add configuration when you have something that doesn't fit the very obvious pattern. Ruby cut out more of the boilerplate by not making you repeat your type names five million times. It gave you a CLI tool that generates a working Rails project for you instantly, makes it super easy to get started filling in the blanks. It gives you enough structure that you're probably not building your whole app inside the HTML view like you would in PHP. On top of that, Ruby was a nicer language than most of the competition -- PHP and Perl are both pretty ugly, and Java doesn't even have lambdas.Other replies have pointed out things that made Rails less relevant -- more microservices and fewer monoliths, more web APIs and React and such instead of pure CRUD at the HTML level. But I think it's also because a lot of the basic ideas Rails had either ended up going way too far -- to do that `User``users` mapping, every Rails server needed a complex set of rules on how to pluralize English words! -- or ended up not being necessary for what they were trying to do. Like, turns out with decent type inference (Typescript, Golang), you can do strong, static typing and not constantly have to repeat yourself. Java and even C++ got lambdas, `var` and `auto`, and other basic quality of life code-level stuff.",

They do not position off-shore resources in such a way that makes them plug-and-play for any arbitrary development team.Your argument more or less rests on the notion that productivity and labor costs are the only considerations when developing a successful product — rest assured theres a lot more to it.But sure, if all you bring to a development team is the ability to take tickets, and work for cheap, you may need to re-evaluate exactly what you’re bringing to the table labor-wise in the long term. Advice on how specifically you can/should upskill requires more context than fits in a Reddit post. Pick any arbitrary pile of podcasts or blogs related to product development, and when you read something which relates to a skill you haven’t mastered, learn that thing. Pay attention to what’s happening in your organization, and make sure your skillset is well aligned with the “big rocks” coming up.Frankly, not every software product demands “FAANG-level” engineers to be successful. But pretend you’re a company trying to be competitive in a market. The hypothetical skill-curve of labor isn’t flat among your competition. If literally every competitor sourced from the same off-shoring agencies, and all of those agencies were equally skilled at product development, what a fantastic opportunity for you to disrupt that market by having significantly higher performing teams right?",

I've worked with execs who literally just looked at three Grafana dashboards, asked \"why is this metric down,\" and then forwarded the engineering team's answer to the board with their name on it. That's a workflow an LLM could do before breakfast.But the reason AI won't replace CEOs anytime soon has nothing to do with their actual decision-making ability. It's about who controls the purchasing decisions. CEOs buy AI tools. AI tools don't buy CEOs. The incentive structure means AI companies will always market their products as \"making leadership more effective\" and never as \"replacing leadership entirely.\" The tools will always be positioned to eliminate the people who DON'T sign the checks.The real irony is that middle management is probably more vulnerable than either engineers or C-suite. The \"translate strategy into tasks and make sure they get done\" layer is genuinely something project management AI is getting decent at. But nobody makes LinkedIn posts about that because middle managers don't have Twitter followings.",

        "body": "All of the tech degrees miss out on stuff that others don’t. CS happens to focus on programming, how computers actually work, and a base level of network, and business stuff. CIS heavily focuses on business operations, has a bit of coding, some network stuff, etc. It overlaps tech with business management and that sort of stuff. IT strongly focuses on Networks, servers, traffic, databases (which is a bit businessy), etc. The programming tends to focus on more automation type stuff similar to CIS. Some colleges have different curriculums for these courses, others don’t really and you can take any classes. It’s just a big toss up. That’s why almost all job posts have CS, CIS, CIT, IT, or other tech related field. Even if they don’t, it’s usually just implied. Someone with a CS degree that has an oracle box virtual home lab setup, has maybe messed with their home network, and builds computers would obviously be strong contender for Helpdesk. Vise Versa, someone with an IT degree built their own small OS in Rust, maybe has another project developing their own language from C++, and maybe does science and math simulations in OpenGL then they’d obviously be a strong candidate for a true entry level (0-3 years experience, unlike the 3-5 we see now) low level software engineering position.So, all of this to say, it just really depends. They 100% have their differences and should be recognized for that. In the world of experience trumping everything, it doesn’t even matter which is why I can see these roles asking for any tech bachelors.",

This job is too good for me and all my income goes straight into my chipmunk cheeks. The company itself is ancient, stable, all about technology/computers (it's neither Nvidia nor AMD). Given that it's a GPU job, I used C++ both on the role and to persuade my interviewers (I **hate** higher\\* level languages).It's fine if you don't consider it a solid career (because I'd agree).My current compensation as a junior is $200kI'm posting this in hopes that it will make an unemployed soul out there feel a little better today.Oh, and they also take us out to eat for free every once in a while and have around \\~5 company holidays (in addition to the normal holidays).

I did have some friends who were interns prior at places that I used to work/intern for that were tiny ass companies but eventually made it to Amazon. I had one specific Chinese co-worker who was stupid brilliant. He was a really gifted computer scientist and put in HARD WORK to study LeetCode and DSAs. I also don't see why being at a small company puts you in a disadvantage to pivot towards a FAANG oriented company. If anything, it puts you above other applicants because it shows you handled more programming aspects, and had hands on experience in the designing of said applications at your company.",

        "body": "I think some variation of this is what often gets overlooked. Let's just say that AI, across the board, makes all software dev take 25% the human time that it used to. On the surface that means 75% of devs get laid off. But in reality, this ignores the factor of human ambition and greed. The ultimate goal of a company isn't to punch off its current TODO list. It's to maximize profits. So at least some of those 75% should end up building new features and launching new products to generate more profits through efforts that wouldn't have been justifiable at the previous cost of development.And some of them will go off and start their own companies doing things with a person or two that previously would have taken a team, startup capital, etc.And so on.I think the same thing applies to the idea of people sitting idle overall. If you look at all of the laid off people coldly as a resource pool sitting idle waiting to be exploited to generate profits, it starts to look as silly to not find a way to put them to work as it would be to not tap into an oil well sitting idle in your backyard. Not because you're trying to do a good deed by giving them a job, but because you're trying to make more money. Which is really the only reason anyone has a job today.The truly difficult part could be the relative pace of all of this - if millions of people get laid off at an unprecedented rate, it will take time to figure out how to leverage this new human resource - what happens in that time? But in the long run, I suspect that the ultimate answer to how we keep ourselves busy in the face of these new tools will be the same answer that has accompanied every productivity increasing technological development in human history: we'll just do more. That drive is pretty central to what it means to be human, IMO.",

But it’s not there yet and won’t be anytime soon even though our entire economy is propped up by that idea.The point of Ai currently is to cut down on entry level and mid level roles. Theres a two fold approach to why companies do this, both of them have to do with money.1. Just hire less people and cut down on time to train them as that’s lost revenue, and also lay off employees who are not absolutely essential or senior level people because they obviously just do nothing right? Makes their labor cost go down, shareholders see better numbers in the immediate, everything is smooth sailing until it’s not.2. The senior level people that stay on assume the work of their peers that got laid off, get a slight pay bump (or none sometimes) to do their work being “augmented” by ai, this basically allows the company to get more labor for paying the same price effectively.Dollar now > dollar tomorrowEveryone loses, they win, economy gets wrecked we lose jobs, they get record profits and re invest into other business ventures or just pay themselves with the “returns” :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:",

See Gmail as a reference. The issue is: 85% of your engineers are going to do nothing and that creativity leash is basically just free hang out time. That luxury of hang out time isn’t available to shrinking businesses.",

I would say it varies a lot by company and even team.Some companies hire more “worker bee” type developers who are focused on implementation then lean on PMs or other business functions to decide the details of what to build. Others expect developers to make more choices about what to build and do the building. Those companies also tend to pay more because they expect more from developers. It does seem to be loosely correlated with how structured their processes are because if different people are making decisions than doing the implementation, process will generally be necessary to facilitate the coordination. The most obvious marker of this in my experience is the number of PMs or BAs or whatever they call them. If you’re evaluating a job offer and trying to understand how much autonomy you’ll have, look at how many of these people there are in comparison to engineers. The more there are, the more of that kind of work they will have to handle.",

Dream up ANYTHING and then start building it, this is not about the product topic, it is all about making software systems. Keep doing this project after project and you will learn a ton about systems, design, logging, communication, etc.I used to be a big book person myself, and they are good to get some ideas to get started, but it's better to go start building constantly, and then come back to the books when you need to reference, get unblocked, or learn how to do a specific thing. I think another aspect of this is that the building of systems/services/projects gives you more things to connect mentally when going through books on \"advanced topics\". For example, after building a bunch of projects, when you go through your next system design book, you will make mental connections to what you've already built and think up use cases and improvements with the topics they are talking about. If you just read books / take courses from the start and aren't building, nothing will stick as easily.",

First, I think your bullet points focus too much on the technology you used and not enough on the impact your work had on the company. Keep in mind that a lot of recruiters are not very literate in terms of tech (as weird as that may be), and so to them it looks like a lot of jargon. I'd really suggest formatting your bullet points like this: (1) what you did, (2) in layman's terms what impact it had (business metrics here a plus), and (3) optionally mention the tech used. Second, unless those non-work projects you did are very meaningful or impactful, then I'd suggest getting rid of them and use the space to add more bullet points to your work experience. Anyone off the street can create a school-level project with AI. Business impact is key. Last, keep applying and practicing. Take whatever you can get. Don't be picky. Target smaller companies.",

You still qualify as a college hire as you are within one year of graduation. You graduated from an Ivy League university- try to get in touch with the college recruiters from large companies assigned to your school. They can help you get back into the college hire funnel.Industry hiring generally begins with SDE 2/mid- level roles which require 2-3 years of experience. Which you don’t have. You can still apply for these roles at large companies but you’ll need referrals to get you past the automated resume screen that will see your 6mo of experience and peace out. Reach out to your previous lead and manager at Amazon, as well as people you worked with, friends, mentors. You don’t need to feel close to people to reach out. Send them your resume and ask them to send it to people in their network who may be hiring. Ask your friends to ask their boss if there is an opening in their org. Meet up for lunch, send a message from linked in. Reach out reach out reach out.The other approach that works well in this situation is to apply to startups and smaller companies. These companies don’t have established hiring processes so there is more flexibility.",

So if you ask on experienced devs, you'll probably get a lot of people who are saying language doesn't matter and what not, but the good ones will say the opportunity is only good if you are willing to make the leap to learn the other language.Java is one of those languages that can feel \"old fashioned\" by todays standards because of the fact so many other languages figured out shortcuts or answers to common problems that still exist in java. So my conclusion has been it always is universally painful when anyone is trying to traverse going from something like dotnet or python to a java system. I'm living that pain right now and I'm primarily a dotnet dev that got hired into a java shop that needed a dotnet dev for a side project. And you are right Java Spring is full on magic box because people have built answers to so many problems. It's less programming and more like fitting together pieces of a puzzle, which is why I kind of dislike it. However, it got that way because raw java is the literal boards and nails of high end compiled languages because it was open source and the first one. Had this experience when going between android, iOS, and windows. It was like the windows stuff was somehow between two extremes in approach.",

I am slightly surprised you can get a senior job without ever working. My worry would be - how do you work in a team, are you familiar with code reviews, shared code bases with git, writing architecture documents, clarifying requirements etc. Especially in senior role you get a lot more responsibilities that are not just code, but you need to be able to drive architecture and communicate to management effectively, steering them in the right direction.Regarding questions and what you put into your cv, full stack vs backend - it doesn’t matter. They will hire based on what they need for the role. If the role leaning to front end they will ask more about frontend. The cv won’t change that. So just keep your cv truthful. There’s a lot of backend leaning full stack positions and you fit that, don’t apply to front end leaning positions.Blazor is definitely used and I do see some positions for it. It’s more used in enterprise applications , which I doubt you can get hired as a senior without ever working in that scale before.",

Your 8 years of keeping a production app running is honestly more valuable than most people realize bc that shows you understand the full lifecycle, can handle real user problems, and know how to maintain code over time. The fact that you've dealt with race conditions, auth systems, and layered architecture tells me you're not just copying tutorials.For the interview prep, I'd brush up on basic SQL optimization, maybe review some common C# patterns, and be ready to walk through your architecture decisions on your main project. They'll probably ask you to solve a simple coding problem, but it's more likely to be \"write a method that does X\" rather than dynamic programming puzzles. As for the full stack vs backend question, honestly your Blazor experience might be more of an asset than you think as lots of .NET shops are curious about it but don't have anyone who actually knows it well. I wouldn't pivot away from mentioning it, especially since it shows you can handle the whole stack when needed. Small companies love that versatility because they don't have huge teams. The 2.5k salary is solid for a first industry role, especially remote from LATAM, and once you have that professional experience on your resume everything gets easier.",

After that, they sent me an email offering me the Senior C# SQL role.I know that I'm not near to a Senior exactly because of what you say, those are the exact same feelings I have. I kept my systems up and running without issue for years but I work alone so fixing problems always has been easy because I know everything about my projects.Yet I feel like I would never be ready and I saw no offers for remote positions for Jrs, I've been looking for them in LinkedIn for weeks, and the market is really harsh for people without a degree to miss this opportunity. I have nothing left to lose, So I applied.I'm hoping the bar is not set too high and I'll just be honest in the interview, I'm not a regular Senior but their requirements didn't say anything about leadership nor complex tasks, so this may be a good fit.Anyways, thanks for answering, I'm glad a human can try to help me, I'm sick of speaking to AI and it just gives me fake hope lol, I'd stick to fullstack with Blazor then, at some point I may find a job with it.Btw, where did you saw the job offers?

As SWEs we build products that provide value to customers. Unfortunately users don’t care how scalable a product is (unless there’s an outage), or what design patterns were used, they just want it to work. A sloppily built app with tech debt that works and a better coded app that also works at the end of the day both do the job. I definitely struggled a lot with doing it right vs getting it done at the start of my career and a big thing that helped for me was understanding “blast radius” i.e. if this breaks how bad is it going to be? Why should I care about building a perfect solution for a service only a few customers actually use/care about. Of course customer obsession is a good trait to have, but trying to minmax happiness can help with burnout and understanding what actually needs to be done right.",

People know it has value, but they don't yet know how much value.The improvements that companies keep making, makes it seem like the potential value is much, much higher than it actually is. Right now, everyone knows it is not as valuable as it is valued at, which is leading to the intense speculative bubble we're seeing. It is the belief in what it will do later that keeps the bubble so strong; if several PhD level papers come out showing we're not even close... that will probably kill the bubble.And of course, that probably won't happen for a while. The folks who would do such research are also largely funded by the people who need the bubble to continue.This is normal for an immature technology. What is NOT normal, is thinking the technology is going to replace everyone, without actually proving it can, and everyone hedging their bets on this happening anyways.Companies like Apple are probably going to be the big winners at the end of this. They're not firing their teams and replacing them with unproven AI. And at this point in time, it is looking more and more like AI usage just shifts the bottleneck further down the line rather than eliminates it (as far as automated programming goes).Since the changes it makes can be breaking and it has no accountability, a lot of devs are being forced into code review for thousands upon thousands of changes. It is likely to lead to unstable software, with limited ability to diagnose and maintain, even if companies increase headcount. You just cannot fit the context of the changes into your head fast enough to tell when the AI is doing something dumb.As such, the workflow we're accustomed to is not very accommodating to AI autonomous changes... until it can actually take over dev jobs, which is still a long time away.Site Reliability Engineers and Cybersecurity developers are going to feast.",

        "body": "I work at a FAANG and my view, as well as that of all my coworkers, is that this tech is absolutely going to completely reshape this field and already is. It codes far faster than any human ever could, by orders of magnitude. It can do system design, it can debug and diagnose, it can work in large codebases, it can work across multiple microservices.Hand coding is dead. There is no way, in hell, any company is going to tolerate an engineer who insists on taking a week to write something AI can in 5 minutes. So what if the code isn't 100% perfect, it took 5 minutes, even if you spend an hour or two refining it thats still a tiny fraction of the time it used to take.No one's quite sure where this is going to go, but theres two real possibilities. The best case scenario is that because SWEs can now work orders of magnitude faster we end up having even more work to do and at a higher level. Now instead of taking a couple features to work on during a sprint you instead ship an entire epic by yourself; the concept of a sprint is probably over too. And because you're working at such a high level, business domain knowledge is going to become a lot more important. The PM and SWE roles could end up merging together under this scenario.The worst case scenario is that theres nothing a human SWE can do better than AI. AI gets good enough that a completely non-technical user can use AI to create an enterprise-quality product or service. Or maybe a non-technical user can't quite get there, but you only need a handful engineers to drive all engineering output at a company. This represents the extinction of SWE as a career, and probably all white collar work.People in my org are concerned enough about this that I know some talented engineers are already actively interviewing for new careers. Not new jobs, I mean total career switches out of white collar work entirely. A lot of our non-work discussions are now about what our plans are if AI kills white collar work, with ideas ranging from alternative careers to starting businesses to moving to cheap countries to retire early.",

It may take a LONG time to pay off (jobs are especially hard to get right now) but eventually it will succeed. Hopefully you'll find a position that is better than this one.In the meantime, there might be ways for you to work around the problem within your current organization. This advice will be appropriate for some companies and not for others so consider your situation before applying it.Sounds like you've effectively been \"demoted\" by being assigned less valuable work. Also sounds like you aren't being given enough work to actually challenge you (\"haven’t touched a line of code in 2.5 months\" \"just got assigned the most absurdly simple defect\"). Maybe you should go ahead and \"promote\" yourself without asking for permission.Figure out who at the company WANTS the system rebuild that you thought was a good idea (\"rebuilding the existing native application with my language of expertise that I’ve worked with & loved my entire career\"). Maybe this is a product manager outside of the tech world, maybe it's a VP who doesn't have the clout to get things moving. (If there isn't anyone who wants this done... maybe it shouldn't be!) Talk with this person. Say that you aren't being challenged in your current position and you have some free time. Offer to build what they are looking for as a \"Proof of concept\". Invest some time and just BUILD the darn thing (it's amazing how much faster a \"skunkworks\" project can go. If you succeed, maybe you end up as the tech lead for the project (which would consist of releasing the \"POC\" that you built).As I said, it's not the right solution for all companies, but it CAN be effective in some places. And it doesn't sound like you are especially worried about annoying your current manager.Sometimes, the way to stop being a mid-level SWE is to stop behaving like a mid-level SWE and start behaving like a senior SWE.",

Then spend 1.5 - 3 years at your next 2-3 jobs until you find something that has good pay / culture alignment. The only reason, I suggest you don’t leave your current role earlier, is that you don’t want to distract yourself from the degree. It will make your future much easier.I’ve averaged 2-3 years per job & it’s given a lot of growth professionally & financially. I’m hoping to be at my current job substantially longer.",

Idk how your experience has been with your current company, but my biggest takeaway from being at the position I am at currently is that you should switch jobs when you feel you knowledge has stagnated (as in not learning much) or you prefer to go in a different direction in your field (switching from a Full Stack Engineer to say a Back End Developer).It also appears getting past the 2 year mark is pretty much the golden rule. Now depending on how much you are learning or if you have stagnated, the 2 year mark could be a good indicator to look at how far you have come since starting and analyze how much you have learned. I specifically plan on getting to around the 3 year mark before I start applying to much higher paying position. Be it, I am only a few minutes from my house currently and don't have a house, car, or kids to worry about in terms of big monthly payments. Whatever you do end up doing, do not just quit your job and hope to get picked up elsewhere fast! When I graduated college in 2023, it took roughly 10-11 months before I got the position I am in currently. Just be aware that when you do start looking, it could be another full year till you find that next job.",

On the other hand, massive usage of AI is not bad but that heavily depends on yourself how you are using it, as a tool that does everything for you, or mostly as a CR partner, someone to discuss the architecture approach.

It really depends on how much friction you want your next job search to be. It's easy to remain in the defense ecosystem, especially if you have a clearance, because getting interviews/callbacks from other defense contractors is much easier after having a proven track record in defense. It's also a very comfortable job outside of the work aspect; a 9/80 work schedule is game changing if you are in company that does that and the slow work pace can be relaxing. I honestly don't think I'll ever attain that same level of WLB anywhere else outside of defense after this. I will definitely consider defense again when I am older and ready to just coast to retirement. I think these factors are huge reason people get stuck in defense; it's what I've seen from my older, high tenured colleagues do and people that have left my company to go to other defense companies.I will say that defense is varied and even teams within the same company can have wildly different directives and experiences. I was fortunate to be in a team that got to do really cool stuff that also had a more relaxed pace, and I still got to learn a lot about SWE at the same time. Some of my colleagues that got placed into the big money maker team in my company were working left and right on different projects every month from what it seemed like. My recommendation is that you give this a fair shot for 1-2 years and make an adjustment if needed.You may actually enjoy the work you do and discover that your team isn't as slow or not productive for learning as you may initially thought, or you completely hit the mark on your initial assessment. As a general life advice, use this opportunity to really isolate what you want from a job, and align your next actions to directly support that goal and don't compromise it just because it's easy. If you want out, commit to finding a job that fits your desired career track or work towards joining a top company that can give you that clout you need to work at your end goal role. Going for what is easy to get is how you really get stuck in a niche.",

I also moved to a LCOL area which helps a lot. Work expectations are minimal compared to private sector jobs. If you are even an average developer, you'll be above average in defense. Shit is the definition of easy mode.I do not need to worry about offshoring, at least for now. I still have many contacts on LinkedIn who have been hammered by them; these are great engineers too, people I learned from. The private sector is fucked to say it plainly.I'm nearly 40 now and too sick and tired of walking the layoffs minefield. I was only laid off once, but even when you survive, there is always someone you know who doesn't and that eats away at your morale. I've seen two people fired in defense and it was due to timecard fraud.",

Questions like that open up discussion and it's productive. You're taking responsibility but laying the groundwork to improve.On another topic, why are you constantly making mistakes? What are those mistakes like? The type of mistakes matter and some times it requires reflection. You can ask yourself questions like:* Do you have ADHD and always been prone to making small mistakes? * What is your workflow like? * How can you organize things to reduce clutter and make things easier?* What are your development processes like?

If I know I didn't have a good explanation of a detail on my resume, I can brainstorm a few and practice them until they sound natural. Or if I flubbed a coding section, practice it. Look up the questions I didn't know.I guess you can try to read between the lines of the little feedback you did get too. Like if your profile was impressive, they might have thought your performance didn't match their expectations (for that experience or title before).Or ask for very broad suggestions on places to improve. It could be near the end of the interview itself, before the decisions. Maybe even offering ideas yourself to make it easy for them to parrot it back if you're worried about bothering them. And to show where you think you could best improve.Maybe I've just gotten enough experience finally, but \"culture fit\" (and confidence) has felt really important for a lot of my previous interviews. Do you fit in. Are you like us. Can I work with you, and do I want to. Information can be learned. New tools often are like other tools (new dialect).

I don’t know if HR sends generic rejections or just ghosts you if we reject.Phone round - I stopped doing this because i felt it’s pretty useless, it was useful screening tool when we didn’t do virtual interviews and instead had in person interviews. Generally I go over work experience, poke around some technical areas, see if you know what you’re talking about or if the resume was exaggerated. Also good opportunity for both parties to calibrate expectations, so we aren’t wasting eachother’s time. Then wrap up with LC easy question, my go to is a graph search algorithm.Onsite/Virtual final round - now this highly depends on the role. For IC I usually do system design round, for other EMs, I’ve done system design and roadmap planning and strategic vision. Main reason I’ve failed people who solved the system design was due to lack of depth in understanding. It’s very clear when they’re regurgitating from a video they’ve seen rather than make live trade off decisions and ask clarifying questions. Did I really say speed was necessary? Or do we care about accuracy and freshness of data? Why are you adding a cache? Did you clarify the DAU and types of requests to be confident in your cache hit rate? You get the picture. For EM side, it’s usually their examples from their previous job lacks the scope we were looking for. “How did you drive alignment across the organization? How many teams were involved? Did you come up with a proposal for leadership? How much coordination tax would this take? What is the risk if we don’t complete?”TL;DR - we’re human, your interviewer needs to like you and you need to fit their similarity bias. Most rejections are because someone better applied, more knowledgeable, better work experience, and just had a good day.",

There are plenty of resources online to learn at your own pace, but if you don't want to teach yourself then that's not a good option.\"Obviously I'm not a vibe coding monkey since I have the theoretical and programmer brain from my CS degree\" Gunna be honest, this is sounds super hypocritical to say right before you talk about how your old major project was completely vibe coded. Maybe you would learn something if you had to build the same project without Claude. It's super easy to understand code especially code that Claude writes. It's a whole lot harder to think of that logic and write code from the ground up. Think about how easy it is to read a book and how much more difficult it would be to write a book.From the sounds of it, it looks like you don't like CS but kept going with the degree and now don't want the last 4 years to be a waste. If I were you, I would really consider what you want your job to look like. I only have 2 YOE and I spend my days sitting in a cubical doing full stack development. In this time, I have learned that real world coding is very different from the fun projects I had during college, so now I'm getting a master's to pivot into a data analytics field. I had a couple data driven projects during this time and realized it was way more enjoyable. However, I also know that I don't have the discipline to self-study without the fear of an exam or project deadline so that's why I am getting the masters.Ill end with this, you're not alone at all. Over half of my friends that graduated with a CS degree went into a different field that involved no coding. One is in audio/visual, one is training to be a pilot, another a scada engineer. While yes, it's a bit demoralizing to pivot a career right after graduation, it's much better than being stuck in a role you hate.",

If you want a prestige boost, then having Georgia Tech on the resume might be good, otherwise, likely not worth it.The knowledge is somewhat useful day to day in that as a graduate student in a lab I was a lot more like a full-time employee than I was during my internships. The coursework is what you make of it, I took a few RF classes that ended up being useful in my job. I could’ve learned that stuff on the fly though. I finished undergrad in three years, and used my masters year as my senior year. (Still lived in my frat house, etc lmao) Fully worth it for me, as it was funded by a lab and I got to drink a lot more beer with only two courses a term, but I would not have paid extra for it and would not have stayed in school longer.",

I overwhelmingly receive interest in automation roles, but have had a few \"manual\" roles come my way as of late.Tons of off/nearshoring. It is a weird time. It seems like everyone recognizes that quality is declining across the board, and yet the trend of trying to push it off on individuals who have little to no passion for it continues. All the focus is on speed, and testing goes out the window. On the flip side, deploying changes only gets cheaper and cheaper, so production issues are viewed as less of a liability -- until you have a $10,000,000 issue.My hope is the eroding quality issues and disruption risk of the modern landscape will make quality somewhat a competitive advantage moving forward. Any team who has had effective quality advocates guiding processes and shifting quality concerns left/bringing the quasi-adversarial perspective knows the value they bring to a team/org. Alas, no idea if this will come to be.",

No one cares, nor should they. If anything, they should just be happy that I’m done because I won’t have a second priority. - IMO, the benefit is going to be almost all invisible. Companies that set their filter to “masters degree mandatory”, now you’ll be surfaced for those roles. This might mean you’ll get more bites at the apple, but it absolutely will not be a fix if you’re a poor interviewer.If you’re going to do a masters degree, it should be some sort of specialization. A general CS masters is basically what you learned in your bachelors, and definitely not very additive. I think programs in AI or Cybersecurity could be additive, or a masters program in CS that specializes in one of those (since those can be argued as additive)",

It just means better.I've seen people with 2 YOE get Senior titles because they were at the right place right time—young team, desperate, whatever. Or just dumb.

Remember: There are more than just 1000 companies in the world that are powered by applications—custom or out-of-the-box.I'm not saying titles don't matter—they do, they gate a lot of things including but not limited to your dating life—but if you want to level up your skill, that's a lot more of a different thing than just saying \"I want to move up to Senior Backend.\"",

This is a long shot, but do you have any advice for this?

        "body": "1. I'm agnostic about the specific companies I work for. I just insist they be tech companies where I'll be a profit source not a cost center. Historically I went for startups with business plans I couldn't drive a truck through and generally early enough to get a significant fraction of the company with a transition to SaaS in 2010. Since 2017 I've been more worried about accumulating assets for retirement and worked for public companies with liquid stock.So I don't bookmark specific companies.I hadn't heard of half the public companies I've joined since 2017 and one of those two was the best I've worked for in over thirty years.2. I don't know how often timing was an issue in my Q4 2025 job search because I don't have visibility into whether I failed a resume screen or they chose someone else, although I got offers from companies where the job posting had been up for months and where they took up to two months to get back to me.3. In my Q4 2025 job search I made a spread sheet because I applied to many (62 versus at most a handful) more companies than I did historically and that was the most convenient way to keep track.4. I'd apply if the job was a good fit even with a 99% ghost rate. I'm an individual not the average candidate who is under qualified as Joel Spolsky discussed 20 years ago in [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/06/finding-great-developers-2/](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/06/finding-great-developers-2/) where \"almost every hiring manager in Palo Alto right now with 1000 resumes on their desk has the same exact set of 970 resumes from the same minority of 970 incompetent people that are applying for every job in Palo Alto, and probably will be for life.\" Google hired me in spite of a reported 0.2 - 0.7% acceptance rate, although to be fair that position came through an inbound recruiter contact.5. Along similar lines I don't think stats would be useful.6. Tools facilitating automated application are the biggest BS in tech hiring presumably causing long backlogs to talk to a person and some good candidates being lost in the noise.",

The screening process feels so disconnected from actual job performance, especially when you're more direct or don't play the corporate small talk game well. I've noticed this pattern too where founders tend to hire differently than HR departments do.To answer your questions: I do bookmark companies but honestly it's pretty manual and messy. I use a basic spreadsheet to track applications because most job platforms are terrible for this. Timing is huge though, I've definitely gotten rejections that felt like they already had someone in mind before posting. The ghosting stats would actually be super valuable, like if I knew a company had a 70% ghost rate I'd probably still apply but adjust my expectations and not put as much energy into customizing everything.The biggest BS right now is probably the AI resume screening stuff. You're getting filtered out by algorithms before any human even sees your application, and nobody tells you why. It's this black box where you could be perfect for the role but get rejected because you didn't use the right keywords or format. Companies are posting jobs they're not even seriously trying to fill, just collecting resumes or satisfying some internal requirement.Super cool bc I'm also building something in this space too (called Sprout) because the whole system feels broken. We're trying to give people more visibility into company response patterns and help optimize applications for these screening systems. But honestly the real problem is that hiring has become this weird theater where everyone's pretending the process makes sense when it clearly doesn't.What specific automation stuff have you seen people build? I'm curious about the more elaborate setups you mentioned.",

I think the bigger issue isn't just *how* you search, it's that you're fighting a volume game where everyone else is spending 2 hours per application while you're doing the same, which mathematically means you can only reach like 10-15 companies a month max before burnout hits. The unconventional approach that's actually working for people now is automating the repetitive parts without losing quality.Not talking about spammy mass-blast stuff, but actually letting software handle the grunt work of finding roles that match your criteria, customizing your materials for each ATS, and submitting at scale so you can focus energy on the companies that actually respond. I've heard really good things about SimpleApply for this exact use case since it handles the end-to-end application process and lets you reach way more opportunities without spending 40 hours a week on form filling. To answer your actual questions though: I track in a spreadsheet (Notion got too heavy), I absolutely would skip companies with 70% ghost rates if I knew that data, and the biggest BS right now is take-home assignments that are clearly just free consulting work.The fact that we're all pretending 8-hour unpaid projects are normal interview steps is insane. good luck with your product btw, sounds like you're tackling real pain",

I obviously gained weight over time. There are ways to avoid it. As you state, it’s related to cognitive load. On one of my worst projects in terms of hours, I lost weight because I was very mindful of my diet and how I dealt with stress. We’re all human, though. I’m not sure where the cutoff is between discipline and caving. Probably flexible and impacted by a lot of different factors. For me, personally, there have been times a switch went off for whatever reason. Perhaps a visual representation of the behavior spurs action more quickly.I think burnout is a different beast from smaller actions related to cognitive load. Interesting to see Monday your biggest food ordering day. I would have expected Friday or if you have consistent end-of-sprint days.",

You could also load up a crock pot in the morning and come home to a nice hot stew and an amazing smelling house.If you can get into the habit of making larger portions and storing them in the fridge or freezer, it really simplifies meals in a way that's consistently higher quality and less expensive than delivery. You can also do some simple little side dishes like roast carrots, cooked spinach with garlic or even kimchi, so that you get some variety with the main thing you're eating.I'm much less inclined to order anything, since a meal for one for one night will usually cost about the same as a meal for one for a week. Even just driving over there and getting an order personally will at least cut that cost in half.",

If you're worried about your skills stagnating, talk to your employer and ask to ring fence an hour or two a week to help maintain them. Alternatively, spend some of your personal time maintaining your skills, working on side projects etc. that align with your preferred employment whilst job hunting.",

One guy had a bad review that stayed in his permanent Workday record, even as he changed teams. I'm weirded out. My paranoia says that a C level guy who doesn't like me is trying to get rid of me but he's getting pushback, so he's trying the feedback angle to see if he can get anyone else to say something negative about me. I don't understand why the guy doesn't like me, as he's never said anything negative to me directly, but he's made passive aggressive comments to my manager, like \"I don't think he's happy here. He doesn't seem happy here.\"",

Buy a motorcycle, take ski trips, go to nice restaurants, take in a movie every now and again. climbing corporate ladders is for the silent generation returning from WWII. Automation kills the ability for you to shine in most situations; therefore, you need to invest money in something interesting and look for a way out of tech eventually.I'm a Christian but even WFH got to me eventually. We desire to have connections with other humans so I'm now happily married and living in the Philippines. We're building a farm and investing in other financial opportunities, so it's an option if you find yourself in a situation like that. If you prove yourself in WFH then you can live abroad in cheap countries and live a life of extreme luxury. Otherwise, you can just travel and take your PTO. If you're WFH then you need to absolutely push for your PTO because sick days can be forgiven if you're good at your job. If you end up WFH, then map out your PTO and make a challenge to travel to every continent to explore, after 5 years you'll find a place, an activity, and possibly somebody to make WFH easy.You don't want to go to an office dude, and once you're in that position at your job, then you'll have to stick it out for at least a year. If you're WFH, then switching to an on-site team in 6 months is WAAAY more doable, all you need to say is \"your mental health is suffering because of WFH\". There may not be an immediate opening but it's not the same as asking for a remote position. However, people who are onsite most likely have way more room to be toxic since they're \"putting in the work and commute\", so don't be surprised if you run into the exact opposite of what you like.You play sports, BJJ, hang out with people, you probably have weird quirks like looking people in the eye. Trust me man, the way tech is going, you're gonna find yourself in a bad work relationship, offending people over zoom is way harder than offending someone in person. Protect yourself and if you get the position, take it; moreover, this person reached out to you because they're probably trying to save you without saying that part out loud.Now if you're a bloodthirsty, psychopathic, pathological liar, then absolutely work onsite and crush everyone by throwing them under the bus; however, if you're looking for peace then WFH.",

It's not going to help you if no one takes you seriously. Pick a 24 hour period once a week to do no school work, you need to let your brain rest.Graduating with a bachelor's of science majoring in computer science, for me at least, was an exercise in stubbornness. I just didn't get \"it\". The thing about computer science is it is not about specifics, it is about concepts.If you can understand the concepts, you can code in any language. You aren't getting a degree to \"learn to code\", I know it might feel like that, but that's not it.Your degree is learning how to learn to code, and that is a very distinct difference.If you are a first year student with no coding experience and you jump right from class to assignment and expect to bang out code, it isn't going to work; to get it to work you need to build the synaptic pathways, to do that you have to work through it. To do that, you need to pseudo code.You can write out pseudo code like an essay.Let's take something very simple, adding two numbers.Do we need anything? I don't think so, but let's put a comment at the top where we can ask for anything that we need to be brought in.Next we need to numbers. How are we going to get those numbers? We need to decide what type of numbers we want. Let's say that we want two whole numbers, we need containers to hold those numbers, and we want the containers to be empty.Name container one and empty itName container two and empty itThen we want to get two numbers. Let's assume we are going to ask a person, then write a function.Ask person for two numbers and store them in the containers, then call the function we will write.The function will then be a box we put something(s) in and then something(s) come out.So we say we cut holes in the box for thing 1 to go in so the box knows that thing 1 has the properties of the hole for thing 1, and the same for 2. Then we cut another hole in the box for one thing to come out.Then that is it. You start very high level and then you write out what you want to do, then you try to figure out how to do it.You have be able to understand the concept of what it is that you are doing before you can code it. Once you know the code, then it is figuring out the syntax.You then start from the top and go to the bottom and change all that you know into code. If you don't know it, try to figure it out, look it up in a book, spend a good 15 minutes on it. Once you can't figure it out, put that specific part into AI and ask it to change it to code. See if anything clicks.Make a word document and name it whatever you are having problems with. Then copy and paste the pseudo code and the AI code into the document. Then tell the AI that you don't like that one and you want it done differently, and keep pasting in the different ways of doing things as you tell it that you want it different; there will be a finite number of ways of doing it.Look at the document, is there anything in that document that \"clicks\" and makes sense to you? If it does, put it at the top and highlight it. That's the way to remember doing it. Rinse repeat.There's no other way to code than understanding the concept of what you want to do and then turning that concept into a reality through syntax. Computer science is like a pyramid, the concepts you learn in year one will hold up year two. I still remember having to use the Jacobian from calculus and being like \"What the actual fuckity fuck fuck?\"If you don't have the time to learn the concepts of how to psudocode at a high level, I think you need to consider making more time by doing less.If you can understand the concepts, but not the syntax, you'll be fine. That will come as long as you keep working at it.",
