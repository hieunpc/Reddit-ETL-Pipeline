It's not a \"commercial open source\" project with an \"enterprise version\" or \"hidden proprietary features,\" like Delta and other similar projects. The project itself is not very popular or exciting, and Apache Spark is often considered \"not modern.\" However, I know that half of the identity resolution projects at a real-world scale of billions of entities rely on GraphFrames' implementation of the Connected Components algorithm. If one needs to cluster graphs on a scale of billions, compute centralities, etc., GraphFrames is the solution. GraphFrames is the only known to me open-source project that can handle such a scale without requiring separate infrastructure. It takes up almost all of my free time, around six to eight hours per week (unpaid, of course), but I'm happy to work on something interesting. What could be better than taking a scientific paper with a distributed graph algorithm and putting it into Scala code? After my routine paid job of moving data from one place to another and doing boring ETLs, GraphFrames contributions are like fresh air to me.",

We all believed that \"social\" would solve all the deep-rooted problems humanity suffers from (self-inflicted, of course). Both classes (employer and employee) drank the Kool-Aid and disregarded the warning signs until it was too late to slow down.And look at the mess we ended up with—the loss of truth.

If you know what you are doing, it can be helpful so you can focus on the intricate and complex and not fatigue at the mundane or redundant. The current push in \"AI\", which most only know as the effects of LLMs will think their approach is novel when it is actually novice. Industry and government have seen periodic phases of this and like those phases the masses will move onto the next fad before they have gained any understanding in the prior. As a cross between a scientist and an engineer I have seen these waves appear and receed. Each time people like me are subjected to the beatings of unbridled and undirected passion by those who have not spent their time earning an understanding and respecting it for what it is. We then pick up the pieces when that frenzy fades into the abyss. I do believe that these tools are useful for those who understand how to use them while understanding their assumptions, limitations, and correct use cases. I believe this is what sets us apart from those caught up in a layman's understanding of the latest advancement.This does not mean that our types won't be in for a wild ride of unnecessary pain and suffering but at the end of the day it is this 1% that keep society balanced on a blade's edge between order and chaos.I hope this was helpful.",

Because of this tendency, I think the book is important to read before entering DE *and* to revisit often in your career. Tools and techniques make it easy to lose sight of why you exist as a DE in the first place; as important as knowing the ins and outs of spark or airflow is, the business doesn't care about how you did it. They care about value and they care about cost. If you don't know that, you kind of don't know anything. This book teaches you to think on that level.As an aside, knowing the fundamentals of DE is now more important than ever, because a lot of hyper-specific tool knowledge can now be delegated to AI (obviously you should educate yourself on tool fundamentals).

It's theoretical knowledge that pays off over the long term vs specific knowledge that pays off in the short termRead your other question about Kimball, I also read that one lol :face_with_tears_of_joy: and reviewed it tooFundamentals of DE is better first as it's a high level view of the field of DE **including** data modeling, of which Kimbal is the default methodology in many places Even folks who say they don't do Kimball throw around and implement Kimball concepts Fundamentals of data engineering goes over Kimball versus Inmon and Data Vault, so you'll get a primer before you dive into the data warehouse toolkit later if you choose to go deeper Hope this helps !",

I would say that Timescale- works fine for time series data- can scale, it requires fine tuning and monitoring - Timescale cloud is great, super reliable, it is not cheap though - With Timescale cloud (now TigerData) adding replicas is very easy, scaling up the read capabilities - query speed is decent, not great, but to query large amount of data in the past it would need materialized views. This way queries can be under 5 sec- tables take up more space than other DBs, and they can be compressed - backfilling data on compressed tables can be problematic I’ve never tried Citus, which I heard is better for general, non mainly time series data. I am sure that vanilla Postgres would require several compromises to handle TBs (eg split tables manually), and the queries would not be fast.",

It is like comparing \"Ford vs a V8\" -- what? That's not even the same category of thing.Do a comparison of Iceberg and Delta Lake in both Databricks and another execution engine so you can compare the difference of the two formats. Or change the comparison to be Databricks vs a more self-managed Glue.Also \"without vendor lock-in\" seems like it has little real basis. Delta Lake can be read and written by multiple different execution engines. Databricks code is still just SQL and/or pyspark, and it reads/writes to cloud storage that can be access by other execution engines. There's no more or less lock-in between Databricks and Glue -- they both have their custom extensions to pyspark and their own catalogs.",

You have to realize company processes are your processes that you have to follow. If they don’t make any sense or they sub optimal who is bringing this up to their managers ? The question is not what is the problem, the question is what is the solution. Once you know go to your management and let them know. Good management will listen, if not you should change !",

It's probably a symptom of where I've worked: 1 other IC in my team the entire 6 years ish I've been there. End-to-end, to some extent, has been the job. For a while I've been able to weight the proportion towards admin/engineering/come-architecture work because of some team changes around me, and seniority, I guess.Back to the blurry line, though. If a data engineer \"does pipelines\"... WTF even is a \"pipeline\"? Isn't it just input to output? What's the output of a data engineer? Varies wildly, I'd say. Probably also very dependent on team makeup, like mine. If output is data at a cleaned/\"silver\" state where an \"analyst\" or \"modeller\" comes in to then make it star schema or something else: well, for me in my place, that's not worth much. 50% value kind of thing. Good for the self service analyst who wants to just get it into Excel. Maybe you don't want to build enterprise reports with it, though, for example.So, if a \"data engineer does pipelines\" is part of the definition of an engineer, and that pipeline involves extracting data from an SQL server or an API feed into some kind of staging area in a warehouse or data lake.... I repeat my thinking, that's half the job at best, and worth that much. In that case we would do some general analysis of the raw/source data; set up some options in config/metadata; set up the automation; and that's kind of that bit done. The rest is *analysis*, *modelling*.So, I guess I do arguably quite a lot of analyst work as an engineer. Sorry for the waffle.",

The “bridging the gap” comes from knowing how data should ideally be structured for end users (which I know since I used to be one), and either architecting the structure or building it out myself. I’m still technically a full stack engineer so still do a bit of everything. I do work with end users, but we’re in consulting so I wouldn’t say I’m necessarily working with analysts. Far and away most important skill is understanding data modeling, dimensional modeling specifically. Technically after that it’s SQL then Python but this may change depending on your stack.",

The current marketing of OpenAI / Anthropic and others want to make organizational leaders believe it is that simple. Just develop an agent give it enough tools and just have a BA write the prompts. You can crank out 10 or even 100 agents this way. The agents will quickly do something that looks like what you want, but the last 20-30% of the features will take (as with other tech) 80% of the time and skills. Then layer on data integration from enterprise systems, testing, deployment, hosting, observability, alerting, human in the loop etc and you quickly exhausted a lot of companies skill sets (especially smaller companies). Also the run cost and token cost of such agents are a lot higher than agents that are properly designed for a specific workflow.",

In reality, AI projects fail more often because of messy data pipelines, lack of inline governance, and the need for structured, semantically rich inputs, not because the model itself can’t generate text. You still need engineers designing pipelines, validating outputs, handling temporal misalignment, and making sure the AI actually produces actionable results rather than just plausible-sounding responses. It’s not about slapping ChatGPT into a workflow; it’s about building reliable, production-ready systems that can scale, and that takes proper evaluation, monitoring, and observability, basically everything CoAgent (coa.dev) focuses on for enterprise AI deployments. If your clients understood that upfront, half the “myth-busting” calls wouldn’t even exist.",

It's why whenever governance programs are rolled out they have huge frameworks and RACIs and everything else most sane people hate. I think you're on the right track, but you'll quickly find focusing on just the technical part will be lacking. Your governance problems will be solved by building and maintaining relationships, not building tech stacks. Find the people who use the data to solve business problems, bake them cookies, laugh at their bad jokes, and start to understand why they use the data the way they do. Governance isn't just about locking things down, it's about translation. You need to learn each domains dialect, what data they use, why they use it, and how they refer to it, and rationalize between them. That's how you start to solve business problems using governance, which you will need to quickly or else you'll end up in white paper hell where no one cares to listen to you and you're just shouting standards into the sky.",

Of course, go nowhere until you have another offer. If you can get another (seemingly better) offer - great. Keep in mind if you leave this place after say, 6 months - what if the next place is also unexpectedly not what you want? Are you going to feel stuck for awhile, cuz you don't want **two** 6 months stints in a row on your resume?Personally, I'd relax on job searching and plan to stick around at least >= 1 years to learn things well there, learn what your options are there, and have it be a 'safe' tenure on your resume.

Big data came in to the scene specifically to address limitations of traditional data processing such as the inability to model unstructured and semi-structured data as well as the need for fast real-time analytical queries. OBT as a fully denormalized model allows all data in a single table as it is best for read-heavy analytical queries using map-reduce algorithm (hive, hadoop) or vector queries (columnar like clickhouse, hbase). Obviously, normalized data model will not work with a columnar database. And in the same way, OBT is not meant for transactional systems using traditional data stores.",

This allows you to start developing reports / dashboards more quickly while still working your way through the full dimensional model. This is most often done when rapidly prototyping in a tool like PowerBI. OBT also works better for some niche storage / warehouse types. An example of this would be Microsoft ADX which actually has very poor join performance if you have a dimensional table that may be large. ADX has no row indexes which means lookup key performance is very bad. In order to mitigate this limitation ADX very much favors OBT data design over dimensionaal / Kimball modeling.",

Not sure if there is a data engineering standard, but I would argue to have consistent folder names, like data, config, log, util, core, etc, and from there, build your product. Don't force yourself to use OOP. For ex, a file like 'helpers.py', why would you go for class class-based approach? This could make the code less readable. Other than that, learning OOP is pretty straightforward after you learn the basics. Go for any YouTube tutorial - would be more than enough.",

Watch some YT videos on how DM interviews are done, there's tons of mockup interview videos. Maybe take Udemy course if you want.Then learn distributed storage and compute (Snowflake, Databricks). Either of these are almost used across different domains for DWH. Remember, Snowflake is easy to pickup since it does all the background work like cluster mgmt, micro partitions where as Databricks has slightly uphill learning curve since the users need to learn resource and cluster management, partitioning, etc. In data engineering world, both AWS and Azure are heavily used. Companies that has web based application tend to use AWS from my past experience. In US, both AWS and Azure are popular. In Canada, have seen more of a Microsoft shop across.Not many companies use GCP in data engineering world. You can start with either AWS or Azure and cloud skills are easily transferable from one cloud to another, with just a few differences.",

Said in another way, you could (in fact, I do) have jobs that are processing records in batches (everything from the past 24 hrs), BUT the way those jobs are triggered is thru a pub/sub architecture. Meaning its not a a run-at-3-am cron scheduler, but instead events & rules on an aws event bus. So in this example the \"choosing batch\" does not automatically exclude the Event Driven part. Our glue jobs were built to process records in batch, but then we also went back and swapped out the scheduled runs with pub-sub events.... and all of this was done **without touching the glue code...** Batch to streaming is a bigger effort to transition to. Scheduled to event driven is much easier, I do not mind using aws event bridge + step functions. Eventually I'll get around to refreshing quicksight data sets with the same pattern. The use case we up against still does **not require streaming**, It's more about cramming a growning amount of ETL into the off business hours. This is becoming more of a need and less of a wish as complexity grows and threading needles with schedules no longer is practical.",

Almost all data pipelines I build leverage small micro-batches with event & temporal triggering: * Data streams into files on s3, persisted once either a time or size threshold is met. Max time is typically 1-15 minutes, depending on the feed. * Once it lands all further processing is typically event-driven leveraging s3 event notifications and parallel processing kubernetes, ecs, lambda, or whatever. * If downstream apps need to run against newly-arriving files, they can subscribe to s3 event notifications for when they do. These can also be translated to load timestamps & ids if the apps want to query the database rather than just read the s3 file. * If downstream apps need to run against a certain newly-arrived period of data (ex: the most recent day/hour/etc) then a specific agent is responsible for periodically querying the data and is solely responsible for dictating when a given period is complete. And then it sends out a sns message and apps can subscribe to that.The net results is that it's extremely resistant to data quality problems from late-arriving data, it delivers data as quickly as it's economically feasible, most of the system is fault-tolerant and self-healing, and you don't have bloated daily processes failing in the middle of the night and lengthy outages, you deploy during the day, you know immediately if there are problems, and it doesn't take 8 hours in the middle of the night to know if the fix worked.",

We use tools to change the content and structure of our data so that a push to each branch is idempotent. For example, our transformation layer uses a dbt ci similar to what is described in their [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/continuous-integration) (modified for our specific workflow). Our consumers build either off of UAT or PROD, depending on the stage of the feature we are building for them. Unlike typical git workflows for stateless applications, our data engineers need to merge to each branch sequentially. It looks like this:1) Merge Feature to DEV - check if DEV Environment data passes tests2) Merge Feature to UAT - consumers connect their dashboards/scripts/aimodels to UAT environment and report back on what they need changed3) Merge Feature to PROD - once consumers are happy, we release to prod, which has some additional checks and needs a senior data eng to sign off Major downside of the approach we have not been able to resolve is that PROD/UAT/DEV branches will have a different commit history.",

Are you delivering to a seperate team that is the data analysts, or are the analyst within your team? If your team includes the DEs, AEs, and DAs then I could see there being a struggle to deliver some layers (medallions) to UAT but not others. On the other hand, if your a team of Engineers delivering to Analysts, I think its easier to point to milestone/wins that enable the analysts. Those \"building blocks\" (facts and dims, cleansed tables, or tables w surrogate keys) I would consider to be discreet things sent into UAT separately. Thoughts I've had myself about the Medallion architecture: If you're implementing a dimensional data model (star schema), doesn't it make sense to say this is represented by the \"Silver\" layer?",

Meaning no active dev which means consumers have assurance that the tables are just gonna disappear or change schemas b/c engineers are working on new features. Also thinking in terms of merge strategies, I picture UAT being behind dev. This matters more in a larger org, but dev can move ahead and work on features that are not ready to be UAT-ed. This allows consumers to do a more thorough job of validating, which I often think of as \"I need to go talk to so-and-so who knows the business more to see if these results look right\", and if so-and-so is busy for the next week then at least engineers can move forward on the dev branch.",

        "body": "OOP really shouldn't be a goal in itself. There are some people (usually from a Java background and sometimes C++) that seem to think all production code must be OOP which it sounds like you have run into. This mindset leads to odd things in Python, like classes with only one method other than init (just write a function) and classes with only static methods (just put the functions in a module).Python often lets you write simple clean code by just putting functions in modules or passing them as arguments without classes. In a lot of DE code, functions are often only run once rather than many times across an application so there is less utility for OOP than there is in SWE.OOP is worth knowing of course. Some examples from the last week I've had is writing my own Operators and Hooks in Airflow which requires you to inherit from various base classes, another would be managing database connections. I have also written code using the connector design pattern to allow easy connections to many different cloud storages for a pipeline.Python is a very loosy goosey language in OOP terms so I'd stick to Python specific resources or you will get confused. I'd recommend \"Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming: Build robust and maintainable software with object-oriented design patterns in Python 3.8\" by Dusty Phillips. You don't need to read all of it, if you know what an Abstract Base Class is and why you'd use one and why composition is favoured over inheritance then move on to Arjan Codes' design pattern videos on youtube.",

I would ask where they like to document (nowhere), explain the value of people understanding their data more, and bullet point your things. Use a phased approach to gather the “full chain”1. Source data: Ask engineers/data generators to fill out DBT Source YAMLs. They are technical, and probably won’t mind the interfacing. Also ask for existing docs, design reviews, and the code. AI should be able to read the code and tell you what it’s doing. 2. Transforms: Same thing with analysts/wh users. Describe the table/views/columns and ask them to state their assumptions. Their data is a lot of work and valuable! We’re moving towards making data products. 3 exposures: approach business owners and those reporting to business and at this point just ask for the reports/models/ which see important and a URL which can get you to the report, or to know what is being referenced. “If you tell us what you’re looking at, we can ensure it’s not impacted by warehouse changes and upstream data evolving”1. The data portability alone is worth it. DBT docs are accepted everywhere - you can pull them into warehouses, data vendors, data catalog tools, and it has its own free portal you and put oh GitHub pages.2. Get SQL writers to use DBT templating. Big org win. Otherwise you can rewrite their tables with a script and show them a lineage graph, and then they will start using DBT3. Start working towards “impact reports”",

To your questions: 1) Yes, everything is stored on premise: the processed API query result in a Delta Table and from thereon a duckDB database, both located in \\`data\\` in the workspace. 2) I added the bronze Delta Table as a source in dbt ([here](https://github.com/moritzkoerber/local-data-stack/blob/master/dbt/models/01_bronze/xetra/sources.yml)). The result of the silver and gold stage are both written into a table in the duckDB database, which is a \\`.duckdb\\` file (no \"raw files\" like in bronze). I believe duckDB does not support an incremental write into external locations/Delta Tables through dbt at the moment.3) Yes, I simply query the gold table from the database. I added the duckDB database as resource in Dagster and by this it can be easily used in assets. [Here is the code](https://github.com/moritzkoerber/local-data-stack/blob/master/src/local_data_stack/defs/assets/presentation.py#L28).That's great feedback, I did not realize how much I did not describe appropriately.

        "body": "Near-real-time? Short answer: Flink.Long answer: I already worked in a setting in which the pattern was trained using scikit-learn (it was a simple classifier that considered 50 dimensions and decided if the event was fraud/not fraud). We packaged it and exposed it through a FastAPI endpoint. It was deployed on k8s with a load balancer for horizontal and elastic scaling. The main app called the endpoint with the payload and we answered with a float (the score). Using FastAPI background tasks, we sent asynchronously the payload, timestamp and score as a JSON to S3 (we could also have published it to Kafka). Then, a small ETL orchestrated by Prefect imported the JSONs into ClickHouse. The API was capable of answering the request in \\~100ms. It was fast enough for the small product we had back then.Coming back to Flink: I believe that for usecases that requires statefulness, it is indeed the best solution. You could also use Spark, even though it will very likely be slower. Another good fit is TImeplus/Proton (waaaaaaay easier to setup than Flink, the tradeoff being the flexibility on the choice of the pattern).",

Maybe try publishing your learnings too in some blog postsDon’t worry about the size of the data. What matters is demonstrating how the data enables business decisions - and for a data engineering role, showcasing things like IAM, RBAC, monitoring, and reliability is far more impressive than just processing a big file.For what it’s worth, I work with Snowflake, dbt, lakehouse patterns, and DuckDB daily, and even then I only have about 30% of the technologies listed on my resume compared to yours.

Seeing the capex peak will be an important sign to pay attention to, it would likely signal they’re ready to start deploying headcount to use that hardware to grow revenue.

Roles were found through contracting companies in the cloud vendor PSO programs. The company would bill the resources(DEs) at 200-250$/hr to clients, and contracts would generally be 3 months to a year. Contractors were mid-senior DEs and paid 100-225k. Companies were all US but across sectors from retail to tech.aside: Negotiate people! I had access to the numbers and contractors that were doing the same role, same tasks could have 75k spreads in salary. Also change jobs, you don't owe any company anything and it's how you really bump your salary. Projects I did as a contractor with PSO included:Building a CLI wrapper around GCP's CMLE that allowed data scientists with local PCs, with graphics cards, to have a containerized workflow that would work locally and a flag of '--cloud' would run the same job on CMLE. Crazy reduction in spin up times, validation of flags and savings on cost of spinning up clusters with hundreds of graphics cards for 10 minutes to fail during startup. Lots of data migrations. \"Get this Oracle DB into the cloud like bigquery... no its license expired and we don't have the ability to do CDC or replicas to avoid pulling too much during working hours oh and you need to use a vpn tunnel that is 25mb/s.. no we don't know what data we want so get everything... how does cloud work?\"Helped a startup convert their Data Workflows that executed in an on prem location to separate compute from storage, then containerize compute, then migrate storage to the cloud, then migrate remaining compute to the cloud. (Not distributed compue. Python/Java ETLs).And really, listening to a ton of meetings that cover insider Political BS(Which team owns what data, who should have permissions, VP wants method A but acquired company does it method B and wants to keep the current method, etc). Realizing when your contract is just to 'validate' some execs preferences and agreeing. Also constantly pushing back on Realtime data everywhere.",

Statistical tests (KS, PSI) still work on samples. For categoricals, stratified sampling helps catch rare value changes. For partitioned tables, profile only the latest partition(s) instead of full history.In terms of frequency, I run lightweight profiling (schema, basic stats) on every run, and save detailed stats for a few runs per day. Tier by importance—critical tables every run, others maybe 2–3x daily.I built a profiling tool that does adaptive sampling (random, stratified, top-k) and handles partitions. It stores results over time, so drift detection still works even with sampling and less frequent runs. Trino supports TABLESAMPLE directly in queries (SELECT \\* FROM table TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (2)). For Spark, add .sample() before your profiling checks.",

Log filename, row counts, checksums, and load status in a control table; redirect bad rows to a reject folder with a reason code. After a successful run, move files to an archive with a timestamp. Deploy to the SSIS Catalog, schedule via SQL Agent with retries and email alerts. This gives you audit trails, restartability, and easier handoffs than ad‑hoc scripts. For Access migration, point forms/reports at SQL views or stored procs and retire most VBA.If you stick with Python, wrap it in a single CLI, write to the same control table, call BULK INSERT or bcp for speed, and schedule with SQL Agent instead of Task Scheduler. I’ve used Azure Data Factory and Prefect for orchestration, and DreamFactory to auto-generate REST over SQL Server so Access/VBA could poll load status and logs.SSIS with SQL Agent is the clean, maintainable path here.",

In some cases you may want your ABAP coders to build extracts (or expose ABAP output via other methods like web services) but you may feel it’s not scalable to be dependent on them for everything. If your vision is to pull hundreds of SAP tables into a data warehouse, then asking the ABAP team to write, maintain, and schedule hundreds of text extracts might not be the best choice. There are different techniques for getting at the underlying SAP database - replication, SAP connectors, etc. Do some thinking just to ensure text file extracts is really the direction you want to take this.",

I'd probably manage the transformation logic with dbt, but most data warehouses will support scheduled queries and/or views if you don't want to introduce an extra tool yet.This has the advantage that, in the flattened tables, you can include only the fields you currently have a use for, while still storing all the unused ones in the warehouse as raw data. If you need the other fields later, you can simply update your transformation logic.",

As you get more experienced you gain seniority, and then get someone else with less experience to pull things out of their ass and it's now your job to steer them away from bad ideas.Their current set up is Not Good. They know this, and they also know that solving their problem isn't actually hard - it's just tedious. So it's a great job for an intern! This really is the best way to (1) learn what they all do at a high level, (2) demonstrate independent problem solving skills and (3) demonstrate/develop your ability to summarise and communicate information.How did you come up with your four options? What are the pros and cons of each one? (What does chat GPT say? Check the feedback from an LLM chatbot against established sources.)Break down the problem into smaller steps:1. Design database schema2. Move historic records into database3. Allow new records to be added to database4. A process/system to extract data from the database5. A process/system to transform the data into something usable for reporting6. Making the reportsCan you think of any I have missed?Each step will have at least a couple of 'good' solutions to choose from. There's going to be a balance between software with expensive licences and open source solutions. There's also going to be a balance between things which you or other colleagues already know how to do/use and things which you need to learn. There's also going to be a balance between complexity, future-proofing, maintainability and the minimum viable product.If you can generate a set of solutions to present along with an indication of what you think the trade-offs between those solutions might be, you will make your superiors very happy. It's ok if you don't know the answers, or if their assessment of the trade-offs would be different to yours. Being wrong about something is absolutely fine so long as your process is transparent.",

Think of it like database for data entry application. Generally, if your sole focus is to unify data and generate insights, you'd focus on OLAP not OLTP database. Snowflake is an OLAP database and it has lower barrier to learn than other similar service.Fivetran acts as your data loader. Sure you can use snow-cli to load the data yourself. However, I find Fivetran make this process easier in many ways.After the data has been loaded, you'll need to transform those raw data into a ready to use data. Maybe it's for user to use it directly (hence, self-serving analytics), or it's for analyst and scientist. To transform them means you will have to create new column or entirely new data from the existing ones. For this case, use dbt.Document and update the transformation in git.",

Team size, level of experience?- who else needs, or might need, access to any of the data at any of the medallion levels? - how are you planning to do deployments across environments?- what BI or other downstream processes will this be serving? - how complex or broad is the scope of data? Like, are you just ingesting a few tables from one system, one business process... Or an entire enterprise worth of different business processes, tens of systems, etc? And what kind of source data formats - just SQL databases, or less-structured APIs, etc?- how much transformation, data cleansing, etc etc will need to happen between raw data and final semantic models?Remember you don't have to follow a literal bronze/silver/gold structure - people often take medallion architecture too literally. If your use case is simple with one SQL source, you might only need a raw/bronze kind of layer to land the data, then straight to gold/final in one hop. If your use cases and data are complex you might need more than three layers, and you might differentiate one layer to multiple workspaces thematically, even just within prod.For small teams and simpler scenarios, you also don't _necessarily_ need separate dev and test environments. Depends on what tools you're using within Fabric, how you're testing, who is testing, how deployments are managed, how often things are changing, etc. Sometimes, testing can reasonably happen in the same workspace you develop in, then you just promote to prod.",

As always, pick a solution that is a good trade off between function/ cost/ performance. Of note, if you're in a separate managed environment, providing the sensitive OpenVPN profile and credentials might be a bit easier/ secure on a VM. It's generally an anti-pattern to bake credentials into a Docker Image and if you want to supply the credentials at runtime to a container, the best practice way to do this is using k8s Secrets, which does require access to the underlying k8s Cluster Airflow is gonna run the tasks against. And it will be your responsibility to manage the lifecycle of the secrets.On a VM, hopefully you'd have a Secret Manager by the cloud provider easily integrated to access the credentials. If you're not able to run a simple DockerOperator or KubernetesPodOperator or use k8s Secrets effectively on said managed Airflow instance, I'd seriously question the value of that offering.And beyond that, just install OpenVPN, open the VPN connection and execute dlt.",

Relevant docs: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-jdbc.htmlhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/spark/connector?view=sql-server-ver17Option 2: Add the SQLServer as a foreign catalog in Databricks. This will populate an object in the Databricks catalog that allows you to query/explore the DB as though it were a native table. Downside is that performance can be rough as you relinquish control over the query in favor of a simpler interface. Spoiler: this is using JDBC under the hoodRelevant docs: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/query-federation/sql-serverThere are other ways (sqlalchemy for example), but these two options have worked well in my experience.If you're pulling multiple tables from the same db, set up a class or set of functions to allow yourself to reuse them for any datasets you need to pull. This way your workflow can read like a series of simple steps ex: get_max_cdc_column, fetch_new_data, add_metadata_columns, write_to_delta. Added benefit here is you can quickly whip up new ingests by passing different args to your functions.",

Just a lot of overhead.The only valid reason to do something else is for API's that need event-driven updates in near real-time between systems. Else, read directly. Use any audit columns to your advantage to make incremental loads. Some systems you have no choice, no direct access to the MSSQL server, so you must use API or whatever else is given.When in doubt and vendor-based software (like an ERP) - use API first, direct query second. As the vendor can do schema changes and break your code. Not with APIs.We have local VMs and azure VMs and I connect directly, albeit with the approriate security in place, and a staging layer.

Then one Databricks DLT or Auto Loader pipeline per DB using apply\\_changes for upserts, with a jobs cluster or serverless and autoscale. Use Trigger.AvailableNow for micro-batch or continuous if latency matters. Compact small files and VACUUM on schedule.If you want managed CDC, Estuary or Fivetran are easy; DIY is Debezium -> Event Hubs/Kafka -> ADLS sink. I’ve used Fivetran and Estuary for SQL Server CDC, and DreamFactory when we needed a quick REST layer over odd sources with no connector.Cost/control tips: consolidate pipelines, reuse a shared job cluster, use spot where safe, and separate bronze/silver/gold by schema. Handle drift as add-only where possible; treat renames as add+drop and keep a dead-letter path.Net: centralize compute and offload or standardize CDC; let Databricks focus on transforms.",

A few thoughts that might help:\\*\\*General pattern that works:\\*\\*Process at the lowest granularity you need for reprocessing. In your case, that sounds like AP\\_Number level, since you want to reprocess specific APs without touching the whole EQP.\\*\\*On avoiding reprocessing:\\*\\*Track what you've already processed with metadata (timestamp, checksum, or version) stored somewhere lightweight - could be a simple metadata table in your warehouse, or even a manifest file per batch. When new data arrives, compare against this metadata to determine what's actually new vs. what you can skip.\\*\\*On the Part\\_Number optionality:\\*\\*Since Parts are optional and variable per AP, I'd process at the AP level and handle Parts within that processing step rather than trying to partition by them.\\*\\*Alternative approach:\\*\\*What if you partition by ingestion batch (timestamp when client sends data) rather than by the hierarchical data structure? Each batch could contain multiple EQPs/APs, but you'd process the whole batch as one unit. Downstream, you'd have the full data hierarchy in your warehouse with proper keys for querying.\\*\\*Question for you:\\*\\*What drives the need to reprocess individual APs? Is it data corrections from the client, or something else? Understanding that might help determine the right partition strategy.(Side note: your client moving to database storage sounds like it'll simplify this significantly - might be worth investing effort there rather than over-engineering the S3 ingestion flow)Curious what you end up doing - hierarchical data ingestion is always interesting to solve!",

Alternatively the upload process could write all customer or order related data to the same table and append additional 'key' data like `logical_set, date_partition, order_id, customer_id`. Then have an incremental DBT model that looks for the highest rendered partition of each logical set, and runs based on those. I don't think most systems use fancy lineage or data registries. But the individual ETL job would have a high watermark for each logical type and only advance when it can.

(The period .

And the machine Jupyter is running on needs python (or conda in case)If you're in a controlled environment you need to have whomever is responsible for your machine configurations to run a bash script when the server starts. A simple bash script is all you need to do this. You will want the environment to be stable and unchanging. The best way to do that with servers that do not have internet access is by packing your environment in a tarball (without your custom libraries installed) and unpack the env and install on the machineAgain all of this, tarball unpacking, install of library are just all a bash script.

The upside of this is that it's a common pattern that most of your customers will understand. The downside is that they have to write code (ie do work) to get the data out. The shape of the data is limited to what you serve over the API. It also puts a bunch of extraneous load on your servers and db (we've seen APIs be taken down because they were being scraped aggressively for BI purposes).* you can let your customers download CSVs. Like the first option, this will take work on your side to support and operationalize. The upside is that it's a pretty well understood pattern. The downside is that your customers might get annoyed quickly because this is a manual process: if they want data with any kind of regularity, they'll have to do this over and over again.* you can upload the data to an S3 bucket (or other object storage like R2 / GCS) and let your customers read it there. This is similar to giving them access to a database that you own, but gives you better cost and load protection: they'll be using their own compute to read it so it's less likely they'll blow up your bill by reading the data (though they can rack up big egress fees if your dataset is large).* you can share data directly to your customer's database or data warehouse. The upside is that the data shows up directly where they're ready to consume it, and they have to do zero work in order to get the data. It's also much more secure than letting them access your database directly (for example, they can't take your database down by accident by putting undue load on it). The downside is that it can be more or less cumbersome for your team to implement, depending on whether you build it in house or use existing tools. If you decide to use tools for this, assuming your data exists in places other than that RDS instance, you can leverage some of the native sharing functionality of some data warehouses (eg Databricks' Delta Sharing, or Snowflake's Data Sharing). Alternatively, you can use a vendor like us ([https://prequel.co](https://prequel.co/)) that will let you write data from your database instance directly to your customer's db / warehouse regardless of what stack they run.*Full transparency: we're a software vendor in this space.*",

And these loop copies are very easy to implement in adf.If you are against a loop (which it vaguely sounds like) then having a large time period to look at would likely work. 24hrs seems like it's too much based on example, but you should have data to be able to figure out a reasonable offset.

A lot of the issues you’re describing (stalls, jobs not starting, long refreshes, unclear logs) were real problems in older versions of the product, but shouldn’t be happening today. The one case where we still see this with abctl is when it’s running on a VM that’s below our minimum recommended resources - in that scenario, performance can degrade in exactly the ways you’re describing.The other factor here is your specific use case: Postgres-to-Postgres. Postgres isn’t a great database for moving large amounts of data, so even outside Airbyte, this pattern tends to be slow.Normally I’d suggest our Flex product, which handles these workloads much more gracefully, but I understand you’re looking for something that’s predictable in cost. In that case, I think the best next step is to understand why the Cloud version isn’t performing well for you - since Cloud should not exhibit any of the problems you’re seeing on abctl. If we can diagnose that, there’s a good chance we can get you to something stable without changing tools entirely.If you’re open to it, I’m happy to take a closer look at your Cloud account with our team. Please dm me with your details so I can get back to you on official Airbyte channels.",

Fortunately the interviewer was willing to pivot so he drew some tables, came up with scenarios and asked me to write joins to get the data. FWIW you can't necessarily improve how well you do on trivia but you can learn to explain how you use concepts in your day to day life. So if you can't explain in the most technical terms encryption vs encoding, you can at least talk about how your application encodes values, why it's important for the application and where you use encryption.Personally I'll generally take the developer who can talk me through what they'd improve in a project over the guy who can tell me what each gang of 4 design pattern.

I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and then it took me 6 months to learn to walk again. When I reported back to my job when the surgeon ended my FMLA and I could prove I could descend down 2 flights of stairs in less than a minute, my office was on the 3rd floor of a 5 story building. I had to prove that in case of a fire in the building and couldn't rely on anyone to help me down the stairs. But as I made it back to work after 6 months, my termination papers were waiting for me as they had already replaced me. I say that to say that every in person interview I have ever been to in the last 41 years, I was always offered the job. I've been been to 4 in person interviews this year and none of them have contacted me after I left the building. But all 4 interviews have gone the exact same way that your interview has gone. When I sat down with other employees for a technical review, all 4 interviews with them would ask odd ball questions that had nothing to do with programming. Most of the people I had interviewed with I saw a sheet where they had to google for these odd ball questions. I'm also a back end developer and one question I was asked is how would I use a Friend Class in C#. Now Friend classes are mostly used by testers, not developers. I've never ever used a Friend class in production. But the guy asking the questions wanted an answer, I made up some answer of how I would track down a bug that was happening in a Entity Framework class and returning invalid data. I said I would use the a Friend class to inject various variables into the Framework class to possibly see where the problem is coming from. Now it would really be a lame company to work for if they were using Friend classes in production, and I would bet that they were not. But the guy interviewing me said \"Well, that isn't what we would do.\" The interview then ended. The manager would return to the conference room and I would be walked out the building. More than likely it was just a gotcha question to say that we interviewed US citizens and none of them were qualified for the position so we need to apply for more H1B visa holders, or something similar. All 4 interviews where similar things. This one just happened to be the last one I went to in the end of July.",

It is not even close to being the same.Treat it as a learning experience and understand that preparing for technical interviews is very very different. Remember that interviews are intentionally designed to expose what you *don't* now. Good interviewers rarely focus on what you *do* know. Interviewing is a skill and you should definitely focus on it if those skills are weak.I would actually argue that with these concepts.. the theoretical foundations have to be there, yes, but how it's applied in real world scenarios is far more important. The edge cases, the pragmatic approaches.. the theory only goes so far. And the only thing that matters here is experience. You won't really understand hashing until you've screwed it up. You only really understand securing an API until there you cause an unauthed API incident, etc. Having text book theory about all of these with no real world use is actually worse. Best to be honest and say, \"I don't understand the inner workings entirely, but this is how I have used it, and this is what I learned, found interesting, found tricky..\"The other thing you nailed, was your understanding about your communication style. You need to develop clear, concise, confident, vocabulary about these concepts, it has to be second nature.Of course, any seasoned dev can google/stackoverflow/llm the answers and patch something together in a real job context. But can they think and speak on the spot and come up with a clear approach to a complex problem? Interviewers look for \"architectural sense\". Are they just slapping ideas together, or can they actually build and piece together a system, that works? Can they document and write a spec, without help?Your ability to communicate ideas, problems, solutions, and tradeoffs, as a dev is more important than your ability to code. Maybe not at first when you're getting started, but certainly in mid career, and late career, it's everything.There are plenty of resources and courses online to learn about just about everything. It needs to become an obsession on your part, to consume as much knowledge as you can AND then apply it in personal projects, over and over again, from scratch, from frameworks, from everything, until the skills are cemented. It's brutally tough, I get it. There's so much to learn and specialize into.But in this job market and hiring climate, only the obsessed, people who truly love this stuff, will make it. There is no room for casuals anymore. The bar is so much higher than it was a decade ago, but there is also ten times more resources/avenues for learning/getting started.",

It's easy to push forward and only learn new things, but you forget old stuff this way too.You kinda have to think about it, even on weekends. What's the syntax of a loop? What did you learn this past week?I would take each day and write quiz questions in a document for what you learned.Consistent practice, especially early on, is better than sporadic learning. I suspect you've taken more than one weekend off. You take one week off because something in life came up, and if you don't think about it, you forget it. Even 5 minutes a day reviewing the same thing over and over helps.Athletes practice all the time. They generally avoid taking days off. To be fair, they've often trained since youth so they have some muscle memory. You're new to programming, so you need that consistency so you don't forget. You need to think even when you're not in front of a computer.",

That was my fault, but it was hard to teach it.I kept telling myself (at the time) to find some students with buggy code and demonstrate how to fix it, but unfortunately, it didn't happen.It's your debugging knowledge that really shows the quality of programmer you are. OK, maybe that's not quite right. The debugging means you can fix leaks in the plumbing, but then there's the overall design. Is the building's foundation good. We build virtual structures, but much like a physical building, we have to fix things when they break....and I'm rambling.",

So I compiled the game with debugging symbols, ran said game in GDB, replicated the bug and I found the very instruction that had crashed it by following back up through the stack trace - somehow a zero had gotten plugged into the denominator of a division operation in the physics engine. Armed with this knowledge, I wrote a guard clause around the function that crashed and ensured that the value was non-zero (but instead really really really small) and this fixed it. And this wasn't even advanced debugging, this was literally backtrace viewing, stack frame traversing, and register inspection.The moral of the story is - it still pays to learn low-level computer science, assembly, C, and of course debugging tools like GDB and valgrind.

        "body": "I did a career switch also when being 28. From logistics to CS. Logistics was fine but it did not fascinate me. Messing around with computers, experimenting with viruses (at one point my laptop was full of malware), camping our computer classroom during secondary/high school studies - all of that was interesting for me. So, I went for a degree and I never regret it. Started Bachelor studies when being 28. Graduated when being 32, and then followed it up with Master studies in Cyber security. And working as a junior software developer at the same time.Self-study will not take you far. You do not know what you do not know but what you should know. While in a university professors know what you should know and make you to study it. Even when you do not like it. Yes, you can google \"X roadmap\" or something but this only touches the main topics not tells what exactly you have to learn in it. You can also pick some online bootcamp course, but this only teaches you the very basics that usually is not enough to get hired.With self study your portfolio will be much more generic. You'll be copying the tutorials you are following, writing meaningless calculators. While university studies will introduce you into much more complex topics and also will give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects. Either as part of your course studies, as part of hackathons, part of the computer club or robotics club or such that you might join, or as your Bachelor thesis project. Also, you'll learn all the theory that comes handy later on. Online tutorials and bootcamps show you how to write a functioning simple prototype but they do not tell you why to do it the way you are doing. And often they leave out all kinds of things that will be needed during your work as a software developer.And then there are connections. All your course mates, professors, computer club mates, they can later on help you with finding a job. Most of your course mates graduate and get hired. Some of the professors already are working in different companies while also part time being lecturers in a university. People can give you referrals. You'll get none of that as a self-learner. Now, to the downside of doing these studies: you won't be able to study full time and work full time at the same time. Either your studies will stretch over to 4-6 years, to lower your study load, or you'll have to lower your work load. I was working with 50% load and studying full time. And I run out of all the free time. Sometimes my flatmates (I shared an apartment with other students) found me sleeping in the middle of my notebooks. I feel into sleep while studying. Also, it can cost for you. Where I am from, university studies are free for our citizens. Well, free as long as you are passing your exams and not failing some course. Retaking a course will cost. But in other countries it can be that the studies fully cost money. I will put it so: how will you stand out as a self-learner from the crowd of university graduates, vocational school graduates, and junior developers changing their company? Why a company should hire a self-learner over a guy who has a degree? If you can figure it out for yourself, then sure, go with a self-study. But if you do not have a strong plan to have an advantage over degree holders, then go for a degree.",

You don’t need to be super techy to be a BA, you need to be organized, communicate clearly, and able to move the “needle-over” on projects consistently.

You might get something scaffolded in a few hours and maybe something sort of working in a week.

Did you omit it for the format because of time/space constraints?- You claim \"don't learn SQL like it's 2010\", but then never use any features post SQL'99. From skipping through I didn't see a single CTE, window function, recursive query, lateral join, json data, tree data, vector data or generalised indexes. This is really basic stuff. Sure, it's not an SQL course but a database design course - but these features are capabilities of databases nowadays that can be used.- you seem to do this implementation agnostic, but some stuff here is highly database dependent. Postgres does not have a tinyint type, text data behaves very differently on MySQL vs Postgres. Of course that can't be fully addressed in these videos, but with a full video on string types to wave this away as \"text may be better on any length\" is... weird.- ~~same with date types, a datatype introduction there should have timezones in it.~~ - nvm, it does mention it in the constraints video- NULL algebra is relegated to one of the last chapters it seems, but it's a gigantic footgun.

I focus heavily on entities, relationships, cardinalities, constraints, and conceptual/logic design. Because of that, relational algebra, window functions, etc aren't core to the curriculum for this class.* I also intentionally keep the SQL examples **implementation-agnostic**. If all you want to learn is vendor differences, you need to look elsewhere.* For the data types videos, the goal is to give beginners enough intuition to make reasonable design decisions, not to provide an exhaustive catalog of every nuance across engines.* As for NULL semantics, that topic *is* included, but it shows up later because students need some conceptual grounding first. By the time they get there, they’re ready for a deeper discussion of null traps.* As for \"A table is used to represent a single entity\", it helps beginners learn in the 1st lesson. Nuances like junction tables are inappropriate in the 1st lesson, and are covered as the course progresses.These choices are mainly for pacing and approachability, especially for students encountering databases for the first time. That said, your points about relational algebra and modern SQL features are fair for someone looking for a different style of course, and I appreciate you raising them.",

People usually get academic degrees in Computer science, not in programming.Software engineering is (somewhat of) an engineering discipline, concerned with how to optimize the development of software, usually large software systems. Recently, we have Software engineering degrees, which, compared with CS degrees, usually focus more on the team and systems aspects, and remove theoretical computer science.Just like you don't need a civil engineer to build a one-floor small house, but would definitely hire one for a ten-floor building, software engineers would be more useful when building large software systems.Keep in mind there's tons of overlap, programmers, software engineers and computer scientists usually program; many (most?) programmers have a computer science or software engineering degree etc.Given these large overlap, and the fact that these terms became popular at different times, they're not always used in these ways. A company may call a position 'Programmer' while another one calls it 'Software Developer' and another one 'Software Engineer', and the CS degree at one uni may look exactly the same as the SWE degree at another.",

Like, some problems can take a long time to solve even with really powerful computers (billions of years), and some problems are such that they can't be solved with a computer at all regardless of how powerful it is. Computer science is the science of examining these problems and methods (algorithms) of solving them.Software engineering is the discipline of writing software systems. One activity of that work is programming (writing the actual code that accomplishes the task), but there is a lot more involved such as understanding requirements, and design. It turns out that if we just start coding from our heads we inevitably run into problems so there are strategies and best practices that aim to reduce the likelihood of things going badly.Regarding job prospects software developers often have degrees in either discipline and in many ways they end up overlapping so it doesn't matter too much which one you pick, what matters is that you put in a lot of effort to actually become good at your job.",

They have to learn the fundamentals to a level where they are no longer consciously focusing on them.

Writing long methods and tons of code looks impressive, but fitting that into a larger project takes more time than writing. I take extensive notes on the API I wrote last week so that I can use it this week. Remember that raw code is the easy part. Programmers need skills in logic flow, software design, computational theory, and collaborative work. All of those are desk jobs that deal with notes, research, charts, and so on. Typing in the for loops and if statements is a tiny portion of the skill.

Kernel Stack - You don't want to share privileged kernel details with userspace accidentally, so the switches to supervisor mode swap stacks.2. Signal/Exception Handlers can be told to use a separate stack, because signals may come when your out of memory. You can sigaltstack() to set this up. Check out man sigaltstack.3. Cooperative Multi-tasking - exactly what your saying, when you have a more than one function executing on a single thread of execution, so you may have stackful co-routines with there own stacks.",

I quit my old job to move to a major tech hub (this was before I had kids -- it would be much harder to do this now) because, you know, you should go where the money is. And by \"move\" I mean \"sleep on the floor of the one guy I know in this city\".I was very quickly disabused of the notion I'd get hired as a software engineer because 1) I had absolutely no worthwhile experience to speak of, and no one is hiring you off a portfolio.\\[0\\] 2) I was objectively unqualified, which I can now say with the benefit of hindsight. I wasn't competent enough to understand how actually incompetent I was.After sleeping on my friend's floor for a scary six months of unemployment and failing to get hired as a software engineer, I changed my approach from \"What can I do to get someone to hire me as a software engineer?\" (because that clearly wasn't working) to \"What can I do to get on a path that will allow me to take meaningful steps toward my goal?\" and this basically unlocked everything for me.I made lists of what I deemed the \"right\" companies to facilitate my growth. These were:1. Companies that were smallish but definitely growing. Successful startups or just post-startup-phase companies. Places like this, you're going to get asked to flex out of your zone all the time, and internal mobility is very high relative to the Googles or Metas of the world.2. Companies where software engineering was in the DNA of the company: whether it was a strong engineering brand, or the customers were engineers. I wanted to become a software engineer, so I wanted a place that had software engineering top of mind (ie not like, a photo-sharing app or dog-walking-as-a-service or whatever).And I guess (3): a place where my past background might be at least slightly relevant, to leverage in some way the value of my past life.And from there I made it my goal to get \\*any\\* role in one of those companies. I would have taken a role in the kitchen.I got hired as a non-technical customer support agent at what was the dream company on my list. And I spent the next few years proving to them that I am awesome and capable of bigger and better things, and after a few years transitioned internally to a software engineering role, which I would have ABSOLUTELY NOT ever been considered for as an external candidate, largely because I was not competent to do the job. It's much, much easier to become competent while you're inside the house. When you're on the outside, you're largely flying blind and it's very very easy to waste energy. Inside, you will get \\*precise\\* intelligence about what you need to succeed.And I've been here ever since. Dream job.\\[0\\] unless it's literally insane or you are some major tech influencer / Techerati Twitter / library-maintaining celebrity / etc",

But the good thing is, this moment will pass. If you genuinely are interested in tech, just keep on pushing, it’ll be worth the effort. if there’s a simmer of hope to pass the test, study as hard as possible to pass it. worst case scenario, you have to retake the class but you now know everything in all future exams. As for your career in tech, you have to do side projects and internships. As long as you keep these up, you’ll be fine after graduation. Many graduates lacks experience needed to land a job, which is already over saturated. If you don’t like tech, then you should find what you want to do. since you’re only on your 3nd semester, you still have a bit of freedom to explore while you take all the prerequisite aa classes. On the side note, you should have financial aid no? You could also look for jobs in your school like desk help. you could study while getting paid. College isn’t for everyone, there’s different ways to make money. But it is an investment. Like a gym, you have to put in the work to get results you want.

The point of you writing your documentation is to get you to think about what you're doing in your homework. You're practicing structured thinking and discipline. It's helping you more than you realize.The only reason I write documentation is when I'm publishing an API. Clients rely on accurate documentation when consuming 3rd party code. The documentation is either correct - or it's COMPLETELY DEAD. If your documentation betrays the client, they'll never trust the documentation or the product ever again. You wouldn't, if it were you.Beyond that, there are design documents that describe system architecture at a high level. This is for internal consumption for my colleagues. I don't rely on my own documentation.The last layer of documentation is the source code itself. The program documents itself. Abstraction hides complexity and tells us WHAT - this is the most important; an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. The implementation tells us HOW - and we really don't care. `std::for_each` could be in terms of `for`, `while`, or `goto`, I don't give a fucking shit. Comments in the code tell us WHY, and provides context.Outside of your class requirements, you never write documentation that tells us what the code tells us. If I see: template std::span::iterator median(std::span);I don't need to be told the `median` function computes a median. I need to be told the parameters are a sorted range and the return value is within the range, because I can't express that in code. I need to know the rounding function used, as it's consequential. I don't care how the median is computed, otherwise.There are a TON of bad comments, and they should tickle your intuition that something ain't right. The problem with comments that tell me what the code tells me is who is the authority? The code or the comment? This matters when the code and the comment don't agree - which they usually don't. A comment might be a heading, telling us where we are and what the next segment does. We call those \"functions\". Break your code up. Let the compiler elide the calls and composite the function for you. It's a sign your functions are too big.Another way comments and documentation warn you of bad code is that the whole thing is bad. Getters and setters - \"Gets the thing\", and \"Sets the thing\". Bad sign. Getters and setters are not OOP, if you're busy learning that, they're an anti-pattern. It's a sign of boilerplate - which there should be none. It's redundant. You have a misunderstanding of applied software engineering, and this code can't be justified when there are equal or superior solutions.Use bad documentation as a test for code quality. It takes time and practice, and a development of a deep understanding of idioms, paradigms, patterns, and our craft. It'll take years, and you're just starting.",

My experience is yes you will learn a lot of basic programming skills. But engines will also abstract away a ton of stuff that can make the native language feel foreign. I cant remember the last time i touched std library in UE5 for instance. I think if your goal is to “learn the language” then working with an engine is not necessarily the best approach (in isolation). But it def teaches valuable skills. So mix it up and learn different things if you can.",

The reason I (for example) can read documentation now, is that I have mental models ready. Just yesterday I had to read the cods for a linear algebra crate in rust, and for a database ORM (also in rust). Reading those today feels familiar, and I can anticipate where I am going. I know most of the terms used, I have done the relevant math manually and programmed it before. Everything fits into the models I have built in my brain neatly. Comparing this to when I first started writing ray tracers at university: I just passed linear algebra, and had no pracical experience. Everytime I read an unfamiliar word, I had to go back, and refresh my memory of that specific thing. \"How does XYZ relate to ABC again?\". The more unfamiliar words, concepts and language features you have to keep in your head, the harder it will always be for you to read documentation, or to plan and write complex code. There are basically two ways to learn this stuff: Theoretical and Practical. Theoretical covers stuff like lectures, and classes, but also online courses, reading a book or a tutorial. This can help you gain information a lot faster, since it is (hopefully) well structured and presented in a proper way to learn. Practical is things like coding, but also exercises you would do for class or for a course (or in a book). This will solidify the knowledge you gained from the theoretical part. It also forms shortcuts in your brain. After you have build the third backed with APIs, you will instantly know what to do when you start your fourth. You will have a folder structure figured out, some patterns you want to use, and how to name the endpoints. This is the type of knowledge you only get by implementing the same concept repeatadly, you cannot really get this from theory alone (and people who only got this from theory alone most often have really weird, and mostly impactical, solutions to certain problems)",

How to search through the module hierarchy, where is the search function (hopefully there is one).Honestly though, a large part of how I navigate docs is knowing the type of word to search up because I've seen the concept in other libraries or languages. Then I just google it and because my wording is very specific, the right doc usually turns up if there is one at all.If not then it's back to source code. If even that fails then...

One of the greatest difficulties at being good at writing software is being able to find good documentation. Without good documentation, it is extremely difficult to write good code.Despite what many may think, one of the best things Microsoft did in their early days was to provide exceptionally good documentation. Their MSDN documentation was distributed in CD-ROM format, and it provided gigabyte levels of very accurate technical information. It was called the MSDN Library.Microsoft would pay their technical writers' large amounts of money to produce highly accurate technical documentation.Those roles are now gone, as technical documentation now comes down to reading the source code or battling through autogenerated documentation.But the lack of high-quality documentation is missed, at least by me.",

Basic script can pull from that.Basically what the script does, at a new machine. Can we linux or MacOS. I install git, pull the repo. Then the script checks if Brew or the package is there, else it installs it. From there there are a few choices ( a complete personal install, a few types of server/CLI setups. So that i can set up my machine or just some basic CLI stuff. But let’s say my own machine. It start with installing the terminal stuff from brew and importing all config files and creating the symlinks.Then if i tell it to do a full run it also downloads things like Vscode/Neovim, extensions and all other apps i have. Then the some happens for there configs. Then all my key binds and alias and preferences are there. ( on servers as well, loaded into my profile. But more basic )Then i have one main script for creating different projects and Dev environments. It basically launches with ‘newproject’ and can be started with a flag like -python. Then it offers me a few choices, if i also want CI/CS files, full test suite. If i so a complete run of a script i end up with a folder setup thats git initialized, a main.py a unit test setup and all the basic venv/pip installs i always have, a simple CI/CD file that can start on github runners etc. This script alone takes about 10 sec to complete.Full script depends a little on the download speed and machine speed of course. But a full install is under 10 minutes. And if i log onto a new server i want a few things, like Z/FZF/Tmux and more things like my aliases, this takes a few seconds and it means every server acts the same for me.You are a developer, the basics of such a script should take not much longer than setting up a Env. So make a start, iterate on it.",

Make of that what you will.They claim to have had a major upgrade in May 2020 and that should make it bang up to date. Computer science hasn't changed significantly in the last 5 years.Note that this is teaching computer science, not programming and certainly not software development. They are different fields. You could finish this whole course without knowing how to write a single line of code, but you'd know a ton about how a CPU and RAM works. The course's programming module seems to lean heavily on a book called Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) which is known as a maths-heavy academic textbook with little practical application in the industry of writing code. On the other hand you could take a software development course, learn how to build a full-stack web service and deploy it to the cloud, but still think a computer is a magic box where binary happens.You could compare it to a racing driver vs a car mechanic. It would benefit both to know how a combustion engine works, but knowing about catalytic converters doesn't make you drive faster, and knowing about racing lines doesn't help you fix cars.There's no \"wrong\" career path here, but software developers who know fuck all about CPUs are far more employable than computer scientists who can't code. If your goal is \"learning almost anything there is to learn about software and hardware development\" then your time is better spent on something other than teachyourselfcs.com.",

They don't have to be technical just any human willing to engage with you. Demo what you did and explain it, the pressure from this should force you to know the material well and the questions they ask may provoke new areas of inquiry you didn't think of. having someone ask questions also forces you to examine the things you think you know, do you really know it ? or just feel like you do.if you just need to memorize pure data for tests or things to just know you can combat the forgetting curve with spaced repetition. good luck! and try to have fun with it :)",

There are many (many, many) ways to accomplish this, so it's hard to give a good recommendation without it.I will recommend Python for the programming language, Flask for the web framework, and Waitress for the server. Python is about the simplest language to learn, Flask provides tools for building a web service in Python, and Waitress acts as a go-between to accept browser requests, turn them into calls to your program, and send the results back again. I would also recommend Flask-RESTful (I would structure the form submission as a REST API call). All of these have very good documentation.Note that as a security measure Waitress only responds to the 127.0.0.1 interface (your local-machine loopback) and cannot bind to ports under 1024, so you would usually bind to port 8000 or 8080. For local testing or demonstration this is quite sufficient; if you want to serve pages to other machines, you would usually install nginx as a reverse proxy.Your laptop very likely already has Python installed, but it is a good idea to make sure it is up to date. If you open a command-line window and run \"python -V\" it should respond with something like \"Python 3.12.3\". The current stable version is 3.14.0, and that is the one you should be running unless there is some specific reason you can't. (On Windows! On Mac or Linux, don't go monkeying with the system-provided version.)It is recommended to start by setting up a virtual environment, to prevent something you're adding from interfering with things you've already installed. You can do this by running \"python -m venv my_app\" followed by \"my_app\\Scripts\\activate\". You can now install the modules by running \"pip install Flask flask-restful waitress\" and start work.Check the Flask getting-started docs; it will walk you through writing a minimal web app. Use templates; you can probably drop most of your existing html code into template files and use it from there with minimal modification and without cluttering up your code. Check the Waitress docs; they will show you how to call your app and get it running. Try to keep everything as simple as possible until you get a minimal version up and running; you can always gild it later.Good luck! :four_leaf_clover:",

Apache tomcat, by default listens on port 8080 (for unencrypted traffic and 8443 for https if memory serves). So, if you opened up your browser and entered http://localhost:8080/mystery, then assuming your web app is called \"mystery\" you should see the index.html (or index.jsp) of your site.Now if you determine that your IP is 1.2.3.4 (it won't be, but let's assume it is) you could go to another PC and enter http://1.2.3.4:8080/mystery then you will likely get a \"host refused connection\" error. This is because the firewall on your laptop isn't allowing anything from the outside to get through - unless you set up the firewall to allow external traffic using port 8080 (or 8443 if you want https) to get through...Note, if you do open any ports, only open the one or two that you allow and when you are done close them. In fact I would open them when I needed them to be open and close them once I've done the demo from the other computer.There are plenty of other potential things you may need to take into account. For example, it will be much easier if both computers are in the same \"subnet\". If you don't know what that means, then just connect to the same wifi AP and hope that the configurations are such that they connect to the same subnet (e.g. try not to use a professors laptop and your student laptop - this is unlikely to be an issue as it is unlikely that there will be such configuration issues, but you never know for sure unless you try it and know what to look for when it doesn't work on some computers ).",

Also take some control theory courses. I know a lot of folks say that you can do software engineering without a degree - by and large that isnt the case for the type of work you want to do. I have 10 years of experience and have never worked with anyone without at least a technical undergrad degree. But that is in of itself insufficient. You also should get involved in organizations that build things. Find a Formula SAE team and write the embedded software. Build a cubesat with a team. Get involved in something tangible and multidisciplinary and demonstrate direct contributions to complex software systems.Once you have started school and have at least one concrete project outside of school you have done - message me on reddit and I can look into helping you land an internship at a company doing the kind of work you want to do.",

If the program is statically linked, it means that all the library code needed is included in the executable. Dynamically linked programs do not include the library code, they use a mapping table to connect function calls in the program to the library code. Dynamically linked bi are smaller, and multiple programs can share the same function code.Static/dynamic typing is about what variables can hold. In a statically typed language, a specific variable can only store one type of data, an integer OR a floating point OR a character string. In a dynamically typed language, the same variable can hold differ types of data, or the data in the variable can be treated as different types.Linking is about making a program binary, types are about variables and the data they hold.

When you write a program, there are typically a lot of libraries with commonplace code you're using (iostream in C++ for example). If like, 4/5 programs on your computer are using iostream, it kinda makes no sense for each program to store it individually, right? That wastes a ton of space. The solution is dynamic library files (these are \".so\", or \".dll\" files). A dynamically linked program will be compiled in such a way that when it needs access to a library, it will access the compiled library code at run-time from the library file instead of having it baked into the executable. Of course, you could just bake the library code into the executable as well. That's static linking, and it's common when you're writing a program for a system with limited space. It also means your entire program is all in one piece.As for dynamic/static typing, that's talking about the data being read. All data has \"types\". Data can be an integer, an unsigned integer, a character, a boolean value, a floating point number, a double floating point number, etc. and all of those are stored & interpreted differently by the computer - as far as it's concerned, everything's just 1s and 0s. How does your compiler know which is which? Two solutions:1) You just tell the damn computer what you want. This is static typing. If you want \"i\" to be an \"int\", you fucking call it an \"int\", end of story. It's what you do in C, C++, Java, etc..2) You take a chill pill, and have the compiler/interpreter guess with how the rest of your code uses that variable. This is called dynamic typing, and it's the standard in Python.",

        "body": "To add a little more detail, linking relates to calling methods. It’s something you barely think about while coding. You just call one, but how does that actually work? Code is also stored in memory at runtime and instructions have memory addresses (line number offsets from the start of the executable file). To call a method, you create a new stack frame for it on top of the stack, set a return pointer to hold the line you are currently on, then jump to the first line of the function you called. At the end of the function, you set a return variable in the caller’s stack frame and jump back using the return pointer. So, how do you know where to jump? If it’s a method in the same assembly, that’s easy. If it’s in another assembly, you have to determine the jump address. That’s linking. Assemblies have a table of jump addresses at their start so it’s possible to read and set these addresses. Static linkers set this at compile time and if the actual assembly used differs at runtime, interesting things can happen. Dynamic linkers use a runtime to load assemblies and will resolve these jump addresses at that point. Note that virtual methods that support polymorphism have an expanded table of jump addresses by concrete type since they can overload methods. The runtime selects the jump address based on the actual type at runtime. See v-tables for more information.Typing. All memory storage ultimately has a type. It has to since types are literally encoded differently and processed by different cpu components. You can choose to set that type yourself at compile time (statically) or let the runtime take its best guess (dynamic). The later is rarely necessary with objects in languages that support ad-hoc tuples (like js grab bag objects). With primitives or collections of primitives, it’s not a good practice. With types, you want strongly typed code that lets the compiler do as much validation for you as possible. Anything it doesn’t check can still break as an exception at runtime.",

        "body": "at a high level, there are 2 types of embedded systems. I used to work on large unmanned systems, and we used stuff like PC104 computers with serial ports. The line of code you reference in your question would be an invocation of a library function, and that library function would talk to a driver, and that driver would send voltages out the USB port that produce the required signals to tell a motor to run or an actuator to move or the like, or it might read a camera video stream or a lidar or gps output. This is not much different from coding up a laptop or something, these computers had a full operating system and mouse/keyboard/monitor support for diagnostic efforts and so on. Its 'barely' embedded, in the big picture of that world, but we made many a 'robot' (mostly, unmanned aircraft and later, watercraft) with those tools. The other level is where you do more of that hands on, sometimes actually wiring devices together yourself and sending voltages to them with some agreed upon way, often directly setting an address to a value using a C or assembly like language. I did a lot less of that, as it is slower to produce the product and a lot more weeds to get into for each individual component. For example we had one 'smart' actuator that ran code, but you had to wire it up a certain way to accept a program and then wire it up a different way to run the program installed on it automatically when it got powered on. There was extensive documentation for making that work. I would start with a simulation. keep the stuff that would be hardware isolated so you can replace it, and build a sim where you drive your robot around and have it do the things you want it to do all in just pure desktop code. Then if you want to build it, you can pick out the hardware and change out the isolated code to interface with the motors and sensors and all. We had full simulation for all our vehicles, crude but it got the job done, to test our control systems and such safely in a virtual world. Eg if your robot is going to navigate a maze, get the logic for that done in a sim, if its going to avoid obstacles, do that in the sim... get it all working best you can before a live test.",

I don't give the full pseudocode, but I'll for example walk someone through how to solve the problem manually.As an example, let's say it's insertion sort. I might demonstrate by taking a list of 5 numbers, then inserting them into a sorted list one at a time by comparing it to each position until I find the right place to put it.Even when you understand conceptually what to do, turning into correct working code can be tricky.

They don't let you write code do so anything that is already done in libraries.

This is a great point of view because building muscle memory or internalizing concepts is essential to learning higher-level concepts and practice is the only way to do it.I haven't seen it used a lot as an exercise because you need to master both solving problems using pseudo-code and turning pseudo-code into code.I think one practical challenge is if you just want to practice code and not think too much about problem solving, you could just pick easy problems to solve and work through them. Pseudo-code still means you need to understand the problem and understand how the pseudo-code solves the problem to make sense of what you're doing",

Their intent would be clearer if they'd called the function `toggleAutoPlay` too.You don't need the if statement at all if you use code like this:- let intervalId; function startAutoPlay() {   intervalId = setInterval(function () {       const playerMove = pickComputerMove();       playGame(playerMove);     }, 1000);   document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').innerHTML = 'Stop';   document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').onClick = stopAutoPlay; }; function stopAutoPlay() {   clearInterval(intervalId);   document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').innerHTML = 'Auto Play';   document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').onClick = startAutoPlay; };Instead of checking state variables and branching, you just make the click event point to the right code block in the first place, Personally I'm not a big fan of the choice to put the looping function inline either, there's a lot to be said for a few extra lines of code and the additional clarity.",

In the `else` statement, it stops autoplaying.We don't know the state of `isAutoPlaying` at the time someone calls the `autoPlay()` function. It's initialized to `false` but that will change over the course of the app running. `autoPlay()` isn't called immediately. We don't actually see *where* it's called in this code, but my bet is it's tied to a button click event. So when the app starts running, it's `false`, and then the first time `autoPlay()` is called it will call the first branch of the `if` statement and set `isAutoPlaying` to `true`. The next time it's called, `isAutoPlaying` will be `true` and run the `else` branch instead, resetting `isAutoPlaying` to `false` again.Quick edit: The statement `!isAutoPlaying` doesn't actually change the value of `isAutoPlaying`. The value doesn't change until it's explicitly set with an `=` sign. It's just flipping the value in that one `if` statement.",

JVM languages make up a large minority of languages and also have their own pretty standard interop.There are a lot of cases where sticking to the same language between apps is actively harmful - let's say you're hosting a simple web app, which will typically involve an application backend (server), an SSL termination / reverse proxy layer, and a frontend (web client). At some level you're forced to use JavaScript for the client and a C layer for SSL termination (nginx or similar).

First look at the types available in Postgres (they're very similar in all relational databases) and pick up the basics of SQL (both DDL and DML) in Postgres. Then look up database \"normalisation\", you really want your data in at least 3rd normal form (it's not that difficult). This is the main thing that will prevent future problems above all else.It's also a good idea to look at the permission model of Postgres, as you'll need an app user to connect with and you'll want to restrict that user in certain ways, e.g. the web app should never be able to drop databases, as an obvious example.Edit: It's worth noting that if your site is small you don't necessarily need to move to Postgres. SQLite will run a modest site just fine as long as your use case is fairly simple. Much easier to move now than when you have users and data though!",

For example, you could have a users table: create table users ( -- in SQLite this would be: id integer primary key autoincrement, id integer primary key generated always as identity, name text not null, favorite_color text );And then a `posts` table: create table posts ( -- these have their own ID! id integer primary key generated always as identity, -- then we link them to a user user_id integer not null references users(id), title text not null, body text not null );That way, the database engine will check that the user you're trying to reference when you insert new posts actually exists.

        "body": "Like any other programming problem: start by clearly saying *what* you're trying to do, then break that down into smaller subproblems or steps until it's approachable.It sounds like you want to identify *all* of the possible poker hands. Start with just one type of hand, e.g. a flush.What's the definition of a flush? It's a hand where all the cards are the same suit.One possible way of doing it is to say: \"a hand is a flush if: it's all hearts, OR all clubs, OR all diamonds, OR all spades\". And then write code to check each of those four conditions. This approach will work but it's a bit tedious.If you think about it for a second, then it should be obvious that \"a hand where all cards are the same suit\" is equivalent to \"a hand where all cards have the same suit as the first card.\" So you don't need to write four separate checks for the four possible suits.And so on. You can repeat this kind of analysis for each type of hand. For some of the hand types, you will need to examine multiple possibilities, e.g. for two pair, you'll need to check the different possible cards that might make up a pair. For a straight, you'll need to check whether there's a straight with aces low (5-4-3-2-A) or aces high (A-K-Q-J-10).There are many possible ways to implement this. If you're a beginner, I would suggest that you first focus on getting something that works *correctly*, even if it's ugly or verbose, and then look for ways to simplify and optimize it. And you should write lots of test cases to make sure that your code behaves as expected.",

So, how I would've done that is this - I'd create a Card class, so i don't have to store suit and value as a raw dictionary, instead i can assign those to a card's attributes through constructor, e.g.```card1 = Card(:red_heart:, \"Q\")card2 = Card(:red_heart:, \"7\")card3 = Card(:club_suit:, \"J\")```Also, I'd override comparison dunder methods in Card class, so that i can compare two cards like this:```def __eq__(self, other): if self.suit != other.suit: print(\"Can't compare cards with different suits\") else: return self.value == other.value```And \"less than\" dunder method, so i can tell if the card has higher or lower value:```def __lt__(self, other): if self.suit != other.suit: print(\"Can't compare cards with different suits\") else: return self.value < other.value```I would also wright a method to compare suits, so i can understand how cards relate to each other.And also, think about how you, as a human, identify that you have a flush, for example? You will take a look at you two cards, check their suits, ignoring their value, then you'll take a look at the table to compare those card's suits to the ones that you have on hand, and IF total amount of cards with the same suit is 5 - you have a flush! So all these hands definitions can be converted in to the functions where if all requirements are met - you've got straight, full house etc.",

I developed a digital shift planer for our logistics department (I'm a warehouse worker) to replace their old whiteboard solution. Seeing my boss with my colleague from the office who does the shift planing in front of that TV discussing the plan and drag and dropping employees via the touch screen was a moment I will never forget and where I understood I can actually build something useful with software.

When sites deploy captchas their goal is to raise the cost for scammers with bots, not to make it impossible.If the \"prize\" is valuable enough, a scammer can just pay people to solve captchas for them. Say the goal is to sign up for a new account on a social media platform. They can pay someone in a third world country $1 per account. If they can make more than $1 worth of scams per account that's a good deal.Adding a captcha slows the scammer down. Now that person they hired is solving captchas all day so it takes them 5x as long to create an account. If they only get $4 worth of scams per account before it's closed, it's no longer valuable to them.Same with AI. AI can solve captchas but it's not free. Using an API or running gpus in a data center costs scammers money. If it costs too much they'll move on to other targets.",

        "body": "It's impossible to answer the question as asked. CAPTCHA isn't one thing but a category of solutions.25 years ago we had bots that could reliably solve CAPTCHAs. That's why we made better CAPTCHAs. When the best OCR could outperform the worst human, we changed techniques. Pick the stop sign. Solve the math problem. Slide the puzzle piece. These all got defeated in their own way. It didn't remotely require \"AI\" in the buzzword context we use it today.The modern ubiquitous reCAPTCHA - owned by Google - is more focused on behavioral scoring than solving a challenge. You won't get specific details on how it works, that's by design. Security through obscurity is still important.Mimicking imprecise human input is not exactly difficult, and still doesn't require \"AI\". From what I understand reCAPTCHA is as much about browser fingerprinting, IP reputation, web history, logged in Google account and many other signals, as it is about checking if the mouse shakes while you move it. Cloudflare does something similar. These signals are relatively easy to defeat at the individual level, but harder to scale. Which is really what most websites care about - not a couple bots creating accounts, but a troll farm creating hundreds.Google constantly improves detection with machine learning. Google doesn't publish the efficacy of reCAPTCHA. They may not even have accurate figures themselves, because identifying real world bots is exactly the problem. [Independent research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12108) suggests reCAPTCHA v3 may be the most effective CAPTCHA and highly accurate. If your project requires a greater degree of confidence to prevent automated abuse, you should look at alternatives to CAPTCHA, eg. ID checks or payment details. I'm pretty sure every alternative has much more friction than CAPTCHAs, which is why they're largely still used.",

Most users have a surplus of compute available at any given moment, but that extra cost adds up quickly for bots.For example, lets use factorization as this compute. The server can take a list of prime numbers, and select 'n' random prime numbers from that list (repeats allowed), quickly compute the product and send it to the client. The client then needs to factor the product into it's prime factors and send those back to the server, which is a lot more work than computing the product.The tricky part there is finding hard enough problems to meaningfully deter bots, but not force users on potato (crappy) computers off your site.",

UNIX pros will have no trouble typing the above command, but after a few times of using it they will probably start to hate it. New users, of course, will be lost trying to type the above.Imagine your program worked like this instead: ./my_awesome_program -o my_output.txt my_input.txtIn general, that's much easier to use, for newbs and pros alike. But of course you'll have to write at minimum some code for processing the arguments (see Python's argparse, for example), and code for opening input files, opening output files, checking for errors, etc. However, such code is definitely reusable across projects, though, so once you've written it once, you can and should reuse it in many different such command-line tools, not only to prevent code rewriting, but also to enforce \"consistency\" in your CLI apps.BTW, even for programs that accept input parameters by naming files, it's a popular convention to also allow an option to read from standard input. This is particularly useful if the input the user wants to process comes from another file. Typically this option is called \"-\": ./some_other_program_that_produces_output | ./my_awesome_program -o out.txt -So in that way of calling the program, the output goes to out.txt, and the input comes from standard input (specified by the - argument for the filename), which we can see comes from some other program (but your program should not know nor care about that). Python's argparse may have an option and/or example for handling this as well (see the manual).",

Output will typically be buffered, so a dialogue between two concurrently running programs will get stuck when B is waiting for output that A hasn't flushed. There are ways around this, but in cases where you'd be tempted to go there, it's much better if you can rethink it - use as many temporary files as you need, if it helps avoid that mess.PS \"stdin\" is buffered input around the UNIX file descriptor 0; stdout for fd 1, stderr for fd 2. These file descriptors are the underlying UNIX I/O, and the shell can open and redirect other file descriptors if there's any use for them.",

Be Active: Exercise is really good for your brain and keeps you motivated. Taking up sports or going to the gym will do wonders for your emotional health, physical health and your brain.2. Do Something: On my course, there are a lot of people who do nothing outside of University. As long as you're taking up a part time job or working on side projects, you're already beating a lot of the competition. In my interview at my internship, they prioritized my soft skills and what I learned in my prior role as a Restaurant Supervisor, and it's why they took me on.Make the most of your free time at University too. You won't be at a stage in life where you have so much free time again. Go out and have fun and work on side projects, and good luck :)",

Also try to stick with 1-2 languages and really master them, its better to know 1 language inside and out vs 7 language on a surface level. I'd suggest c++ but im biased af.

The original Facebook had a PHP backend and a regular frontend. That also answers to your \"And what parts did you actually have to code? Frontend? Backend?\" part. If it would be just backend then it would be just an API. Unuable for regular everyday users. If it would be just frontend then it would be stateless and there would be no way to interact with other users. A fully functional CRUD application needed both backend and frontend even in early 2000s. Just then you had more likely no frameworks and you were using the regular language itself.The comment in that thread says it took couple months for Zuckerberk to make it. Which is realistic time for a single person team. Because you won't be just writing the backend and frontend but also deploying it, setting up a database, figuring out its hosting, do some elementary security testing, etc. A random beginner could not do it. A person had to have a knowledge in creating CRUD web application. Which would be doable for a person who had spent months in learning it (do keep in mind, writing that early Facebook took couple of months already by itself), trying out smaller projects, and then going for that bigger project. Doable for a CS Bachelor student (2nd-3rd year or such). The current Facebook for sure is not duable for beginners nor for students. It has whole separate teams working on different parts of the system.",

But the more mutable state you have the more bug-prone you inherently are and the harder it is actually parallelize your program, not to mention that people are undisciplined and leak internal state everywhere anyway…And as the video you saw points out OOP=Inheritance+Encapsulation. And inheritance is in general kinda pointless… Composition is better mechanism of abstraction and parametric polymorphism/parametric types (think of C++ templates) are way better way of code reuse, there has been at-least million PLT texts written on this topic, they aren’t that hard to find either. So that’s why in lot of people say that OOP is essentially just a method of encapsulation.Also as someone in this thread pointed out, everybody defines OOP bit differently, for what’s it worth I recently saw this definition and kinda liked it: ”compile-time hierarchy of encapsulation that matches the domain model”",

Optionally, encapsulation of the data. (access modifiers at language or design level).6. Design patterns (e.g. GoF Patterns for OOP).Those are basically the core OOP concepts. Plenty of implementation details within each (e.g. message-passing, vtables, etc.)It will be useful to look at the differences between OOP in message-passing langs (Smalltalk, Ruby, etc.) vs something like CLOS (Common LISP) vs any class-based language (Java, C#, C++, etc.) vs a prototype-based language (JS etc.) for differences in the interface presented by the language to the programmer as well as implementation.",

        "body": "Object Oriented Programming is based on an ideology, whereas Functional Programming is based on mathematical principles. I'll tell you right now that FP is consistently smaller, faster, easier to maintain, and scales better than OOP. You REALLY should focus on FP.The principles of OOP do not cause OOP, they come out of OOP as a consequence. So you can use abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance as standalone idioms, or in other paradigms - Functional Programming has all these things, too - and you can still completely miss OOP.OOP is all about message passing. It's also known as the Actor Model of computation, which you might want to read up on. There's an old tome called Theory of Objects you might want to track down and read, you might want to Google Alan Kay and Carl Hewitt. You might also benefit from dabbling in Smalltalk for a bit - Squeak is a modern implementation.---In OOP - you send messages to objects, and the objects decide ENTIRELY how to handle that message.You do not call `car.accelerate();`, you instead create a message, \"I wanna go faster\", and you pass that to the driver, and the driver decides what to do with that. MAYBE they accelerate the car, maybe they maintain a more consistent speed by moving to a less busy lane, maybe they take a shorter route, maybe they're already doing everything they can and have to ignore you.Java doesn't have a message passing interface like Smalltalk an C++ do, but you can build something - make a `Producer` and `Consumer`, both derived from `Runnable`, that share a `Message` queue. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level construct. In C++, it's standard streams.You are giving the object - the actor, autonomy and agency. You are not giving up control. You don't need to command the object what to do and when to do it; it's your object - you built it, you designed it, you've just relocated WHAT and WHEN to somewhere else in your design - when you construct the object. Want a more aggressive driver? Give it more aggressive characteristics as a part of it's construction parameters. Now when you pass it messages, you know it will drive as predictably as you have prescribed.Objects have no public interface beyond the message passing interface, maybe some necessary boilerplate per your language. You don't GET or SET anything - members are implementation details. You don't push or pull information, you can send it messages with new information, or you can submit a question or query and maybe get a response. Normally objects are constructed in terms of other objects. A car that is accelerated - you don't QUERY the car for the speed, the transmission sends a message to the speedometer, which could be a text output, it could be a widget, an analog device, a HUD...So in OOP, you assemble this graph structure of objects as your nodes and message channels as your edges. Your inputs are a source, a monitor, a motor controller, a log file... These are sinks. Things in the middle of the graph can be both sources and sinks - you can make objects that produce their own messages, consume messages, and produce other messages as a response. Perhaps a motor controller is producing heat, speed and power consumption on its own, but also responds to control inputs to speed up or slow down, and acknowledges it received the request.I dunno, use your imagination.OOP is GREAT for graph theory, which means it's great for distributed systems. Bjarne invented C++ because he wanted to build network simulators (could have just done it with a matrix - linear algebra is great for solving for networks), but its performance is quite damningly limited. It's ability to scale is also limited - you can scale your graph horizontally all you want, but eventually the size of the network becomes the most limiting factor and you can't get additional performance.You can abstract any problem into the OOP domain. That doesn't mean it's a good fit. You can make a text character an object and pass it a message asking it to capitalize itself. This is how Smalltalk works, since everything is an object. But consider the overhead... OOP, Smalltalk presumed a smart compiler, an investment in the paradigm could make the object oriented nature compile out, leaving optimal machine code behind. I don't suppose that's flawed, but it would be an investment in this unique programming paradigm. You're basically trying to get the paradigm out of the way so you can get back down to the lambda calculus formula of computation that the program should actually be.So in any of these languages, you can create User Defined Types, as classes certainly are, but that doesn't make them object oriented. Without that autonomous agency, without message passing, it's just more imperative programming, where you're taking direct, explicit control of what happens, when and where.And think about it, once you have an object that accepts messages - you have abstraction aka complexity hiding; you don't know how the object is implemented and you don't care so long as it behaves as it should in lieu of the message. You have encapsulation, which is that bundling of state and functions, aka you can build it internally in terms of stateful behavior. You have polymorphism, which is the ability to interchange any object for any other and they each decide what a message means to them. And you have inheritance, which is an implementation detail, but gives you type hierarchies for when that is sometimes useful.You weren't TRYING for any of that, but you get it for free.",

That is, if an A objects contains a B object that contains a C object that contains a D object, then BW argues that A needs to know all the dependencies of B and C and D.Except, of course, *nobody actually writes OOP this way.*In real life OOP we use dependency injection.

The front end's entire existence is built upon what your back end provides it. You will need to make available what the front end needs, which often involves knowing a decent amount about front end development. E.g. You're working with a server-rendered app and the front end suddenly needs some back end data globally available. You *could* create an endpoint and have the front end devs request the data from the back end when the JS runs. But... you just sent the page to the client, and it's a single context, right? So you could just render some JS into the page to define some global data, avoiding the unnecessary round trip, and tell front end devs they have the data already. (I'm not saying this matters per se, just an example of some knowledge of front end helping you make a back end decision. There might be reasons you *want* an endpoint instead).",

If you understand the tools that the UI has access to and the trade offs that different UI decisions have, that’s much more important than being able to center a div. I don’t care if a backend dev knows the intricacies of flex box or what browsers css-grid works in, they should know that giving the UI a huge garbled mess, and telling them to just sort and filter it all out in the UI, that’s not only a jerk thing to do, it’s MUCH slower to do almost any of that in a browser on a 5 year old phone than to just do it on the server (could also be a vulnerability based on what it is).As another person said however: if you do have to make a change in the UI, you should know what you’re doing, within reason. If you don’t know what you’re doing, you may screw things up and make the other devs mad at you and please don’t do that. You’re supposed to be a team. If you need help, always ask. If your team isn’t helpful (for any reason other than lack of expertise), they aren’t a very good team.",

Nobody knows everything, but many pretend they do, even beginners, beware of gurus and savants, do not compare yourself to them, because you would be comparing yourself to an illusion.Now how to choose, when to dive deep, when to stop, when to not dive at all. I cannot answer that for you. But I can tell you my solution. Focus on projects.I always had this problem, but it never shows up when I have time pressure from a client. When there is time pressure and the main goal is not to learn, it is to get the project done, then I magically start to prioritize things properly.I have side projects with no time pressure, usually they get nowhere, but I do not expect them to.If I am working by myself for myself, I have to create time pressure and reinforce it all the time, or else I get into study loops or refactoring loops or planning loops.My suggestion to you is to not direct your learning toward interviews, at least not as the main focus. Interviews are abstractions, they are meant to assess knowledge, but they are very flawed.If you focus on knowledge that helps you build actual software projects, that is useful, and nothing in the world can ever make that not useful.If you optimize for interviews and the interview landscape changes, then you have wasted your time.",

Set a timer for that period of time, like 30min. When it stops, you stop. Add to that initial list of things you planned to research later.You won't memorize everything (and don't need to), and often times simply going through the main material, only learning enough to continue on with said material, will help you build a foundation to reinforce the rabbit holes you'd be digging through later. If you start with the rabbit hole first, then you may wind up with collapsed tunnels as you have nothing to tether that knowledge to. That'll result in digging those same tunnels later, wasting your time.Do just enough to build a basic mental model of the theory and your material. Only focus deeper when you need to.**If you need a different perspective:**Beginners in art require a lot of quantity to produce quality, and as they get more reps, the more quality becomes important. Starting with only one painting that they focus all their quality on often stunts their progress compared to those who've done a healthy mix of both. You're focusing way too much on quality. Lean more towards quantity for now.Programming is solving problems by building solutions, like a trade. You need to build a lot of projects to get better at programming so you have something to tether theory to. Learn what you need to build those projects and occasionally a step beyond, and that experience will reinforce the times you dig deeper.You *can* focus a lot on theory to make *learning how to build projects* a smoother process, but theory isn't the thing that makes you a programmer. Just like how knowing the properties of a hammer, how to make sandpaper, and different types of trees doesn't make a carpenter learn how to build a house, memorizing every definition, theory, syntax, etc, isn't going to be the thing that makes you learn how to build a program.You actually only need very basic theory to start building programs, just like a carpenter can start building incredible things with a hammer, nails, wood, and a saw. Keep to your priorities, as you'll likely be hired as a programmer, not a computer scientist. With that said, **chase the fun**.I actually enjoy digging into things and learning theory/CS concepts, so I like to mainly do that with little bits of project-building sprinkled in. That's severely limiting the speed of my growth as a programmer, but it's what keeps me interested in programming in the first place. It sounds like you're the opposite of me as you're getting overwhelmed, so chase what's fun for you.",

Just keep doing what you're doing and maybe add some practice material but things that will challenge you. Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python by Al Sweigart is an excellent choice as well as sites such as Exercism, and lastly you can simply ask an AI to give you some projects to do.

A good exercise is to build a calculator application following PEMDAS rules. Start with just addition and subtraction. If you get an input of X + Y or X - Y, calculate that. Then add in multiplication and division, and associated priorities. How would you handle A + B * C vs. A * B + C? How would PEMDAS work for these cases, and how can you implement the rules so that PEMDAS works? And so on until you have all of the various levels of PEMDAS.",

Most beginners get stuck because they jump from syntax straight into “real projects” without actually learning how to think through problems yet.What helped me early on was treating it like leveling in a game. First, get comfortable solving tiny problems on your own, not with speed, just with clarity. Things like loops, conditions, arrays, and functions should feel boring before you move on. Once that foundation stops feeling heavy, start recreating small tools you already understand: a calculator, a todo list, a simple CLI game, anything where the logic is familiar. That’s where your brain starts connecting the dots between “writing code” and “building something.”LeetCode and the competitive stuff makes more sense *after* you’ve built a handful of small projects and can reason through the steps of a problem without panicking. And choosing what to build becomes easier once you’ve stumbled through a few mini-projects and noticed what feels fun to you vs. what frustrates you.You're not behind....you’re just at the stage where the real learning starts. Keep the momentum and focus on understanding, not rushing. The speed comes later.",

Or, use a content management system like Wordpress, which is free; you only pay for the web host (which you'd pay for anyway). Something like that makes it easy to update and edit the content without changing any code. There are thousands of free templates and plug-ins that let you make pretty nice looking sites with Wordpress, or you can customize it yourself with HTML and CSS without writing the whole thing from scratch, or even hire someone to build your template but edit the content yourself.Now if you find it fun to build the HTML by yourself that's great!

Always an element of awkward timing with things like this. Maybe the external service should be idempotent so that it can be notified again without causing issue. If we don't control that, then depending on how we know that the external service has been notified (e.g. response, webhook etc.) we could enqueue the state update then, which retries until it succeeds. Or we could hold open and append to a write-ahead log which is usually very fast, then reconcile later. All sorts of possibilities.I haven't seen the setup of course, but my thinking was that the previous (Received?) state + presence of a state update task in the job queue (which can only happen on receipt of confirmation of notification from the external service) is enough info not to re-send the notification, else the state change has succeeded so you wouldn't anyway. A separate flag or an extra state could be used too. Definitely no need for \"sub\" states (within states).",

They don't care.One way would be to review their code and to ask questions about their code. Try to understand. Get them to react. As long as you keep a positive learning attitude, this shouldn't be a problem.Let's mention the \"good code\" part. What is good code? Code that works? Code that achieve high quality? Medium quality? Where do we draw the line here? The threshold is set by the reviewer/company. This is an idea. For some good code is just what works. For other there needs to be tests. For others it requires maintainability.We have a bunch of best practices and guidelines to follow to help you do better code (solid, dry, kiss, DDD, hexa/clean...). A lot of opinions on what works and what don't. And knowing what fits or not is generally a matter of experience more than knowledge.Now, if people at your company are not helping you in any way, I doubt you can think of yourself as an intern (whatever the title). An intern must be managed and led by someone. So if you ask questions and don't get answers, get ignored and such... You are solo. So make the most for yourself.",

I'm not saying you should start practicing calculation in chess, I'm just saying that this is trainable, so it will come over time. > My workaround is to comment the hell out of everything, for example \"// 'r' now contains a pointer to 'rects_' from rect_packer which has x, y, h, w, etc. data\" because even though it's so obvious at the time when I come back to it in a couple hours or a couple days I have to click through all the files again just to re-understand what is doing what. You should have better variable name then. The variable, function and method names should ideally be clear enough that you can read the code and understand what it does, what each thing contains. > To hopefully improve this ability I'm working on the Trachtenberg method and doing 3x3 digit multiplication which seriously over clocks my mental CPU but I can manage, however I'm not sure if there is something better I can do to improve the \"concurrent logic buffer\" size in my head. I don't know this method nor its goal. But if you are doing it just for the reasons mentioned in this topic, it's a waste of time imo. - Be more dilligent with your variable names and code structure. Do not hesitate to break down things into smaller functions that you reuse (one benefit of a very small function is that you can wrap a few lines of code into a single function call. That function name can then be explicit about what that part does, making the whole code more readable). - Things will come with practice. Don't think of yourself as unable, or dumb, or whatever. It will come, just keep practicing and learning and doing, make your own life easy when you can (for example, good variable names, again, is a way to make your life easy).

The number of keywords and the total amount of syntax is smaller than most languages, so even compared to pure JavaScript running outside of any environment, JavaScript has twice as much syntax.But my guess is that you're not comparing apples to apples. When you say you look up documentation for JavaScript, are you talking about looking up DOM APIs like addEventListener, querySelectorAll, and so on? None of those are actually part of JavaScript, they're part of the web platform which has tens of thousands of JavaScript APIs. Or if you're on the backend then you've got the thousands of APIs in Node.js, Express.js, and whatever else you're using on the server side.So if your JS code is using the web platform or Node.js but your C program is \"pure C\" that just reads and writes files, for example, then it's not a fair comparison.I'll bet that if you write C code for a Linux kernel driver, or a GTK+ or Win32 GUI application, for example, you'd look up documentation just as much as when you write JavaScript.",

        "body": "Depends. Why do you need em synchronized? What are you actually doing?Regardless, the answer's likely one of Mutex locks or Semaphores. In either case, you're going to have to have threads wait on each other to catch up before continuing.As for what \"synchronizing threads\" means, it means what it does on the tin. Threads don't run at consistent speeds, and they run independently of eachother. This means when you run two threads, the order they finish in can vary at run time, which can be bad if one relies on the result of the other to do its job. This can also result in two threads using the same resource at the same time, even when they shouldn't - imagine two people being able to book the same seat at a movie theatre because they both clicked \"book\" at the same time.To synchronize threads, you give them a way to communicate, and that's where Mutexes & Semephores come in.Mutexes are a shared resource that can either be \"locked\" or \"unlocked\" at any given time. If you wanna use it, you have to lock it so no one else can use it. You also have to unlock it before moving on lest you fuck everyone up.Semephores meanwhile are kind of like hall passes, where mutliple threads can use the semephore at the same time, up to a threshhold; useful less for strict ordering, and more making sure multiple types of thread (ones that involve heavy processing for example) aren't running at the same time, gumming everything up to a standstill.",

I'm not sure what you mean with the words your using, but the simplest approach would be to just figure out how many milliseconds between requests you have, line up a list of requests you want to make, and then every x milliseconds fire off the next request in a separate thread that does whatever your wanting to do with any given request.If you are making too many requests for your side of things to handle, double x until it isn't overloading your side. Then lower it by half of the increase until it is a problem. EG, the current value of X is 16 and it works. The last value was 8. Make x (16+8)/2=12. Now its too fast so make x (12+16)/2=14. Then repeat that process, bisecting up and down until you reach equilibrium.",

And secondly it was far to passive for my taste. I learn far quicker by hacking on stuff and referencing docs than I do listening to someone talk.But then I was already pretty experienced at that point, and I could filter out the stuff that I already knew from other languages and frameworks while focusing on what was new to me. If \"everything\" was new then I could imagine videos would be more helpful.Also everyone is different so I guess my only real advice is throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.",

Now here are some tasks to expand on that original thing, that require essentially “remixing” the skills and information provided, we won’t tell you how to do it, but everything you need to solve it is there.”That gets you into the “zone of proximal development” and that’s how humans learn.",

Healthcare workers specifically (have many nurses in my family) think tech work is cushy because of the high pay and ability to work from home. Because they’re usually working with patients, working with a computer sounds much “easier”. And to a certain extent it is, I never want to be hands-on to save someone’s life, fuuuuck that. Also, hospital office politics tend to be really bad. In our industry, sometimes people move up or away and take their shitty behavior/patterns with them. In healthcare, that shit is set in stone. People stay a long time and power structures rarely change. However, they don’t understand how competitive and mercenary-like our industry is. Annual industry-wide layoffs for no reason at all. Offshoring. Widespread age discrimination. PIP and up-or-out culture. Immense pressure to show impact or be cut. Ridiculous multi-round leetcode hiring process. Constantly learning or else the industry will leave you behind. So our working conditions are relatively more relaxed, our industry is the complete opposite. We have 0 job security. Don’t get me wrong, I am happy I choose this career. I make good money and work from home so no one will cry for me. But it’s a mistake for anyone to think this is easy money.",

You’ve only been out of the game for two months, stop being so hard on yourself. I *highly* doubt your knowledge is outdated.Yes we’re in an economic downturn and you might not find your dream job in this market. But plenty of companies, across all industries, are still in need of quality devs.And don’t overlook the small/mid-size local businesses, there’s WAY less competition and they’d kill for your skillset. Less pressure to perform means you can just chill there & upskill until a more exciting opportunity arises.You don’t have to follow any those recs, find whatever path suits you. But you absolutely need to stop ruminating in this AI/cloud bubble and start applying. The real world still exists behind all the hype.",

Learning a little bit of cloud and DevOps wouldn’t hurt either, it’s pretty expected these days. So learn the basis of Azure, AWS, or GCP to the standard that a dev is expected to. You don’t need to go super into the weeds, but get an understanding of CICD Pipelines, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.This is pretty much the bare minimum knowledge for devs with a few years experience nowadays at least for web devs.Do that then study some system design methods (neetcode has videos for it as well as leetcode) and a few DSA questions. Don’t go too overboard on it though like many here will, if you aren’t trying to crack Big Tech, a good chunk of companies don’t even ask leetcode.From there just apply and hope for the best, the market is as good as it was 3-4 years ago.Edit:Biggest thing is probably to not ask this sub for advice, it’s full of unemployed people, students, and sky is falling doomers that can’t see what their weaknesses are",

I'm not saying this to kick you while you're down, I'm just trying to give you realistic expectations. You may need to fallback on some low skill jobs just to pay the bills, and build up your tech skills on the side so that you can emerge in a better position once the market rebounds. Pick what sector and tech you want to work in, and go forward with that. Don't spend a lot of time second guessing your choice, just make sure it's not something niche.",

These passionate individuals make something so good that it becomes a household name 3. Business people start to take notice of this things popularity and insert themselves into these companies4. They begin profit maxxing and cost cutting5. Around this time, the veterans from step 2 start to get pushed out or move on 6. Business people squeeze the last dollar out of the product and everyone just kinda hates it now. It’s stale7. Business people get frustrated as they can’t make money. They leave. 8. Thing falls back into relative obscurity for some time9. Go back to step 1Example: Pixar. Bunch of people make a 3d animated film, first of its kind. Then business starts inserting itself and the movies quality begins to get worse (after around wall-e I’d say). Right now animation in general is on the upswing and I think we’ll see more good American animation soon",

Well everyone learned so now what. I do think the field will stabilize eventually and feel more like engineering. You don't wake up one day and become any type of engineer. Maybe some specialist engineers make a ton of money but the majority make a fairly middle class amount of money. As others have pointed out the biggest issue right now is in the US and perhaps some other well to do countries where everything is expensive software engineers want to be upper middle class if not straight upper class compensation. But their job is also incredibly easy to have done anywhere else in the world and the rest of the world now has reasonably talented programmers unlike a few years ago where there was a significant skill gap in most cases. As such why would you ever pay someone 160k or something like that, when you could pay 15/hr instead? Its basic math. Do I think US based SEs will start having to be paid 15/hr? No. But I do think they will have to meet people in the middle somewhere.",

        "body": "Most AI performance measurements are not credible, and growth in that sector is not sustainable because of the costs of the underlying infrastructure. Neural networks don't scale very well, and the explosion in their usage from 2010 onwards was basically only enabled by improvements to GPU hardware.Those improvements have plateau'd, both due to shortages of silicon, and due to how little headroom there is to make hardware breakthroughs at the moment. We've basically hit the point of diminishing returns for the everyday consumer and for business use of LLMs and GPT systems.With that in mind, I can't predict the future, but for the time being, LLMs and GPT systems are *a convenient excuse* for the layoffs required in the post-COVID recession conditions. Businesses don't like to scare their shareholders and stakeholders by saying \"the market sucks and we shrunk\", so they spin it as \"we adopted AI, so the 40% reduction in forces is actually 40% efficiency!!!\" LLMs and GPT systems also took off right when crypto startups needed an exit plan and a way to unload *thousands* of GPUs.So you'll need to prepare to job-hunt in a very large recession, and the AI / ML sector is currently experiencing a hype bubble. Obviously, some of that hype is totally valid -- they are fantastic at classification problems that don't have formalized training sets. But, a lot of the hype is business people and end users not quite understanding the shell game going on. And there's plenty of grifting because people think they'll be able to sell their \"bottle imp\" before it's too late. LLMs and GPT systems will remain, and they're *really* cool. But not $10B+/year cool, and in 10 years it's **astounding that they are no closer to AGI than when they began promising it \"next year\"**.As a new grad, you'll need to keep yourself sharp until you get your first role in the industry. And when you do, **have a backup plan because juniors are the first staff to be laid off when money gets tight**. Don't be too proud to find part-time jobs to pay the bills for the year or two finding CS jobs can take in a competitive market.",

There really hasn't been anything new in the software world (outside of Gen AI) in quite a while, and what has been done before is quickly becoming so saturated, that there's not a whole lot of reason to make more of it. Software has eaten the world, but it turns out the world was not as big of a meal as what was once thought.For example, you see posts like \"wow Gemini 3 can make a threejs game!\" or \"look at this fancy UI GPT-5 made!\" and they are for sure impressive if you are completely unaware of how commonplace it is for people to make stuff like that since well before generative AI took off.Look at [Deepmind's game examples](https://www.youtube.com/@googledeepmind/playables) on Youtube, you have:1. A very basic dungeon crawler in threejs2. A starfox-like3. A subway surfer clone with a pirate theme4. Astroids5. A space invaders cloneAll of which are impressive if you've never made them and have no clue how to, but none of which are new or innovative. People have no new ideas and AI is exacerbating that issue because if it has been done before, eventually an AI can be trained on the output and imitate it.",

Everything from customer service, network engineer, QA and even a director. Here are a few nuggets I REALLY hope everyone listens too. They are nuggets I learned from a lifetime of being in tech and it applies no matter what is going on in the world....- Be flexible, willing to adapt and always find enjoyment in learning and don't get attached to any tech, job, title, company- There is no such thing as a secure job, title, or company no matter the state of the world. Downturns just are more in your face about it. - Nothing is permanent. Have a great job? Cool. Enjoy it. It can go away tomorrow. Unemployed? I am so sorry. It sucks. Just keep working on your skills and applying to everything. - Luck is a major factor in literally everything. You could be the best specialist in your field and can't find work. You could not tie your shoes and make $500k a year. Just focus on what is with in your control and not how the dice lands when you roll it. I suppose the other thing is be careful with online reading. Specially this sub. I love it here but also realize negativity and doom get the play here and in the media.

Hell, I was.But remember, graduating with a CS degree equips you with a tool belt that goes much further than just being able to write some JavaScript. Unfortunately we can’t all be on here posting about how our big name company is giving us 225k a year or whatever. BUT! You are definitely still employable.To my new grads out here losing hope: the outlook may be discouraging but the tough people outlast tough times. There is a lot of crazy stuff happening in the world right now that unfortunately does affect the current parameters of your situation, but these are temporary circumstances. Remember, your degree is literally based on problem solving.My last suggestion is to open your horizons a bit, which I’m sure you’ve done already. There are a lot of companies that aren’t specifically the “big names” we see here, but are big names in their own industry. This is also how you find some neat niches to grow your specialities in. Right now, you should be open to anything. You just want your foot in the door— any door. Except for doors with red flags. Always run from those. GIS is a really cool industry that never gets talked about on the main stage. Do with that information what you will.NEVER GIVE UP!",

Never mind I worked at private no name non-tech companies in non-tech cities. So it's not like recruiter sees my resume and the company sticks out as anything other then never heard of this place.I like working on physical device, but the companies that need / want what is essentially a generalist C and C++ SWEs are few and far between. I can't even find new companies to apply to most days at this point. Many companies want C or C++ with something else and the unfortunate part is when don't have that something else another candidate will. People say look and apply to companies everywhere, but I cannot just up and move to Idaho for a job. The family would never go for it. So I either need a remote job, a local one, or we are relocating to specific areas of the USA. Granted tech hubs like NorCal is on the list of approved relocation spots, it's still not easy to even get interviews at this point. I have no issues with RTO either as I'm more than happy to go in to the office every day. Some days I would prefer it to just get out of the house.

The people who were older than that did not have kids or did not have a spouse (or, had spouses who were in demanding industries). I saw 2 cases where people left 3 months prior, or 3 months after the birth of their child.I think a lot of people try to make as much money as they can from 22-32 and then downshift. They shift to either remote jobs or more 'chill' industries like traditional banking, defense, or they start to do their own independent thing. Some do leave tech in its entirety when they see those 'stable' tech jobs aren't paying much more than less intellectually demanding roles.I do think there's some disparity in fairness compared to previous years. 10 years ago, someone at 33 with a kid on the way could have gotten a remote arrangement from their current company.

I'm not saying don't get it in something technical but consider that. Remember SWE is ultimately a tool used in every industry and domain and having a degree in said domain can quite literally be the thing that helps you stand out in a pool of resumes depending on the job.

But I understand that’s not even the TC so it’s not really a 1:1 but is there a way to know the min I would be offered without actually seeing the offer?It depends on what you're trying to maximize for. You can absolutely just say \"I won't accept less than $160k\" and filter out opportunities this way... the downside is if they actually were willing to pay $200k you might have unwittingly lowballed yourself (after all, if you're happy with 160, they can just offer you that or a bit more). But the upside is you don't waste your time if they're actually only willing to pay $120k. Revealing nothing on your end first lets you maximize the possible offer but at the cost of maybe wasting your time.If the range is big you could also ask something like \"what's the difference between a $130k candidate and a $200k candidate?\" Usually if it's that big it has something to do with leveling.",

A reasonable starting expectation is that someone who fits the job description at an average level should get 145k.Take a step back and look at your resume compared to the job description. Do you think you're 10% better than what the job description is asking for? Maybe the JD asks for 3 yoe and you have 4. Maybe the JD says \"remote anywhere in the US\" and you live in San Francisco so you would expect to earn above average. Maybe you worked at FAANG and the job posting is at a smaller company that won't get a lot of FAANG applicants. In this case, sure, expecting to earn above 145k is totally reasonable.",

There is lost time people could be doing real work. Online assessments cost money. They have no real reason to give anyone benefit of the doubt, especially when they have tons of candidates. You have to remember there is an imperfect human being on the other end.

Even if you are there for 2 years without a raise. But then you should be looking to leave that company for something else again. Choose this if you think the specific project they are doing will be really good experience to get you the next role in 2 years. Don't worry about being a job hopper, all a recruiter/hiring manager needs to hear is \"I'm looking for a company to settle at long term\" to clear that up.Option 2 sounds good if you have enough knowledge and experience to handle that environment, or don't mind attempting to learn it. If the tech side of the company is just starting that also presumably means they will hire other engineers soon-ish too? And of course consider if you think this work experieence would be better for a potential next future role after this (even if its 5+ years later). Would you mind sharing the company name in DM?",

They can't tell what's impressive and what isn't, so they default to assuming it's all entry-level. Mention the most advanced courses, but cut things like \"Computer Science I/II\". A short list of courses that sound more impressive is better.The skills section needs serious trimming. That LeetCode level notation doesn't mean anything to most hiring managers. It's not an industry standard, and honestly it reads like you're trying too hard to quantify something that your GitHub and projects should already demonstrate. Same with the soft skills list. Saying you have \"time management\" is meaningless when you could just show it by describing how you delivered a complex medical AI tool with proper NLP pipelines and error detection.Your language list is creating a credibility problem. Eleven languages including VB and Prolog makes it look like you've dabbled in everything but mastered nothing. Recruiters know that's not realistic for someone graduating in 2026. You'd be better off splitting this into \"proficient\" (languages you've used in substantial projects) and \"familiar\" (things you've learned but haven't built much with). Don't bother listing languages where you're only familar that are unlikely to be relevant for the types of jobs you're pursuing to keep the length reasonable. That honesty will make you look more competent.The Task Scheduler project is actively hurting you. Your first two projects demonstrate real engineering thinking; then you list a project whose features are \"arrays, scanners, and conditional statements.\" That's literally week-three CS101 material. Removing it entirely would strengthen your resume by raising the average quality of what you're showing.Your game project description has a weird gap. You did a great job explaining the design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy), which shows architectural thinking, but you completely forgot to mention what you built it in. Unity with C#? Unreal with C++? Custom engine? The tech stack matters way more to a hiring manager than knowing it was inspired by backrooms-style horror games.More generally, every bullet point should pass this test: would a junior developer find this impressive, or would they think \"yeah, that's just normal programming\"? If it's the latter, cut it. Your resume should show the ceiling of what you can do, not document every step of your learning process. You'll have a bit more empty space, but that's better than getting mentally downgraded for a bad relevant to irrelevant ratio or preventing the reader's eye from catching the important parts in the 10ish seconds they're going to skim it.",

I made it to the final round of a position at bytedance but ended up getting rejected, and otherwise had limited success applying to MLE jobs in tech. Background is about 2 years of \"applied\" Data Science experience (worked at an investment firm that didn't have a very developed ML pipeline so they had a research team creating the models and an applied team that deployed them) + an economics degree from uchicago. Anyway from my perspective it seems really hard and some companies just straight up expect their applicants to have published research. Best chance for more normal applicants seems to be in less competitive industries like healthcare.You should be trying really hard to get a job anywhere though. It's easier to switch to a more ML focused role internally if you get hired for something else than it is to get hired for that role off the bat.",

This would include, notably, numerical linear algebra, which underpins all statistical and machine-learning oriented algorithms.2. Optimization algorithms, in which you study how to find the minimum solution to some equation and/or constraints by using calculus. Would be useful in any industrial engineering-type software.3. Classical Big-O notation, which describes growth rates as a function of input size. Useful for understanding whether your algorithms are prohibitively expensive when scaled up.4. Simulation of physical motion or physical behaviors, as used in computer graphics and visualization, scientific computing, signal processing and other similar physics-oriented domains.In summary, I would say that calculus does indeed play a foundational role in the study of many core CS algorithmic domains. Note that these algorithmic domains don't necessarily have a lot of overlap with the kind of work you might do in industry, unless you're working on cutting edge stuff. But nonetheless if we're strictly talking about computer science as an academic subject, then absolutely yes calculus plays a role.However, if you're talking about very specific techniques in calculus like how to compute certain integrals by various substitutions or other random stuff like that, then no, those skills are mostly ways for students to exercise their quantitative and mental reasoning while learning the concepts.",

For the technical it was hinted to me by the interviewer I did the best at that point out of all candidates.- There was limited info on levels.fyi for this company but I was able see that some people at my YOE did get offers similar to the amount I was asking for within the last year.

        "body": "Projects aren't worthless, but they won't get you very far in an interview unless they are fairly robust. Little basic couple-of-weeks projects are not impressive. A year-long endeavor that has real potential is a different story, though.Nobody is going to look at your project before they have decided to interview you, so it's not a particularly valuable tool for getting interviews. Once you're getting interviewed, it will be relevant in that it allows you to talk through some of the decisions you made while building it, but if you already have past projects that you can use for that, then the value in building new ones is diminished significantly.All interviews are a bit different, though, so there's certainly bound to be some companies where it is more relevant than others. It's good to build projects, but most of the value comes from keeping your mind and your skills fresh. The project itself isn't so meaningful.I'm also just a dude who works in software. I've not exactly done research on this stuff. I'm just extrapolating based on my experience as an interviewer and interviewee.",

Had I lost my job in Canada, I wouldn't be under any additional pressure to move. I would have unemployment. I'd have healthcare. I'd have family.I understand the feeling of reaching a glass ceiling but I've realized that so long as you work for someone else you'll always have to tamper your expectations.

        "body": "TLDR: Don’t move for less than 300-400k, Consider moving within Canada first. Canadian SWE (6 yoe) current living and working in NYC. From my opinion, it’s only really worth it if you can make significantly high salary, such that you can buy your way out of American problems. This is significantly harder for someone with a family, as your expenses will be higher and you will be impacted by more specific issues than someone who is single (Schools, Health care costs, etc). Even in a lower cost region like Baltimore, I wouldn’t move for anything less than 100-300% salary increase over your Canadian salary. If you’re really committed to this - Don’t focus on the L1-B visa, Consider TN. Apply externally to jobs in cities with tech hubs (SF, NYC, Seattle). With your YOE you should be able to get some decent high paying jobs (200k-400k). These should pay enough for you to support your family with 1 income; so even if your spouse can’t secure a visa, it’s still manageable. - Plan for potential private school expenses. Public education varies based on where you live, so either plan on paying more rent in a high income area or paying for private. - Plan for a short stay. Both L1B and TN are employer tied. So you WILL (not maybe) eventually find yourself having to come back to canada quickly if your employment ends. - The tech market is tough right now, but from what I’ve seen it’s still pretty competitive for senior level roles. Tbh, Consider moving within Canada. There are definitely senior level jobs in Canada that pay way more than 100k, you may just have to move to Toronto or Vancouver. Also, 100k CAD seems low for senior even for Canada.",

What matters more is being comfortable with the tools, understanding the concepts, and having a few solid projects that prove you can actually do the work.The market is rough right now, so having something structured behind your transition can make a difference. I’m doing a master’s in a tech field for that reason. It’s not required, but it helps add credibility when you’re coming from a non-technical major.Self-learning absolutely isn’t a waste of time.

Once, it even removed a test case unrelated to my feature. Still, they’re incredible for understanding a codebase—like a supercharged Stack Overflow.

The iPhone in 2007 was a hardware revolution—suddenly everyone had a computer in their pocket, spawning entire industries. AI is different: it’s a software paradigm layered onto what we already have.The job market won’t “recover” to old norms. This is the new normal: pruning human labor.

Now they're stuck (often with a pile of tech debt) because they never built the experience needed to move forward without the model holding their hand.Anyone who's actually built software knows that the last 10 percent of a project can take just as long to build as the first 90 percent of it. By outsourcing all the thinking to an LLM, especially without understanding the code being written, you're setting yourself up for failure when the model inevitably hits its limits.

Today I still frequently get into these spots. The difference between me back then and now is I communicate much better and know how to learn. Delays? You know beforehand and you call them out when you see them coming. Giving stakeholders a heads up is good. No heads up when people are counting on you is really bad.In general though it sounds like you just need to spend some time so be sure to get AI to summarize docs for you and help you with coding as well. This will limit the number of surprises but surprises always happen. If you never hit surprises then the scope of your work isn’t big enough for you and you’re ready for more challenging work. Not communicating changes in assumptions and no requirements that were found would be a problem but people will give some leeway to new developments that were discovered. Prod issues? Everyone makes these mistakes. I caused one a few months back and even the most senior members of my team have done this too. Again if you haven’t done this then you haven’t worked enough or the scope of your work is too little. It happens to everyone. For these take charge and learn from them. Everyone makes these mistakes and can learn from them. I’m a manager turned IC again and I can say this: you want a good relationship with your manager too so play the political game. The manager is generally on your side because if you do well so does the manager. A lot of these issues can be communicated with the manager to help unblock you. Can’t give estimates right away? Yeah no one really can unless they’re super familiar with the subject matter. When your work becomes more ambiguous as your level goes up these can be more difficult. What I do is I give a large estimate (adding to my current estimate) or tell the people involved when I can provide an estimate and why I can’t I do it now.",

Don't feel too down about things. I started very similarly to you, doing QA automation at a large bank even though my role was officially Software Engineer. I built out the QA testing framework for cloud infra in my spare time, and the cloud infrastructure team liked it enough to take me in after a few months. I did that for a few years before hopping now to a backend role at a fintech. As long as you're building code and interview prepping, you just need a bit of luck and some years of experience under your belt, and enough code work to talk about in interviews.",

Or they'll write some stupid fragile DSL that will be destroying productivity on the team years after they leave. This sort of thing leads to security issues on the internet on a daily basis.I've been doing a personal project with [boost::spirit::x3](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/latest/libs/spirit/doc/x3/html/index.html) to automate generation of cereal serialization functions, python and emscripten APIs for C++ code and once you get over the gratuitous operator overloading abuse common in many boost libraries, it's really nice to use. So at least on C/C++ projects, there really is no excuse to reach for a regex when you could rattle off a small and well-tested parser instead.emscripten is pretty nifty too.

It may not seem like I was sending out a ton of apps, but I decided to not use A.I. and I also live in Oklahoma (not really a bastion of opportunities with regards to tech).When I finally gave up, I started looking elsewhere and I quickly I landed a job in finance working on mortgages. It obviously isn't my dream job, but I took enough mathematics classes that they figured I was worth the risk and could learn finance efficiently. My pay isn't terrible eitherYou can always pivot. I know a few other computer science grads that pivoted to finance when they realized finding a tech job was going to be nearly impossible in their area.",

To be honest the toughest CS class is trivial compared to even an easy medical school class and you get into the tough ones like immunology and it's an entire semester of WTF. The important part. Don't go into medicine for money. It pays well but not everyone is cut out for it. I know I wasn't and it took me a couple summers doing cardiology research work decades ago to understand it. If you can, try to job shadow a medical professional to see what it really is all about. In the USA it's pretty much obligatory. I assume your country has a 6 year medical school straight from high school? Most countries in Europe are like that. There's also 4 years graduate entry medicine in some countries (Ireland, Poland i think, etc). Regardless best of luck!",

The business stance is that code doesn't have to be pretty, code has to get the job done. And a working project that looks like shit now is pretty much always worth much more than a promised project in the future whose only differentiating feature is that it \"looks better\", \"will be more maintainable\" or \"doesn't carry the same technical debt\" (Spoiler alert, it will carry about the same technical debt.)Want to improve your designs without introducing [YAGNI](https://wiki.c2.com/?YouArentGonnaNeedIt) violations? I've found that [test driven development](https://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment) or at the very least development where you write a method or two in your classes (assuming you're an OO shop) and then write some tests to test them will highlight deficiencies in your design without you designing a bunch of extra stuff you're never going to need. If you find yourself with some down time, you can also go back and write tests for older code if it's possible to do so. A lot of the time older code is heavily coupled and can't really be used outside its existing context, so it can be difficult to do that.Identifying pain points to fix when you have some refactoring time can also be helpful. You can often clean up a bit around code you're working on without it taking too much more time and without impacting a huge amount of the code base. Incrementally improving quality of the code is a lot easier to pitch to management than throwing the entire code base out and starting from scratch. That's another thing that junior level programmers often want to do, generally before they've even had a chance to understand the code base as a whole.",

AI has slightly compounded those feelings.I have a good feeling I'll make it through and land an amazing job somewhere that I'll love and grow in but right now being unemployed kind of sucks. I think it's pretty typical for developers to go through layoffs as the field moves pretty quickly and developers need down time to brush up on their skills and stay current but I just can't find the motivation to do that at the moment. I've been in that six month employment window where you're still being judged by management and your colleagues. If you go into a role burnt out you're not going to make a good impression, in all likelyhood you're probably just going through some type of burnout.Id try as best as you can to get plenty of sleep and go outside for walks, maybe some more rigorous exercise like biking or hiking if you can. Stay away from technology for a few weeks or maybe months and then come back to it with some fresh perspectives.This is also why managing your money well as a developer is so important because you never know when you'll need to rely on your savings, it's just a very common thing to be laid off in this profession.

He didn't seem to buy that and asked me why he'd trust my code over an AI's code. That left me speechless and not particularly amused.The whole career just feels hollow now. A few months back I started getting my excitement back and working on some old projects, but now I'm firmly back in the \"eeehhhhhh\" phase. It's just a soul-sucking situation in my opinion.",

But you certainly wouldn’t be the first to leave that for the upside and growth of startups.- what’s your current NW- how much are you leaving on the table - what’s the realistic 1, 3, 5 year state of your startup prospects- do some self reflection, is this a work thing or a personal thing, get to the core of what you’re missing in your life if you can. It could be as simple as you love your work better at startups or maybe it’s just a grass is greener situation. Only you can figure that out - Best advice, talk to those in your network on both sides of the coin for perspective. At the end of the day though if you’re ok with the money part of this and you feel this is your path at this time, it’s certainly a reasonable choice.But if you want the “odds” version of this, yes, on paper staying at fanng will probably be better for your net worth long term.Also then again the industry is in such a shift who knows how effective traditional wisdom is going forward 10 years on this .

After accepting the offer, I brought up this dilemma with the hiring manager. He would wait a few weeks if he had to, but of course, he emphasized that he needed me ASAP. Ultimately, I decided I had to look forward and accepted the start date before the bonus payout. My previous employer did end up paying a decent bonus that I missed out on.I've been at this job for two years now, and in my opinion, there was no actual rush where a few weeks would have mattered, but as soon as I mentioned it to the hiring manager, I realized that it was now a test of my commitment to the new job.

Maybe that's not a crime, but it felt unprofessional and rushed.Were the calls important?It's a sign of disrespect for your time and life. Nobody calls about business after hours - not without an appointment, or unless something urgent has come up. (There is an argument to be made that not everyone would want to be called at work about their application, but if I'm reading this right you're too young for that?)The question you should ask yourself is this: If this is when they are on the clock, what will they expect me to do?>They originally said there would be three stages: verbal English, technical interview, and then a written English test at the office. I only completed the first two, and they skipped the final step and moved me forward anyway.Your English seems fine; they might have legitimately decided that if your spoken English was as good as it was, that your written English would be up to par.I find it far more worrying that 2/3 of the process are focusing on something that should be mostly irrelevant.>I started as *Software Engineer*. Then later they said I might be placed into front-end. Then they said they do front-end, DevOps, software engineering, etc. and **they** will decide which department I'm going into. They literally told me **\"you have no choice\".**That's fair, I suppose. The company has open positions to fill, they decide where they want you to be. You are free to accept or to walk away. Not nearly every company is like google, where they need so many people that there can be a degree of choice, and an entire matching process.And it is not uncommon, especially at the beginning of a career, that they will see strengths and weaknesses in you that might not align with what you imagine yourself doing.But rejecting an offer is a perfectly fine choice.>4. **The salary dropped mid-process.**That is outright terrible.Especially if they are not certain of the role they are going to offer you.>They keep mentioning 5-month training period, but they haven't explained what exactly it includes, how it works, or what kind of guarantee (if any) there is afterward.And this is where it starts to sound like a scam to me.If they don't have a precise role, how can they have a training program?>6. **They want my passport, social card, and bank account details before showing a contract.**I don't know where you're from, and what is usual there. Nobody in what is widely considered \"the western world\" would think that is normal or acceptable. This is where I would start to run for the nearest exist - but maybe you live in some dystopian hell hole where this is what employers do. You have my sympathies.>Everything combined makes me unsure whether this is normal or a big red flag.Big red flag. I just can't tell if it says bad things about your country, or just this company. Ask someone local to you.",

We didn't care that much about crypto experience because most of the roles we had were more or less standard full stack web dev. Crypto knowledge was a plus, but not needed, and other factors were more important (the usual \"demonstrating ownership\", being good at a coding interview, getting along with the team).You shouldn't put something 12 years old at the top of your resume, but I think you should find some space to include it towards the bottom. It's good to show you're interested in the field, and might get you past some automatic keyword screening steps, but unless you got a lot of traction on it (GitHub stars or such) recruiters are going to be much more interested in more recent experience.",
