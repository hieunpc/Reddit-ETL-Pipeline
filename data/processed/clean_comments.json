Often I would concede to a different design, and after some time the team would arrive at what dimensional modelling advises. E.g they wanted to mix detailed data with aggregated snapshots in one table. I did not wantnto argue. I said \"well Kimball advises against this because its trouble\" and let them build it. After some time they split the fact tables into transaction and aggregate.It is not Kimball's ideas in the book, but experience of a wide industry practicioners over years of working with data. Now we have the cloud and storage is less limited. Our mental capacity still is limited, so it is easier to reason about facts and dimensions in separation, rather than a 100-column big table....and what about many to many?",

Since people are going to suspect LLMs anyway, I used one to try to reorganize it.I would probably add some testing too.---# Data Engineering Pipeline Checklist## 1. Requirements First- **SLA**: How fresh? (minutes/hours/daily) Daily reporting → no streaming needed- **Impact**: Cost of being late/wrong?- **Consumer**: Dashboards, ML, reporting?## 2. Architecture**Single source of truth**: One storage layer (warehouse/lakehouse/object storage). Everything reads from it.**Batch over streaming**: Streaming adds complexity (ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills). Default to batch unless real-time is essential.**Design for backfills**: Parameterized date ranges, versioned transforms, separate raw/modeled layers.## 3. Reliability**Idempotency**: Jobs must be safely rerunnable via partitioned outputs, overwrite-by-partition/merge strategies, deterministic keys.**Orchestration**: Use Airflow/Dagster/Prefect for retries, dependencies, visibility, parameterized runs. Avoid \"cron spaghetti.\"## 4. Observability**Minimum to prevent silent failures**:- Row counts/volume checks- Freshness checks- Schema drift alerts- Job duration tracking## 5. Performance**Optimize last**. Most slowness comes from bad joins, file layout, or moving too much data—not lack of Spark.**Fix basics first**: Partitioning, columnar formats, filter pushdown, avoid cartesian joins.## 6. Simplicity Rule**If your SLA is met with**: scheduler + Python/SQL + storage + basic checks**Then distributed systems add unnecessary complexity.****Use distributed systems when**:- Volume exceeds single-machine capacity (hundreds GB–TBs)- True real-time requirements (sub-minute)- Complex streaming aggregations- Multiple concurrent consumers need isolation",

Something lighter like Liftbridge (Kafka semantics, single Go binary, no JVM/ZooKeeper) or just NATS JetStream covers 90% of cases.On the storage side - totally agree on \"one source of truth, columnar, object storage.\" We're building Arc with exactly this mindset: DuckDB for compute, Parquet for storage, S3-compatible backend. No distributed cluster to babysit, SQL interface, handles GB-to-TB scale without the Spark tax.The line I use: if I can run the query on a single node in acceptable time, I don't need a distributed system.

For the first three months or so, while building the team, everything was smooth. But after that, I started feeling more or less the same way you described. When you’re the decision-maker, from system design to the nitty-gritty details, you’re also the one who gets blamed when things don’t work out. At one point, I even felt that juniors were contributing more than me because I was stuck in a loop of wrong decisions. But that’s okay. We are engineers, and we are supposed to try, fail, and learn until something works out. It can feel overwhelming to be your own north star at the beginning. I hope you start figuring things out soon. During my own period of doubt, my CTO once told me, “I’m happy that you’re demotivated. It shows you’re serious about your work, and when things don’t work out, you feel disappointed. That’s a great engineer trait.” So you do have a great engineer trait.

I’m certain that you’ve encountered that situation.This is why I generally caution younger engineers to avoid startups; it’s intriguing to potentially build everything from the ground up, and the money sounds great, but it’s just not a good fit for anyone who hasn’t done that architecture and design work in a more controller environment before.",

This is why we do proof of concept work - to try and gain significant confidence architecture/design will work before building it \"properly\".For what it's worth, being a solo DE is way harder than being a senior. Seniors traditionally work under tech/DE leads, and often with architects. Whether your title reflects it or not, you are actually doing the job of a **lead** DE.And of course, being solo, blame never spreads - it's all you. Teams I've been on as a senior have definitely fucked up, but nobody could blame me because I had very little decision-making power (just over my own lil' design pieces really). Any big decisions were not my responsibility, so any big failures weren't my responsibility.I'm quite happy being a senior indefinitely.",

Use draw.io or something like that to draw your architecture, and share that with your team before building it and review it to see if it is foolproof. Then go build your application to that architecture. Things will fall into place, and you’ll have a documented trail of why you made decisions. And for streaming itself, just use Spark structured streaming. And if you need to do a backfill have a classic Spark job set up for it. But put these things into a design doc before you even write one line of code, and you can review that design doc with your leadership or other engineers",

The newer tools are genuinely interesting, and AI is opening up some cool possibilities. Business folks need someone to make sense of the data chaos, and it’s pretty satisfying to be the one who stitches it together into something useful.I’ve been director-level for about 15 years and managed to stay pretty hands-on until recently. Even now, I try to keep up so I can actually lead effectively, and I’ll jump at any excuse to write some code just to stay sharp (and maybe flex a bit for the team!).If you’re losing passion, I’d seriously look at changing projects or orgs before bailing on the field. A good team and leadership that encourage experimentation and improvement make a huge difference. It’s still a solid career, and one underrated perk is that data folks tend to be closer to business goals and strategy than pure app devs. That context keeps things interesting, at least for me and if you can find a good company to work for.",

Regarding what I'm seeing, getting a lot of attention lately is the Data + AI stack, and specifically context engineering (e.g. ontologies). Two main choke points for AI deployments are 1) information retrieval, and 2) context management across complex tasks. Back in January 2025 was when I was first hearing about ontologies and context engineering at conferences, and now in December 2025 I'm seeing a lot more articles and thought pieces on this. What typically follows are enterprise POCs where vendors will get first signal of adoption before you start seeing case studies that drive further adoption (if it shows success).So I argue 2026 we are going to see a huge emphasis on data modeling for AI, specifically for unstructured JSON data and vector databases.",

Never delete from the database, use a flag for soft deletion instead and adjust your pipelines to account for it.

Protobufs are solid for data contracts. platform work is also really good experienceimo id lean toward offer 3. having a team means you can actually learn and grow instead of just firefighting all day. aws + python is the most transferable stack and platform engineering is a good direction. the solo DE thing in offers 1 and 2 sounds like a burnout speedrun tbhDatabricks is cool but not worth being the only DE on a team at 2.5 YOE.

If you want to grow fast and learn good patterns, I’d lean to Offer 3: AWS, protobufs, and two senior DEs is a really nice combo. If your heart is still with Offer 1 for stability, take it, but keep doing small Python projects on the side so you don’t drift too far into Scala-only land.",

We would not accept anything into our pipeline that failed the tests.The vendor knew of any issues immediately without one of our team members having to be online to qa.To implement, we basically kept track of what we expected the schema and checked the file against those expectations. If that passed, we loaded the data into Duckdb, ran our dbt source layer testing, then parsed the dbt results into something they could work with.

Once in a table, you use SQL syntax to parse the good data and flag the bad, to send back to the origin what was rejected and thus not loaded.Please test with a column called FirstName and put this inside: GREYBUSH,'\\\\Then see what happens. It made Snowpipe (python language) go KaBoooooom as the backslash is the escape character. It the Snowflake file format with a bunch of options, nuke the escape character so that there are none.Currently in Snowflake we have File Formats with a unique name for every vendor + every entity we receive.That dog cartoon \"What a mess?\" yup.Why we load as a blob? The biz units **DemandeD ThatT We Do PartiaL LoaD**, not to reject the entire file, if there are any bad lines. Like a carriage return + linefeed inside a column, text columns not wrapped in double quotes when they should be, a comma instead of a period for Decimal columns (French format), dates that are not YYYY-MM-DD, again, Europe/Quebec versus English North America. I get DD-MM-YYYY in these files, UTF-8, and French accents. It all works.So if you load in a \"binary\" way you maintain whatever UTF-8 or Iso6500 the file was sent as, and parsing is easy with sub-selects on every column. I run the biz rule analyzer first, and only for IsValidData=1 do we import. Then we use DB\\_SendMail function to the appropriate biz unit of the invalid data.Honestly, the code quality of SaaS and input forms have taken a serious nose dive since 2020's. What happens when you use the lowest bidder to build your SaaS system.HTH",

You may even be able (depending on situation) not even have to travel to work most days.Pay may not be great in your country, but I'm willing to bet you can get away with not having to ruthlessly budget ... and you should slowly but steadily be building up a big enough pension to see you through decades of retirement.To be clear: this is perhaps the cushiest situation to have existed for someone subsisting on their own labour (rather than pre-existing capital) in human history.Not trying to be harsh here - I want to give you this perspective because I think it will ultimately help you.Get-rich-quick schemes are a pipe-dream: startups can be done, but you'll have to work far, far harder than you are right now, with less than 50% odds of success even under ideal circumstances ... and often for far longer than you may expect (I've worked in two successful startups that remained unprofitable for _a decade_, running off fresh rounds of investment until scale made the economics work).",

How is it not for so many people? What the hell do your employers demand of you? If I do \"overtime\" (lol fool me, I'm on a salary, but I can swing it as take a few hours off another day) it's because I have some weird compulsion to do so: something playing on my mind, something I want to progress or finish off; or some training/learning/research. Sometimes I'll feel a bit behind, or making up time for going in a bit \"leisurely\" in the morning.I enjoy the work I do - most the time - the tech is cool to use, I'm loyal to my employer to an extent (they've been fair, decent, and flexible) but I'm not particularly interested in the actual business or industry. Or the goal. Basically help the owners/shareholders/whatevers make more money? Cool, man... very fulfilling.OP, are you more entrepreneurial , do you want to work for yourself more than some company? I don't have first-hand context of that, but I can't imagine it would be easy, or even highly compensating - at first, at least. It's not me, but if that's you, more power to you!Is it the DE angle you've lost interest in specifically? And because the lag in landing a job, your interest simply waned? What is it you actually enjoy? Creating, problem solving, fixing or improving something? If you don't go out to work for yourself right away, is it realistic to keep looking for something else that fits better?Edit: Unless there's some radical shift in society and economy, we work because we need the money. Since I spend 40 hours of life a week doing it, I may as enjoy it enough. Find something you'll enjoy doing.",

The job is to solve problems and achieve real-world objectives. Sometimes to do that we have to consider other constraints on the problem space, such as:- \"this technology is inferior, but it's battle tested and has loads of technical support staff backing it; we can't afford the risk of a new system going down and having no way to fix it\"- \"this technology is old, and therefore I can easily hire people who already know it, and there is a lot of documentation; the new one is great on paper but we need experienced staff to maintain it, and they are hard to find\"- \"this new technology is better than what we currently have in terms of technical performance, but we've rigged up enough custom ameliorations around the existing core tech that we will realise hardly any real world gains from switching\"- \"we would benefit from switching technologies in a measurable way, saving £50,000 per year, but it would take this entire team six months of work to move all our legacy code onto it. They have other, more pressing priorities and the benefit doesn't outweigh the cost of hiring a team of contractors to do it.\"But let's say you think there's a big pool of potential adopters for whom SQLMesh II would make business sense. It's not so easy to take a slightly superior technology and turn that into a going concern. dbt has mass adoption.Are you personally planning to fork SQLMesh and spend a substantial chunk of your time maintaining it, if Fivetran strip the original for parts? Perhaps you will fund this via a hosted version - will you be picking up the phone to pitch it to companies yourself, or will you use your own money to pay someone to do that?What will you do if Fivetran freak out as soon as you get traction and throw a bunch of engineers at making dbt good enough to kill your competitive advantage? Unlike SQLMesh-original-flavour, you don't have proprietary code; Fivetran have access to the same stuff plus a lot more resources.Remember, you _only_ get acquired if it makes business sense to them to spend the money on buying you out ... instead of on using their own engineering team to outcompete you. If that happens it's very good news for analytics engineering, but _terrible_ news for you as a founder. Typical outcome: nothing happens. The incumbent has no motivation to improve, and would-be founders have no ability to realise the gains for themselves, so do nothing to change this.",

If you force them to parse nested JSON or do aggregations on arrays inside Redshift, query performance will tank and they will hate the awkward syntax.I would suggest fix the data and not the warehouse. Stop loading raw json into Redshift. You can probably try integrate.io and put it in front of Redshift. This means you connect the source APIs/logs and flatten the json arrays in flight. The data lands in Redshift as standard optimized columns instead of SUPER blobs.This should fix your issue.",

Note that through the majority of the history of data warehouses the principal platforms were general purpose databases like db2, oracle and sql server. In fact there's very few features in say snowflake that you can't find in the general purpose databases.A few considerations: * It all depends on your total data volume, the data volume your queries will be scanning, the number of queries, etc, etc, etc. * But a 10-20 TB data warehouse using Postgres can work absolutely fine. * Partitioning is critical * Summary/aggregate tables may be critical if you want really fast queries for dashboards, etc. I like to monitor my use of these like one would monitor buffer space / caches for transactional databases - and try to get 95+% of my queries to hit them. * Certain queries will benefit from the use of indexes. This can provide a significant edge to performance. * Configuring your database to support query parallelism is also critical at volume. * Database constraints are just as important in OLAP as they are in OLTP - and postgres can provide a ton of value here! You may need to turn them off on massive fact tables, but you can also use them at least with summary & dimension tables. * AWS RDS has pretty slow IO, but other hosting options can provide blisteringly-fast servers. But you may need to have postgres dba skills. * All the above assumes vanilla postgres. Adding extensions for duckdb, columnar storage (hydra), etc can provide faster performance in many cases.FYI: I migrated part of my snowflake reporting to postgres on RDS a few years ago in order to save a bunch of money. IIRC it was about $20k/month saved AND my queries were much faster. So, while I would not propose that a single node Postgres instance will always outperform a distributed database, there are absolutely scenarios in which it will.",

The main point of the duckdb extension is to attach to external tables in a lakehouse. Like read/write iceberg tables in s3. This allows you to query data across your lakehouse and Postgres db. BUT if your Postgres tables are getting bigger duckdb extension will not improve the query performance as the Postgres DB will be the bottleneck. If your data volumes are low 1000s of rows vs millions or billions of rows you can get away with Postgres.If you plan on high data volumes you can use duckdb to aggregate Postgres data with a datalake in s3 and then use ducklake or duckdb to query it.So no pg_duckdb doesn’t turn your Postgres DB into a data warehouse.",

If it was any other tool we would be scratching our heads and thinking there is something wrong with our pipeline itself.But with HVR's realtime metrics we were able to see which table was causing this issue and know the exact volume of that table.

Asking someone to “go faster” without fixing deployment order issues, data gaps, or validation rules is not actionable feedback. It is just pressure.If anything, the fact that you are documenting discrepancies, rebuilding inherited messes, and validating edge cases suggests you are doing the job correctly, not slowly. The risk is that you are absorbing systemic chaos personally instead of it being acknowledged as a team or org issue. That is not sustainable long term, and it is reasonable to say that out loud.",

As this will change the comments, based on your constraints.DuckDB for olap processing, easy install on a Linux-VM, only heard great things about it. Microsoft has the free SQL Server Express for OLTP - perfect for staging area - 10 gig limit per database - so have a DB per source and ingest, you'll have 2 cpu peformance and decent ram usage (16g I think, check Microsoft's web page).So what's nice with SQL Server Express is it plays nice with your AD and talks easily to other MSSQL systems, so you can avoid flat files when flat files don't make sense.If you want history of all changes, without the hassle of CDC, flat files on a massive file share dedicated for this, you basically emulate a datalake. If this file share system is Linux, there's probably Datalake compatible open-source you can use so you can do SELECT directly on the CSV/Json/XML flat files, just like a real cloud datalake. But I haven't done it - I'm sure someone here has.In any case, Google Big Query and even Azure Datalake are not expensive. Probably on-par with dedicated hardware costs internally adding a 4TB mirrored fileshare system, when costed and budgeted over 36 months.It depends on CAPEX versus OPEX, your boss should know this. Internal hardware adds inventory, and small companies can rent-to-buy-back over 36 months, even DELL offers this for hardware.",

Use pgvector to do vector inside Postgres.Or use ClickHouse instead which also fills those roles. Fast enough you can just do the transforms in the database, supports vectors, has an in-process engine called chDB if you need it which also doubles as a data science data frame lib.People always default to wanting a big bag of tools, but it just makes it more expensive. Most of the time, a database works just fine until you actually need to go wider.",

The article explains these well. Key concept here is loading only what you need to, making it useful in situations where the amount of data is very large and/or compute is a concern.A key thing to understand would be is\\_icremental(), which is a function which will return True if the model it is being applied in *already exists* in the warehouse (and is also an incremental model which is not running in full-refresh)That means anything wrapped within is\\_incremental() won’t be applied the first time you run a model, or when you fully refresh it.This is what you use to compare existing records in your target with your source so you only load the new and/or updated records, depending on your strategy.You can also flip that and use NOT is\\_incremental(), meaning that what you wrap it around will only run the first time the model is built (or on full refreshes). That could for example be if you have some old stale data that you need to union with on the first run, but then never need to look at again, except for the case of a full refresh.EDIT: For some clarity, heres an example of an incremental model from dbt docs.If this model has never been run before, or needs to be fully refreshed (reloaded) then `{% if is_incremental() %}` will evaluate to false, meaning that the SQL it wraps wont be sent to the warehouse. That makes sense, since `{{ this }}` will be rendered as the incremental models name. Hard to do a select from something that doesnt exist yet right? We need to compare event\\_time in source with what we have loaded before, which we cant do if we've never loaded it.Once we've loaded data for the first time, the if statement will evaluate to true, meaning the WHERE clause gets put into effect. Then the models SQL will return results using that filtering, and that's what ends up getting inserted into the target table in your DWH. {{ config( materialized='incremental' ) }} select *, my_slow_function(my_column) from {{ ref('app_data_events') }} {% if is_incremental() %} -- this filter will only be applied on an incremental run -- (uses >= to include records whose timestamp occurred since the last run of this model) -- (If event_time is NULL or the table is truncated, the condition will always be true and load all records) where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} ) {% endif %}",

For high water mark incremental processing you want to drive off of the timestamp representing the moment the record was written in your data warehouse/lakehouse/dbt. You do not want to rely on the application timestamp or the timestamp generated by your source system for incremental processing. For the purposes of this conversation, let’s assume `table_a` and `table_b` both represent this in a column named `dbt_updated_ts`.Another concern is persisting these timestamps in your target model. You will need to decide on `table_a.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_a_dbt_updated_ts` and `table_b.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_b_dbt_updated_ts` or doing something like `least(table_a.dbt_updated_ts, table_b.dbt_updated_ts) as source_dbt_updated_ts`. Regardless of the decision, you should *also* re-state a `dbt_updated_ts` for downstream consumers of your model. They should *not* look at your various source timestamps for incremental processing, only your new `dbt_updated_ts`And this is where the rub comes in. Now you have 2 sources with 2 different timestamps and you need to process them incrementally. A comprehensive way of doing this would be to take all the keys above the high water mark in source a and union with the keys above the high water mark in source b, union the keys together, then use that to scan both tables again to make sure you catch all the changes. Generally this is computationally expensive, although it should give the correct answer.If you are doing this to create something like a SCD type-2 dimension it gets more complicated on top of this, as you will now need to deal with the temporal aspects of your source system as well.I would warn you of this: if someone says add a lookback window, that is usually to cover some architectural sin. This should be questioned.It’s complicated and often computationally expensive to process multiple upstreams in an incremental fashion. Do not forget the maintenance cost: next month you will have an engineer who thinks they are clever and will mess with this logic and it may be ok for most cases but not certain edge cases. KISS. If you can, just materialize any model with multiple upstreams as `table` and save yourself the headache. Again, single-model HWM incremental is perfectly fine, it’s when you attempt to incremental more than one model at once where you will find pain.",

        "body": "Depends on what you mean.If you're joining/unioning/selecting from other up stream incremental models, you don't really need to think about how they are materialized. At least I can't think of a scenario where you would need to consider that. I could also be completely wrong here, not something I've really given any thought.If you mean in the context of joins/unions within the same model, you still only really have to think about where and when you apply the is\\_incremental() macro. To use the above example again (but expanded a bit), say we have some old stale data that we need to load, e.g. from some old source system, and then we're adding data from the new system on top. We still keep the same fields and everything.In this example, the first time we run the model, the first incremental macro will return false, because the model deosnt exist in our target dwh yet. The second macro will return true, since the target table doesnt exist yet. So then we will run the main query, and then union in the old data.On every subsequent run, the first macro will return true, and the second one false. So on all future runs, we will be filtering data from the new system, and disregarding the old one entirely, since no new data is being generated there.So we wrap SQL we want to compile and send to the warehouse depending on the context in which the model is running. In practice I've only used this to wrap a WHERE (most common), CTE's or UNIONs. You can also include multiple wrapped statements as below, for example we might apply an incremental macro inside our CTE's in order to make the model more performant. I find it hard to imagine a scenario where you would wrap it around a join. {{     config(         materialized='incremental'     ) }} select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from {{ ref('app_data_events_from_new_system') }} {% if is_incremental() %}     where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} ) {% endif %} {% if not is_incremental() %}     union     select         customer_id,         period,         total_sales     from  {{ ref('app_data_events_from_old_system') }} {% endif %}This means that the compiled SQL will look like one of these 2 (excluding all of the DML that dbt builds in order to actually insert the data into the target table): -- FIRST RUN RESULTS IN select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system     union     select         customer_id,         period,         total_sales     from  old_db.old_schema.app_data_events_from_old_system -- SUBSEQUENT RUNS RESULT IN select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from target_db.target_schema.target_table_with_app_data_from_both_source_systems)",

This means all of the incrementals they've built involving multiple tables are impossible to reproduce from scratch because those incremental tables are not being updated correctly. Had an entire database in a previous company where they would have to regularly refresh all of the datasets because of this and it would sometimes crash in the process. Absolute mess.For me, because I have the skillsets to do so, I pretty much prefer to stay away from any sort of incremental involving multiple tables and use table materializations like you mention unless I 1) really need it and 2) can implement it in a more generic way rather than a custom incremental model. More generic being something like a custom materialization or macro. For example, we have an incremental materialization that checks counts of the source query vs the incremental table by the incremental timestamp to load deltas. This makes the actual SQL in the DBT model involve no incremental logic and makes the DBT model robust to source data that sometimes updates some historical data instead of only inserting new data. If this scenario had been implemented as a basic DBT append-only incremental model (which it was before it got refactored), then the data would not match reporting from the source system.The example I gave speaks to another problem that goes beyond what you bring up (engineer that thinks they're being smart). There's also the problem that often times engineers will develop something with some assumption for how it's going to work in their mind. \"Oh, well we should only get new data for this process every day.\" This is only sometimes true. I've worked at multiple companies and every company has had at least a couple of processes you might expect to work that way but don't for business or engineering reasons. For example, if you have a DBT model that involves updates from multiple tables, what happens if table A is updated later than table B? Then on the next run, you may have to update your incremental on late-arriving data from table A + historical data from table B, which leads to historical updates in your table. Of course, there's other ways to implement these things, but by no means trivial in my experience.",

Anything that involves replication, multiple server coordination, especially a server that’s far away, etc etc is going to push you out of 15ms range. I’m pretty sure you can’t even publish a record to Kafka and consume it back in that kind of time if the Kafka cluster has standard replication a and lives in a data center a hundred miles away.Given what little you’ve shared, I might suggest getting a beefy machine, loading all the data into memory, and using something low level in Rust like [differential dataflow](https://timelydataflow.github.io/differential-dataflow/) or [DBSP](https://docs.rs/dbsp/latest/dbsp/).I don’t see how you break 15ms end to end latency using conventional stream processing tools.",

Even though they are some differences and additional features the price tag is not low. I think $100 / user / month. If you want to leverage all the additional feature like job scheduling, catalog, semantic layer etc it might be worth it as you don’t have to setup infrastructure for those.

If you have bespoke code, maybe look at a load framework like DLT. Is the framework any better, or do you like having more control over the process?Save your raw data to a more modern file format with proper data types (e.g. Parquet, AVRO) - do you need to do any transformation on the source data to make it fit? Are there any unexpected issues with the data that you have to handle?Load your data into a local database, either directly from source or from your raw files. Then you can start running proper SQL queries against your data and get some practice with querying databases in general. DuckDB comes to mind, it's powerful and lightweight with good support across many languages.Do some transformations on the data - consider cleansing data quality issues, perhaps normalising the structure, or transforming it into a better shape for Data Science modelling. You could do this with some bespoke code, or look into transformation tools like dbt or SQLMesh.Build some visualisations of the data to build more of a story around the data than just raw values.In each case, try out multiple tools. If you're using Pandas, consider trying Polars or Ibis, or leveraging DuckDB's APIs. What do you like about each one? What do you dislike? Even if you're achieving the same goals with each, its good to get a feel for the differences in each tool and form your own opinion.",

This is mostly done with dag selection methods too and not actually looking at the graph as unpronounceable mentioned.When responding, it makes it so much easier to handle comms and prioritization when you know what teams or services will be impacted, but definitely depends on how expensive outages are for your team. Second big thing that comes to mind is with respect to performance and cost. Mostly just looking for single dags with a ton of downstream dependencies (limits parallelization), and tables that are joined over and over again instead of materializing out the join. dbt project evaluator has great docs on this and is worth a read regardless if you implement it.",

        "body": "This ended up being longer than I expected. Hopefully you find this useful. There's actually a lot to your question.When it comes to designing a mart, I keep the \"analyst\" persona in mind as much as possible. This is my north star, even if I don't have analysts. Querying a star should be simple, not something full of odd case logic, analytic queries, coalesces, and the deep SQL knowledge. Save that for your transformations leading up to the star if needed.Regarding keys specifically, there are several goals I have when designing a mart. From the perspective of the \"analyst\" persona querynig the star:1. Joins (dims to facts) should be done with `INNER JOIN` not `OUTER JOIN` - this is for performance and for usability2. No records should be dropped via join - this is a quality issue, you should not be dropping revenue on the floor because your users dimension is incomplete or late for example3. Join conditions should be singular (e.g. no `AND` in join clause) in nature - this is again for performance and usabilityThe ideal query would look something like this: SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name FROM fct_sales AS f INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d ON f.customer_sk = d.customer_sk GROUP BY d.customer_nameThese goals need to be addressed in concert. To do so, you really need a lookup process instead of a hashing strategy.In order to address 1 and 2, you really need to have placeholder records in your dimension for \"unknown\", \"missing\" or \"not applicable\" customers, and your fact table creation needs to use these values as appropriate. You cannot hash your way out of this problem; you need to process your dimension (or at least your dimension lookup) first, and then process your facts. Generally this is done with a lookup table. For item 3 in isolation of 1 and 2, if your dimension is SCD type-1 from a single system then using the source system natural key seems reasonable. Once you have multiple source systems (say, customers from 2 systems) then the natural progression is to either add a `source_system` column and make sure everyone remembers to join on that as well (hint: they won't) or to concatenate your source system with the natural key. This concatenation leaves you with a string key instead of an integer key which now negatively impacts query performance.If your dimension is SCD type-2, it's worse. You are left with something looking like this, which is not obvious to analysts, performs poorly, and is error prone: SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name FROM fct_sales AS f INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d ON f.customer_nk = d.customer_nk AND f.transaction_ts BETWEEN d.begin_effective_ts AND d.end_effective_ts GROUP BY d.customer_name Usability note: Is it `BETWEEN` or did you do the right thing and make your `end_effective_ts` the same moment as the next `begin_effective_ts`? I can almost guarantee your analysts will either use `BETWEEN` or worse they won't consider the effective dates at all and `DISTINCT` the result set to get what they want. Honestly, it's doubtful that future engineers will remember which way you went with effective dates either. All the more reason to address this in your transformation while building the mart instead of leaving it to the mart consumers to remember.To achieve goal 3 with SCD type-2, you want to put a SK on the fact that represents the state of the dimension at a point in time (probably the moment of transaction). To do this you will also need a lookup, as you cannot hash your way out of this either.At this point it should be clear that lookups are the way to go. So the real question is why would you want a hash instead of an integer? To me, the answer is now obvious: integers take next to zero compute to calculate, will join more efficiently, have half a chance at clustering in a meaningful way, and are immune to collision.TL;DR integer lookups",

The exact DQ checks you need to implement depends on your use case, but the ones that you’re listed - will be already a huge step forward if you have none now. For the love of God don’t event try to build your own DQ framework, so many teams make this mistake. Instead use some of the already available open-source solutions, some of them are very very good. Testing is also very important part of pipelines, which are unfortunately neglected by most of the DE teams. It will make sure that your commit editing “pipeline A”, won’t alter the logic of “pipeline B”. End-to-end Testing is the best thing you can do for your Data Architecture. Create a small sample input dataset, dozen of rows usually is enough. Create expected output dataset. Run pipeline on using sample input as source and compare your actual output with expected output. Do it on every merge to main branch. Very simple, straightforward but gives you a lot of confidence in you data pipelines. It requires some simple CI/CD pipeline and probably separate env to run the tests but data quality always comes with a price, like all good things in this life :)",

IMO it’s an extremely hard problem to solve if you want to get beyond basic questions like how much did client x spend in q4 or whatever.I think the approach you are describing is probably as isolated and secure as you could possibly need to get, and may not be flexible enough to provide real business value. But it depends on what sort of questions you want the agent to answer. If you want agents to do things actual human analysts are currently doing, I think allowing the ai to explore the schema and basically do multi turn “deep research” with access to a large portion of the warehouse plus a semantic layer explaining tables and data relationships is probably going to be needed. My current opinion is that if I was going to something as isolated and controlled as what you are describing I might as well just build a dashboard with those curated views available.",

We’re not trying to recreate a human analyst doing open-ended exploration (yet). We’re aiming for safe, repeatable workflows first.. the stuff that’s painful today because it’s frequent + operational (support, RevOps, CSM, finance ops), not really deep research or exploration. 2. Dashboards are great when questions are known and stable. Agents get interesting when the question is variable but still bounded, e.g. “why did churn risk spike for these 20 accounts?”, “summarize anomalies by segment”, “draft an escalation note with the relevant context,” etc. The way we're thinking is that these sandboxed, curated views/tools are guardrails - the agent still does the synthesis + narrative + next-step suggestions.3. We’re also treating schema exploration as a separate (higher risk) capability. I agree that to do real analyst work, you probably need: semantic layer + table relationships + multi-turn exploration. But letting an LLM roam your warehouse is also where we foresee getting: cost blowups, accidental joins into sensitive tables, hallucination and more. One more reason we’re starting constrained: **repeatability.** For some of the agent tasks we're aiming for, it’s almost mandatory for teams to yield the same answer for the same/similar questions (or at least the same underlying definition/query) every time. So our plan for now is: **start constrained → earn trust → expand surface area (curated views + sandboxing allows us to do that)** ideally with a semantic layer + policy checks as the expansion path. If you tried doing this in prod: how are you handling this tradeoff? Do you allow wide read access and rely on RLS/RBAC + logging, or do you gate it behind a semantic model / query planner / allowlists?",

Those are the level of questions i was thinking of when I mentioned needing schema exploration and multi turn deep research.The only approach I'm using in 'prod' is stuff that heavily depends on a human in the loop. What I've experimented more with is snowflake's 'cortex' ecosystem which allows you to do RBAC on curated views with semantic layers. It's still in the data warehouse environment but the agents can only access those curated views. What I found with this though was that I couldn't answer questions on the level of what you are describing very well, which is why I think if it's ever gonna work a much more flexible approach is needed.",

        "body": "Yeah I’ll stick with CST extraction, but I think there’s still a risk of partial UTC partitions past midnight.Example: I run a 2-day rolling extraction on Jan 5 (CST), which pulls Jan 3–4 CST, midnight to midnight. A record from Jan 3 19:00 CST converts to Jan 4 01:00 UTC, so it’s now in the Jan 4 UTC partition within target table.The next day, extracting Jan 4–5 CST overwrites Jan 4 & 5 UTC partitions. Record X isn’t in staging (CST is Jan 3), so it gets lost.As I’m typing this though, I’m thinking a buffer day might solve this? E.g., rather than extracting just 4th and 5th, extract 3rd as well. Covert to UTC then only overwrite UTC partitions that were within the defined rolling window (e.g., just 4th & 5th UTC dates).",

Maintaining data integrity and reliability at scale across platforms can be a very tough challenge, especially with any reasonable volume. All that to say: you're right that it's a real and difficult problem to solve.I'm biased (I'm one of the founders of Prequel, where we do something similar to what you're talking about), but hopefully I can also be pretty helpful on the topic -- let me know if there are any questions I can help with.Also, the Pontoon team put together a helpful feature comparison matrix among the players in the market (though they recently discontinued work on the project): [https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon?tab=readme-ov-file#pontoon-vs-other-etl--reverse-etl-platforms](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon?tab=readme-ov-file#pontoon-vs-other-etl--reverse-etl-platforms)",

Now that all Snowpipe/Snowpipe streaming is a fixed price (0.0037 Credits per GB), it should be easier to see what your costs will be regardless of the number of files. Generally Snowpipe will be cheaper, but your time is worth something too. As you mention, Snowpipe can support schema evolution with ENABLE\\_SCHEMA\\_EVOLUTION = TRUE. But if you need more granular control, I could see scenarios where you might want to do it your way. Bottom line, get an understanding of GB/hour for data coming in so you'll be able to answer the cost differential between the two approaches. If it is a lot of data, the difference might be fairly small. Good luck!",

        "body": "tl;dr: I wouldnt necessarily advice to use Snowflake as operational database. As an analytical database, it might help you if the analysts are experiencing timeouts and/or slow queries Depends on how much data you have. Are analysts experiencing problems when they run queries on MySQL? And if they are, are you sure this is a problem related to the amount of data or could it be due to a bad-indexed db or small ec2 instance used to query?By design, Snowflake is not made to be an operational database. There is a new table format called Interactive Table, which according to the documentation is basically the way you would use Snowflake for transactional data (low-latency + high concurrency). It is, however, also written that you get best performance by querying that table with a Interactive Warehouse, which - and here's the catch - is by default ON all the time (which will sky-rocket your costs)If the analysts are experiencing slow queries, then replicating databases in Snowflake will definitely (most likely) help. In this case, I would leave the MySQL database as your operational database and replicate them in Snowflake, where analysts would only query from there (given that they are ok with some delay in the data compared to the data in MySQL). You'll spend a bit less with the AWS instances used to query data, but I'm pretty sure your Snowflake bill will more than compensate that decrease.Btw, I move data from MySQL to Snowflake doing exactly that: lambda -> s3 -> Snowflake (using Tasks) + PowerBI. Very quick to get it up and running (with a first load done with DMS), but given that lambda is not really made for this kind of task (there's a 15min hard timeout in the lambda), I'm on the process of moving that into fargate.",

        "body": "This sounds like a case for ELT vs ETL.If you want tracking and lineage for your data so you can go back and debug if something fails, do the minimal level of processing between the json and the dataset you send to BigQuery (just enough so the dataframe is in the correct schema) and store the data in BigQuery. Then build additional steps that extract the data from BigQuery and do more complex transformations on it.If you don't care about access to the raw data, just do all your transformation steps between the json ingestion and Bigquery.Also, if you just want to cache your json, you don't necessarily have to convert it into a BQ table. You can just store the json in an unstructured data format in something like an AWS S3 Bucket or GCS before you begin processing the JSON into a dataframe for BQ.Also, if you're already working with pandas, I would recommend looking into polars. It's like pandas, but newer and faster (built on rust) and it comes with some features that make validation and type casting a bit more intuitive.Last thing, depending on your usecase, casting everything to a string has pros and cons. You might end up losing data as a result. For example, if you have a datetime column that you cast into a string and back, you lose any non-represented data like timezone that you can't get back anymore. I personally like maintaining the typing as close to the data source as possible.",

For pipelines like this that have been stable for decades, the biggest risk is changing logic that no one fully remembers the edge cases for.What I’ve seen work better in similar situations is a phased approach. Keep the Pro C transformations intact initially by containerizing or running them in a controlled environment, then focus on validating inputs and outputs aggressively. Once you have parity and confidence in the data, you can start peeling off pieces of the transformation logic incrementally instead of all at once.Modernizing is valuable, but preserving correctness first usually buys you time and reduces risk, especially when the business depends on this pipeline behaving exactly the same way it has for years.",

        "body": "All excellent questions.1. Cost and speed - I’m in the process of running benchmarks against progressively larger databases. So far, I’m seeing a maximum 10% overhead in storage for the VCS on the database. Cost is dependent on your architecture, but if we’re going with Aurora RDS, it’s dependent on IOPS. This solution uses Copy-on-Write, so there is an increase in IOPS over just running against production, but less than simply copying all the data. Since it’s also delta-based, the IOPS are only upserts, but those are ran twice (once on the branch, once on the merge into main).2. Difference with Git - generally, you don’t store data in Git outside of small test sets. This is a branch that essentially allows you to run your code in production without ever actually touching production. You connect to the same database, so you don’t need to modify your connection (beyond minor branch variables with can be set via environment). Subsetting your data can result in edge case failures since a subset by definition doesn’t include every case. 3. Blame - you can track blame for every record, every column and row, every constraint just by querying rather than digging into the CDC or building a proper SCD pipeline. 4. Silver bullet solution - that right there is the reason behind this post. I want genuine feedback from the community. I have worked at several jobs where this would be incredibly useful, but that’s only my limited experience. I know there are other, more targeted solutions for the various problems. I wanted to get a sense of others’ experiences to see if this addresses a genuine broad need, or if it’s overkill for the majority of problems. One issue I’ve faced constantly is the introduction of bad data into the production database via improperly structured code which might look fine in git but fails in weird ways when applied to the entire database. This allows you to not just review a PR of the code, but also a PR of the data changes at the same time.",

        "body": "Interesting, I do a lot of work with dev teams around logging, what I’ve found works for us is being clear on the exact code change, logic and format of it. We even help write test cases for them in some cases. We also have dev data flow into our data lake so we can validate and iterate dev data before production so it doesn’t break or mess anything up.This has taken a while to get into strong place for a lot of teams such as buy in from stakeholders, value output and context around what the code does so we can advise on the change, especially around the logger and implementation.For the case of having it tied to git sounds interesting, but we are large org, hundreds of repos and already well defined process for releasing code changes (not necessarily tied to data) so to add have the data change linked to PR would be difficult I think for us to introduce as the there’s a lot of teams, infrastructure and processing for us to validate. Ways we have gone to improve the feedback loop is to get the data show back to people as possible. So getting dev data back, tools to view logs as interactions happen and pushing to be advisors/partners on the logging side. Also running QA checks and validation on dev data to catch drift early has been a massive help to catch things. This is generally through strict types like struct types in spark or pydantic etcThis generally means data engineers try to partner with teams for a log change and setting guidelines and docs on best practices to follow for teams to be self serve. Once a change is implemented, DEs integrate and transform data for other downstream teams and analysts to consume.Definitely not a perfect solution, but has worked well for us. Starting over tomorrow, would I consider a data vcs? Maybe as a trial to experiment but probably not. Data is generally later phase concern when building a product/service unless the data is your product, but usually not the case.Having had to built a service for users and already a key stakeholder of the logging implementation, time spent on data logging was tough to prioritize as needed something built and out the door and made more sense to do after release as a follow up.Having typed structure really has been the biggest help. Working with developers, have a well defined data type not only helps data products but also helps developers to work with. This means everyone is all largely speaking the same “language” and centralizes the source of truth like what a data vcs brings",

Async mechanisms in languages like Python and JavaScript use single-threaded, event-driven, queue-based mechanisms. They help to simplify the design of asynchronous systems where you send a lot of time waiting on network traffic, disk reads, or user input. Async does not run anything in parallel, and you will not see any performance improvements from in; in fact, overuse of async methods in tight loops can significantly harm performance due to the added overhead of the event queue.Part of why async design is popular in Python and JavaScript is because threads really suck in those languages. The existence of the global interpreter lock in Python <3.14 severely limits how well threads can perform, and worker threads are a huge pain to manage in JavaScript.

        "body": "So, let me tell ye about the old timey times.What we used to do is load pages in serial. Request came in, and as we processed the page, we'd make database requests, wait for the response, build more page, do more requests, etc. Not great. If you had a long loading page, it might takes 20 seconds or more to load.So we got async. Async was cool because now when a request comes in, I serve you a template and give you some URLs in my API to query. Each makes its own specific action and on completion does something else. Page loads in 0.5s, most of your data is there in <1s, and that one long 15-second query stalling out the old page eventually loads in when ready. Great!However, we ended up with edge cases. Your page loads a complex tab that needs data from 5 dynamic drop-downs that it also has to load data for. That's 5 requests that all get triggering in serial using async or .thens (aka callback hell), or you could hope for the best and occasionally end up with a race condition and a failed load.So we got promises. Honestly, for >90% of use cases, it just improved handling with then, catch, finally, etc. But it also enabled us to use Promise.all where we could cleanly write code, where we could call some nonsense like: function foo() { Promise.all([ getUserDropdownData(), getCityDropdownData(), getStateDropdownData(), getDepartmentDropdownData(), getSomeOtherData() ]) .then(values => { //doesn't execute until all of the above data is loaded const [userData, cityData, statedata, deptData, otherData] = values; buildUserDataDropdown(userData); buildCityDataDropdown(cityData); buildStateDataDropdown(stateData); buildDeptDataDropdown(deptData); buildOtherDataDropdown(otherData); }) .then(() => { //doesn't execute until we're done building all the dropdowns refreshTableData(); //...might have to add a 1ms timeout to grab default values accurately }) } /* disclaimer, I half tested this real quick with timeouts, may or may not work, example only */You would literally be tearing your eyes out to do that without promises; I'm talking 3-4x that many lines of code to sync all of it up. Also, with overhead, you might be waiting \\~200ms for each request, so your drop-downs load in \\~220ms instead of \\~1000ms. Now we can cleanly make those requests in parallel without fear of race conditions, and request our table data even faster.We also got web workers; because Javascript is single-threaded it just executes whatever is at the top of the stack. If I have to do something that counts to...1 billion, that'll block the top of the stack while it counts, locking the rest of the page. If I assign it to a worker, the worker gets a separate thread from my main JS thread to do its task.And that's all I'm gonna say because I took way too long typing this.",

        "body": "> Is multithreading considered “legacy” or risky now?Depends on the use case. Async doesn't help with CPU-bound work. Multithreading can.> Are async/event-driven models actually better for most scalable backends?Async is just a way to have a suspendable function. For backend, the theory is that we spend a lot of time waiting for slow IO. OS-provided threads tend to be heavyweight (e.g. every thread reserves memory for its call stack, and that tends to be O(MB) for each thread). So using them just to wait for slow IO is wasteful. If we instead move all that into userspace, we can avoid a lot of that overhead.> Or is this more about developer experience than performance?It's both, although async/await also has some downsides (mainly [the function coloring problem](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)). Some languages / runtimes (like Erlang, Go, and Java) manage to avoid the function coloring problem.> A lot of blogs and talks make it sound like classic multithreading (threads, locks, shared state) is something people are actively trying to avoidI maintain that async is susceptible to many of the same issues that multithreaded code is susceptible to, but at a more coarse-grained level. If you have shared data that is being operated on by two in-flight `async` calls, then they will interleave with each other in unpredictable ways. You still want tools to e.g. block one async function from resuming while a different async function is busy updating some shared data.Because async/await has well-defined preemption points, you're not going to have a single memory location that is being read from and written to at the same time. But you _could_ be in the middle of updating a complex structure. Perhaps it's in an inconsistent state, but you need to call an async function before you can put it back in a consistent state. That's basically the same problem that exists in classical threading, with the same solution - you want something like a mutex.There's a reason that Go and Java (with virtual threads) both have mutex types, despite both supporting colorless async. Even then, you are encouraged to use higher-level tools if you can. But sometimes, you just need a mutex.",

Take the following as an example loophole. The common SQL injection came from login pages, meaning the application would accept a username and password from the end user, then will check the database for matching records.An example of a poor and vulnerable way to handle the input / login process would be something like`Select TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = '{input.username}' AND Password = '{input.password}';`then accepting the record returned as the 'authenticated' user. Now, lets look at how the resulting query would work for a normal input as well as a malicious input. Lets say I put in \"John@Doe.com\" as the username and \"RubberDucky\" as the password. The application would pass the following to the database`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'John@Doe.com' AND Password = 'RubberDucky'`fair enough, now what happens if i put in a username of \"Admin';--\"? The application would pass the following `SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'Admin';-- ' AND Password = 'RubberDucky';`The database will return the first user that has the username of \"Admin\" and consider it to be authenticated because ' will finish my string input, \";\" would terminate the SQL command, and \"--\" comments out the rest to prevent any kind of syntax errors. that is just a very basic example. Another example i found in production (i work for this company and had permission) was they created an API that would allow you to pass in a SQL query to generate custom reports and such (HORRIBLE IDEA btw). To make it \"secure\" they used pattern matching and prevented commands like \"UPDATE\", \"DELETE\", \"\\*\", etc. So as a proof of concept, i encoded my query in b64 and passed in a query that would decode and execute it to create tables, dump SQL user names, dump stored CC info, etc. I have also seen people do it in HEX Once you start spotting potential holes like this, the possibilities are endless as to what you can do.

It was a great way to learn, and I felt really dumb when someone pointed it out to me, but I'm super glad they did!

And that's where the application has access to the database. It uses a pool of connections that will just execute any command you give it. You can make it so that certain commands are not allowed, like dropping tables, but modifying data and reading data your are not supposed to might still be possible. >how are they able to get data returned from a database with their query if they are not an authenticated user to the databaseThe application is authenticated. >and how would they even know what to inject into the SQL database to get what they wantThey often don't. But they can guess. Often there's a table called \"users\" or \"user\" and it has columns, such as \"name\", \"email\", \"password\" etc. That's why it's hacking. They just \"hack\" until it works. > this is purely educational because I honestly don't understand it?There are many books about this. You really have to see how 90ies PHP websites were made to understand how insecure it all was. Note that it's only possible in very old libraries that let you just create strings containing sql queries that you then execute. Wo now use templates and make sure that user input is checked and always passed as a certain type (string, number, date etc). You can't just pass \"1' AND 1; --\" and have it be inserted into \"select \\* from users where username = '%s' password = '%s'\". And we salt and has the passwords, if there even are any. But some people are idiots and think it's ok to use 20 year old libraries and not do anything for security. Then it's easy. Others use modern frameworks and even they can have vulnerabilities. But it's not as easy as it was back then.",

In any case, everything will be unclear, because this is programming, and it requires passing the stage of discomfort and lack of understanding at the initial stage. Those who passed this are wonderful people, and they can tell everyone that their path and sequence of learning languages were correct. And about those who did not become a programmer, we will never know - a typical survivor bias. Therefore, the most correct and adequate option would be to choose a random language based on your goals, and then, if programming is yours, and you do not quit it, you will definitely reach the moment when you can decide yourself: stay with it or change it.

The theory often comes after the exposure, if at all. My dumbass didn't know that about programming, so I spent a few years locking in on CS with no real programs to my name.

Scope projects so they fit in a couple of weeks, pick a clear finish line, and keep working even when you are a bit bored, just like a workout.If you want a bigger project, slice it into tiny versions that you can actually ship. Finishing a lot of small, slightly boring things is where real progress comes from.",

So currently jobs are being replaced and teams downscaled.But I believe in a few years everything is going to start falling apart because of people overusing AI and introducing large amounts of tech debt without having experience devs ensuring everything is plugging together well.

Now AI can do the same shitty job.The industry will transform, the demand in skills will grow - AI will become tools. So no, studying is required more than ever now.

Populate your skills section, learn these technologies. 4. Consider buying books such as TCP Illustrated, C++ Software Design Principles, Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces, Inside the Machine. Study the materials to uncook yourself, any coding exercises they ask you, put them on your GitHub to show that you're working. 5. https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x Study these repository, create some of the projects they suggest you to make go populate your GitHub. 6.

For example \"ZOO-123: Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" This ties that commit with Jira ticket ZOO-123 that either is about changes to RabbitMQ messaging or about fixing an issue with said messaging.Also, some companies use conventional commits. It is just a way of formatting your commit message so that automated tools can process commits in an easier way. Read about it from [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) An example would be \"fix(ZOO-123): Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" There the fix() keyword shows that the commit was for fixing something. A feat() keyword can be for adding a new feature or for working with some new functionality. For example \"feat(SCHOOL-23): Add Japanese language.\"The commit message itself is often in imperative present tense. For example \"Fix to\" instead of \"Fixed\". The commit should give a summary of the change. What was done. Keep it concise and clear. Do not add a whole essay. But also do not just write \"Added more changes.\" Which changes? Why? Read about it from [https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3](https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3) Avoid frustration and all kind of nonsense in the commits. Yes, when the stuff does not work and your earlier commit did not fix it then writing \"Get working already!!!!!\" or \"wgo8g7tfwo82w37fdto238gd\" is not a rational way how to deal with the issue. It is unprofessional. In the previous company I worked at, we had one guy who raged in his commit messages.Avoid adding too many details. Instead of writing \"Fix to UserNotificationIntegrationTest, BillingIntegrationTest, BaseIntegrationTest, RabbitMQPublisherIntegrationTest\" better pick \"Fix to integration tests\". Which tests, that can be seen from the git commit itself. Neither go with \"Added an email support to UserNotificationService by introducing emailSender() method that uses angus-mail library\" just write \"Add support to send user notifications via email\" Some good and bad examples are in [https://chris.beams.io/git-commit](https://chris.beams.io/git-commit) Also, it does not really help when you finish your whole project and then add it via a single commit that has a commit message of \"Initial commit\".",

Mindlessly asking AI to generate code for you teaches you nothing. But using AI to explain documentation, recommend improvements, provide examples, and break down code can be immensely valuable. There's nothing wrong with asking AI to clarify and teach. That's exactly what a professor does; to accommodate curriculum reading.What I'll do when trying to pick a new project I'd like to do and ask it something like this: \"I'd like to make an app or program that does xyz. What stack would you recommend and why?\" It'll spit back a bunch of recommendations. Then I'll pull up Google and read a bit about them and pick one. Then I'll pop open the documentation and ask the AI: \"Let's start from the beginning. How do I render zyx? Or how do I get a basic function abc working?\" Then I might ask it to explain the code and reference the documentation. I'll sometimes ask it for a list of the most common functions from the API and what they do, etc... but once AI helps me get the ball rolling I gradually transition to doing things myself. Once I understand the code the AI generated I'll apply it myself. This approach can take awhile but has gotten pretty functional at learning new skills. While I'm doing all this I'm also checking documentation and taking notes. AI is like a tool box but you shouldn't drop the toolbox off at the job site and trust it to build everything itself. Learn to use the tools and apply them properly.",

There are times when this is obvious, but it's frequently used as a way to lend more force to someone saying \"I don't like this.\" So when you're going to tell someone that their code is un-Pythonic, you'd better provide an obviously superior implementation.> Are there good examples of non-pythonic vs. pythonic code?Yeah, the ones that get trotted out the most are C-isms. In C, you have to do a lot of things explicitly that are handled implicitly by Python's stdlib classes.* A lot of resource handling (files, sockets, etc) can be done with context managers.* Loops can usually be handled as iterator algebra problems rather than by fiddling with indices. Nested loops can often be turned into non-nested loops with `itertools`.* More broadly, unless you have a really good reason not to do it, stateful manipulation can often be replaced with list comprehensions and some basic functional programming concepts.On the other extreme, just because you can code-golf some problem into a deranged one-liner list comprehension expression does not mean that you should.

People will just switch to the faster product.This change is supported by the recent development of new languages designed to make performant software easier to write. So you'll see more products written in C, Go, zig, Odin, and Jai.

        "body": "One thing to keep in mind is that most programming learning becomes fun when it is tied to building something, not when it looks like a language drill. A lot of experienced programmers actually bounce off game-like tutorials once they are past the basics. What tends to work well is a small project with constraints, like recreating a simple game, automating something he already cares about, or modding an existing system he uses. That gives him feedback loops, problem solving, and room to explore a language deeply. If you want to support it as a gift, hardware, books with real projects, or even just time and encouragement to build something slightly ambitious often go further than any dedicated learning game.",

You could him some nice books PLUS something 'fun', like new clothes, a PS5/Switch 2/Xbox game he wanted, a new game controller, or cash.2. A Rasberry Pi!If he is into hardware programming, [https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/), maybe he would want a Rasberry Pi. It's a small micro-computer he can use for personal projects. May take a bit to deliver.. It could cost a 'bit' depending on which micro-computer you get.3. Games & SoftwareRealistically, there aren't many that could serve as a Christmas gift... Most of those types of resources are already available for free online! If there is a Coursera or Udemy course that's paid, or if he would like a subscription to a learning platform like [https://www.boot.dev/dashboard](https://www.boot.dev/dashboard), that could fit your question, but maybe that wouldn't work as a Christmas gift. These types of softwares are often subscription-based, so it might run up your bill...You could get him one of these softwares if he asks, but maybe that's something for another time!\\---Me, personally, I would get him a nice book. You could use one of my suggestions, or something else. A raspberry pi is also a nice option. Make a nice gift basket, get him some nice books, put in some plushies if you want. Place in some gift cards to his favorite mobile / console games. Maybe some new clothes. Books + fun stuff, it would make a perfect gift. :) Merry Christmas, thanks for helping your son's learning.",

Even just mentioning it right now makes me want to go find a copy and play it (e.g. on an emulator like DOSBox).It's not specific to any programming language, though, but there is a \"chip lab\" in the game that you have to regularly go to to design chips.

The lack of templates, for example, makes generic programming very tedious and difficult, even though it can be done. (It's just the wrong tool for the job, and DSA is probably better learned in C++, Java, or C#. It can be done in Python, but typically, Python offers \"too much\" and makes it too easy, not really giving a solid view of what goes into DSA, in my opinion.)If I were you, I'd audit a course on DSA if you feel that it would strengthen your knowledge of the subject instead of enrolling in it. Auditing is a great way to review or to learn new concepts without the pressure of assignments and exams with deadlines.I'm surprised you took a course on web programming: it's a landscape that changes so fast that by the time you've started the course, what you're learning is probably already obsolete. the others sound pretty standard for a CS curriculum, but not learning advanced algorithms or the theory of computability (unless you covered that in discrete math, which seems unlikely) seems like glaring omissions.Another option would be to pick up a book on DSA and work through it at your own pace... that undirected learning style doesn't work for everyone, though, so pick what works best for you, but yes, a solid foundation in DSA is very important to have: knowing what data structures and algorithms to pick and why is something that I would consider essential.",

Some people have learned the \"single return\" style and stick with that.Others prefer the \"return early to handle error conditions\" style, which has its advantages.Most people seem to miss that the two styles are not mutually exclusive. It's certainly possible to handle errors early without an early return. Though, it usually means that we need to do one of two \"not nice\" things stylistically: (a) we need to increase indentation for the non-error case, or (b) we need to use a goto at the error point (or throw an exception), which many people find not nice, but rarely say the explicit reason for their aversion to it.In your particular example that you cited, the early return is not really an \"error case\", though, so in this particular example, placing both the returns at the same indentation level (i.e. one within in the \"if\" branch and the other within the \"else\" branch) would make the \\*intent\\* slightly clearer.Now, suppose you wanted to amend the function and include some kind of \"error condition\" like for the value 0 (which is mathematically neither even nor odd). In such a case like that, then in my opinion it would be clearer to use an early return for that, since doing so \"idiomatically\" expresses the idea that this kind of situation is an unexpected or unusual case. I.e., maybe the caller made some kind of mistake by asking whether 0 is even or odd, because logically that may make no sense, so maybe it's a mistake that it was asked.Once the \"error returns\" are taken care of, the rest of the code can basically assume (correctly) that the value in question is \"correct\" in terms of logicality. I.e. for this function it means the rest of the code can assume we are dealing with non-zero quantities, which almost always helps analyzing the correctness of the algorithm.",

What happens if an email address doesn't match the \"`isValidEmailAddress`\" check?It's a bit easier to read, both in terms of lowering mental strain and indenting depth, if you take simple cases and pull them out like this: // Try to guess the user's first name, return a generic name if it can't be inferred String guessFirstNameFromEmail(String emailAddress) { if (!isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress)) { return \"Alex\"; } if (username == \"\") { return \"Sam\"; } if (username.contains(\".\")) { return username.split(\".\")[0]; } if (hasUpperAndLowerLetterMix(username)) { return username.splitBy(SplitMethod.CapitalLetters)[0]; } return username; }In the lower case, it's more of a series of deductions - you're considering your assumptions first, and it reads more like getting \"weird\" cases out of the way first (bad input, empty string, etc...).",

If you have to allocate some hash memory at the beginning of the function, or open a file handle, or whatever, you want to be damn sure that you close that handle or free up the memory before leaving the function again. For that reason, we'll have one return at the end of the function, and use a temporary variable to store the return value. You don't need to have a crazy nested if-else structure for this. Just set the temporary return variable to some value (like null) when you create it. As soon as you hit a return situation, set the variable to some non-null value.

Sometimes they even make more objects.Then there are four \"pillars\": encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.1. Encapsulation is when an object's properties are hidden to the public, and optionally only exposed through some kind of filter. These are most commonly seen as `get` and `set` methods.2. Inheritance is when one type of object is a \"subclass\" of another (\"superclass\"), so every property and method of the latter also belongs to the former. 3. Abstraction is when you hide the internals of how something works, and just expose the inputs and outputs. This is far from exclusive to OOP; chances are you're already used to this. 4. Polymorphism is when you refer to the same object using different types to get different information from it. In the same \"subclass\" relationship used for inheritance, every object of type subclass is also of type superclass.That's it, that's OOP! Now practice those ideas with C++ since you know the basics of it already. It's very conducive to object-oriented programming - in fact, in college, my advanced OOP class was all C++. If you want examples, just ask, I can help.",

There were staffing issues that postponed the course but the communication throughout was terrible and we were often times left in the dark. I have heard similar stories about other online bootcamps here in the UK but someone else might have a more positive experience with them. In hindsight I should’ve paid for the more expensive courses that included in person classes/exams as I think there would be more structure. Either that or should’ve gone with something more well known (Lewagon for example). IMO the most valuable thing I gained from the experience was due to the project based assessment, it gave me a git history, portfolio and talking points in interviews.",

I was signed up to NuCamp's newsletter and got an email that my city was offering a retraining scholarship, which meant I'd only have to pay $600 for 7 months of classes. Hard to pass that up.I did NuCamp from September 2024 to March 2025. It's designed to be a part-time program that you can do while you have a full-time job, but I'm not sure how realistic that is. I quit my job and went all in when we started React. Before the BootCamp, I was in tutorial hell, having done Free Code Camp, Harvard CS50, Odin Project, YouTube, and Udemy classes. I'll say that even with all that prep, the BootCamp was a firehose of information, and by the end of it, I was exhausted. I liked the classes. Most of the teachers I had were good. The Jobs class they offered was total trash IMO, but that could have been because of the teacher, who felt more like a social media influencer. That class did force me to finish my portfolio website, so it wasn't all bad. Their Discord is actively shouting out jobs. I ended up taking a few more months after class to wrap my head around React and get better at JavaScript by building projects and doing CodeWars. Over a year after starting, I'm now studying Front End Dev questions I pulled from GreatFrontEnd and dabbling with LeetCode, which has been incredibly frustrating. At best, I've probably got another six months of practice and projects before I'd be hireable, but realistically, I'm thinking I've got another year. I'm an artist, so this stuff comes slowly to me. Since you're already doing analytics, I'm guessing it will be faster for you.If you do the BootCamp, my advice is to do personal projects with people in your cohort. That was probably the MOST beneficial part of the BootCamp. Looking at my group's code and trying to make everything work together really forced me to understand it and broke me out of tutorial hell.Another tip I'd give is to grab a BootCamp class off of Udemy when it's discounted and work your way through it to see how you do. Just make sure you're doing your own personal project after every tutorial project.Hope this is helpful. Good luck!",

Java has a strongly implied folder structure. Holy shit the directories: com.foo.bar.domain.entities.baz…Look at other projects and try things out. Use a nice IDE (IntelliJ) that makes it easy to refactor and move things around when you realize you don’t like how you organized it (I have been doing this the past few days).As for when to break up functions: as much as you can. Some early advice I got from an AWS engineer was: “if you want something to scale and be maintainable, it has to be made of small pieces.”Good codebases grow. Good codebases eventually become mazes. As a programmer, I try to imagine another programmer (likely myself later on) landing at this function as if being dropped in a maze: how long will it take them to understand where they are.I can’t really give them a good, complete map. But I can try my best to make it so that at each intersection (at each function), it is obvious which way to go. I can make it so that they do not need to spend time looking around, exploring, reasoning, guessing, and backtracking. A good function is understandable immediately, either:- accomplishing something simple in relatively few lines of code- or listing a series of other functions (each doing a simple thing in relatively few lines of code) like a recipe in relatively few lines of code.There are no points for being clever or obscuring what your code is doing. Boring, obvious code is good code.There are certainly times where it makes sense/is easier to just have a big long method.But I have found no predictor for how many bugs a function will produce more accurate than its length. I have gotten paid many dollars to debug big long methods and break them into manageable, readable, *unit-testable* pieces.",

It works, but you notice duplication (HTML boilerplate). So you refactor and extract a shared layout. Now you accidentally have two kinds of files:* files that should be publicly served (pages)* files that are internal building blocks (layout)That alone justifies a first structure: public/ // endpoints src/ // internal codeYou didn’t \"design an architecture\". You just answered a real question: \"this file should not be publicly accessible\"From there, the same thing keeps happening:* group by technical role: MVC-style architectures* group by feature/resource: modular architecturesHexagonal, clean architecture, MVC, etc. are not things you start with. They’re names we gave later to patterns that emerge when you keep asking:* Who is allowed to call this?* What changes together?* What should not depend on what?If you end up with a 500-line file, that’s not failure: it’s usually the signal that the next split is becoming visible somehow.",

If you're building a calendar or scheduling app where the primary goal of the app was to schedule things, then rolling your own might be worth it to deliver an amazing experience and have full control over it. If it's just one tiny feature, it probably makes more sense to use a good existing library.Second, what are the costs of using an external component? Let's say I need a matrix multiply function. Adding a dependency on a huge linear algebra package like BLAS or numpy might increase the size of the build, add a new license to check, and just overall add a lot of complexity to the project. If the only thing I need it for is to multiply some small matrices and performance doesn't matter, I might implement it myself and use another library to verify that my implementation is correct.Last, is this something that needs to change/update frequently or is it stable? If it's parsing a data file that's internal to my project and not user-generated, then that code might not ever need to change. Writing some custom code to parse it might be fine because it's not likely to break. On the other hand if it's parsing user-generated PDFs, a third-party library probably keeps getting new bug fixes and improvements over time, so it's probably way better to use a library.",

But we also had a ton of niche cases and requirements. Sometimes management wanted a summary of the table, and it may need to sum, average, or count the number of times a certain value (or range) appeared in a column.Some cells also needed to provide a link, multiple links, or color-code text in some way. Some cells needed to reformat data in a certain way - for example, if we got a timestamp, did we need to show just the date, just the time, seconds since time, etc. One manager always wanted us to separate date and time as two separate columns for Excel reasons. Oh, yeah, and it needed to have a one-click download CSV export of the data in-browser (so, it couldn't re-send the data to the server to generate a file).Wrote one, it worked great, used it for about 8+ years and it got copied to several of our different systems. Eventually one of the juniors asked why we were using my library, and not some npm library he found that did \"the same thing but better\". My answer, after looking at the library, was that I wrote mine 4 or so years before the npm library was created according to its github history. It also didn't support all of the features, or at least not in some of the specific use cases we had. So it *wasn't* something that existed when I needed it, and it also still didn't technically do everything we needed it to do.Similarly, I'll also \"engineer\" extremely simple things from scratch if I feel like it would take me longer to find a library to do the thing than it would to write. This case was we had a dashboard for a monitoring tool that just needed to show groups of \"top 10s\", so 10 rows, each containing a bar, another bar (with a definable color) inside of it with width based on a percentage, and a text value (that could also be a link). Easy enough: div wrapping a div and p or a, a dozen lines of CSS, and a function to manage it, took 5 minutes to write, 100% localized code I don't have to rely on a library for.",

All of these routes are valid options and many self taught programmers were made from them.I found Udemy better fit for me because it explains the theory in videos with examples and then puts you into test with an exercise or a project (at least in the courses I had).Like others said, In programming you are going to need to read in order learn something on the go more often than not. Not from the comfort of your room, but in the office while you work for example. You won't pull headphones to watch any videos there. For now it looks like cs50 or a Udemy course would be a better fit for you. But in the end it doesn't matter much. After the tutorials is where the hard part begins and there are no videos there. Hope that helps :victory_hand:",

        "body": "Just a bit of advice and perspective:First, you can access the videos from Free Code Camp's Concepts [here](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecampconcepts/videos) They have said they may be removed at any point in time, so look into a YT Downloader or some such. Their main YT channel also has several long video tutorials and crash-courses to my knowledge.There is also lots of videos all over YouTube about most programming topics / concepts, computer science, as well as specific tutorials on projects.Second, unfortunately, reading is just a part of programming as I am sure you're aware. You're going to have to read requirements of projects and their documentation, as well as write it. You're going to have to read code and genuinely try to understand it, both the functions and the larger whole. You're going to have to read documentation of the programming languages, tools, and APIs you're using.I'm not saying that to shame you, God knows, I barely read books. But reading is very much a part of programming, from the learning to the actual process of doing.Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp are both what I have experience with. They're both solid platforms, and I'd probably complete FCC first, and then circle back to Odin Project and see about the gaps and more advanced knowledge it covers. One of the big advantages is that it is fairly unguided and gives you a set of objectives to complete. This forces you to think about what you're doing, how and why, as well as forcing you to acquire knowledge and documentation just like you would on any real project.At that point, I'd probably just try making projects. Maybe dabble in a game engine like Godot because of its lightweight nature, GDScript which is very easy to read and write, and ability to do web exports for Itch.IO. Hell you can even use it to make applications / tools, not games, but I digress.I'm just not sure what to suggest that can fulfill that video requirement, besides trying a hybrid approach. Try to at least read the highlights and general idea of a topic, and then look for some videos about it, maybe practical examples. Don't force yourself to deathmarch paragraph after paragraph, but I don't know if you can truly avoid reading either.I'm sure others know more, I mostly learned by messing around modding games, reading books, nibbling on these tutorial sites and such. Best of luck.",

Otherwise I'm using it for boilerplate code which rarely needs comments, or just having it spit out a few examples of something I haven't used before, which I rarely use in production without significant modification, if at all, so again, no comments, just a good prompt. With AI, I find it much easier to look at 10-50 lines at a time and make sure it doing ok rather than having to stare at a ton of lines all at once and try to redirect it after it's gotten way ahead of itself.If you're using an in-ide agent I can see where the comments could help it continue on to fill out the function/file, but I just personally prefer to keep my AI on a short leash.Plus, I tend to work with a lot of aging code that needs to be refactored and it gets touchy.

In any case, user stories are also not acceptance criteria, which are more specific things which must be present in order for a ticket to be done. Sometimes things are vague and you have to fill in details based on your understanding of the purpose of the ticket; however, if things are too vague you need to have a discussion to make more detailed ACs. ACs should cover: inputs (clicks, path parameters, query parameters, etc), authentication/authorization (which types of users can do this, what happens if it is not authorized), outputs (status codes, formats such as JSON/XML, schema), how to handle error states (bad inputs, server errors, etc.), validation, navigation (what happens after a user clicks a thing). They won't necessarily cover everything, but everything that they don't cover should be \"dealer's choice\", i.e. they shouldn't matter to the end user, if they do, then it should be in the AC.For your example:AC1: Make a GET endpoint /orders that returns a JSON response matching the schema ... AC2: It should take the following query parameters AC3: It should only be accessible from Orkes in the web service, authenticated by ... AC4: If query param is invalid it should return a 400 status with an error message matching ... AC5: If not authenticated, it should return a 403 status with an error message matching ... ...",

Failing that, please please ask for opportunities to get with real users. Go on sales calls? Shadow some support people? Go to user training sessions? Anything. Just get to know some users. At least ask about it. The worst your manager can do is not respond. But they'll know you care.Finally, you can always do some writing and refine the vague use cases. Notice I said \"refine the use cases\" not \"design the components of the solution\". If you refine the use cases, for one thing you'll be clarifying requirements, always good. For another, you'll be challenging your BA to think more clearly. Most importantly, it's a constructive outlet for your strong professional emotion \"WTF is this stupid requirement and how am I supposed to know when I've met it?\"Caring about real users is a superpower.

This is bad because it means the story can't be worked if Geoff is on vacation, but it can be good in a way because if Geoff writes too much detail, he might cross over into dictating design and implementation details and you don't want that, either.My middle ground is this: the lead (or a designate) takes such a story while it's still on the backlog and attaches all the subtasks that dev can recognize, including the design step that includes getting details from the people who have them. The lead can do this accurately; a junior dev probably can't, but repeating this process is part of the way they learn about the system and the organization.By the time the story gets to the top of the backlog, if there isn't enough information to actually start the work, there should at least be enough breadcrumbs in it that a junior knows what to do to get that information.",

They get groomed by the team (including input from architecture-focused engineers and the customer) into acceptance criteria and high-level steps, which in turn get broken down into tasks when you're planning what you're doing next week.So: \"As a rogue AI agent\\*, I want access to our orders so I can blackmail our customers.\"Leads to these grooming questions:* What information is needed to blackmail our customers? Just item names tied to customer IDs? Item names and quantities? Prices?* What mechanism is needed for the AI agent to access the information it needs to blackmail our customers?* Do we have a system in place for assembling such a mechanism? If so, where is it; if not, do we need to separately come up with such a system or do we want to do that under the auspices of the blackmailing-our-customers story?* Who all should be able to access this mechanism? Do we need to invent the networking / auth-auth / API?* How much documentation does it need?* How can we tell that the AI agent is successfully blackmailing our customers?* Wait, who put this story in the backlog anyway? (j/k, nobody ever asks this question)Which we can imagine introduces these acceptance criteria:* An endpoint in the fulfillment API that can be queried by customer ID and returns a list of all that customer's order IDs and item IDs, names, and quantities* Access is restricted to members of the BLACKMAILBOT9000 user group, which already exists* Automatic tests demonstrate blackmail emails sent to a dummy address (TBD: replace the hard-coded address of `dipshitjr@hhs.gov`)* Don't bother documenting it; no human will ever need to know about this endpoint* Allocate another data center to the agentic AI project* Stop asking questions about where these stories are coming fromUnfortunately, it is typical for people to use terms that have real value to describe just making-shit-up-as-they-go, and to think that they can replace teaching people with giving them a coding ass-istant. The only way I've found to deal with that sort of thing is to make the shitty stories everyone's problem by using the meetings to discuss them to force the PM to do the work they were supposed to do on their own time.

When I learn something I save one small example that actually runs, plus a short explanation in my own words, tagged by problem type, like “async patterns” or “validation”. Months later I almost never remember the details, but I remember that I have a snippet or note for it and can reload it in a minute.The other thing that sticks is using the concept in a tiny real project once or twice instead of only in course exercises.

With respect to googling, IMHO, trying to code without an internet connection is madness. I myself often google the basics when I haven't used them in a while or to confirm I am remembering things correctly. If you switch languages a lot, you might start using the wrong syntax and I have to check that from time to time.When watching tutorials, hopefully you're coding along with them and then trying to do something a bit different which isn't in the tutorial and adapting what you learned to your problem. One little project that I would do using different web technologies was a little contact manager. That's not a typical tutorial example, but it's not much more complicated than a lot of them.

The best books are often out of date in some ways, and although they are a great resource for \"How\" and \"Why\", you will also need an up-to-date source of information. I have been using w3schools, and although they may or may not be the best that can be found, my hope is that it will bridge the gap between the great books on the subject and the recent changes to the language. I know and use HTML and CSS pretty well, and I am to the point where I can look up the raw features of it to figure out how to do what I want (when it is something I have not done often or at all); I am sure there will come a point where I can get to where I do not need the book (or lessons) to figure out how to do something with the language. So...short answer, it is just part of learning. Do not feel fake or inferior. And, definitely, you learn by doing. Watching videos can be interesting, but they do not help me really learn. Whatever the language you are learning, get a compiler/IDE. Type the code you are learning and experiment with IT. In other words, make the code you think you are learning work in an environment separate from the one that is teaching you. And don't copy and paste. Type it out. I use Code::Blocks and highly recommend it (it is free). Slight\\_Scarcity321 gives some good advice a little ways down this page.",

I dont think you do. Sure, you understand why it \"can\" work, but do you understand why it \\*must\\* work? if you only consume the tutorial, your only getting one side of the story, you need to question it. ask yourself \"why did they do this?\" \"how does that work?\" \"why does that work?\", be critical, dont believe the tutorial at all, \\*prove\\* the tutorial with external research, who knows? you might just find out the way theyre doing things isnt how you should be doing things (which happens way more than you think) this way, you trace a possible path from the problem the tutorial solves to how they got to their solution, and such is a path you can take when you go to implement it yourself.if your given only the starting line, destination, and a single path, youll never learn how to make a path yourself, you need to know why every other path \\*wouldnt\\* work, instead of just why this one does work. try to think to yourself how you would implement something if placed in the tutorial authors shoes. something i like to do is read a part of a tutorial, guess what the next thing is, implement it in a project specific way (i.e., a tutorial is not your project, you use a tutorial in your own seperate project so of course you code must look different to fulfil your own project requirements) until i hit a wall, and look at the tutorial again, but crutially dont worry about doing it wrong, as doing it wrong will actually make you understand more why the tutorial does it a different way when you hit a certain wall and youll gain more understanding. once your done a section, delete it all and re-code it. write down or just make a mental note of all of the places where you get stuck, those are the things you dont fully understand (note, sometimes i do this, other times i dont, i get lazy, it happens, but whenever i have done it it has helped clear the fog, so maybe if nothing else works you can try this)",

For me, i got in right before the big transition to AI went into full effect, so I got in just in time. I worked as a student tutor during my bootcamp and then scored an internship after my bootcamp.

I've heard good things about WGU.The main thing I'd be cautious about is stopping work for 6 months. That's not nearly enough time to be job-ready, and quitting work will just put immense pressure on you, which is the opposite of what you want.Learning a completely new skill takes time. Trying to rush it and squeeze more learning into less time rarely works in practice. You need time to rest and get comfortable with new ideas.I think cutting back on hours or finding work that's less stressful, but that keeps you employed, would be ideal.Take courses, learn to code, but most importantly build stuff. Make real, useful stuff and launch it - that's the best way to prove you're job-ready. In this field, \"entry-level\" doesn't mean you're still learning to build stuff, it means you've already built real projects on your own, you're only new to doing it in a corporate environment.",

I have b-degree in business administration, never worked in related role. 2 years ago I was 27, applied for a second university, 2 years course which teaches programming (qualification at the end). I already had bachelors degree, I didn't need 2nd one. Before the school I learned some coding already, so the course wasn't that hard and I had a bit of experience already. I only had experience with frontend, today I can build full-stack applications. (junior lvl) I got scholarship for being the best in class so that helped financially.2 years later. I'm still looking for job since June. Yes, I'm a bit picky of which role I want. I don't want to work as administrator in a bank and answer old grandmas calls. I want to do something programming related cause I know I have a knowledge and experience more than some juniors today. And I will be hard working and learn as fast as I can. But I had mby like 4 interviews in 6 months for the roles that I was not really happy about so let that sink in.What I think: Bootcamps in todays job market sucks. 5 years ago they were worth it, cause you could learn fundamentals in 4-5 months and company was happy to hire you and they would teach you on the job without any experience or knowledge. Because to be real, nobody can learn advanced things in 6 months. You will only learn some simple things. You won't learn to build advanced full stack applications with best practices and high security. And today company expects you to know all of that, which takes 8 hours a day for 5+ years of doing real job.I will be completely honest. If you are not a genius (so that goverment can hire you) or you don't have a relative or a very good friend who can hire you. You won't get a job. There are already 1k devs with so much more experience, knowledge and skills applying for the same role you want. AI doesn't help ether, seniors can do 3 jobs now, generate things fast, they wont need juniors to fix buttons for them anymore. (You already know it, based on your generated post) While there are more developers than jobs available it will stay like this and I think it will only be worse. My hope is that AI will become so expensive without improving that it will be more rentable to hire juniors instead. Or companies realize that they need juniors to learn and become seniors one day.",

        "body": "The core idea of OOP is to associate data with behaviour. E.g. instead of having a `sort()` function that sorts a list of data based on an algorithm, your data has it's own `sort()` method, so it kind of sorts itself instead of getting sorted.On first glance this sounds very powerful, because a list of strings may be sorted differently than a list of numbers or a list of pointers. What OOP allows you is to have a list of any type, just call `.sort()` on it and the correct sorting method will be used automagically.This idea was then further applied to other things like a Date. Instead of using a library of functions and a collection of structs that the functions work on, you now get an object and have all functions directly associated with that object, so instead of writing `dateutils.to_string(date: Date, ...)` you now have `Date.to_string(...)`. In the early days of OOP this was used for code reuse through inheritance. Inheritance just means, that you define a new class and tell the computer that this class should have all the features of that parent class plus the new stuff you define and except the stuff you redefine in the new class.However, it turned out that Inheritance doesn't work well for code reuse, so nobody sane recommends it any more for that. It also turned out that it's more common to have different behaviour than different kind of data, so people started using \"Composition\" instead. Composition just means that your objects has other objects that are used to perform different kind of behaviour. For Example, you may have a class `Animal` and the animal is supposed to have different behaviour like walk, run, speak, eat. Instead of using Inheritance to create new subclasses of `Animal` and implement different behaviour, you define small interfaces `IRunner`, `IWalker`, `ISpeaker`, `IEater` (or similar) and write small classes for each interface. There might be a `Bark` and a `Meow` class implementing \"ISpeaker` and there may be \"BipedRunner\" and \"QuadrupedRunner\" implementing \"IRunner\" and so on. You then create different animals using the Animal-Constructor:```pycat = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Meow(), CarnivoreEater())dog = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Bark(), CarnivoreEater())horse = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Whinny(), HerbivoreEater())cat.speak() # \"meow!\"dog.speak() # \"wruff!\"horse.speak() # \"neigh!\"```This is what \"Composition over Inheritance\" refers to. So we're almost back to having functions applied to data, but instead we call a method of an object that then looks up another object and calls one of that object's methods (for each individual method call).A big downside of OOP is that contrary to its promise it makes code harder to maintain, because you create a compile time hierarchy that matches your domain model and with that you create boundaries around things (objects) instead of creating boundaries around properties (e.g. positions, prices, ... ). Maybe that helps a bit.",

I know it's important to research on your own, and not rely on \"spoonfeeding\", but it gets to a point where it's absurd. My best learning experiences where when the lectures had streamlined content where all course assignments and exams were heavily or even completey based on those lectures. I always felt like I came away with something positive and felt a lot more skilled. Also, it depends on the professor but some will outright disregard any questions. And when so much rides on the assignments and with so little support and resources, you tend to focus on the lectures less and are scrambling for the assignments to the point where there's hardly any retention of what you were supposed to learn in the first place.

What actually helps is learning how real teams operate, not memorizing rules.If you want a solid foundation, start with how teams actually collaborate. Read a few well maintained open source repos and pay attention to their README, contribution guides, commit history, and pull requests. You’ll learn more about Git hygiene, reviews, naming, and decision making there than from most blog posts.For API keys and secrets specifically, the rule is simple. Never commit them. Use environment variables, config files that are ignored by Git, and documented setup steps so another developer can run the project locally without guessing. Almost every production issue I see around secrets comes from shortcuts taken early.Books like “The Pragmatic Programmer” and “Clean Code” are useful, but treat them as guidelines, not law. The real skill is knowing when to apply them and when to keep things simple.Best practices come from context. Build things, read other people’s code, get your work reviewed, and break things a few times. That’s where the lessons actually stick.",

By the end of your 3rd or 4th year (however the study program is for you) you'll have some preferences in terms of where you are planning to specialize in.You can't niche down early when you do not know your options. Sure, you can decide \"I will become mobile app developer\" which is a valid path. But are you certain that this path is for you? Perhaps you'll do better in programming IoT devices? Just go by the curriculum, for now.Learn to learn. Right now you are doing your college/university studies. It is not any more high school where teachers would remind you to do your assignments and such. Now you have to learn how to live an independent life and make your own decisions. When I was doing my Bachelor studies then some of my course mates dropped out within the first two semesters. Some partied too much. Some had no self-discipline. Some found out that they picked a wrong field. etc. About skills more, then become proactive. Do not rely just on your courses. Participate in hackathons. Join a programming/robotics club. Work on hobby projects. Because by the time you graduate you'll have to compete with everybody else. And then you have to stand out somehow, to be hired.And, do not rely on an AI. Can happen that your client prohibits any and all AI usage where the data goes through third party cloud services. What will you do then? Oh, and do not try to hack your university's/college's systems. Some of my course mates got into problems when trying out stuff.In terms of tech stacks then learn these things that are actually in demand in your area. Sure, the curriculum should already support that but if it does not do that then it is up to you to check different job offers and see what is required from developers, there. And that applies to any path you are picking. May it be an AI, a mobile app development, an IoT development, a web application development, a data science, or something else.",

        "body": "Funny story I actually just answered a very similar question is the cs majors sub lol I will paste my answer here:First, if you want to study cs get a cs degree and then specialize after. From my experience and talking to professionals degrees like cybersecurity, information systems, and data science (do a stats major instead) are not as good.As for knowing what you want to specialize in I don't think there are any shortcuts besides trying stuff and seeing if you like it. Either take a class or build a project and see if it's cool. You can also research online about the different cs disciplines. If you decide on embedded systems I think computer or elctrical engineering is a better major, but it prob depends on the school.Regarding how economically cooked the different cs subdisciplines are, they honestly aren't that cooked. What's (or rather who) is cooked is the person who graduates, has no extracurricular experience, and is only interested in the doing bare minimum to get money.The truth is that cs isn't an easy path to 6 figures. You either need to genuinely like it or be very disciplined because the degree is only like 30-40% of the puzzle. Join tech clubs, do competitive programming/leetcode, build stuff, and give it your all! It's such a cool subject that touches all the sciences, math, and unifies it under this neat idea of very clearly describing a process.PS: Maybe it's just personal bias but it seems that web dev is the most vulnerable to AI. There's hella ai tools like replit and loveable that can already handle most basic-intermediate apps. Also if you want to be immune to ai get a job writing like cobol for a bank or visual basic for some unc company.Now specifically regarding some stuff you asked: You should stay general until you know what you like, at least until like you finish your first year or two of uni. You'll have enough time to skill up specifically for your interest. Focus on fundamentals and you'll be flexible enough to pivot. Also, even if you end up going into like embedded, building a website will still make you a better and more well rounded programmer.",

AI is the latest hot thing today, but who knows what will be the next thing a year or two from now? Maybe the AI bubble will have already popped by then, and if you specialize in AI early on, based on current trends, you'll be left on ice.So be a generalist in your studies and only specialize once you enter the workforce. That way you will have the skills to quickly and efficiently learn any niche you want, and have the knowledge of which niche is in demand at the time you'll be looking for work.",

But even then, without a knowledge and skills you won't be hired to better tech roles. A university graduate can apply to that company and they will hire him over you.Better go for a CS degree. If necessary then lower your work load while doing your studies. It won't be easy. I did my studies while working part time. And I had no free time of my own. Just learning multiple coding languages will not merit you. Software development is not a Pokemon catching. No point to learn a new language when you can't make anything meaningful with it. Also, no point to learn a new language when that language is not in demand where you are living (forget remote jobs as a beginner).Go for a degree, concentrate on gaining knowledge and putting it into a practical use. And on your own learn these languages that are actually in demand in your area. And then not just learning a new language for the sake of learning it, but learning it to solve some real world problem with it, by building an actually useful project (no calculator apps. Nobody will use these).",

We make useful software for our users.So, when you're starting to get adept with some particular tech (in your case js and python) your next step is to use that tech to make somethihg useful. The whole creative process has more steps than just laying down lines of code. Planning it, packaging it, deploying it so others can use it, are just as important.Simple games are a good choice, because they're inherently useful: people play them for fun. Sure, you can learn another language. But, if you do a couple of projects first, you'll get more out of your effort to learn that new language.Also, it has to be said, in your programming career you will probably need to learn new languages or othe major tech at least a dozen times. And that's a big effort. So, now, early on, your task is to learn the WHY and HOW of the effort of learning a new language. Doing projects helps with the WHY.Welcome to our great trade.",

It the course you're taking hasn't mentioned getting up and running with an IDE and a virtual env, I have to question how good a course it is.I would suggest trying to avoid resorting to AI to understand a script. Look up the parts you don't understand in the Python documentation (which is very well written, typically, and very useful) and then play around with them until you understand them. An AI can teach you things, but usually it just hands you the answer and you don't learn anything except how to communicate with an AI.",

In practice mode, you stop at error, go back to mistakes you make, and drill them to perfection. In performance mode, you ignore all the mistakes you make since, well, you are performing and stopping at every mistake is just going to make everyone notice them and get them really annoyed.Applied to programming, you use as little help as possible during practice mode.

So put that site out of your mind completely. You shouldn't even be considering library's like numpy until you have a good grasp of computer science and programming.If you want to learn Computer Science and really understand programming you need to engage in the equivalent of a 4 year CS program. If you are going to DIY this find a program online that starts out with C/C++ and learn how software actually works. You need to stay with one of those C languages until you have successfully built and UNDERSTAND, at least a couple of data structures. A good program at this point exposes you to other languages.For now stay away from AI and Python. They will both become extremely important in your future but first you have a lot to learn.",

Of course, you can also go on job posting and look at their required stack and learn those too.Don't worry about forgetting stuff happens to me all the time, I google CSS all the time like whats + vs > vs \\~ selectors. As long as you know a decent amount or a vague idea you can always google it. JS wise, its pretty similar to any other programing lang. just in different synax and how the underlying feature works. But, overall its all about practicing without the tutorials (you can still google to help, like I google all the time and I worked at federal agency for frontend stuff).",

        "body": "Is the newest thing also stable and reliable? Older thing can have its issues worked out and fixed. Perhaps only some very obscure corner cases are still generating Github issues. But other than that, the thing is stable and \"it just works\". Whereas the newest thing can have multiple open issues.Is the newest thing actually maintained? Recently I had to make a technical analysis for a new microservice and had to come up with an architecture proposal for it. I considered different alternatives. There was a library A and a library B. Library A had been around for many years. Sure, it had a lot of bloat and stuff, but it worked. Library B also seemed to work. Less bloat. Promising. BUT the maintainer/developer/owner of that library had abandoned that project. For 2 years there had been no commits. Github issues were abandoned. Yes, that B was newer than A but it was abandoned. Whereas A was older, did have more bloat, but was in active maintenance. Recent commits to update versions. Recent commits to fix vulnerabilities. etc.Is the newest thing that you should consider in the current geopolitical world? Let's say you are a developer in the US. Will you use a library made in China, in Russia, or in Iran? By itself the library can be newer and perhaps also better. BUT the decision makers can start making decisions where they tell the developers to make the library close sourced and you won't have any overview of the changes. Decision makers can introduce kill switches or backdoors. Or, the developers will collect data and send it to their data brokers. And then that data will be used in a competitive manner. One of the many reasons why one should think twice if he should use Deepseek AI, for example. Technically very promising LLM model. Also, it introduced many changes to other LLMs in the world. But, it follows the political agenda of China. It is not neutral.Does the newest thing have enough documentation? Older stuff can have massive documentation compiled by many developers over years. A new thing can have close to no documentation and you have to be one of the pioneers creating that documentation on the go.How is the new thing fitting in the existing infrastructure? Perhaps it does not even work? Yes, stuff often is meant to be backwards compatible, but not always it is the case. For example Spring Boot 2.x vs Spring Boot 3.x and different libraries. Some newer libraries expect you to use also newer Spring Boot version. Also newer Java version. You can't just throw the newest library in the code and hope that stuff works.Do you have resources (time, budget) to make upgrades to support the newest tools and the newest versions?How will you balance constant upgrades with adding new functionality and maintaining the project as a whole? A new library version can come out every month, for example. Will you concentrate on version upgrades over working what the client actually cares about? It is difficult to \"sell\" version upgrades to a client. You have to prove that it is needed. Yes, Dependabot is a thing but some time will still go into reviewing its MRs and doing smoke testing to ensure that untestable stuff (for whichever reason) works.With you updating stuff, will you break something that external service providers are using? You can't expect them to update their stuff because you are doing constant upgrades.",

It's called a 'Backend for Frontend', because all it does is usually all you need as a Frontend Dev. If you plan to only learn Javascript as a proper programming language, Node.js is a popular choice for backend development, if it gets more complicated than that. That's totally doable. For many things, expecially small to medium scale solo dev projects, you can totally get away with just JS, yes.At some point this no longer scales very well, but you can always cross that bridge when you get there and notice JS is limiting you. You can't build a 'Facebook' scale Project on just JS.. But Facebook started with just PHP, because that's what they knew how to write.Bottom line is - yes you can build useful stuff with just JS. Sure.VSCode the IDE you are statistically likely using - is entirely written in JS.",

I'm glad my feedback could be useful.Hopefully you found this new code to be easier to read and to possibly extend in the future, at least from my perspective I would feel that way lol. If/Else statements are very powerful, but once you start chaining tons of them, it is always a good place to stop and ask if you can do it in a better way, whether that be with a match / switch case (some languages call them switch), or using a design pattern like a state machine.Good example of that would be a video game character with multiple states like crouching or jumping. Someone could string a dozen if/else statements, and check nested if/else statements inside those blocks... Or they could use a state machine.On that note, I hope this [website](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) all about design patterns can be of use to you.Happy I could help, all the best and happy holidays!",

Run it on GitHub Pages so now it is on the Internet too. Good stuff to learn to get that far. Then add the next small thing by adding a backend server and modify your TODO application to POST tasks there instead. POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE are REST verbs you can learn about. Just print the tasks to the console for now. Once you have that working add a database and save a POSTed task to the database using SQL. INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE are SQL statements that map directly to the REST verbs and they are often referred to as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Fill in the GET (SELECT) request to retrieve your tasks, the UPDATE, then DELETE. Now your application is full stack.Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn, when you need to learn it. MDN is a great resource for the frontend and there are many great resources for whatever backend and database you choose.As you build this, you are doing all of this locally, frontend, backend, database, and committing changes to git and pushing those changes to your GitHub repo as you go. To get your GitHub Pages frontend to talk to your backend running on your local machine you can learn about CORS (allows your frontend to talk to your backend) to add that to your backend then use \\`ngrok\\` to temporarily expose your server and port to the internet (only works while \\`ngrok\\` and your computer are running).Now that you have a full stack application running on the Internet, time to learn about authentication to make it so only registered users can access your server. You will add login/logout to your frontend and backend as well as user management. More REST and CRUD stuff to add for that too.Cloud stuff is next to get all of it running on the internet. That is a later topic.Whatever projects you pick, build projects as completely as you can. Make them full stack if that is your thing. Take TODO and add subscriptions/payments, member management, calendar schedules, email/sms reminders, single-sign on, SaaS deployment (cloud), whatever else you can think of. If you just do frontend, touch every angle of it in your projects.This is a possible roadmap for you that will keep you busy and hopefully motivated for a while. Once you can do this, you can pretty much build anything.Start small and keep adding small things to it.I hope this helps.",

        "body": "Picture yourself in the early 1980s. There is no internet. There barely are any knowledgeable people in your area. Formal programming education is basically non existent before University.All you have is the *documentation manual* for the programming language.How do you learn?Through experimentation. You have no resources, so the only thing you can do is play around, try things. Fail. Try more. Fail again. Try more and eventually succeed.You won't learn by copying tutorial or stackoverflow, etc. code. You will only learn by creating your own code, even if that means that your solutions are maybe complicated, convoluted, and sub-optimal. Yet, they are *your* solutions. They stem from *your thought process*. This way, you *learn*.Once you have a working solution, there is no harm in looking up how others have solved the problems. This way, you can learn better, more optimized approaches. Yet, first *you* need to figure out a solution.The notion of directly looking for solutions via the internet is detrimental to learning, even more so in the current age of permanent availability of the internet, and worse, with the advent of AI. It makes us lazy. It makes us stopping to think analytically. It makes us stop investing effort, because \"why should we when everything is readily available?\". In return, it makes us stop actually *learning*. Learning means struggling. Learning means failing. Learning means debugging. Learning does not mean getting a solution from effectively a third party (no matter if Google, Stackoverflow, AI, etc.)Discipline yourself to not looking for direct solutions and even less *in code*, but to look for *approaches* to solutions. Maybe, download the documentation for your programming language and then cut yourself off the internet. Seems like a radical step, but can be extremely helpful for learning.The thought process from problem to solution is what really counts in programming, not the *implementation* in a programming language (that's the more trivial part and just a necessary evil).Once you understand how to \"think like a programmer\" things change considerably. Programming languages become less important and you learn to work on a more abstract, conceptional level.Maybe, try some programming competitions, like [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (with the accompanying subreddit /r/adventofcode) - current year is over, but the challenges are all accessible back to the very first season in 2015. Another recommendable site is [Exercism](https://exercism.org). Here, you get challenges and have \"hints\" and guidance.As usual with such posts (of which there are more than plenty), some Literature (aka *books*):+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles PetzoldTo address your \"all coders do is just copy-paste\" statement: yes, we do copy paste, but not because we *could not do the job*, it's because of time constraints, trusted and tested solutions. Contrary to a beginner/learner, we can assess what a solution copied from the internet does, how it fits into our codebase, what side effects it has, etc. We could come up with our own solutions, but that would be less efficient in a professional setting than to resort to tested and trusted solutions.",

So to truly understand the underlying theory, building your own is a good idea.But, noone is going to buy your homebuilt project, or hire you to build another - then want you to be able to use the tools they have already paid good money for, and they want you do do it well and do it fast!So don't go building your own as an excuse not to learn the tricks of the tools - but also, don't just be a tool-user, but make sure you understand enough to be able to learn any tool.My recommendation *(as someone who doesn't know anything about the business)* is to go on with building your own, but remember that it is a hobby-project, something you only do for the learning experience. And then as your \"professional project\" build something with the modern tools, to show off how well you know them!",

Building an engine with C++/OpenGL will force you to explore lots of aspects of C++ and programming in itself. IT will push you to undersatnd DSA well, coz you will have to implement really effective and less time consuming algos. Get rid off this notion of \"insecure about my math/physics background compared to students from elite schools\"That is the beauty, you cant know everything ahead, you will discover new things. I see that you want to use OpenGL! But I gonna challenge even for even farther step - build your own simple CPU graphics engine. Learn how 3D cooordinates get converted onto the 2D screen! IT is physics :) You already have a tech background, all is your hands. I suggest for that [https://www.scratchapixel.com/](https://www.scratchapixel.com/) , a free and amazing learnign source. Listen to your innver voice - professors might be wrong...even if you wont succeed 100%, you will acquire lots of useful info and materials and habits....have fun!",

People tend to respect you more when you have integrity and boundaries. I wish more people would find this out for themselves. One of my proudest moments as a people manager at a previous job was when I refused to be involved in an initiative to document my team’s work so that it could be offshored.

Immigrant, visa or junior devs don't have any leverage right now, and there is a very real risk that they get laid off for this kind of disobedience, causing them to be locked out of the field forever if finding the next job takes too long. Being able to say \"no,\" for non-technical reasons no less, and keep your job is quite a privilege.What you're proposing here can't work on an individual level, and while your decision to stand your ground is commendable, it will ultimately make no difference. Telling others to do the same without first establishing the conditions to have any leverage is basically just asking them to risk their future for nothing. Particularly people like you would be required to join and lead this effort for collective action, but often times the devs with actual leverage will not do so for perceived personal gain.",

Are people adjusting yearly, are they doing it later with stock inflation (we are in an insane bull market for tech)? Do people just straight up make up salaries on there? People I know are getting worse offers than 2020-2022 era, especially adjusted for inflation. The people I know making bank got an offer then, stayed through it and their company is like up 2x so they are making historic money. They will cliff in 2025-2026 and go back to normal salaries for their role (still FANG).  So you could have someone claiming 350k for an E5 or 600k, when new offers are more like 325k. I think the industry is obviously down. Layoffs and wage stagnation are very real.  The only people who leveled up this year are AI scientists.",

These are the enrollment statistics for universities in Ontario, which is the province where I'm from: [Statistics | Ontario Universities' Application Centre](https://www.ouac.on.ca/statistics/). If you look at the statistics by program group tab and you filter for 2024 in one box and 2025 in the other, you can see that there has been a noticeable drop off equal to approximately a 25% reduction not just in applications, but also in acceptances/confirmations for CS programs. Although these are only statistics for Ontario, I have no reason to believe that the same would not be happening elsewhere; I doubt there's anything special about these statistics compared to any others. And clearly, this shows that the cat is out of the bag regarding how CS is a more competitive field than it used to be, so there's no reason to suggest that enrollment won't keep decreasing for the foreseeable future.",

Let me reiterate functional testing is important to everyone, but code quality only matters to devs. A lot devs in India (and other off shore locations) aren’t paid enough to care about code quality but they do as a matter of pride care about the functional output being correct - the part their management and customers will see. Ironically this matches exactly with what the business and customers want. Why deal with a bunch of “overpaid” people complain about the need to refactor and take care of tech debt all the time perceived to be moving slowly and being difficult to manage when you can get others who will accept less pay and just do what you want them to do.",

It has its uses, its not completely unusable and if you are creative you will find a way for it to do something its good at - but mostly its terrible at real engineering. I now interpret other developers talking about how helpful ai is for them to be a sort of self-report. The thing ai is best at is implementing things like functions with very strict input and output, and creating tests... which has literally never been the engineering bottleneck in my experience. The real work of an engineer is turning customer feedback or PO requests into a cohesive system that will solve a need. Even before ai, most of my coworkers didn't struggle with function implementation, some were even better than me at it... the thing they mostly struggle with is architecture and ownership, and ai appears to be *hurting* this more than it's helping.So yeah, I feel pretty gaslit as well.",

I would never in a million years think to use Copilot of ChatGPT for a task. I wouldn't even really consider those products to be coding tools compared to how useful Claude Code is. But even a tool like Claude Code is only as good as the person directing it. It's not a replacement for a junior, but it is a replacement for a few hours a day I might've wasted context switching between code bases. If somebody is speaking broadly about AI, I kind of tune it out. There's a big difference between what each tool is good at regardless of what the benchmark scores say. I'd much rather use the things and figure out for myself if they work. If something sucks, don't use it and try something else if you want.",

Good engineers can almost smell where a problem is coming from. And that's not about using the debugger tools well, it's about training your instincts. Good engineers can debug systems without seeing any of the code much less running it in a debugger.There's lots of tools to help with diagnostics, but it's the process and the experience that really make the difference. Bad engineers have the same access to logs, metrics, tools, etc that good engineers have...and yet bad engineers often can *NEVER* find a problem that a good engineer will pinpoint in minutes.And \"debugging\" doesn't just stop at software: Once you develop the mindset and practices you end up applying it everywhere. After all, building software is really about *debugging people's problems* and patching them with software. Bad engineers write bad software because fundamentally they can't diagnose the problems users are having that they are hired to fix as a software developer.How do you get there? Have a talent for it helps a lot. After that it's lots and lots and lots of debugging of everything, everywhere, all the time.",

Even as a jr, document everything you do. Just finished a big project? Most jobs use a documentation system where you can just look up how to do things. Even a simple \"how to run this test\" can go a long way and is proof of what you did. \\- When you finsih something, give yourself credit and post it somewehre or mention it in standup. This is somethign many of us struggle with, giving ourselves credit. To get promoted you want the higher ups to know what you did and how you participated in that. \\- Take 10 minutes after standup to present anything or even show a doc. Again, you want to be recognizable. You want your boss to say \"OP had a good presentation post-standup that was really interesting\". \\- It's better to do 5 tasks and shwo your work than it is to do 10 tasks and keep quiet. This was my biggest issue. Id do tasks but never really wanted the praise or to present it so i kept quiet. My coworkers thought i wasnt doing much and in review seasons i didnt have much coworkers to sing my praises. \\- Dont be a passive engineer. A lot of engineers are good but are very passive. In stand up they dont really say they are stuck, they only say \"i continued working on X and investgiaging a small issue\". Nothing else. Nobody is going to help if you dont say \"im stuck\" and trust me engineers get more mad if you spend a week stuck on the same issue then if on day 1 you say \"im stuck\". Time is money. Reach out to coworkers and talk to them about issues. That conversation could lead you to getting close with a higher up engineer. If you as a junior can get a principal engineer to back you up, that goes a far way.",

I’ve been at my current position (my first one since outside of college) for about a year and 10 months give or take. From working there so far, I have worked with two really good engineers. Both of them have had two totally different experiences, but surprisingly, both have ended up in the same place doing the exact same thing. One of them was a self taught developer who tinkered with programming at a young age and learned many languages. Unfortunately, he didn’t pursue a CS degree because he grew up very poor but is in the works of getting one right now. This dude had many personal projects under his belt and worked extensively outside of work getting tasks at work completed. He had around 15 years of experience working with software and loved programming. He knew embedded programming really well too including how PLCs work and loved learning new things about programming. The other had a CE degree from Michigan Tech and has around 15 years of experience. He worked with embedded programming for the bulk of his career at GE Aviation. He really enjoys learning about new technologies and currently is helping us bring into the modern era an older application. This dude is my current mentor and has taught me so much in terms of how to program and ultimately, how to go about architecting and designing programs. He is a monster, he designed a completely new product from an older application at my company and reverse engineered the way it works so that it translated properly to a new language and environment. My coworkers had told him that the old project was a mess since it was written with a very old version of C++ (to most of us it was a mess lol). But he straight up in the interview said “nothing scared him”. My bosses laughed at him but he proved US ALL wrong. The thing about both of them that made them really good engineers was that both of them explicitly stated to me that all they did was “breathe and live” code. They programmed on all their free time and worked many hours outside of the usual 40 hour work week perfecting their craft. They read books, watched videos, they absorbed so much information on their free time that it clearly showed when they came into work ready to start their day. Like I feel helpless sometimes just seeing that they can take on so many tasks (especially tough ones) and my tasks I complete are mediocre at best. But the thing is, I am absorbing the knowledge they give to me. I’ve learned so much from starting my position that I don’t think I would be anywhere near where I am in knowledge and experience without either of them.",

It may take less time to develop than technical skills, it depends on where you're at with things like handling stress, communication etc. It feels longer because people tend to, unwittingly, neglect it until they've bombed several interviews.The key thing is that self-study conditions are radically different from real interviews. There's no one breathing down your neck while you problem-solve. The time pressure, high stakes, and interviewers disrupting your thought process aren't simulated. This is often why people brain freeze in interviews.Do mock interviews alongside your self-study to identify your weaknesses, and ideally start them early so you have more time to fix issues. Here are two relevant resources: one on [getting truly interview ready](https://www.coditioning.com/blog/11/complete-tech-interview-prep-roadmap), another on [key interviewing skills](https://youtu.be/V2czxOT_hwU). You'd probably never feel 100% ready, but at least tick all the necessary boxes before stepping foot in interviews for jobs that you care about",

Even if problems seem similar it may show up with a different constraint and you the solution you'd normally do for that problem might no longer be effective or even feasible. Basically you get an increased scope of knowledge on top of the hindsight of knowing what approaches works well in a situation of multiple approaches being \"correct\".In the example you gave the big thing is scope. You can design and architect a website or microservice but also remember generally thats an extremely small scope and more than likely is a solved problem. Like anyone could go on some system design prep site and know how to design and architect twitter or facebook or some trading site. Where the seniority in that comes in is knowing why you may want to take some approaches vs others based on needs because you've had prior experience making such calls. Often time what you think in your head or what works on paper doesn't play out the same in reality and there tends to be a lot of edge cases that are missed.What makes the big n experience so valuable is because you get exposed to a unique scale problem. Because they work around stuff so big they get to see the extreme edge cases a little more frequently even if theyll never directly work on it but just that visibility is so valuable especially to similar sized companies. But you can turn around and see big n employees might not do well at a smaller company because the breadth of tools they need to know how to use might be something they never even have had to touch or think about previously. Or that scale isnt the big issue and theres another type of problem that needs to be solved.Like if you can crank out a business/ecom site effectively without much help or guidance (this includes truly understanding the business reasons behind what your developing) you are probably a senior at a non tech non super huge scaled company. But you wont be a senior at a company where scale matters and vice versa.You could be a senior level expert at CUDA programming and then be junior at cloud stuff. Thats why again id put senority to yoe/overall exposer and it changes depending on the scope.",

On the same day that I interviewed for the senior role, I also did a junior dev interview with a different company. They bombarded me with system design questions for a full hour, then sent a rejection email ten minutes after with no other feedback. A week later, I got offered the senior role and it paid $40k MORE than that shitty junior one. Point is: it's crazy out there and nothing makes sense. Don't let rejections shake your confidence.",

Harden your alerts, metrics, and your tests and you will *reduce* the chances of an outage. In my experience I've categorized outages as unforced errors and just being unlucky.Was the system down because of an unforced error? Lead a technical review on it. Why did it get to that point? How? How can you prevent it from happening again and how can you apply this to OTHER cases in the future? Reduce unforced errors to 0.Unfortunately. there will be times that you will need to put out fires. That's part of the job. For example, [Log4Shell - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) was a week ruiner for many. AWS, Azure, etc. outages have caused fires at work.Also fwiw if you're not really needed in these meetings, you can really just go to the concert and attend chats through your phone if you want.",

As a junior engineer, you can't decide this, but you can get the conversation going. \"Hey, what happens if...?\"Second, if there is no such procedure in place, then - all things being equal - I'm probably going to the concert. If it's one I could stand to miss, then maybe I'm making an offer: Cover the cost of my tickets plus something for the trouble. Something like that. But me helping you above and beyond the normal agreement is a favor, and sometimes I'm not in a position to grant you that favor. Boundaries are important.However, I'm also going to try to be accommodating within reason. In a situation like that, I'd offer to check in when I get back from the concert. If the issue's still ongoing, then perhaps some responsibility could be handed off to me so that others can get a break. This is probably really helpful as a junior, because while you might not be the best help for the initial incident, there can often be follow-up work that is less intensive. Like someone needs to run a database query every five minutes and make sure A stays less than B, until we can get the alert automation in place. And if I'm on the primary crew and I've been at it for six hours and a junior comes in at midnight and says, \"How can I help?\" you bet I'll hand that over and get some sleep.Finally, there's also the issue of Emergency Theatre. Do we really need all hands on deck? Or do we need the appearance that we're busting our butts to get it working again? There's not much you can do about this in the moment except recognize it and deal with it later. Figure out why this is the case. There's usually some failure in the management chain - some mid-level director with more power than sense, who has to be appeased. Or maybe a high-profile customer. Recognizing this and knowing it is very important as you navigate office politics in the future.",

The business would like to address that need on the timescale defined in the needs assessment. Maybe that's \"right now, ASAP\", maybe it's \"sometime before Q4\". The manager ultimately responsible for hiring the person described in the needs assessment does not have infinite time. That manager has other responsibilities that take them away from spending 8 hours per day on hiring. Also, [reqs vanish randomly, often without notice, without reason, and at the least convenient time.](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/wanted/) Even if I as the hiring manager had infinite time to hire this very special req, my budget owner/stakeholders very likely do not have infinite time to wait on the problem being solved.Most of the time, we try very ***very*** hard to hire an existing intern. They're already a vetted culture fit 9 times out of 10 and that's one less thing you as the manager need to sniff out. Half of the time they've already done the exact work you need done, and if they're an engineer you can just look over their commit history.",

E.g. maybe the job description says 6+ YOE but candidate has 4 YOE and has a Senior SWE title already, or it says looking for embedded C but candidate has several years of embedded Rust experience and has C listed at least somewhere.- If they wrote a cover letter, do they actually understand the kind of role they're applying to? If it's generic or looks like AI slop that's an anti-signal.- Does the resume indicate a clear understanding of WHY the info they list is important or worth mentioning? I do not want a laundry list of every task a candidate has ever done, I want the highlights that indicate skillsets and ability.- Have they articulated previously done work that's similar to what we're looking for, or are they just regurgitating a tech stack? For strong candidates I don't care if they have exact tech stack matches, but sometimes more junior or otherwise weaker-signal candidates will get to a screen for having rare tech stack matches.- Do I recognize their university, prior companies, or anything else on their resume (e.g. notable open source contributions, math or programming competitions, publications at relevant venues)?And frankly at the end of the day I am wildly overloaded and am one person making a quick judgement. I also put significantly more weight on candidates that have been referred to me somehow or who have a shared connection.

At my last job I was involved in hiring, and we would always get at least 1,000 applications in the first 24 hours after posting, usually we'd end up with 3-5k. We started with a code screen, basically a couple LC easy questions, that usually got us down to a few hundred. Then we'd divvy up the resumes and mark them as reject or pass. It was a quick glance maybe 5 seconds each resume to see if they had the basic qualifications, the vast majority of those failed. Then we'd be down to \\~20-50 people and we'd have our HR do a phone screen, basically ask about their basic qualifications, make sure they're interested in the job at the salary range we're offering and the tech stack they'd be working on. We rarely rejected anyone in this round but many took themselves out of the running so typically we'd be down to 10-20 at that point. Then we'd have the hiring manager have a phone screen with them. If they made it to this point they had something on their resume we liked, so we'd typically ask them about it and really drill down and ask for excruciating detail to make sure they actually did it. Spoiler alert, most people are exaggerating and/or lying about their specific contribution to a project on their resume, and it's super easy to weed out. That got us down to \\~5 which we would invite to interview.Once we selected to interview them, I would then read a cover letter if they sent one, although I think a lot of other folks didn't even read them then. This is also the point I would look at their github if they had one on their resume or anything else they included as side projects. I think I was one of the few people involved in hiring who did any of that most would just look at the resume 10 minutes before the interview. Then the interview was with a few folks, we had one do a tech screen where we give them a sample problem and watch them code, change requirements and see how they adapt. One does a culture fit interview where they ask questions related to soft skills, how do you handle conflict, those types of questions. One is a business round where our product person asks them some questions related to our business and some basic logic questions to see if they can reason through product requirement type things. Then everyone meets and ranks the candidates, we come up with a consensus order, and send the offer out to the first one, if they decline send the offer to the second one, etc. It's also possible at that point that some people just get a fail so even if they're the highest rated candidate we'd rather restart the process than hire them, although that's rare most people who've made it to this stage are at least getting hired if they're the best candidate interviewing for that role who accept because as you can see it's a long and painful process and we'd rather not start over.",

Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.If you're submitting an application, you are selling yourself. No salesperson in the history of ever has tried to get their counterpart to just read the product description. They want face time, to tell the story of their product, to make an emotional appeal.Do you think they send out empty e-mails, with just the technical specs attached and the words \"for your kind consideration\"? Or do you think they will use every sentence, every square inch of screen real-estate that they can get to make the other side interested in a conversation?Why on earth would anyone believe that the proven process would work differently when the opportunity you want them to grasp is yourself?For what it's worth, I currently going through my first hiring process on the employer side - I am sitting past an HR filter, so I don't even know if there were any cover letters; I wasn't giving any. But I can tell you this: The majority (of a very, very small pool) of CVs I have seen would not get a pass from me; there's too many slightly reddish flags, and as desperate as I am to work with a larger team, I simply don't have the time to allow someone to correct the misconceptions that their CV has created in the first place.But I would have read a cover letter; I would have read a slightly more detailed CV, and some of the things that tripped me up could have potentially been explained away. Who we invite is not entirely my choice, but I do get a say.And your problem is: I don't aim to be fair, I don't give a damn about giving you a chance. I care about filling a vacancy with someone who primarily has the right skills, enough experience and who I can stand having to talk to a few times a week.And if I know one thing it is this: Once we do hire someone, I lose my voice. I can't get them fired if I think they're a dud, or hard to get along with, so - for my own sake - I have to be very careful and weigh working in a team that's too small vs. working with someone I don't want to work with.And then, neither a CV or a cover letter take eons to write, or to customize for a specific position. Make your documents modular; have blocks that you can shift around if needed, and templates that you can remove or include.Believe me, I write cover letters when I apply for jobs. I have zero proof and no data to show that they work - but I really don't see a world where it's not worth the bit of extra effort.",

It probably feels scammy because companies are keeping it under the radar to avoid pissing off software engineers, but that's just my theory. It's a degrading idea to utilize technical workers as independent contractors, especially for SWE that are accustomed to being valued and in-demand as full-time workers.I don't think it's you aging out, it's more about the field itself abandoning you or at least devaluing you. The hope is to find a company that still values software workers and get lucky with being offered a job there.",

You have more time to yourself to plan your next move, or take some time for self-care. So this would benefit you.Ideally you would have F-you money, so that you could take the mental/emotional route without the stress of wondering if you have enough to meet financial obligations. My personal opinion: if this job is really affecting your mental health to the point where you don't care about getting fired, then you should feel empowered to let it go.

Helpful for people who forget to track their work throughout the year.  3. Manager-side summarization - Some companies are experimenting with AI to help managers synthesize feedback from multiple sources.The biggest shift I've noticed isn't AI doing the reviews—it's AI making it harder to hide behind vague statements.

It produced a ton of products used in homes, and even had a massive research wing. Getting a job there was seen as being set for life. You had a job for life and a nice pension for retirement.In 1981 a new CEO came in. He cut any non profit part of the company. Every department was expect to fire the bottom 15%, no matter how they did compared to others. I think he removed the pensions, but not sure on this one. GE’s stock price soared.Jack Welsh’s tenure at GE was the catalyst that set corporations to become what they are today. Also a CEO’s job is to increase share price. They can be removed and fine (woe is them /s).If you want stability and to be appreciated for the work, and you’re in the US, go govie. Maybe not right this second, because the current admin is anti-government worker. However, you won’t make big tech money, but you can still get over 100k a year pretty easily. More if you go contractor, but you get more replaceable (being good at your job or having a clearance will still play a big role).",

        "body": "If another developer’s actions create obstacles that make your work more difficult, it is reasonable to raise those obstacles with your manager or whoever can address them. The focus should stay on the obstacle that is blocking you, not on the developer as a person.This framing positions you as someone trying to improve results for the company by identifying obstacles, rather than as someone “reporting” on a coworker. It avoids unnecessary interpersonal conflict and reduces the risk of backlash if your manager interprets it as a personal complaint.If the other developer’s behavior does not produce obstacles that actually impede your work, it is usually best to ignore it. Spending time and energy evaluating another person’s work habits is a distraction from producing strong results yourself.**Responding to your edit:** you’re saying that when your coworkers don’t do their work, you end up working overtime and feeling pressure to meet deadlines. That overtime and deadline pressure is the real obstacle being created by their lack of follow-through.That’s understandably frustrating. The right response is to communicate clearly with your manager about project status and work allocation. When work is assigned but not completed, you should state that the project is off track, explain that tasks are being reallocated, and explicitly note either that you are working overtime to meet deadlines or that deadlines will slip as a result of the reallocation.This gives your manager the opportunity to recognize and credit your extra effort, or to see that deadlines are being missed because work isn’t getting done and needs to be reassigned. Ideally, this leads them to independently notice that a particular coworker is consistently not completing their work.If your manager does not acknowledge your overtime and instead simply pressures you to work harder, then the issue is poor management. That’s unfortunate, but it is a separate problem from how you should handle the situation with your coworker.",

Keep your jQuery sharp, it's still relevant while working with those frameworks.But it looks like you're primarily specializing in C++, going by your projects? It might be worth doubling down on that angle and perhaps picking up Rust as well.Either way, you should tailor your resumes to the platform(s) you're applying to work on. A resume that says \"I do everything\" isn't going to catch eyes the way that \"I'm your C++ expert\" can. Resumes are brochures of what you can do in the posting you apply for.

So what I decided to do is turn that boring work into something exciting. Even if im not getting paid more for spending extra efforts on it, I felt pleasure in the work from praises by upper management. Just getting your name recognized at the top can be a motivational aspect that turns something boring into something exciting like: \"how can i surpass myself even more next time?\"For example, I worked a few years ago on a feature to create some key vault. So its a process feature, literally no programming, you could get it done in 1 hour by click click click > done. But I decided to present it on a review meeting and instead of the typical boring power point slides that engineers talk through to present their work, I decided to make it dramatic. Kinda like a thriller. I looked up articles on what happens if Secrets arent stored in a key vault. And I got a couple news articles about Uber for example or some other companies in which their credentials like API keys weren't securely stored and thus a breach happened. So basically I took these examples, added ominous bgm, and started narrating it like its a thriller movie lol. The meeting turned from boring to everyone quickly locked in. Their reactions were priceless. In the end i got all the engineers to store their credentials in the key vault. This is just one example of how you could turn something boring into something thrilling and exciting. Upper management started inviting other managers whenever they saw my name on the presenters list. They became like my fanbase \"I wonder what he has for us this time!\" Lol Personally that became my passion for a while! That has bolstered my mental outlook even if it wasnt a monetary incentive involved. Money isn't everything sometimes (in terms of satisfaction/happiness), and in a way, it actually unlocked a skill in me: story telling. Thats a skill of product managers, so it opens up more career options!",

Also, we don't have free reign to choose whatever stack we want. There are languages that our developers are familiar with, ones for which we have tooling (e.g. Terraform modules), and for which we can easily collect metrics. I got in a bit of trouble for using Python for a cloud function script because it wasn't an \"approved language\". IMO, you can absolutely build something that would scale to 100m daily users in Python or Ruby (not that I would want to), as the language matters much less than the architecture and actual implementation. I think there is this idea that you need to use C or Rust to get the \"absolute best performance\", and that is probably true on a micro scale, but on a macro scale, you can just use a native extension and get the same performance boost without actually writing low-level code.",

Here are some platforms that connect businesses with candidates: [https://pathforward.org/returnships/](https://pathforward.org/returnships/) [https://www.reachire.com/returnships-for-business/](https://www.reachire.com/returnships-for-business/) [https://www.irelaunch.com/relaunchers#get-started](https://www.irelaunch.com/relaunchers#get-started)I did not find work through that, but through some of the resources I found on these websites, I was able to learn how to frame my career break for future interviews positively.

At my last job my manager actually had a whole meeting with me about gold lining and 80/20 rule. What i really gained from that convo is that in business its super hard to value \"mental work\". You cant really put that into a metric and more specifically if you have story points to your tickets, that'd be the only real way to show mental work in the stuff you do. You have to be your own advocate in that regard. But even still at the end of the day the deliverable is the only thing others can do something with so as you stated thats kinda what you should do if you want to excel in the business sense.",

By the time I as the engineering manager am reviewing your resume, it's probably 3 minutes prior to your interview, or if I were really lucky, maybe I reviewed your resume the previous afternoon and took down a few notes. Sometimes, interviewers are swapped in last minute - you have no idea if your scheduled interviewer actually has to hop on an incident call, or has an emergency. Being shoulder tapped 5 minutes before an interview is common.",

My teams (also at “rainforest”) have all of the juniors working on infra at some point, and I highly recommend OP taking a step back and looking at the “meta” tasks. Explicitly “building AWS infrastructure” without seeing the patterns is a gap worth focusing on. I know life at that company suck and people will ghost you, but there are many people who WILL bend over backwards to help you figure these things out given you’ve done some digging yourself and can ask informed questions.In my experience pretty much all feature work at all levels is going to have to consider business logic and deployments to a service that runs on compute, extend or create DAOs that write to databases, add routing rules for new APIs to an LB, and update front ends — the foundation for an application; lambdas and queues and ddb streams are all very common patterns too. That alone is a really good place to start researching trade offs, which is something you can do very intentionally while building, or even by looking through low severity system issues during oncalls. If you’re on the hook for LLDs, there’s even more room to dig into trade offs and alternatives.",

Because, by your own admission, they haven't actually reached out to speak to you. They may be using automated tools to just spam out connection requests to keyword hits.These are low-quality connections for both you and the recruiters/HR people. The odds of these turning into mutually beneficial relationships are somewhere between zilch and nada.Put more thought into who you accept connections from, be more selective. I don't click Accept unless I've had a conversation with the person or they're connected with someone I know who can vouch for them. I also have my LinkedIn profile set such that no one can send me a connection request without first following me - adding that tiny barrier helps a lot.

Mind you, I started out working on build systems at FAANG, and it was very different than what it is today. The trick is to find platform teams that are hiring SWEs where you can build tools that take the pain of infrastructure off of the product teams.There are a lot of DevOps/SRE roles that intersect this space and are 90% config-writing (infrastructure as code), but if you can get into writing custom Terraform modules and Kubernetes controllers you'll be highly sought after. I had a recruiter recently tell me that they pay their platform SWEs more than their backend or frontend SWEs because they're more specialized and harder to find. It's not for everyone, but give it a solid try, you won't be boxing yourself in (at least this early in your career). I have specialized in this role for 10 years so I show up in searches for senior positions. Recruiters that find me for product teams will usually end up having the hiring manager reject my resume because I haven't worked on product for a decade. But I'm not pursuing those types of roles at this point anymore. I think you've got a ways before you're in that position. At your level it's normal to jump between domains to figure out what you like.",

Again, I promise, no judgement. We have all been there and it is hell getting out without flopping over to overdependence on AI. Stay diligent my friend.",

That's a little tongue in cheek, but it's worth having some perspective: people that work mining coal a mile underground don't do it for fun, don't study coal mining as a hobby, and don't participate in miner meetups. We all need to keep some perspective on how lucky we are that there's even a question there.In that vein:> I enjoyed going to the office, using my split keyboard, having triple monitor setup, cool desk decorationsI don't mean this to be discouraging at all: but you need to get more out of things than that. Not that there's anything wrong with enjoying better tools and environment - but careers are long and tweaking your setup isn't going to keep you motivated beyond the next few months, let alone decades.But all that said - you aren't entirely wrong. This is both a job and a career, and if you're not learning stuff or getting growth opportunities then that isn't good. You won't always have interesting things to build, but if you never get that then you're going to stagnate and that's where people run into trouble finding new jobs.You should be able to work with your manager to identify some growth areas and find some tickets where you can learn something. That's a perfectly reasonable expectation. But the key is to focus on what you can learn and what new skills you can build: it being \"exciting\" doesn't really enter into it.",

They're both the same. I went to college in Virginia and every recruiter came to the state's #1 Engineering + CS school (Virginia Tech) and almost every recruiter went to #2 (University of Virginia). I'm talking over 200 companies at alleged #35 Virgina Tech's [expo](https://www.sec.vt.edu/expo.html) where I got internship offers. We interviewed on campus in rented rooms.What matters is #1 work experience in the form of internship or co-op. #2 is university prestige so rankings but, again T30 vs T50 is fake. #1 or #2 in your state is fine. Like University of Wyoming has garbage rankings but companies in Wyoming will recruit there. After first job at graduation, university prestige matters much less, if at all.",

You're better off just getting a MS degree to strengthen your resume and trying to land a regular job again. Because - unless you are brilliant - what's actually going to happen is you're going to get a PhD, then you're going to be a postdoc for a couple of years making mid money, then you might get a faculty positon at like West Texas A&M University and you get to decide if you want to move to the outskirts of Amarillo, TX for your career.

Then after that is really the beginning of the more \"cool\" stuff like operating systems, cryptography, robotics, databases, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, computer graphics, compilers, algorithms, etc.>If programming makes sense, which language suits a math student who’s learning for understanding, not employability?Python (due to amount of resources online)>I want to keep learning mathematics If you have never taken Number Theory, I recommend the Intro to Number Theory book by Mathew Crawford from AoPS. I did that when I was in elementary school and it's a phenomenal book. And like all AoPS books, challenging.For Discrete Math, it's Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications, Kenneth Rosen.Those are the more \"CS\" sided part of math. Math majors of course would be: Calculus 1, 2, 3 -> Linear Algebra + Diff Eq -> Real Analysis 1/2 + Modern Algebra 1/2 -> Topology/etc",

I started learning C# early on in life because I loved video games and wanted to make them, there were two primary languages you could accomplish that with back then (this was about 20 years ago) C# with the XNA framework, or C++ with a library like SDL. XNA transitioned to monogame, and SDL is now SDL2. I believe Unity was around but it wasn't popular yet, unreal engine existed but the commercial license was expensive. I went with learning C# because I wanted to make games for the Xbox 360 and monogame was free to use, which I did, I launched two games before finding work in the industry doing web development. That was my path and it worked well for me.In your case, because you have a heavy math background and you're only interested in learning id try LISP or maybe Python. Those are less marketable languages but have heavier focuses on Math.Any mainstream language to start is a good one though. Game programming is fairly math intensive which you might enjoy but it's very labor intensive and requires a knack for art , if you don't mind trying to make your own graphics and aren't all that concerned about design philosophy then id still recommend C# and monogame. Maybe you could start by building pong and then transitioning to a game like tetris. Good luck!",

If you get past the sentence above, then think like an investor and ask them the hard questions. Do not hold back. Go hard on them. If they're competent and experienced entrepreneurs, they should welcome these types of questions from anyone they want to bring on board. After all, they're effectively asking you to be an investor, not just an employee:* Does either founder have any past experience running any kind of business?* Has either founder ever founded a startup before? If so, what was the outcome?* Ask to see their pitch deck, for them to give you the pitch.* Are they already seeking investment? I would imagine they must be if they don't have any cash of their own to invest. Ask to get a detailed report on their efforts so far and why they haven't found investment yet* Does either of them have any connections to people with capital (VCs, angel investors, etc.)?* Ask the hard questions: How soon do you expect to get funding? What is your contingency plan if that gets delayed? (funding often takes longer than anticipated even for companies with a good product, previous investment, etc.)There are a bunch of other more specific questions about early stage startups that should be google-able.

I can guarantee they won't hire a senior or CTO until they get funding. Also, good engineering practices cost money: licenses, infrastructure, etc.--not a lot of money, but they seem kind of short on money, which would be another good question to ask: if they can't even afford laptops, how will they afford AWS, etc.Good luck. I just want to make sure you approach this with hard realism: it's something to put on your resume, maybe you'll learn a few things. Anything else is like winning the lottery.

Going over all topics from linked lists to queues heaps graphs dp and more!If you just wanna build projects to reignite that love you have then you should definitely get your hands dirty wether it’s small things to help your own daily life like make a discord bot or a script to automate one thing in your life or following a YouTube tutorial and putting your spin on something that’s also great!The market is tough and I myself have been struggling but my advice for you is at the end of the day it’s all a numbers game. Get your hands dirty polish your resume, keep applying! Also AI is a tool, you simply utilize tools to your advantage. Not using it is your choice but I’d recommend the opposite !",

Fake check scam: https://old.reddit.com/r/Scams/wiki/index/automoderator#wiki_fake_check> The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.> > Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.> > When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html> > If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.",

I personally include tech stack for each position, but you could include the tech as you describe what you did. I think a tech stack list is easier to read quickly, though. The idea is rather than saying, “I did x,” you say, “I used Y to do X.” May make a difference. Right now, I don’t know if you just know SQL and a little bit of python. It were you manually fixing data by inspecting stuff individually? Most likely no one is doing that, but your resume feels kind of generic/shallow. There’s potentially missing stuff. Did you run this all locally? Were you involved at all with deployment or setup? You must have used some other services or libraries, right? Maybe not libraries, but hopefully you get the idea I’m suggesting. Good luck!",
