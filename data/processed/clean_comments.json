Their API that generally only deals with one record at a time. Some of these tables have millions of records per day. And on top of that their API doesn’t even cover all the tables we query. Told them to fly a kite. They came back a year later with a delta lake api for all the tables…with no option to say no. So now I get to download parquet files every 5 minutes for hundreds of tables and ingest all this crap into a local database. More time/energy investment for me and my company. They probably spent tens or hundreds of thousands implementing that solution on their side. They won’t make up the difference for years vs what we and some other clients pay them, and have only added huge technical debt for themselves and us in the process of just removing a direct access data source (that’s easy to maintain). :face_with_rolling_eyes::face_with_rolling_eyes::face_with_rolling_eyes:",

Power BI was always a friendly positivity-culture (which was kinda nice, and imo Power BI is a genuinely excellent tool), but that's moved into Fabric which doesn't deserve it. The pushers, are some of the same people that pushed Synapse until, overnight, the instructions swapped to the new product, Fabric. MS (seems?) to be putting so much effort into Fabric, maybe it will not suck someday? Certainly sucks now though, and it's a bit troubling that it still sucks 2 years on / breaking changes are made so often. Makes it vaguely feel like the fundamental archtecture isn't good, but idk. I'm sorry you got sucked into using it. Go watch Officespace again.",

Don't spend your time up front getting certifications and understanding all the of the tech. Spend your time finding the best people who already know it and ensure they are the ones leading individual pods of work. 2. Once you have that in place then spend your time figuring out what are the best aspects of your process and theirs and work on adapting both into an established best practice across both. There is a reason you all bought this company and they are probably smaller and used to a lot less red tape than you might put them through. 3. Think more about setting the vision and clearing operational blockers than learning every aspect of the tech stack. 4. Once you have this breathing room, circle back to diving in as detailed as you want and learn. Just food for thought. Congrats and good luck!!",

Since you mentioned acquisition lean on the people you're bringing in to get you up to speed and make sure you understand cost, moving anything to the cloud is not cheap.3. I would only learn enough snowflake to a) understand what exists, and b) understand where your existing platform may be plugged in. Again lean on the resources you've acquired.4. For CI/CD it's important, but learn whatever they're already using. It's probably not worth the effort to learn a bunch of systems and it's almost never worth the effort to move things, so you'll end up using what they've built anyways.That should set you up for coming up with a plan for migration if any. I would say be cautious on any move to cloud. You've likely invested in on-prem hardware already, and cloud isn't cheap. Make sure there's a real business gain before investing in a big move, and don't discount hybrid approaches.",

Refer to this [GitLab Enterprise Data Platform Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/enterprise-data/). It is quite comprehensive and well maintained.

That shift feels pretty fundamental.The biggest change on my side is tighter collaboration cycles. DE gets pulled in earlier when a new product idea forms since everyone knows messy upstream data will kill the project later. Ownership has improved a bit too, mostly because teams finally realized they can’t bolt governance on at the end.It still varies a lot by company, but the places that treat DE as a core layer tend to move faster and spend less time firefighting.

It is very much a distant third place in the cloud provider market share competition, but it's not insignificant, and arguably has an edge in certain areas (e.g. many related to data).I may be extrapolating too far, but I wonder whether you've tended to work at larger, more established companies? AWS benefits greatly from being the first mover, while Azure has good synergy with companies using Microsoft products and puts a lot of effort into Enterprise relationships.Smaller organisations are more likely to use Google Workspace. Tech startups in particular tend to like Apple over Windows, and dont have some of the considerations big, established companies do. These are rough trends, but in my experience companies on GCP tend to lean more in this direction.",

Normalize dialects with SQLGlot, auto-inject LIMIT/time windows, cap bytes scanned, and fingerprint each query tied to commit and user. Add pre-commit SQLFluff and a small suite of canary queries; CI should run EXPLAINs and sample-result checks before merge. Keep a dataset catalog that maps queries to dataset IDs and auto-writes lightweight docs next to the SQL; emit OpenLineage or DataHub events so ops can trace breakage.

I work in Norway and rather not describe the industry, as it is such a niche thing that a google search will hit us on page 1 lol - but it is a big and profitable industry :)Current project: establishing Snowflake as a data platform for enabling large-scale internal analytics on structured data. Basically involves: setting pipelines to copy data from operational databases into analytical databases (+ setting up jobs to pre-calculate tables for analysis team)Data size: a few TBs in total, but daily ingestion of < 1Gb.Stack: AWS Lambda (in Python) to write data from AWS RDS as parquet in S3 (triggered by EventBridge daily); (at the moment) Snowflake Tasks to ingest data from S3 into raw layer in Snowflake; Dynamic Tables to create tables in Snowflake from its Raw layer up to user's consumption; PowerBI as BI tool.Architecture choice was to divide our data movement in 2 main parts: \\- Part 1: From our operational databases to parquet files in S3 \\- Part 2: From parquet in S3 to Snowflake raw layer.Inside Snowflake, other pipelines to move from RAW to analytical-ready layer (under construction/consideration, but most likely will be dbt building dynamic tables) -> so a medallion architecture.The idea was to keep data movement as loosely coupled as possible. This was doable because we dont have low-latency requirements (daily jobs are more than enough for analytics)In my opinion, keeping the software developer mindset while designing architecture was the biggest leverage I had (modularity and loose coupling being the 2 main ones that came to mind). Two books that I highly recommend are \"Design Data Intensive Applications\" (for the theoretical aspects on why certain choices for modern data engineering are relevant) and \"Software Architecture: The hard parts\" (for the software engineering trade-offs that are actually applied to data architectures)",

No lineage, no visibility.Credit-card example: central team gave a DS team access to sensitive data *only* for fraud modeling. They built a derived table, and because there were no permission controls, that table suddenly became visible to everyone in the company. No one caught it for weeks.Company 3 (Large mobile-gaming company): Strong central platform team + distributed product analysts.Result: Honestly the smoothest setup I’ve seen. Even less technical analysts shipped fast because the platform team handled the heavy lifting.Company 4 (Small gaming studio): 1–2 engineers built the whole thing on Prefect + dbt and enforced strict rules manually.Result: Super slow, pipelines broke constantly, everything was fragile.Company 5 (Neo-bank): Huge data team, started doing full Data Mesh during COVID. Each domain ran its own infra and pipelines.Result: Now they’re trying to re-centralize everything, and it’s incredibly painful. Every domain has different tools, different workflows, different security assumptions. They literally said they wish they had standardized the platform from day one.So yeah, from everything I’ve seen:Having a strong central platform/governance team that sets the standards and provides the tooling, and then letting domains build data products on top of that, is the only setup that doesn’t blow up over time.",

They had mainly an old school on-premise solution which was built of multiple siloed data warehouses and depended on tribal knowledge to keep it running. I believe there was one super complicated ETL pipeline that would fail, and they only knew to restart it, until it finally ran. No one bothered to debug why it failed. A combination of older technology, and not managing tech debt because all stable data solutions wander into cost-centre territory where they only care about costs management. Anyway, onto your challenge -Multiple siloed analytics systems, some on-prem, some on private cloud, mish-mash of Azure/Microsoft based solutions and generally no one had a standard approach to data.So we architected a whole new data-mesh(-istic) approach. Hub-and-Spoke architecture built off Databricks for the Hub, bring what you want for the Spoke. Hub is your managed and governed central data lake. Spokes correspond to different domains of the business (Finance, HR, Customer Experience, Investment and so on.).More lower done, we maintain Landing, Bronze, Silver, Silver Plus (meant to hold curated/canonical model, still WIP), with the respective domain spokes having the Gold Layers.Our core idea was the data platform should be a genuine platform. Not just something to build analytics on. So now we can progress to building AI based applications, ontologies and so on without the restrictive mindset of a data platform being only to build data warehouses.For us Databricks has worked like a dream, and barring reporting (Power BI), we haven't considered needing to use it for anything else. Unity Catalog especially from this year, has been a knock-out for the use cases we have. And we still have more to implement - governed tags, data masking and so on.I would say it has been a success and the struggle is to keep innovating on it, than marking it as done and stable and letting tech debt accumulate over the years till someone else comes in and says let's make a new data platform but do it right this time. :-D",

Upstream data from source systems can absolutely create tough challenges and directly impact your downstream data quality. As data engineers, you often have to design and implement your own solutions to handle these issues and stay focused on what you can control.In a perfect world, data coming from CSVs, JSON files, PDFs, and application databases would already be clean, consistent, and well-structured. If that were true, our jobs would be 50x easier and everything would feel like rainbows, unicorns, and ice cream. But since that’s rarely the case, we have to build resilient pipelines that can detect, correct, and guard against bad source data. Welcome to data engineering my friend.",

Unless you know for a fact that your table will stay small and manage-able. Even in the case where your table is small, why would you want to re-process records? Answer varies case-by-case. Maybe its just easier to reload all data than to worry about how to update in place.Yes- staging table. Helps prevent issues with bad data loading into the db, but also by loading into a staging table, you can rely on the dbms to handle inserts/upserts where such a thing is not supported through whatever connector you're using. Unless you blow away the staging tables after each run, it's also helpful for troubleshootingIm not sure what a metadata driven pipeline is. Although it sounds like youre just storing config values in a table to be used when calling the api, which is pretty standard for pipelines in general. If youre using aws, you can store metadata into something like ssm, but if you're operating in a datalake (and it's not sensitive), you want everything consolidated.

That way, we know right from the ingestion layer if the schema is breaking the contract and we can work to remediate. Then, the pipeline can always assume that schema is enforced and we don't need to worry about missing or unexpected data.If it's some sort of public API that can change at any point, then the approach would probably be a bit different. Just throwing something out there this isn't necessarily how I'd do it, but perhaps store as just raw JSON, then parse out the data we actually need from it, and store that in a known schema (i.e. a bronze layer feeding into a silver layer). Of course, all of this will depend on *how* the API changes, so the real answer is that it has to be handled case-by-case (e.g. if a field is added or removed, but we don't use that field anyway, then we do nothing because it doesn't matter, but if we do use it, then we need to figure out what to do in the particular scenario).3 is again sorta dependent on the use-case. If I have access to the full source dataset and it's only a few thousand records, I wouldn't bother with incrementally loading data. I *might* do something like tracking which rows are new/updated if that's relevant to downstreams in the pipeline, but again, depends on the use case.For 4, I generally prefer loading into a bronze layer (if that's what you mean by \"staging tables\"). If it's easy to keep the source data, I don't really see a reason not to do so and to keep it close to the rest of the data (i.e. in the same warehouse). But there are of course cases when this is not desired (for example, if the source data is enormous and is mostly thrown away anyway, then I wouldn't want to waste the cost to store it).For 5\\*, I'm not sure what you mean by a \"metadata driven pipeline\". Do you mean using things like Iceberg or Delta Lake for CDC?",

In most cases I don't expect the schema to change so I want to know when it does since it could have impacts to downstream functions.2) Answered above. You can't remove old columns from the schema since there is old data likely using them.3) Full load if possible. My main reasons are that it's quick and if your source deletes rows without a method for getting which rows are deleted, an incremental update won't pick them up. This is very much dependent on a number of factors, so quite often a full load isn't the best option.4) If you have a need for a staging table, use it. If not, don't complicate things because it fits the design pattern you saw on a YouTube video.5) First time I've heard of this, but I read your explanation in a different comment. If you can use that pattern, go right ahead, I'm all for code deduplication. I think for a lot of people though, and certainly me, it would be far more trouble than it's worth. I work with about a dozen products from various vendors each with their own API auth methods, pagination rules, and return schemas. To try and cram all that into a generic pipeline would be a nightmare of if statements and rule exceptions. It just wouldn't work in my case. Dedicated pipelines are isolated so I know I can change one without it affecting anything else. I can see a generic pipeline having to be tested against everything it calls whenever a change is made to any one of them.If you have a setup where most pipelines use a similar setup, then yeah I can see it being useful, that's not my environment.",

After ingesting data from API and assuming flattening to tabularI think these concepts are all related. With JSON, you can just insert the JSON payload into a JSONB field with whatever fields happen to be in the JSON payload. So flattening wouldn't be necessary. And since flattening isn't necessary, you don't have to worry about whether fields are included, deleted, omitted, etc. from one payload to the next. Just query it using SQL with the JSON features that the database provides.Querying raw JSON using SQL is still relatively new. Some databases (e.g. postgres) are excellent at it. But even the ones that are not yet, they will likely only get better. Demand for these features will only grow with time imo.",

For example, you present your data in proper form to facilitate analytics, you have your date-based data presented vertically, so your months go top to bottom ascending. There are some who have cognitive barriers that prevent them from comprehending those outputs... unless the dates are present horizontally left to right.So there are a myriad of reasons why users wish to export and do their own thing. This applies ro tech and non-tech people alike. It does require a certain trained skill to read reports, and everyone is different in their cognitive design and abilities, all you can do is find that balance that caters for all abilities and levels.Don't be disheartened - in this industry, it's totally the norm, just try to find a way to buiild a comprehensive solution that caters for these different types of needs.Good luck!",

The aim is to stop people editing 'data storage' spreadsheets directly (each form should also be an easy thing to set up).So what have we achieved?- added some level of control over data entry- introduced BigQuery, allowing you to start defining transformations in SQL (e.g. Views, Scheduled Queries), and setting up the foundation for the future- decoupled data analysis from data storage. Data analysis with spreadsheets reading well-managed data from BigQuery is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight pattern- prepared everyone for a future where you have data entry methods write directly to BigQuery, without spooking the horses- oh, and for free your data is ready to analyse out of the box with 'Looker Studio' (free, not to be confused with Looker 'proper'), allowing you to set up reasonably nice dashboards",

Apps Script sidebars + validation absolutely work, and it’s a common way to modernize workflows before moving to something like BigQuery later.The main thing to watch out for is long-term maintenance. Once the logic grows (sidebars, menus, validations, logs, error handling), you become the only person who can support the Scripts. That can be tough when you’re the lone “tech” person. Since you’re on Google Workspace, i suggest to look into Zenphi as an alternative to Apps Script. It covers pretty much everything people usually build in Apps Script—supplier/product workflows, validations, approvals, logging—but without writing code, which makes the system easier for others to understand and maintain.",

Wire lineage and tests into the run: OpenLineage for run metadata, Great Expectations or dbt tests as gates, and fail fast with alerts to Slack/PagerDuty that include run links. Lock interfaces with data contracts so schema drift breaks CI, not prod. Promotion path: infra as code for env parity, MLflow as the model registry, shadow/canary deploys, and a feature store (Feast) to keep train/serve consistent. Have one dashboard for ops with logs, metrics, and run status; Datadog or Grafana + Loki works.With Prefect and MLflow handling runs and model registry, DreamFactory helps when we need quick REST APIs over Snowflake/SQL Server so product teams can call models and tables without spinning up new services.Make failure obvious, standardize the path, and production stops taking months.",

A production pipeline should never fail silently. If the issue is more on the SLA side you can use an observability tool external to Airflow that supports SLAs or a control Dag that flags if a Dag that should have run did not. Also make sure you have a good way to forward issues to the person who developed the prototype so there is a feedback loop to catch patterns that cause production issues.\\>  too many moving parts (Airflow jobs + custom scripts + cloud functions) That one is tricker, might help to have a more defined CICD workflow and if it is not the case yet having everything in version control, so no part gets changed without validating the change does not break anything. Also clear code ownership.\\> no single place to see what’s running, what failed, and whyThe budget solution here is to add Airflow Dags that check what is running and what failed (control Dag again), the fancier solution is to add lineage to your deployment and evaluate that through an observability tool.\\> models stuck because infra isn’t readyMight be helpful to orchestrate infra provisioning from within the same pipeline as the models with a setup task before the model related tasks and a teardown one afterwards.\\> engineers spending more time fixing orchestration than building featuresThere is an upfront time cost but all of the above should help with this. :)\\> business teams waiting weeks for something that “worked fine in the notebook”Same; that hopefully will get faster once the processes and best practices are in place. Which I know is always a battle to communicate to business teams why reliability and maintainability work matters. What I've done before is trying to explain it like this:The notebook is like having working prototype of a car. We can drive it around, verify that it runs great. But having the feature/model in production means we have to make many cars automatically, build a whole car factory. If we have to build all the robots that make the cars from scratch that will take a while but if we take the time to build very flexible good robots, eventually building a new car factory will be fast as well. And maybe we can even start to quickly build a bicycle factory if needed.",

A snowpipe to Load into regular staging tables can be event triggered when a new file occurs in a container of a datalake, or, you use external tables with a scheduler, then do Load into staging tables. The rest after that is 99% identical to any previous Medallion / Kimball DW setup. Snowflake charges based on credits, a combo of IO ingest and CPU crunching. It’s decently priced. Security is by role and can be weird. Keep it very simple or you will be swamped. So it’s not fancy, just convenient. Everything can be done on a browser. Plus it’s easy to make a loop and get a huge bill.",

I would first really understand the why behind the other non-SQL-oriented tools before I get into how they work on Snowflake.",

        "body": "Hmm, tricky. So you're computing over long baseline rolling windows, and you're wrestling with the fact that- old records can receive long-delayed updates- that could meaningfully change your past computed values- bringing those values closer to 'the truth'- but the source system has no recorded update timestamp that you could use to decide which data to include in the batch, only a unique ID for each record?(Before I suggest something, let me just note that there's a solution space that involves talking to whomever it is that controls the upstream and persuading them about the merits of SCD fields. But assuming that's not an option:)How about this:- you have to load _all_ data into GCS every day because of the lack of update timestamps- use GCS lifecycle rules to quickly move old data into archival storage: you're not going to need it unless you need to run the entire process from the top- in your warehouse, create staging tables:1. CDC table, which persists (more on this below)2. today's batch, overwritten entirely every day, simple upload from GCS3. change table, created every day by comparing (1) with (2) to find rows that have changed (for example, using `EXCEPT DISTINCT` if supported by your warehouse)Now, the idea is to update the CDC table using the change table. It should have a couple of extra columns vs the source: `valid_from` and `valid_until`. You filter on `valid_until IS null` when constructing the change table, to get the latest version of each record. Otherwise, you ignore these columns when constructing the change table.If a row with a certain ID appears in the change table, you first need to update its latest record in the CDC table, such that `valid_until` is changed from `null` to yesterday's date. That record now tells you that the row changed in today's batch; it had those values yesterday, but not today.Finally, you insert the new version of the row (from the change table) into the CDC table, setting `valid_from` to today's date and `valid_until` to `null`: this is now the current version of the row.I think this gets you where you need to be:- the CDC table is a persistent record of all changes- it can be rebuilt from scratch in an emergency, by iterating the above process over the old data batches in GCS archival storage- you can `SELECT * FROM cdc_table WHERE valid_until IS null` to build the current version of the data; you can then compute your rolling window over _that_ table",

The idea being that the analysts will deal with any transformations etc once it’s there. Only other requirement being to retain historical data that the source system will eventually drop after 6 months. Initial plan was to just overwrite changed records based on our primary keys, rather than create new records with Valid To and Valid From fields.

Most business can easily get by with DuckDB + partitioned parquet files. DuckLake's architecture can handle large data sizes. I guess MotherDuck might not have Netflix as a customer...

An annoyance I have with the duck stack is that its creators are more focused on creating a siloed database solution than expanding on what it would actually be useful for. Ideally it would have best in class integration with Delta Lake, Iceberg, the major Catalogs. These things exist but not to the level they should. Good support here would mean we don’t have to use spark for everything, tons of enterprises would adopt it, and it would disrupt the big players compute oriented business models. But instead they lean into their proprietary storage formats. It’s their project, so work on what you like, but most development just seems aimed at making MotherDuck profitable.",

Spoiler alert: unless you are truly working with billions and billions of rows, the right number of partitions is often small. (For example, suppose your data set is a few gigabytes/MB in size, with a few hundred thousand rows and a few hundred columns, and those columns are mostly numeric. In that case, the correct number of partitions might be as little as 4 or 5.) You can experiment with the best number. anyway, you mentioned re-partitioning the data, but you don’t mention the default number of partitions for your session. This is an important configuration parameter that you can set at the beginning of the script. I have seen Spark read in a tiny Excel file and spread it out across 15 partitions and then half of those partitions are completely empty. Obviously this is ludicrous, and slow, but Spark can do it if you don’t stop it.Also when it comes to joins, sometimes the big data set can stay put, and only the small data set needs to be reshuffled. Assuming one of your data sets is smaller. So the type of joint, balanced, or imbalanced, equijoin or non-equijoin, also matters a lot for performance tuning.",

For example we recently had it include a shuffle step to rebalance files, but we were rewriting 50TB of data and it just flooded the spill space and crashed.The old 200 default is almost never a good number. It ends up spending more time finalising tasks and spinning up new ones than it does actually processing things (may be slight exaggeration). The ideal number on a fixed-worker-count cluster is 2x the number of cores on the workers, and then higher multiples of that if you have significantly skewed data in large amounts.Even with AQE you might be able to guide it to a better plan by lining up data nicely for it. But I wouldn't necessarily worry about it until something is taking longer than it seems it should and is taking long enough that it is worth optimising.There are other approaches that can help as well. Saving intermediate results somewhere so that it can be reused without relying on cache memory being available as well as truncating the query plan. You can also focus on dropping the descriptive data and just moving keys and filter-by columns for all the major join work, create a unique composite key for each row, then send that back to the original descriptive data then re-join everything on the new unique row key. That minimises shuffles if you have multiple different keys to join on, because you're only reshuffling the keys, and you shuffle all the extra data just once.",

Fast, but compaction takes forever/fails.I'm fairly new to this space/trying to build my intuition. Am I overthinking it? I feel like I delved into option #1 trying to solve #3 on a downstream job, when it was actually some catalog tweaks/config options and not 100% the small file problem.",

I use duckdb’s read_blob with hive partitioning against s3 to load blob assets without needing a database for metadata. Only problem is that the read_blob fetch mechanism loads all data at once instead of just the batch being fetched. The incremental fetch loading works fine for read_parquet though. For now I have a workaround where I load all the metadata by not reading the content and then incrementally calling read_blob with a batch of filenames from the metadata at a time, but would be nice to just natively support incremental result loading to make the experience more seamless and approachable. https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-python/discussions/92",

They have over 100 connectors, I'm not sure why the guy at Bruin is saying that you've got to maintain the connectors. There are some new AI powered enhancements that make it really simple. There was a tease on some features coming in their 1.11 release in the last meetup, and I think that's hitting in the next week. Definitely worth giving a try.

The best option really depends on your company size, how your teams are structured, and what your current stack looks like (MSSQL 2016, lake, warehouse, etc.). Also helpful to know how you orchestrate things today; Airflow, SSIS, cron, notebooks, whatever.One thing I’d definitely think about is choosing asset-based orchestration instead of task-based. Task-based tools like Airflow or SSIS focus on tasks, not data, so lineage ends up shallow, incomplete, or manually maintained. You also get a lot of glue code that makes governance harder. Asset-based tools like Dagster, dbt, or Bruin treat data assets as the core unit, which gives you proper lineage, clear dependencies, and a cleaner way to centralize metadata and governance. If your goal is a single referential for governance, this approach saves a lot of pain later.Regarding OpenMetadata: it’s a good open-source option, but it’s not light. You’ll spend time maintaining connectors, and lineage quality depends on how your SQL is written. Glossary, business rules, RACI, etc., also take time to set up. It works well in mature teams that can own it.You can also look at metadata-first platforms like DataHub if your priority is lineage and visibility over heavy enterprise governance. Sometimes that’s enough depending on your size.Just keep in mind that no tool magically creates governance. You still need a central team, standards, ownership, and a gradual rollout. The tool only reinforces the process you already put in place.",

You don’t have to choose today but you can start by building data foundations and then transition into ML/Data workflows once you’re comfortable with the cloud and data pipelines.Here’s a short piece that I came across which breaks down a practical path to getting started in data engineering: [“How to Start a Data Engineering Career With 5 No-Nonsense Moves”](https://medium.com/@khushbu.shah_661/how-to-start-a-data-engineering-career-with-5-no-nonsense-moves-1bd9d2e1248c) Hope this gives you some clarity.

Your objective should be to make everyone building on top of the data platform able to move as efficiently as possible while being on pattern.Start to bring your eyes up to strategic objectives and work out how you can close gaps so that once others are trying to build you will already have an mvp for them to consume.",

Then, if you read books (\"Designing Data Intensive Applications\" is amazing), listen to podcasts, read articles, get a solid foundational understanding on the good implementations out there, you will be able to understand your current work architecture under a different light. Then you'll start to think \"what would I've done differently here?\", or answering questions like \"what would need to change if I change component/requirement X by component/requirement Y?\" (simple example: what would need to change if our requirement change from batch to streaming?)For the bonus: I was a researcher, then worked as data scientist and software developer for a few years, then as data engineer for a couple of years, and now I am a mix of data engineer and data architect.The architect part is really fun. It gave me the possibility to put into practice a lot of the theory I read before. It involves considerably less coding, but more about understanding business and systems (in my case, how the backend works on a high-level) and being able to come up with solutions that match the technical and business requirements. It is smart that you are thinking ahead, good luck!",

Engineers are also under no obligation to follow the architects suggestions or advice. Architect simply documents and discover major tech moves or implementations. Say the company is AWS based, they're gonna shift to Azure. Architect would be tasked with getting an edge on discovery in Azure. Generally, senior and staff+ engineers still hold primary weight and control over the products and tech stack they own. Especially anything technically detailed, architect would have 0 say. Like best practice for modeling, how to design some major ETL system and etc. All engineering decisions, not architect. Architect would be whats the tech for shifting from AWS to Azure, how do we follow Europes data privacy laws, how do we implement this org level data requirement from legal, how do we standup this technology that all of engineering will use?",

Ship a dbt template with tests, a Dagster/Prefect scaffold, and Terraform modules that create Snowflake roles/warehouses, storage, tags, and budgets by default. Define data contracts and schema versioning; require an RFC for breaking changes. Bake in observability: OpenLineage/Marquez, Great Expectations, freshness and cost SLOs to Slack. Standardize access with RBAC, masking, and secrets rotation; document the request flow and SLAs. Timebox thin slices ahead of demand (one CDC source, one model, one serving pattern) and track adoption, cost per query, and incident rate. Treat the platform like a product: backlog, office hours, and clear deprecations.We used AWS API Gateway and PostgREST, and DreamFactory to auto-generate REST APIs from Snowflake/SQL Server so app teams shipped without custom services.Bottom line: build products and policies that make the happy path easy and the risky path rare.",

They will hire you as a DE if they think you have the skills, not based on the title your previous company gave you.... I'm \"officially\" a SWE at my company, but I do mostly DE work.Based on your post it's not clear if you actually want to do DE or if you want to do AE. Both DE and AE do a lot of database work, but AE also involves a lot of report development.I think you're really overthinking this. Just find job postings that sound relatively interested/align with what you want to do, and then during the interview you can find out the specifics/details. I think hiring managers will definitely consider you, but I get that sometimes with AE roles, they do actually want specific tools, which makes things hard, but you should be able to find job postings that partially fit your skillset and you should at least get interviews.It's pretty rare to find a job description where you're in expert in 100% of the \"required\" tools. Partial matches are usually good enough.",

Id become an expert in SQL first and foremost. In my company us DE's do not do any analytics or dashboard development whatsoever. That is the Data Analysts job. Data Engineers sit at the top of the data hierarchy. I just started at a new company and came in with another guy who is a Data Analyst. He started at 90k, I started at 130k. Getting into the job now and doing the work, I see that Data Engineering work is much more robust and complicated than most average Data Analyst tasks.",

On a data team, you might have a couple of guys who are super good at IaC, some at developing complex/efficient pipelines, some of them focus on governance/security. I think you need a general understanding of these things, but DE is a broad and undefined term.

Models can help interpret messy text once it’s extracted, but they’re not great at pulling characters off a page on their own. The slow and inconsistent behavior you’re seeing is pretty normal when you rely on an LLM to do both jobs.What tends to work better is splitting the pipeline. Use a dedicated OCR tool to get clean text and structure, then let an LLM handle the fuzzy parts like picking out which date actually matters in a contract. It also keeps costs and latency predictable since the model isn’t wasting cycles trying to guess handwriting strokes.If your contracts follow similar patterns, you might even get away with a simple template based parser once the OCR is solid. The fancy model becomes more of a fallback than the main extractor. Curious if the slow part for you is the OCR step or the interpretation step.",

Ensure idempotency of the pipeline, have test cases for the transformations. The list is infinite. So just validate, test and log against the things that you feel are most pressing. Handling data pipelines is mostly firefighting. You cannot plug all gaps. So follow the usual pipeline conventions and build a simple solution and add on things as and when there is a issue/need.

Either there’s some skill set mismatch or things are dying by committee before anything gets going. Beyond that the approach is somewhat similar for most text data, but the details and quality of output show up based on what you’re actually trying to read. Using legal docs as an example I’ve seen arbitration transcripts that have wild formatting differences simply based on which transcription vendor was used. Can’t do much about that other than adapt to what you’ve got. IMO just pick a set of tools and start playing with it. You can spend months trying to over plan at the beginning just to find out at implementation none of that planning caught something that would have been obvious on day one had you just gone for it.Pick some arbitrary fixed chunk size to start, add a reranking step, then test with a cheap model so you don’t rack up a bunch of costs. Once you start playing with it (with a real user involved) the next steps start to become apparent. You’ll start to see deficiencies that give some intuition on what meta data might be helpful. Also, the more traditional filter that can be used without becoming a pain to the user, the better. I’ve seen some absolutely crazy amounts of effort put into mapping infinite possibilities of classification that could have been solved with a dropdown. (Don’t have an LLM try to figure out which of 15 cases the user is referring to based on a vague query when it’s no big deal to have them select it themselves and massively narrow down the documents being parsed).",

For verification, skip a heavy UI at first: store JSON in Git, validate with JSON Schema + SQLFluff, compile with SQLGlot, run dry-run and unit tests (golden answers) in CI, and require PR approval from a data lead; you can add a thin reviewer page later. Guardrails: allowlist schemas/views, read-only, auto-apply LIMIT/time windows, cap bytes scanned, and normalize dialects; cache successful NL→SQL pairs and invalidate by lineage. Error handling: map common engine errors and retry with fixes; keep a timeout. I’ve used dbt and Cube for the semantic layer, with DreamFactory to auto-generate RBAC’d REST APIs over Snowflake/SQL Server so the agent only hits curated endpoints.

It seems more likely to me that he had an internally consistent idea like that in his head, and named the two measures a little oddly, than that he'd have confused a semi-additive fact for a fully-additive one. I do totally agree that if that's the case, these column names aren't very clear.At the end of the day, though, remember this is just an example to clarify the principles being communicated. If you get to the correct understanding of principles, that's all that really matters.

Facebook for example has attribution windows of like, 1 day, 7 day, 14 day and 28 day views that people can use to give themselves credit for a conversion. probably some in between I don't remember exactly.

It all comes down to your needs, if you have only a couple of standard sources / destinations, you can use a pre-built no code tool, even though i do not like tools that have a vendor lock-in with no open source option. But i am a developer, so for a DE team that has no dedicated software engineers, they may be an option, but keep in mind that those tools usually are hardly extendable, so if in the future you come across an exotic datasource that you cannot read with them, you have to build bridges (like python scripts as an intermediary step) that write the data into a database from which the tool then can read and so on...My recommendation: If you have dedicated software engineers, use something like dlthub, if not, you may consider something like windsor. If you have someone that manages your infra, but do not develop your own software, you have other options like Airbyte, which is open source, extendable and has a graphical interface, but i never used it in production, so take that with a pinch of salt.Best regards",

To me this isn’t about blocking marketing or “never letting them make technical decisions.” That’s gatekeeping, and it usually creates more tension than it solves.Marketing people are adults. They can understand trade-offs and deal with consequences just like everyone else. The real problem is usually not who suggested a tool, but who actually owns the process and the outcomes.If ingestion is owned by the data team, then the data team should make the final call. If marketing owns the workload and carries the operational risk, then they can make the decision. Just make ownership explicit and you avoid the “how could you allow this?” gaslighting scenario entirely.Also, you don’t want to become the “no person” who rejects every tool non-engineers propose. That kills collaboration. Better approach is:1. define the owner 2. list the requirements 3. evaluate trade-offs together 4. let the owner decideSometimes a no-code tool is the right choice. Sometimes it isn’t. But shutting non-technical teams out of the decision entirely almost always backfires.",

Agree on an exit path upfront: how to export raw data, how to rehydrate if you leave, and who funds the switch.Pressure-test vendor lock-in: do they support CDC or at least webhooks, raw landing in object storage, and schema-change handling? Add simple data contracts for key tables so ownership survives tool swaps.Stack-wise, Windsor could handle common marketing connectors; keep dlt for oddball sources; Airbyte is a nice middle when you need open-source and extendable. I’ve paired Fivetran for paid connectors, Airbyte for customs, and DreamFactory to expose curated tables as REST for downstream tools without new microservices.Bottom line: pick the owner, set SLOs and costs, time-box a pilot, and keep a clear exit plan.",

        "body": "Sorry, this will be a bit long, but I think it might help.Quick disclaimer: I’m one of the founders of Bruin, an asset based data platform similar to dbt and Dagster, so I’m obviously biased. But I’ll try to keep this rooted in how things actually work in the industry.The difference you’re seeing between infra-heavy Zoomcamp projects and more “software-engineered” Python repos isn’t a real contradiction. They represent different layers of the stack. Zoomcamp is trying to give you a broad picture of what you *might* see in a real team. Not every company uses Terraform or Docker, but many do, so the course touches those pieces early. Later, the focus shifts more toward dbt/Bruin-style asset based work, which is how a lot of modern data pipelines are actually built and maintained.In practice, most companies mix both approaches. The orchestrator (Airflow, Dagster, Bruin, etc.) handles scheduling and execution. The actual transformation logic usually lives in asset definitions: SQL models or small Python transforms with clear dependencies. When that logic becomes more complex or gets reused, teams extract it into a proper Python package with a src/ layout, tests and versioning. So the “tool based” approach and the “modular Python project” approach are not alternatives; they stack on top of each other.The industry is moving toward asset based workflows because they offer a clearer dependency graph, builtin testing, ownership, lineage and easier debugging. That’s why tools like dbt, Dagster and Bruin are becoming common.For someone applying to an internship, the goal is not to master every tool. It’s enough to show that you can write clean Python, understand Docker at a basic level, have touched one orchestrator, and can describe your work as a data flow. A simple infra-driven project plus a small, well-structured Python module is already strong.If you can show that mix, you’re in very good shape for junior roles.",

However, you most likely will end up in some situation in your work that a tool either doesn't exist or is too expensive. In most of those cases, you will need to code to get the job done.Agree that as a junior, if you know how to code and show a very basic understanding of docker/containers is more than enough.",

I'm pivoting to Data Engineering and want to make sure I don't \"under-sell\" myself as a Junior.Background: 4 years in App Dev, 1 year in AI R&D. Comfortable with full SDLC. Goal: Mid-level DE roles.Questions:Since I already have strong SWE fundamentals (testing, git, docker), what specific DE-centric engineering patterns (e.g., IaC for pipelines, Data Contracts) should I showcase to prove I'm not a \"fresh grad\"?I want to build a portfolio project that demonstrates architectural maturity. Would a complex streaming setup (Kafka+Flink) be better, or a robust batch platform (Airflow+dbt+Data Quality checks)?Thanks!",

Just like it is really, really easy to keep a language active, while mainly using another. If you are really worried to loose progress in C++, start a side project. It only needs to be 2-3 hours a month to be enough, just to remind yourself of the language once in a while. All in all, I don't think it's worth fighting the college over language choice. It's always easier and less friction to just use what they want you to, because all the help you can get from TAs and material is made for that language.

If I were you, I'd learn Python as part of my courses, and do projects with C++ in personal projects. Personal projects are amazing when you lack experience by the way, employers always asked me about the personal projects I have in my resume in interviews when I was a student. Also, being good at more languages is ALWAYS a plus, it increases opportunities you can apply for AND makes it so much easier to learn other languages cuz you'd see a pattern of common things between languages. It's true that Python is getting more and more popular, some of my projects would have been brutal without the Python libraries, but there's always jobs that require C++. Finally, remember, you're not cheating on C++ if you learn Python (no judgement, I felt like I was too).Good luck and enjoy programming!",

It's common for universities and colleges to have their intro programming courses be in Python since it's easy to learn, but then move onto a lower-level language to tackle more advanced concepts.",

Whether you are comsci or information Technology can determine the skills you will need down the line.-why let the pressure of those around you dictate your own academics? I am currently going into my last year for a bachelor's in Information Technology and I took classes in python, java, html & css, SQL, c++ along with all the scripting languages u can think of. Am I going to be using ALL those languages in my day-to-day once I graduate maybe, most likely or most likely not; but having the knowledge is beneficial. I lean more towards networking and sysadmin in what I want to do later down the line, so c++ isn't beneficial for ME other than the exposure. If we are talking about 1-2 classes and they fit into your program take the classes you won't be wasting your time. If the decision is dependent on your major take a step back to think about why you're in college. Also python and c++ are kinda in different realms so again what are YOU planning to do? (Pls don't come at me like I have 10+ years in the industry I am a college student with 3 years of IT experience, just trying to help someone who is in the same point I was in at one point.)",

In order to become a proficient programmer you will need to learn a few different programming languages (not because you will need to use them later but because through different languages you learn different concepts that you wouldn't encounter if you only stuck to one language).Also, if you're just starting you will not master any language fully anyway without getting good at core programming concepts (for which you need to learn multiple languages) so learning Python is not going to inhibit your progress in C++ long term (and will most likely enhance it by giving you another perspective for problem solving).Languages are just tools, a proficient programmer should pick the right tool for whatever task they're facing (as you said, your colleagues using Python are done with their tasks while you're still writing C++ boilerplate, that indicates that unless performance is of the utmost importance Python is the better tool for that task), and be able to start using a new language on day one without learning it beforehand, using documentation and google :)In the end the language you'll know the best will be the language you use the most (and the most recently).You can specialize in a specific language but that depends on what you're going to use it for (and even then a strong foundation of programming knowledge including multiple programming languages will be useful), for example if you want to make web applications you're not going to use C++ too much, but if you make game engines you probably will use it a lot.",

You don't see YouTubers doing it for the same reason TV cooking shows have \"one already made\" in the oven to skip over the step most people find tedious to witness. But in terms of actual practice: doing that gives you insight into how different patterns overlap (or are even the same pattern wearing a different moustache) and it's *great* for building your capabilities.Ideally, for maximum safety, you have tests in place before making changes like that so you can confirm that a change that was just \"saying the same thing more clearly\" doesn't actually break the program. But the importance of doing that scales with the number of people on the project, the likelihood someone who didn't write your code becomes responsible for maintaining it, and lines of code in the project; for a small, personal project, one script, one file of functions, that kind of testing might be overkill.(To put on my guy-who's-been-at-this-for-thirty-three-years philosopher's hat: programming is different from other engineering disciplines because the description of the thing we do very nearly *is* the thing we do. It's like magic... Like *old* magick. \"The name of the thing is the thing.\" If you find yourself only being able to put two hands on a problem after you've written one crack at how to solve it, that's *extremely* normal, because you describe the problem with words but also solve it with words. As you gain more experience you often can do more of that work in your head and you'll see more problems that you immediately go \"Oh I'll just solve that with X\" because you've solved a nearly-identical problem before, but looking at the code you just wrote and going \"Oh it'd be easier if I just\\~\" is extremely normal. Programmers aren't rock-stars; we're *writers*. Much like an author realizing a deeper truth about their characters after making a first draft, we often grasp our problems better one we have *one* solution for them on the table.)",

If there isn't a design document for the code write one for yourself. Doesn't need to be highly detailed but it should be something you can use as a map for yourself later. Write it in a form that you understand. I'm not suggesting you write this for the entire codebase, just the areas of focus for your task in small chunks.In between all of this take plenty of notes on things you don't understand.Finally, when you approach senior devs, explain to them what you have learned and then ask your questions. It will go over a lot smoother if you've done some legwork before asking. My rule for new devs is don't spend more than 2 hours being stuck. Ask for help. But I do want them to attempt to understand and do some leg work before asking for help.Please know we've all been there!",

I also buy lower spec systems because it performs faster even with lower end hardware. Windows 10 broke something with my PC almost every time I updated it, I have less issues even with Arch.

It’s a very different design philosophy with MS being proprietary but also designed for simplicity over control. Windows is designed to be easy to use even if you don’t know what you’re doing but that comes at a cost to flexibility. Linux is much more flexible in part because it’s designed by many people over time and in part because it was always meant to be, it’s open source meaning if you need a smaller or faster version you could just build one (which people have done eg Alpine which is a minimum computer with none of the fluff perfect for a server that isn’t designed for anything else — no need for mouse support on a machine that doesn’t even physically exist on its own). It’s also habit and preference. I can switch back to using Windows (and actually have to for some older software at work) but it’s annoying. Because Linux and MacOS are both built on UNIX as a base switching between them, writing into a shell window that is remotely connected to your server from your Mac machine for example, is much easier.",

There are a lot of reasons why, IMO, developing on Linux is better -- you could make solid arguments that doing development on Linux is easier, faster, and more secure -- but none of those things matter if the people who will be buying your game are on Windows.Servers, on the other hand, aren't normally run by end users, and aren't even normally run on desktop systems. Professional environments will usually buy hardware that is intended just for running a specific server, and if you're not already locked into using a specific OS, there's little reason to not pick the one that you have full control over and isn't bloated with things you don't need.To be fair, that's been shifting a lot in recent years thanks to Proton. Prior to the release of the Steam Deck in 2022, Linux desktop share had been stuck at around 1% on the Steam hardware surveys for basically forever; but it's been steadily climbing since then, and it recently crossed 3% for the first time ever. 3% still isn't a lot, but tripling Linux's desktop share in three years after decades of stagnation is pretty incredible. We're at the point now where all of the big engines are multi-platform, and Proton can run 95% of games that are Windows-only (not counting games with kernel-level anti-cheat software), so sticking with Windows for development is increasingly becoming completely optional... and why stick with it if you can get a better developer experience on Linux but still deliver a game to Windows customers?",

What the CLI app does doesnt matter a ton, maybe its a thin wrapper around git, maybe just checks the weather from some external api. The key is that you are able to talk about your experience creating the CLI app on your resume and in an interview. As for the API, I have only had experiences with a basic CRUD and REST HTTP Apis. If you want to use something newer go for that! But as others have said, it would be best to use some form of enterprise framework. If you dont know any, dont worry too much! Just get a first draft out there and start applying! Take inspiration from something you care about in life, i built a movie tracking api, pretty much a letterboxd.com clone when i was trying to beef up my resume for my first job.Being able to talk about the standard coding practices like DRY, DI, OOP would be good too. While i dont personally ask that in my interviews, i've been on the other side where the interviewer cares a lot about those textbook best practices.Adventurous-Date9971 listed out a lot of \"the other stuff\" besides the main programming language, and those would 100% help to make you stand out, but take it all in baby steps!

You need to be able to understand Python code using classes but especially in Python they aren't necessary except if you want to implement `+` on your own data structure or use a library that insists that you subclass something.Take something challenging that interests you and work on it. Read through the whole manual of some programming language. (Don't pick C++ for this, as the standard is absurdly long.)Read some open source software and compare it to what you write.

The web languages are important to learn on a practical side, but alone they won’t make you a programmer. So HTML, CSS, JS can all be learnt together afterwards. You will probably also want to do some basic React after this.

Fundamentals of programming in C (procedural) and theory about computer systems. 2. Object oriented programming in C# or Java and theory on garbage collection, runtimes etc 3.

It’s the kind of book that starts with stuff where you’re like “Yeah, obviously” and then a couple chapters later you’re going “WHAT?!” People tend to have strong opinions about it one way or the other; I think it’s brilliant and should be on pretty much every programmer’s to-read list, but plenty of people think it’s overrated. Given that it’s free, it’s worth a try.* [*Concrete Mathematics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics) is, as the title suggests, focused on the math side of CS, but since this is where most programmers are weakest, it’s worth mentioning.

C books are great for that, but digging into how compilers work or how operating systems schedule things can really lock the concepts in. If you are already doing nand2tetris, you might enjoy something that walks through how code becomes instructions, since it ties the pieces together in a really clear way. For broader CS reading, I like books that focus on problem solving habits rather than any specific language because those ideas stick no matter what you use later. It also helps when you bounce between levels and see how the abstractions stack.",

He wrote a compiler that only outputs MOV instructions but is still Turing complete. He wrote a thing that when you reverse engineer it, it displays pictures from your own hard drive, as a deterrent to reveng further. He hacked into ring -2 on an x86 processor - you don’t know what ring -2 is? Neither did anyone else until he hacked it. He wrote Cantor Dust to suggest what the next gen of reveng tools should look like. Man is a legend. So, while other recommendations make perfect sense, these magazines/books will expand your mind in ways they never could. And the PDFs are free. Did I mention they are free? And awesome? Did I mention they are free and awesome? Just want to make sure. They’re also super fun to read.",

So instead of repeating those, I wanted to add a few books that aren’t specifically low-level, but are timeless and incredibly valuable no matter what language or stack you end up using:1. **Clean Code by Robert C. Martin:** A classic on writing readable, maintainable code. It teaches craftsmanship: naming, structure, clarity, and how to think about code quality in any language.2. **Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler:** One of the most important books if you want to write and improve maintainable code. You will learn patterns, code smells, and how to gradually improve structure without breaking things.3. **Design Patterns (Gang of Four):** The foundational book on object-oriented design patterns. It’s dense, but once you get the concepts, you’ll start seeing these patterns everywhere in real projects.These aren’t low-level, but they’re the kind of books that make you a better programmer overall, they improve how you think about code, structure, and long-term maintainability, regardless of whether you’re writing Python, C, Java, or anything else.",

You’re receiving formatted text that your host binds to a handing method which in turn returns formatted text. Taking the long view, Rest is simply a point of view that “the http verb in the formatted text header should dictate the operation” which replaced the previous opinion which more or less said “just use post or get for that mandatory verb header and name your operation in the relative path and the name should usually match the handling method so you can find things”. Neither is wrong. People just have strong opinions about formatted text. Bonus: If you really want to annoy people, go take the position that soap with xsd-defined payloads is more precise, more extensible, and can be more secure than rest with json (it is) and that devs were simply too lazy to learn the spec. It’s a bit better now that swagger (open api) is more mainstream, but for a while rest was a real pain to consume.The next thing to remember is that your reaction is valid and you’re often going to have more tailored controller services for web front ends. These aren’t enterprise APIs. They’re part of the same logical application and are only services because the halves run on two different computers. Otherwise they would just be helper or data layer methods. We do this because chattiness and sequential service call latency is the death of web pages. So if a commonly used page needs a getMyStuff composite method that returns a splittable json payload in one hit, that’s not crazy. If you need that to be available generically, you can expose a graphql or composite endpoint that allows you to specify an object and specific children and fields. Try not to make something that creates security or sql injection problems.",

It’s simple and you avoid adding extra moving parts while you’re still learning React Native.SQLite starts to make more sense if you know you’ll need things like:•a lot of tasks over time•filtering/searching by date, status or text•more complex relationships later•maybe syncing with a backend in the futureSo my rule of thumb would be:•if it’s a small learning project, JSON + AsyncStorage is OK•if you’re planning to grow it into something more serious or long-term, it’s worth learning SQLite earlyThere’s no “wrong” choice here as long as you understand the trade-offs.

I modified it to work with different features, etc etc. Read the MDN docs on async/await, and probably spent a good few hours just messing with async/await to try and understand it. I could have just thrown the AI result into my program and moved on, because it did work how I wanted it to, but I would've been right back where I started when I initially googled the question",

Then you must do them yourself, of course.I suppose you can ask the AI agent to rate your code style and look for common anti-patterns and so on, but instead of asking an agent for this, you should look into linters, style formatters, etc. that already exist and which will do a much better job at that kind of task.",

It sounds like you have an enthusiasm for games development, but enrolled in a generic Systems Engineering course - which won't teach games development very much, if at all.But the concepts - including UML and much of the other stuff you are struggling with - are applicable to this subject area.re the no interest in \"soft skills\".It could be that you are only interested in the \"colours, fonts and strategy\" stuff and not interested in the boring stuff such as creating and maintaining the administrative stuff such as a database containing user credentials, leader boards and other stuff that is \"administrative stuff\" that isn't really part of the game. Or not interested in Source Code Control. Or not interested in the design process (which may involve some UML and other diagramming techniques as well as boring old documentation). But these are all important things to understand and understand how to use them and when to use them.When I was at University, there were definitely subjects and topics that were part of the course that many of us though \"What is the point of this?\". As a result those people that thought that way often struggled with it. But the reality was that these, while maybe not mainstream in our ultimate careers, did include important \"background\" information and/or skills that were relevant to our ultimate careers.Anyway, that was my thought when reading your post.

You gotta treat it like a petty toddler that is going to do exactly what you tell it to, to. the. letter. Take a problem you want to solve break it down into smaller problems, then worry about combining them later. While you're doing that discard any features that aren't critical to accomplish the primary goal, this gets you a minimum viable product. Worry about bells and whistles after you got and MVP.Search Stack Overflow, reddit, and youtube for help and, if you really want to learn programming, ignore AI. Using AI will not make you a competent programmer it's robbing you of the headbanging frustration required to breakthrough to understanding. It can be a powerful tool used judiciously but you don't have the experience yet to know when to do that.",

        "body": "The battleship game actually sounds pretty hard for a beginner, which you still are. My expectation would be that resources would be provided to you to help you complete the project. If there are no such resources, then it's understandable that you've turned to using a tool (AI) that genuinely can help a beginner write a moderately complex program. Though I don't use it for certain reasons, and I don't really recommend using it, I don't think there's shame in using it for this purpose.However, if there are resources available to you, especially professors or teaching assistants you can talk to, I advise you to go to them with your questions. You can also look online for help with some of the more common pitfalls.The key thing I will emphasize is that there is usually some frustration and discipline required in order to \"get\" what your program is doing (or isn't doing, if you've run into a bug). Staring blankly at the screen or turning to AI for an attempt at a quick fix won't do much to resolve the root problem, which is a lack of understanding. And to understand sometimes really does require you to step through your program one line at a time with a debugger, printing things out along the way, until you know exactly what your program is doing.If you're just struggling to get any code written, it's best to start by breaking the problem down into smaller tasks. For example, you said the game uses a 4x4 grid. My first thought would be: how am I representing this grid? Probably it's useful to know if a part of a ship is on a grid cell or if it's just water. That might lead you to the idea to represent the grid as an array of bools, where a cell holds true if a part of a ship is there and false if not. That's not necessarily \"the best\" way to do it, it's just a way. As a beginner you're not expected to come up with the best or fastest or prettiest solution, it just needs to work.It also helps to translate your ideas into plain English and then into pseudocode before writing any actual code. The jump from thoughts in your head or words in an assignment specification to real code is usually too much when you're just starting, except for the really simple things. If you go straight to writing code, you'll usually end up running into errors or bugs that aren't easy to fix because you haven't thought enough about what your program should really be doing yet. Better to do that thinking up front, write the key things down, write pseudocode that roughly represents what you wrote, and then translate the pseudocode into real code. As you get more experience you can skip/truncate some of these steps, but it's rarely a waste of time to be diligent in this way, in my experience.",

Figuring out what it is he actually likes would likely show his real aptitude and can help you figure out actually get his attention. If you just want to teach “coding” principles to a 9 year old the best bet are probably puzzle or strategy games that they find engaging. It teaches them the basics of problem solving and following procedures. I think of games like Portal, Zelda, Tomb Raider, Uncharted… Games where you do You do A and B to then be able to do C. Actual coding, might as well be teaching him French or Chinese. If he’s not into language, it’s kinda school-like. Remember what we do is solve problems by writing repeatable procedures. What motivates us to actually code? Somebody with money will pay us to solve their problems, while maybe personal problems motivate us for personal projects. What motivates a 9 year old, or what personal problems could they solve through coding? If you can figure that out, you may have a better chance to get his attention earlier to more “practical” applications.",

Kids (usually) enjoy projects or knowing there will be a benefit or result to their work. We have taught kids by getting them to program rock paper scissors using python. Alot of the issue is motivation I find, so if you can find what makes the kid eager, use it!",

Just grinding won't get you further. Your brain will just get overloaded and shut down.A little story from my experience: when Java came out, I was already programming for over a decade and was proficient in multiple procedural languages. Then, I tried Java and OOP. This was a humbling experience. I could not make heads or tails at all. The *language* was easy enough to understand, but switching from procedural to OOP didn't click at all. I tried many times and failed many times until at one point, it suddenly started to make sense. Can't even say what really did it for me.Now, my advice is to program something with it and here, I deviate from the common examples: build a *library* for card games, like Blackjack, Poker, Uno, etc. Start with modeling a single `Card`. It has a suit, a rank, a numeric value, a face, a back, it can be face up or down - the fields. The card can report its data - provided it is face up, it can draw itself (in a loose sense), it can be flipped - toggle face up/down.Then, go further: make a `Deck` that can hold a full set of cards, that can be shuffled, that can deal cards, that can tell if it is empty or not, etc.Next, a `Hand` that takes cards.And so on.Build it in such a way that you can create different `Card` types, e.g. PokerCard, UnoCard, etc. All these can use the `Deck` without modification.With such an exercise, you'll cover abstract classes, inheritance, composition, polymorphism. The benefit is that you can draw a relation between a real world object and its digital representation.",

I am not sure what university you go to or how they teach it there, but in general I don't think they teach it very well and you certainly have not had enough classes to be this hard on yourself.OOP is not just a Java thing either. You can think of it as real life and that is why it is supposed to make sense once you understand that. Classes are just descriptions of things. Objects are instances of that description.Use animals as an example. Mammals are a class that describes things with hair. So, hasHair == true. Some mammals are land animals and some are sea animals. So, where == \"land | sea\". A lion (subclass) \"Inherits\" the attributes of a mammal and adds a few more attributes like sharp teeth. So, hasTeeth == true && hasBigTeeth == true && isDangerous == true :). A pig is a mammal too and it \"inherits\" from mammal too. Some of the attributes it shares with a lion has different values. If we were to control a lion or a pig we call the \"run\" function, the lion will have a faster run implementation than the pig. \"Polymorphism\". We typically hide the implementation and field access to make code less brittle. We would not want someone binding directly to something we want to be able to change later. We make these attributes and internal functions private. \"Encapsulation\". There should be a subclass of mammal that lion inherits from named \"LandAnimal\". Now this part gets tricky because Java does not support multiple inheritance so we want to use hasA vs isA implementation. When we access the base class LandAnimal which actually has the \"run\" method which is slower in pigs than in lions \"polymorphism\" again. LandAnimal is an \"abstraction\" (or base class) of Lion (isA LandAnimal). Or we can use interfaces for this \"abstraction\" (hasA LandAnimal) interface (composition).I just wrote this from the top of my head so I hope it makes sense and is correct.I hope this helps. Relax a little, go easy, and don't give up. You will get it.",

When you sleep, all that learning and information that seems a bit of a jumble is going to be reorganized in your mind and memory. And it only happens when you are sleeping. You also need to take some time off to exercise and get some fresh air because your brain won't work at its best if it is overwhelmed with stress. You have to let some of it out. On the plus side, you are at least 20 steps ahead of most of your colleagues because the number of stories of kids trying to go the easy way out by pawning off the results on an AI, and consequently learning nothing in the process, are legion. You are passionate and committed and you will get there.

Then you can play around with trying to get them all to work together, and begin to discover problems that need to be solved.

Usually push back on things that will take a lot of time, currently not supported.Will sit down have a think at what teams need to be involved, meet with their engineering managers, try flesh out if timelines can lineup. Use any political clout i have to try get them to adjust etc.... At this stage usually starting to break it out into sections and who can do the work and if they are free. Meet with EM's and PM's again to break down further and cut scope if needed.From here I usually have a good idea of what is needed, the requirements in terms of performance, accessibility, delivery time frames, apis, storage etc.Now I usually try and research any unknowns etc, high level data structures and apis to use. This involves prototypes and a lot of throw away code. Sometimes reading papers etc.This will usually result in some form of document, DACI etc that can be shared to gain consensus, get alignment amongst EM and PM etc.Then all of this gets thrown away and we do the actual work cause none of this stands up to reality... as deadlines loom, VPs change their mind on priorities, marketing doesn't agree with what we are delivering, teams that we rely on to deliver their features descope and no longer support what we are doing... Then we usually just do what you do and start coding and deal with the issues as they turn up....",

        "body": "Basic project management, and this is something that I fought with every day in my former job as PMO head.If your job is to manage a software project, then you need to act like a project manager, not a software developer. Project management is pretty simple (in theory), but often difficult for technically-oriented people. For example, the manufacturing department came to us (IT) and told us that they were developing a new product and putting up a new production building for it. The project was assigned to an ERP solution architect, who immediately saw that this is an ERP project - implementing a new BOM (bill of materials) and warehouse management for the new site. This was designed, built, tested, and delivered. But, because he was an ERP solution architect, and not a trained project manager, he completely ignored the whole infrastructure side of the project - it was a new building, so it needed cabling, WiFi routers, client devices, and a new conference room. This only popped up a few weeks before the \"ribbon cutting\" on the new site, when someone came around and asked when we were going to install the hardware, and no one knew what he was talking about. We were literally pulling cables inside the building while the CEO was outside talking to the local news teams announcing the start of production. So, my advice to anyone who is given a project to lead: First, stop and think. Ask yourself if you really see the ENTIRE problem that needs to be solved. THEN break it down into manageable chunks, and plan each one of those in terms of resources and efforts. Once the plan has been agreed and the necessary resources are on board, THEN you start designing the solution (either traditional/sequential project, or a series of agile sprints).",

But each time you build something new, try and apply the things you’ve read about. Read a design pattern and then pick something at random and build it with applying that pattern as the main focus. It doesn’t have to be anything complex, keep it simple. Then improve it. I felt the same way after developing in React for 2 years. I never felt like my skills were where I wanted them to be. One day I stumbled across a video from Brian Vaughn on virtualization, a design that allows data grids to “infinite scroll” as you only render what is coming into the viewport and immediately unmount those elements when they are out of view. I had used well known libraries for this prior, but watching his presentation gave me an insight into “how” he implemented this idea in his library react-virtualized.I went off and tried to build my own little library that could do the same. I dropped the “I’m not gonna re-invent the wheel” mindset, and instead just said I’m gonna sit here and get something working if it takes me all month. Instead of querying GPT for answers, I just broke it down into small bites. “How do I unmount something when it goes out of view? How do I detect when something is coming into view?” Etc.” In the end, my little library worked well enough for me to be super proud that I figured this out, and the amount I learned during the process was pretty wild. I use this example because it was the first of what would become many of these little “let me see if I can make a basic version of this” exercises. This has helped me far far more than than tutorials, countless hours reading and such. Hope this helps! TLDR; BUILD",

You’re getting stuck conceptually, even if you know the basics of programming.What you need to do for your C# project is use whatever resources were given to you during the class to make a working entry point into the project. If you can run the project and get the UI to pop up on screen then the first hurdle is over. After that, you’ll need to write out a big list of what needs to be completed and then order that list based on what you think needs to be done first. Don’t go back to tutorials or your textbook, just knock out each item on the list. Use google if you need to, read the C# docs if you need to, but don’t tell yourself you need to go back to the beginning and start doing something you already know how to do.",

Over time, some things will be more familiar as you do them over and over again. That is how I do it.As for a better way to get better, projects, projects, projects :)Pick small projects to start with and add the next small thing to it, then the next small thing, and so on.I am literally going to paste this from another comment I just wrote about an hour ago:Start small and keep it simple. Let the project guide what you need to learn next. I almost always suggest the often dismissed TODO exercise to start with since you already have some base knowledge.Start small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. EDIT: fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. An address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.You will get this. Best wishes.",

HTML basics - create a \"recipe\"-webside using sections, headers, paragraphs, lists, images and links. (This also includes getting to know the editor, setting up a local server, using git, deploying on github, etc.)2. HTML semantics - look into `b`, `s`, `i`, `strong`, `em`, and a lot of similar tags.3. HTML tables (if you want to)4. CSS basics - colors, fonts, backgrounds5. CSS layout - understand block vs inline, then immediately move on to `grid`!6. Forms - use HTML and CSS to create nicely layed out \"interactive\" forms with input-fields and buttons, that don't really do anything.7. (optional) interactive HTML elements, `dialog`, `details`, etc.8. JS introduction - using document.queryselector to select elements and change their class.9. JS events - add event listeners and functions to add (further) interactivity to your pages10. JS variables - keep state, make counters, etc.11. JS forms - receive form submissions in JS code, read values from forms, write to console12. JS DOM manipulation - write JavaScript code to modify page content, modify form-values13. JSON and Dynamic webpages - use JS to read JSON data and build a webpage with (optional) dynamic data, just read from a (server) local file.14. REST API - write JS to access an existing REST API, make a CRUD webpage15. ???16. profit!Note how additional HTML and CSS can be sprinkled into making the webpages more interesting as you add JS to them. Depending on your interests, you could add animations and color-grading and lots of other stuff, or go more towards the data-part of the application.",

If you try to think of something on the spot, it is very difficult as your mind will generally either think of things that absolutely already exist or that are very difficult. These ideas usually come when you encounter a problem in your day to day life, usually something that is very specific. For example, the last thing I wrote was about doing an analysis of European versus U.S. stock valuations because I saw a post about the difference in market cap, and I want to see if I can tease out what causes it (e.g. is it mostly due to difference in profit growth, price/earnings ratios, dominant companies, dominant sectors, etc.). Most of the things in my journal never get made, but sometimes I will get the motivation to actually start one of them, and I have a big list of projects. Other ideas: an Alexa skill to get the menu of a local restaurant, KSP mod for animal payloads, open play court booking app for local courts, etc. I haven't done any of these, and some of them I don't even have the basic knowledge to do (I have never made an Alexa skill or KSP mod).",

Another one that allocates an array with malloc, fills it, prints it and then frees it. Nothing fancy, just repeating until it stops feeling “magical”.Since YouTube isn’t working well for you, I’d try something text-based like “C Programming: A Modern Approach” or the free tutorials on learn-c.org, and then spend most of your 2 hours actually typing and running code instead of only reading or watching.You don’t need to “fully understand C” before next semester.

Each instruction is N bits, of which some bits tell the circuitry which op, some tell it the operands (what to operate on, e.g. register, immediate value etc.). These instructions can be written in assembly text or directly in machine code, which your compiler will output for a given architecture when writing in a high level language (e.g. C, C++...). Instructions are composed to do useful work. The more instructions the CPU implements directly, the less work for the compiler, and vice versa.Sometimes there's an additional level of translation in between the circuitry and the machine code, called microcode, which allows CPU makers to correct bugs with firmware updates, rather than millions of people mailing back their CPUs :D I don't know if such primitive ops (shifts etc.) are microcoded or hardwired off hand, but I suspect the latter.",

Knowing someone on the cast will work just as well. But if you don't impress them with your audition, none of it will matter.So your primary focus should be to learn the skills, don't worry about the credential because it's the least important thing.The good news is that there are tons of completely free resources to learn to code online.My suggestion is rather than worrying about which one is the most likely to lead to a career, focus on which one is the best fit for you. The first course you pick won't determine your career trajectory, the goal is simply to get you from zero to coding. Once you get the hang of coding, you can pivot to different languages depending on your interests and goals.Here are three suggestions for very high-quality free courses. All three of them are a fantastic way to go from zero to coding, even though they teach very different things. They have very different styles and teach different languages, but all are valid first steps. Pick one that works for you.[https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)[https://programming-25.mooc.fi](https://programming-25.mooc.fi)[https://www.theodinproject.com](https://www.theodinproject.com)",

There are other ways.In more general terms you may also want to mention the chief idea of OOP, structuring code and your thinking so as to model the properties and behaviour of real-world objects or concepts.Encapsulation of data and enforcement of invariants by modifying state only in pre-defined ways (the methods) is usually key too.There are other bolt-on things like abstraction though inheritance and polymorphism (giving rise to interfaces), runtime dynamic dispatch for code selection based on type... etc...I always encourage people to look at all the differing ways OOP has been approached over the years.

A true OO entity would not have methods like that, rather it would have methods designed such that external entities can inform it of things that happened and it is up to the *object* to determine what state it should be in as a response.When using a Design by Contract approach, a contract for an OO method would have no externally verifiable post-condition.",

It's the only way you'll stay motivated to write code outside of class, build new things, and deal with the rapidly-changing landscape and job market (AI, new libraries, new tools, new approaches, refactors, \"breaking changes\", debugging, so on and so forth); at least that's how it is for me. I thought I hated programming, refused to even try it until I was 30, then I found out I'm good at it and I love it (I'm a little obsessive when it comes to programming now). Almost all of my friends who went to school for software engineering, thinking it'd land them a high-paying job (who never programmed outside of class) are all working in a different fields now. In a tight market, employers aren't interested in programmers who aren't interested in code.You've basically answered your own question. There's no reason to specialize in something you hate, nor in going to college if you hate it, for a degree you'll hate working in. Look into audio production and audio engineering (that's somewhat different from straight \"music technology\"). However, you're kind of giving mixed signals. If you're into music and music software, what don't you like about the music technology you were introduced to (which, presumably, uses said software)? I tried being a musician a long while back, and I loved messing with MIDI devices and all the music MIDI and editing software. I liked messing with soundboards, and I think it'd be fun to be the sound mixer/tech at concerts (for example).If the idea is: You hate college, you hate all the degrees, but you're going to get one anyways. Pick something ***you can stand***. Something adjacent to what you want to do. For example, I got a business degree with an emphasis in entrepreneurship, because I've always wanted to start a small business (and as of now, I'm building out my presence as independent contractor for full stack software engineering). Yes, the degree is kind of worthless, and no it didn't ***really*** teach me much about building and sustaining a small business, but it all starts to add up.In my mind, it'd make way more sense for you to go to a technical school for audio production. It'll be cheaper, faster, and you might actually develop a stronger interest for it. Then, if it turns out you hate it, at least you didn't waste 4 years and $30,000 getting a degree you hate.",

Allow yourself to be interrupted with ideas, make notes and try them out.Second, try boiling down the problem to a minimal program that eliminates everything else except the one thing you're struggling with. This often reveals some factor that you previously overlooked. Use a separate copy or some sort of version control so you can switch between the minimal example and the full version with minimal effort.Edit: Oh, and by the way, this is what programming is actually all about, and the main reason why LLMs are not going to \"take over\" any time soon.",

Even if you don't get the exact answer, perhaps you'll get some input you can work with.Remember, the expected outcome is never the actual solution, the final product, the running code. When learning, the expected outcome is always that you try something, that you experiment with, work with the theory covered in the course. Sometimes problems do require a sudden insight that you shouldn't be expected to get, but more often they actually just require you to apply the material from the latest class.Most importantly, don't sit alone with your docs and LLM machines - talk to actual people, maybe those you are studying with, maybe someone completely unrelated.",

For game dev, C++ is used the most across the industry for performance reasons because AAA games have to pay a great deal of attention to performance. Small indie games like Stardew, Terraria, Minecraft (back in the day), and famously Undertale can afford to be written terribly poorly in whatever language they chose and still run on almost any device just because they aren't rendering thousands and thousands of tris at once.If you want to just get to the \"game\" part of development, maybe just use Godot or Unreal or Unity. If you want to use game dev as an excuse to learn programming, stay the course. I learned C first and I'm one of the few who would encourage you to stick with a statically-typed language, specifically C++, instead of Python. Doing so will force you to learn core software development principles like memory management, polymorphism, and the wonderful universe of compiler errors and warnings that await you.",

Your best bet would be to stick with what you already have basic of.I find learning programming languages are much more similar to learning actual language than people think. You need to learn it's structure, vocabulary, grammar etc. from some sort of class or self study. But if you want to be better at it. You need to put it to use. At first you would struggle. You don't know what word to use, you tie your sentence in several grammatical error. But through repetition, tenacity and sheer amount of google translation and search. Then you will starting to be better at it.But the issue of repetition is, you need to actually enjoy doing it otherwise it will be hell for you.I suggest starting from something small. Give your self a small problem to solve. You said you want to making game so you study C++ so I guess you want to go Unreal route? Then pick unreal up and start putting your skill to work. Like making an object move but make the speed various depends on surface. That could be a great starting point?Good luck to you on your journey and don't give up!",

If you're going solo, you're having to discover everything on your own.Introductory programming materials are just that - introductory. They're teaching you grammar and syntax - enough to be dangerous, but it's only just the start. These tutorials and materials NEVER teach you how to USE the language, and they can't. There's so much nuance and detail and intuition that it can't be captured - you can't just be told.So yeah, this is the time they call \"tutorial hell\", where you learn the hard way that there ARE NO tutorials that carry you to where you want to go. You burn yourself out on that before you accept your fate, and it's hard work from here.And I hope you're over this hump already, but learning C++ won't teach you how to make a game. You need linear algebra, calculus, and physics. You need to learn concepts like collision, frustums and culling, the light equation, model hierarchies, graph theory, inverse kinematics, audio, input, networking, shaders, normal mapping, texture mapping, gameplay, then you've got design, you'll probably want some embedded scripting like Lua, you'll need to support assets and their file formats...It's best if you pick up the maths, because you can't avoid that one, and that you then use an engine that implements all the bits you're not interested in doing yourself. Building a game engine is every game developer's \"forever project\". If you actually want to MAKE GAMES, then make games, not engines.If you want to get to the end, you can't escape it. Don't give up. Project planning and management is a powerful skill you can develop right now, because organization will set you free. Don't schedule due dates, but a road map, the things you need to do. You don't need a single straight line, you can offer yourself multiple paths, even in parallel, sort of like a choose your own adventure at times. Some things you have to learn in order, some things you have a choice. But get it all written down, along with planning your game. Don't go straight to coding, figure out what you're going to do first - no code, not even pseudo code. Start with some smaller games just to get smart and make cheap mistakes. Then get more involved. No one starts off with their magnum opus and succeeds.",

This has been very suitable for the C# .NET Entity Framework applications Ive maintained so far, however your experience may vary. If you like reading, I would highly suggest familiarizing yourself with Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design first before delving into derivatives like Microservices, Vertical Slices or even Moduliths. There is good material on it by Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler and Eric Evans.If not, set your own standards for how you want to name classes for specific patterns (i.e.: Builders, Repositories, Controller, Services, etc.) and then decide a folder structure (like most layered: Application, Domain and infrastructure) and rules for which classes may be defined in which folder structure.Your goal should be to make your code more resilient to the \"big ball of mud\", essentially trying to keep it \"easy to change\".

        "body": "Okay, lets see if I can explain this.First of all, Software Architecture is a planned design philosophy. Its how you organize your written code and decide on common styles so to compromise on writing \"same\" code across time as well as people. This is incredibly valuable, since you will recognize old or foreign code much easier, saving time on debugging, additions, modifications, etc. If Coding Guidelines define how you write code within a method, then Architecture is everything beyond that: Methods, Classes, Dependencies of Classes, Modules and Projects. However, its distinct from System Architecture, because it really doesnt \"care\" how which system or component is talking or integrating with another outside of code.From what I understand, project codebase organization is less a \"how do you code\" but more of a \"where are the files\". Software Architecture doesnt care if you use Github or TortoiseSVN nor does it care which IDE you use (on a high level, this actually isnt quite true).MVC is Microsofts take on a 3 Layered architecture (Model View Controller), MVT presumably is djangos version of the same thing, then there is the Onion/Clean Architecture that separate layers into Domain, Application and Infrastructure, sometimes even adding Contract and Presentation...The goal with all these is the same thing. Each layer is given an access hierarchy as well as a specific type of issue to address. This is an overhead and sometimes cumbersome but it ensures that you deal with specific problems in appropriate places and dont risk needing to rewrite your whole application just because your database got an update.MVC's approach decided to disregard making your application incredibly dependent on the used technologies, meanwhile Clean Architecture is the very opposite of that. Its why their structures are different. Some other Architectures like Moduliths or Microservices try to accommodate scalability in their approach, allowing your code to be designed to be spread across multiple servers from the ground up. Monolithic Architectures meanwhile do not.",

Often you couldn't possibly. Often, you as the client DON'T WANT to know all the complexities that implement that resource, you only need a means of referring to it when you want to interact with it.Handles are a low level abstraction over a larger whole you want to be opaque. You want to erase type information, you want to hide complexity, in order to simplify how one interacts with it and to protect its internals and invariants from the client.A handle, the only thing you can do with it is hold onto it and pass it. The actual value is meaningless to you. There is no printing it, there is no modifying it, no adding or subtracting it... It is given to you from some interface that is the barrier between you and the resource, and you hand it back through the interface so when you `foo` the resource, you're `foo`-ing THIS specific resource.",

College does not teach you mastery, only YOU can do that over time.The best way to get good at software engineering is to build projects as others have suggested. You have a great base somewhere in your head :) to pull from. Start with something small and definitely do it full stack. If you focus on frontend only you will miss backend context. Same thing the other way around. To me, those two things go together.Start small and keep it simple. Let the project guide what you need to learn next. I almost always suggest the often dismissed TODO exercise to start with since you already have some base knowledge.Start small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, and the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. An address book, an small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from take TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skill you need to build any of these.Also, I have been doing this for over 30+ years and I pretty much only know (often remember) basic syntax. Things I have done before are familiar, but I still need to look almost everything up.Best wishes. You can do this.",

If yes, great, but if not, then first learn the basics, and come back later.Literally the first result on google for \"discrete mathematics book\" is a free online textbook that, from what I can see, seems to give a gentle introduction to these basic math concepts in its \"zero-th\" chapter:[https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/)",

There’s time for that later after you have some muscles, and it will all be much easier.Edit: I’m speaking to a potential coder. If you don’t really enjoy it then pick another path.Edit 2: there are other functions in cs besides coding. I’ve known a few project managers that could not write/run a hello world program to save their life, in any language, yet they rose in the ranks to the point they thought they knew how to tell coders how to do development. Even if you take that (lucrative) business path it’s still worth knowing how to code at some level.",

It's very possible you are a logical thinker, but are overwhelmed by all the choices available to you. What's more, it can be a challenge to just dream up a project out of thin air.Add to that, it's difficult when you're too young to know what your personal strengths are. That often takes time to develop. All you can do is experiment and explore until you discover the things that you find interesting and exciting. For me it was solving technical problems. It was like solving a puzzle for me, and I enjoyed the sense of accomplishment once I found the solution. It wasn't always easy, but it was rewarding.I'd recommend picking a language and focusing on it. Find tutorials and sample code. Study them and try to understand how they work. Then take the next step and create a project of your own. It doesn't have to be complicated or flashy. It might just be a simple console application that performs some utility function like a calculator.",

If there are no common rules for all nouns then I'd just go with the noun interface.Then I would create a class that handles most nouns. For the exceptions (I'm not sure if you can generalize the exceptions) create a class for each set of exceptions or worse case a custom class for each noun that just doesn't follow all of the rules of the other nouns. All these classes would either implement your noun interface or extend your abstract noun base class.You could also have your custom noun classes extend the\"common noun class but only override the necessary conversions, like if a word mostly follows the common noun rules except in a few cases.Then I would probably create a NounFactory or something that would construct the correct noun class based on the noun provided. Or maybe a static function on some class, it really depends on how much logic you need to choose the correct noun class.If you have things like exception 1 and exception 2, and IF a noun needs exception 2 and it ALWAYS needs exception 1, you can start building a hierarchy of classes to handle these exceptions. So exception 1 would extend the base noun class, exception 2 would extend exception 1. This of course breaks down if exception 2 can happen without exception 1. So this approach while keeping all the exceptions nice and reusable would not work.Hopefully that makes sense....",

That said, you may run into some hiccups if you're not too familiar with Latin>Latin has a very interesting way of generating words: You have an word stem, which usually doesnt change, and then an very big number of possible suffixes that change based on the context in which the word appears.This is arguably not all that interesting on its own; well over 50% of the languages on earth have inflection on nouns. That said, that's a minor gripe. Another minor gripe:>And nouns are a comparatively easy example here. Putting aside the fact that the suffixes also change based on the declension of a word (mostly affected by grammatical gender), Verbs have even more different attributes to them, especially when it comes to the tempus.Case, Class, Gender, and Plurality are all involved in declension. Declension is the act of changing the inflection (grammatical affixes) of a noun. In talking about the different suffixes nouns have based on case, we are inherently talking about declension - not putting it aside.> I am currently trying to learn Latin by inserting the rules of the language into a Java library.Don't know how effective that'll be for learning the language, but as a programming project, it's neat!>In the nominative case, its just \"Servus\", while the genitive case has \"servi\", the dative has \"servo\" and the accusative case has \"servum\" (Cases determine the function of a Noun in the context of a sentence and therefore are extremly important for translations). But then there are also the plural forms, which are \"Servi\", \"servorum\",\"servis\" and \"servos\" respectively.If you intended to store things as stems, you might run into issues as there are 5 basic noun classes in Latin ignoring irregulars. \"Servus\" may be class II, but \"Puella\" is class I, and thus declines differently. In order to determine which class a word uses, you need both the nominative, and the genitive forms of the word - you can't always derive all forms from the one stem alone.As for how you could handle this, there's a few options.Least structurally intensive is just feeding the noun constructor an enum of the noun class, followed by the stem, and just switch-casing how the noun declines the stem based on that. Alternatively, make an abstract noun class, and create subclasses of it that each handle a different type of noun.The problem with the above is that it couples your conjugations to the noun classes/subclasses, which isn't very SOLID - bad practice. Preferred option would be to ditch the enums, and create a number of Declension Strategies (See: [The Strategy Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)) you can feed the constructor. This has the benefit of decoupling your declensions from the nouns themselves.Regardless of which of the above do the job, if you want to restrict which nouns get which declension without putting that logic in the noun class itself (again, best practice), you could also implement a Noun Factory or Builder (See: [The Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method) or [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)) which can take in the nominative / genitive forms of a noun, determine its class, and create a noun object with the appropriate strategy for you.But that's a whole lot of over engineering, so take it all with a grain of salt. All I recommend is that you read more about Latin morphology before embarking on this, as it'll help you understand what actually has to happen when declining the nouns.",

Or if there isn't, there will be people around to help typically. Plenty of people go QA -> Dev. Though actually seeing more QA -> Engineer Manager recently it seems. Have you considered that? ;). Seriously, easiest way to do it is to move within the organisation that you current work in. Depending on the company this can be either going up to one of the devs and saying, \"Hey, you know what, i'd like to move into dev here, what do you think and what should I be focusing on learning?\". Answer to that, pretty much always, is the companies codebase, which I assume is the one you opened, and go overwhelmed by so start by getting some help with that. Or, if you have a bit of a tougher gatekeep to deal with, move more towards the test automation side, do more coding day to day and again start to learn the code bases the devs are working on. For even the best recruiters, hiring from the market always has uncertainty, if I am looking for a dev, i'd pick somebody I know, who knows the codebase, the company and the people 11 times out of 10. Just put yourself in that position. Easy from there.",

You are already a QA engineer and so you can probably find one. I often try to find a string in the output that I can search for as a starting point (error messages if they are unique are great for this). I do a full project search and hope my string only shows up once. Then hopefully you have an IDE with \"go to definition\" and \"go to reference\" follow different function call and definitions to try to find where the logic for your bug is. If you don't have \"go to reference\" and \"go to definition\" you are stuck doing searches for function names and will be much slower. Trying to understand a .net project from the launch through all the routing is going through the hardest part with lots of magic Microsoft functions first which is really painful. Try finding something in the output or a name of something you know and work your way back to what logic creates that.",

For me, I have to understand the why in order to remember it. I was never good at reading a book and memorizing the material. I had to put my hands on it, break it, and fix it before I could commit it to memory. The benefit for me was once I understood it, I would never forget it, but it took longer for me to go through the cycle. I think it's always best to have a problem to solve. It doesn't have to be a difficult problem, but simply something that software can help with. Often times a tutorial will provide you with a basic framework that you can leverage to build on. My programming journey started with simple projects in electronics, like solving resistor networks that required a target impedance and range of voltage offsets. I often implemented an iterative solver that started with a guesstimate and automatically adjusted itself until the solution was found. I learned a lot about iterative problem solving as well as learning the language. Those programs became utilities that I would use from time to time.Another project of mine was a Monte Carlo simulator to test various strategies for maintenance contracts. I learned a lot about Monte Carlo simulations, event queues, and the distribution of non-normal data. This was a much more ambitious project and never reached a production ready state, but still it was a useful means of analyzing my problem and learning to leverage features of the language I was working using (C++).Whatever you decide to do, you need to write code. Just stepping through a tutorial is unlikely to provide long-lasting knowledge (if you're like me). However, tutorials, videos, and course-work may be a great springboard inspiring you to solve other problems. Maybe you learn how to build a simple web application that uses a database and you decide to build your own budgeting application. Be curious and be inspired.Keep a directory of all your artifacts so you can use them as reference material - a grep utility is good way to find them for future reference.",

Look at some of your old projects, try and add a new feature. It's easier to add something on to a working product, than it is to create a new product. Then, try start from the bottom. Make a simple project on your own, like a to-do list. Break the problem into smaller pieces, and then if you can't figure out those smaller pieces, Google it. As you keep working on the project you'll gain more understanding of what to use and when to use it, and you'll rely less on Google for the simpler stuff. It's important you don't try to Google the solution to your larger problem, but instead a smaller chunk of it. Splitting work down to the smallest piece possible is the best way I found to learn. If you get your to-do list done, keep adding to it. Sure, it starts simple, but you can expand it to do way more than it did before. Try and find a project to create that you're passionate about, that passion will translate to motivation to learn and create. Keep working on it, don't go too hard on yourself, and try to avoid videos that tell you exactly how to do a project if you feel you're ready to move on yourself. Google is a great resource for asking questions, becoming a confident developer is mostly about learning how to ask questions, and how to word the problem you are facing. Once you've done that, you can create anything really.",

After you build it once, try to rebuild it with minimal help.Making a todo list isn’t super easy, but it’s not very hard either.You can watch a one hour tutorial, build a todo list app, write to a database, use something simple like SQLite, and learn most of the core ideas.After that, think about what else the todo list needs. It needs authentication so other people can’t see your data. You need to host it somewhere like Vercel so you can access it online. You’ll probably need a backend, and to host that backend you can use something like Render’s free tier. Now you learn how to deploy the app to two services and connect them.While deploying, you’ll meet the great enemy: CORS errors. You’ll freak out, maybe punch a wall, but you’ll figure it out.Now you have a todo list, two codebases, deployed on two services, talking to each other, with auth in place.What’s next?Maybe fetch weather data and show it on the home screen. Maybe add Google Sign-In so people can register easily.The list goes on.But to get started, you need to learn how to make a todo list app, because 99 percent of software development is building a todo list with many different fields.",

At least for me it helps me to understand better.Like if you’re just starting to learn JavaScript, start with a bare naked project and get the script to say something. A simple hello world. Then build it up to be a simple, SIMPLE calculator. All just in the terminal, no ui. Then when you’re comfortable with JavaScript itself and getting things to pop up on the terminal, then you’re ready to start learning how to build a project from scratch.Take your script you made, and try and slap a React ui on top of it, moving your logic to the backend to get practice with full-stack development (if that’s a goal of yours). This is the important stepping away from the tutorial part. This is where you make a decision to NOT follow a tutorial and instead look at documentation and examples to understand what is going on in these, in this instance, React applications. Every engineer uses references. It’s okay to not know things. But the goal is to understand the process, not copying and pasting to create a finished product as fast as you can to feel impressive. I struggled with that part of the mental frame when I first started. Overall, just pick an IDE (vscode or IntelliJ community edition, whatever floats your boat), create a file, and start practicing. Don’t overthink the process. There is no fast path to learning, it’s at your own pace. Place the emphasis on understanding what you want to do and how to do it using best practices.",

You will be able to choose what and how you learn this way.On the other hand, to use AI for development you need to be pretty solid with your software development skills and debugging code you did not write yourself to use it effectively. You can also learn the AI stuff on your own if you are at this point with your skills by building projects. Again, you get to choose what and how you learn this way.Both tough choices.Personally, I went down the AI route and I now train others in our company on how to use it. Our company shifted to lean heavily into AI and I was ready because I learned it on my own by building projects with it long before they made that shift.Best wishes and feel free to ask me questions about the AI stuff.",

Are you asking if the win rate is too low to be fun, or are you asking if the program is behaving incorrectly?It's straightforward to calculate the exact probability of each possible outcome of a spin, and thereby calculate the probability of a win. One way to do this is by brute force: there are 116^3 = 1560896 possible outcomes, all equally probable, and you can write a program to count them up *without* randomness.With a little work, you can calculate the same win probability more efficiently, by avoiding repeatedly considering all the duplicate ways to get the same outcome.Of course, even if the probability of a win is 1/100, that doesn't guarantee that there will be exactly one win every 100 plays. The actual outcome is very likely to be higher or lower due to random variation. If you want to check your program for correct behavior, you can do a large number of runs (say, 10000) and then use an appropriate statistical test (such as a chi-squared test) to see where the observed number of wins falls, in comparison to the statistically likely range.I'm not a gambling expert, but I believe real slot machines don't *only* pay out if all of the symbols on a line match. They have additional lower-value payouts that are more frequent, designed to keep the player engaged and addicted in hopes of a jackpot.",

Just treat it as gobbledygook that *has* to be written for a program to work.However, it's great that you are curious. The `main` method is what the Java runtime invokes when you run a Java program. It has the specific signature you described, and here are the reasons for the questions you asked about the method signature:1. All methods are supposed to either return a value, or indicate that they do NOT return a value using the keyword `void`. Java does not expect the `main` method to return a value, which is why we use the keyword `void`.2. `main(String[] args)`: This is just the name of the method that takes a string array as an argument. This does not directly result in any user input. The Java runtime receives the user input arguments from the OS, and then passes them into `main` when it invokes the `main` method.3. The method is marked public because it has to be invoked by the Java runtime. It needs to be accessible to the outside world, it wouldn't make sense for it to be private.Honestly, I don't know if any of this explanation would make sense to a beginner. When I was learning Java, I just accepted that these are lines that have to be there. It made sense only after I had learned a lot more about data types, arguments, return values, classes, etc.",

Stop doing that. Seriously. Start writing every idea down instead of killing it on the spot. Then let it “marinate”. Doesn't matter how dumb it seems. Just capture it.Then look up the \"Hedgehog Concept\". It's three overlapping circles: what you're passionate about, what you can be good at, and what's actually useful. Revisit your idea list with that framework and see what lands in the middle.Here's the key part: pick ONE and commit to finishing it. Even if it's a dumb one. Even if it's small. \"Too hard\" or \"too easy\" doesn't matter - either way you're learning something. If it fails, you learn why and carry that into the next thing.What you're waiting for - that spark of excitement - usually comes AFTER you start, not before. Once you're in it, ideas start flowing naturally. \"Oh, what if I added this feature?\" That's the excitement you're chasing, at least for me it is, and you can't get there by thinking. You have to be building. The fact that you still feel that urge to build something cool? That's not nothing. That's the spark. It just needs fuel - and fuel is action, not inspiration.",

They’re all saying the same thing but with slightly different twists and versions. Take a program, basic simple. Write out in English (or your first language) the steps on what you want to do. 1) ask the user for input “what’s your name?”2) take in input from the user - store in name3) ask the user for input “how many pets do you have?”4) take in input form the user - store in numPets 5) for each pet get the pets name and type i<numPets6) ask for pet i name7) take in pet i name, store in pets[i].name8) ask for pet i type, store in pet[i].type9) print details to the screen“Hi “+ name+” your pets are”For I<numPets print name type.It might seem really basic but this gives you a plan on what you need to do. You can see that you’re going to need a string for the name, int for the age, struct or class for the pets and an array of pets. How big should the pets array be? Do we need to set limits for string sizes? Like in CYou won’t need to do it for everything but as you build up you’ll start to do it more in your head. I always make a .txt file where I’m planning out what I want to do and how I’ll do it. It’s not always the most basic details (ask for name -> get name) but it’s nice to have a list. 1) Get user phone number -> check if it’s valid format -> enable submit -> Send phone number verification2) verify page: get verification code -> if matched sign session, go to home. If not warn user increment attempts. Slow down and build up the basics.",

It helped when I picked one beginner path and stuck with it long enough to build a tiny bit of rhythm. You don’t need long grind sessions either, just short blocks where you focus on one concept and actually type it out. If syntax feels overwhelming, try rewriting small examples until they feel familiar. Once things click a little, it gets easier to add new stuff without feeling lost. You can still explore other resources later, but giving yourself a single anchor point makes a big difference.",

Choose one resource: as in one youtube course, and use secondary resources if something is missing but you should have one primary resource especially at the start3. Actual application: once you are decently capable of the language you chose do something practical with it. This is the fun part, make a game or a GUI application, now there are a few libraries to help you likea. Pygame/turtle for python, draw basic shapes and include textures to make full games from scratchb. Monogame for C# like pygame but for C#c. LWJGL for Java, also like pygame but for Javad. SDL for C/C++, like all the other libraries but generally more complicatede. Unity, a game engine for C# that allows you to very easily import textures, animated stuff, draw shapes, and minimal code writingf. Unreal Engine, like Unity but for C++ and considered harderg. Web development, make websitesNow this does take time but can be rewarding and once you get to the practical part it becomes entertaining somewhat. All of these have a lot of resources online so you will really never be alone.Edit: you should also not try to memorize syntax, that is why Google exists, but you should understand what lines of code do and over time with practice you find yourself unconsciously memorising lines since you understand the concepts",

You’re comparing your behind-the-scenes with their highlight reel, and it’s not a fair comparison.

Every senior developer you admire has been stuck countless times. The difference is they’ve learned that “stuck” is temporary. Some practical stuff that actually helps.take a walk (seriously, your brain needs to defrag), rubber duck it by explaining the problem out loud, break it into the smallest possible pieces, ask for help but come prepared with what you’ve tried, and remember that struggling with something new doesn’t make you dumb , it makes you someone who’s learning. Everyone feels imposter syndrome, even the person who seems to breeze through everything. It’s your brain trying to protect you from failure, but it’s lying to you about your capabilities. You got this job for a reason. They didn’t hire you to already know everything, they hired you to figure things out. That’s what you’re doing right now.

They are often not the best way to learn new concepts. But if you already know what a regular expression is, and just want to know \"how do I used regular expressions in Java?\", the Javadoc page is pretty good. I'm not looking for 10 pages explaining the basics; I just want to know whether I use `\\d` or `[[:digit:]]` to represent a digit.I agree with you that the reference doc doesn't do a good job of linking to tutorial doc. Official tutorial doc usually exists (e.g. [regex](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/) and [records](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/language/records.html)), but it's not centralized in one place and not necessarily even well SEO'd. Still, I feel that Java's doc is far from \"atrocious\". Compare Java's documentation to the documentation for most third-party libraries. It's like night and day. By starting with such a strong word, you're going to have a hard time finding an adjective for documentation that is _truly_ bad.",

But it isn't completely useless :)I think it is worth spending some weeks on - I've used Shiffman's book \"Learning Processing\" (the first edition is officially freely available on the web, and fine for getting started), with about one or two chapters a day, allowing time for personal projects in between.",

Like I use SDL to build games in C++ but for someone who knows absolutely nothing I think C# or python is the best option particularly because of their relative simplicity python in particular being really easy. Now to learn you really don't need any fancy courses just some random tutorial on YouTube and trust me you will almost never use most of the 'advanced' stuff they teach you. The fun part is actually using the game library (or engine) so once you get to that you will get addicted (hopefully). If you didn't understand anything just ask me.",

        "body": "This is a cut and paste from other comment(s). This question gets asked a lot. Here is a way to learn more deeply in the small projects you work on to get more out of them:Start small and keep it simple. Let the project guide what you need to learn next. I almost always suggest the often dismissed TODO exercise to start with since you already have some base knowledge.Start small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. EDIT: fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. An address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.",

Not downplaying what you are saying, but this feeling is pretty normal for me when things shift. It sucks, and for me at least, time seems to cure it. If the job is likely to be boring indefinitely I find a new jobTo address AI directly, I am deep in it with claude code. I am finding that the normal day to day stuff is pretty boring now. Adding an api to support some new feature, along with implementing the front end is pretty easy. Previously those tasks were like 15% planning, 70% coding and 15% QA. Now it is almost entirely QA. It is legit boring but requires a smart human to make sure it works as expected and the code is maintainable. Rarely does claude code one shot things. Although I still do feature development, I have been shifting to harder problems. Finding slow memory leaks, building dev tools to address some inefficiencies, analyzing and addressing performance issues, optimizing our horrendously slow CI, devop stuff, etc. I still use ai for these harder problems but it involves a lot more human coding and intervention. These things felt a bit overwhelming before but now feel doable.... and they are fun. Learning a lot going outside of my comfort zone",

This is simply not the same for majority of modern jobs. Demand is not static and neither is the workload. Sometime you have to update a button on an app and it takes you a hour and then there’s nothing else to do for the day. Other times that button takes you multiple days to figure out.

In the land of advanced bullshit and vibes, maybe a vibe quarantine is also needed, isolating ui components from a vibe coded api service if that is the only part your ceo is mutilating.And you can do what the ceo did to maintain the vibecoded shit in the meantime, let the AI spin away on it but with your abstractions + architecture in mind.

If you lie in such a way that you imply you are proficient in some technology or methodology that you're not, it can really bite you in the ass. Though of course puffing yourself up a little is also expected.And the hiring managers and engineers you talk to all expect this. They know they can't actually verify the minute details of your employment (and this is why you don't lie about things that can be easily verified, such as degrees and job titles), they just want to see if you can effectively sell your capabilities.",

        "body": "It sounds like you're complaining about two separate things: 1) you don't like or understand STAR, 2) you have trouble remembering relevant past experiences on the spot when asked.For number 1, as others have mentioned, STAR is less a template you're expected to fit into (although I have seen rubrics that break down the same way) and more a communication tool as others have said. It just makes it easier to break a story down into the exposition (S and T), what you did (the A), and why it mattered (the R). Kind of like how most movies or books have a beginning, middle, and end.Number 2 is tough and that's where the studying for behavioral interviews comes from. Whenever I've gone interviewing, I've sat down and written out a Google doc outline where I try to think of all the experiences I've had that would be good in these interviews. This should include projects that meet any of these criteria:- you're proud of it / designed and implemented the whole thing even if it's small - it involved mentoring a junior- it required you to make a big design doc and/or plan and delegate tasks across a team you're leading- something went wrong along the way but you either successfully navigated around it or you minimized damage / got something useful out of the failure- you disagreed with somebody but you either convinced them or compromised and the project moved forward- you had to convince someone of something in order to proceedEtc - basically aside from stuff you're just proud of or where you led or mentored one or more people, the more uncomfortable the situation was, the better. Depending on how senior you're going for, it's ok if you don't have as much on the leadership or cross team stuff, but anything that remotely fits that bill goes in.The ideal candidate didn't actively make good contributions to an important project that successfully launched. They also had to convince two other teams who hated the idea at first, and they planned and led a team of people to get it done, and then when critical partner team x got canned halfway through they found a way to work with teams y and z to ship the project, all while some person on team y was critical of the project and trying to hamstring it the whole time until candidate met with them and got them on board with it. (to be clear this is the hyperbolic sum of all the things you try to fit into this interview and not realistically in a single story from any candidate)Last time I interviewed (last year), once I wrote this doc, I actually found ChatGPT really useful to help me digest it and fit the stories into the framework of these interviews (to be extremely clear: as a study aid leading up to interviews, not as a live tool during the interview). I literally copied and pasted / imported the whole doc and told it \"I'm interviewing for role x at level y with company z. Give me a bunch of example behavioral interview questions with answers drawn from my experiences that fit into the STAR framework.\"It was beautiful. The response ended up being a really helpful study guide to pick my best stories for questions like \"tell me about a time you had a disagreement with someone\" and how to break the story down and communicate it. Make sure you have two or three stories for any one question, since you probably have stories that are relevant to more than one question (it's ok to occasionally answer with \"story x from a minute ago fits that bill because of x, y, and z\" but you don't want to do that too much).Read back over your doc and the ChatGPT convo for a while every day and iterate a bit more with ChatGPT about it so you can internalize everything. With a week or two of this type of study, you'll be way more confident. The hardest part is just remembering all your work experiences in detail and writing the initial doc.",

Networking can help but personally all my interviews have come from recruiters / cold applying. I interviewed pretty hard at the start of this year and got to every final round but ended up not getting any offers out of the 4 cycles I did. Took some time off from interviewing and have been reached out to by a handful of big tech companies (Databricks, Amazon, Rubrix) but declined to talk since I couldn't move at the time.Currently I'm doing a good amount of interview prep and I'm in the process for a FAANG and a few other companies that I all got from cold applying. If you're cold applying, obviously you need to really optimize the resume and go through a bunch of revisions but if you're already at a FAANG company I would hope you have a lot of impressive stuff to put on there. Good luck in your search!EDIT: I'll also add to start prepping for system design as soon as you can. Two of the four interview cycles I failed were because of my inexperience with system design interviews. The algorithms interviews I encountered weren't that bad except one of them from G (which probably sunk me) that requires tries and I never studied how to actually implement them. Most others as long as you know your basic patterns (two pointer, sliding window, etc.) as well as graphs and trees you should be just fine.",

Built a personal site and did some leet codeI feel like what moved the needle the most was the certificate. It separated me in a easily quantifiable way from most other devs with similar experience. There is probably diminishing returns after getting a few though. Next most impactful was leet code. I had many interviews that asked these style questions. I wasn't good enough for them so I wish I had reviewed it more.Learning languages seems fruitless. Why would they want my self taught java experience when they can go higher some one with many years for the same money. I also can't ethically say i have work experience in these other languages I would get filtered out before an interview.My big break was from those recruiting emails that ask you to apply. I think they buy resumes from places like dice, but idk how that works. LinkedIn is such a mess. I did get some interviews but it's a needle in a hay stack",

Some recruiters in the past have said that premium members tend to be higher up in their search results. I think the combination of being gainfully employed + having Premium gives the impression of being a candidate who’s sought after. When I have LinkedIn premium off, I don’t get any recruiter activity. It’s sort of shocking to see the difference. This is all anecdotal for me and am open to it just being coincidental, but in the last year I’ve had two job hunting spells and both times I got activity from recruiters when I had premium.",

Not be aimless, scattered, & constant high energy just for the sake of it.

On the other end of the spectrum, some people think React is a specialization, whereas a lot of seasoned web people will argue that \"it can be learned in a week\", aka there just isn't much depth.\"Web\" is a specialization, and there's not a lot of newbies that can speak intelligently about web security and accessibility and performance and/or any of dozens of advanced topics within that domain, and conversely, seniors that can are going to be in demand, precisely because learning about the domain in depth takes effort.Diversification, in the sense of a principal engineer level of scope, is more or less about having to have an opinion about how some deep aspect of the web stack might interact with some deep aspect of the networking stack or the mobile stack or the storage stack or the ML stack or whatever happens to be on fire this semester",

This matters. Ask yourself whether you worked on interesting projects, did you learn some tech on your own and whether you can see yourself doing that kind of work full time. If not, maybe computer science is not the right fitDo not consider only swe roles, data analyst, data science, AI engineer, data engineer, tech consulting, and product manager positions are all paths you can exploreLC does not matter as much in the UAE. Startups care more about your backend, frontend, systems skills than your lc grind (only companies ik who are crazy about lc are dytedanxe, noon, talabat). i could be wrong hereThe market is tough for CS majors everywhere. If you are not interested in the work or feel you lack the necessary skills, switching fields could be an option (i only say this as you claim you didn’t learn much in uni, but it’s been 2 years since graduation and you could self learn more industry skills)",

        "body": "Hey, i know this probably doesn't help much right now but the UAE market is particularly rough for fresh grads in tech. I've talked to a bunch of recruiters out there and they all say the same thing - companies want people with 3-5 years minimum because they're competing globally for talent and can afford to be picky. It's not you, it's legitimately the market structure there.The masters pivot might not be the worst idea but... business degrees after CS can be weird. You'll be competing with people who did business undergrad and have that foundation already. Plus you'd be starting over in a new field while still carrying student debt (assuming you're not getting it funded). Have you thought about maybe doing a technical masters instead? Something like data science or specialized AI programs? At least then you're building on what you already know instead of completely starting fresh.One thing - that gap on your resume isn't as bad as you think. I see people come back from 2-3 year breaks all the time. The story matters more than the gap itself. \"I graduated into a terrible market and kept grinding while exploring options\" is way better than most explanations i hear. Also those unpaid internships you're applying to? Skip them. They know you're desperate and will treat you accordingly. Focus on contract work, freelance projects, or even contributing to open source stuff. At least then you're building real portfolio pieces instead of fetching coffee for free.",

My department recently promoted a new hire to Staff (from Senior) in the shortest time in company history. He implemented AI pipelines that optimize our binary layout, daily, based on a dynamic suite of performance tests prioritized by noise and throughout signal. We’ve observed measurable improvements in customer performance (1.5 to 2x aggregate) that enable margin growth. But God forbid someone use AI for grammar and it’s noticeable.

Some of the technical infrastructure at big banks and major retailers is almost completely run by these people.My theory is that it's much more efficient for these \"main\" companies to hire a core staff and management, then farm out the entry level tech work to these consultancies, than it is for them to hire entry level talent directly. The cost of acquisition and retainment is high and entry level tech work is often not that unique or specialized anymore, so they'd rather leave that headache to the consulting agencies.",

When other teams give you work, give it a priority level with regards to existing work. Whenever you add work to your current sprint, take an equivalent amount of work out.It's common for people, especially tech leads, to feel like they need to handle something themselves because they read the message first. Sometimes the senior devs are swamped, but the juniors don't have enough work. Seniors should help refine and break down tasks so that a junior can handle them, and juniors should show initiative by taking on unfamiliar tasks and trying to learn while doing.At least in my company, if you are up at 3am fixing an issue no one expects you to be at a 9am meeting. Not to mention that if someone on my team was up at 3am, we'd make it a high priority to make sure it never happens again.Feeling peessure to constantly improve is natural when you're a junior and want to get promoted, but yeah it turns toxic when stack ranking is involved and you know that someone around you will get a PIP.When it becomes too much, you need to tell your manager your concerns during a regularly scheduled 1:1. Their job is to help remove those issues. If you don't trust your manager, then you need a new one.",

FAANG is probably one of the best places for someone like you, because they index on general problem-solving skills and less on selling yourself (ehhh, with the exception being Amazon and its leadership principles) or passing stack or language-specific quizzes.I was actually in kind of the same scenario. The company was Google, so it had CV weight, but between all the internal systems, configs, and getting passed around to different projects, I hit a point where I felt like I didn’t even know how to program. Ended up taking a year off and when I started again I got a lot of interviews but blew most of them because I had such a hard time communicating and selling myself on that kind of extremely specific, internal work. It was super frustrating. One of the few offers I got was from Meta, and now I’m doing ML infra work and feel like I’m starting to level up on those skills. One of the biggest things for me has been working on personal projects just for fun, and it’s made me so much better as an engineer. The natural progression of those projects basically forces me into more modern stacks and approaches. Like I had this idea to do network analysis on Twitter hate groups, and suddenly I’m deep into TLS fingerprinting, optimizing hundreds of concurrent workers without hitting Postgres deadlocks, building a double-buffer architecture, messing with text classification, yada yada. It’s taught me way more than I expected.",

By far the biggest roadblock to their growth, according to them, is the small addressable market. Despite its huge population, India has a relatively small number of people with enough disposable income for startups to feed on. This means a startup has a limited domestic ramp up before they must try to find foreign markets.Second, India doesn’t have the volume of original IP including, but not limited to, university research. You cannot exploit ideas you don’t have to become a tech giant.Third, the policy atmosphere and capital markets in India don’t really compare to the best countries. So, many companies move elsewhere once their requirements cannot be met in India. InMobi, one of the largest mobile ad serving companies in Asia ($1B), was started in India but moved HQ to Singapore.Many companies were sold off by founders as they no longer wished to continue. Walmart bought Flipkart, an Amazon competitor, for $16B from founders who wanted to exit.There are several companies that started of great, became household names, but were then unable to keep their momentum. PayTM ($10B), at one time, was backed by SoftBank, Alibaba group and Berkshire Hathaway who all exited.Finally, while India produces a high volume of CS people, the quality is very uneven and many of the best choose to immigrate (to the US till recently but also elsewhere). This means the best Indian minds are not necessarily working in India.",

India is also making some strides in home grown missile defence and drone tech.

Many people apply for few jobs, only the better ones get the jobs that are available. Some people will lose out.There is some fudging by plain luck, and \"better\" or \"worse\" isn't a single, scalar value - but at the end of the day, this is how it works out.>I’m currently interning at a semiconductor startup in the bay area, and I’m fortunate that my internship doesn’t have a fixed end date. But I’ve been trying to transition into a full-time role, and I’m struggling because there just aren’t many listings to apply to.I can't tell how and where you're looking, or whether that could be improved - but be that as it may - you can only apply to the jobs that are there, and that you find. Networking means you'll try to find jobs that aren't advertised; but I am not sure how much of a dent that can make. What does your current employer have to say about transitioning you to full time? Does anyone at that company has outside contacts?>I’ve tried strategies like applying only to jobs posted within the last 5 days, but the available roles dry up almost immediately. I’m open to opportunities both in the Bay Area and elsewhere, yet I still can’t find much that’s actually hiring.So.... there aren't many jobs, and your strategy is to filter that list down further? If anything at all, you should work on a process that makes you find all these jobs within the first 5 or 2 days.You cannot change the market; you cannot change how hiring works. You can adjust your own processes to make the most of the given circumstances, and see that the work you put into it has the highest ROI that's possible for you to achieve.>What are the best resources for finding real job postings from companies that are genuinely looking to hire? Any advice would help.Not from the US, but when I am looking for work, I see which job boards have good results for what I have to offer, I scan those regularly ,and apply quickly. If that ends up in too few results, I'll have to start looking at places where the good matches are less dense. (Assuming that I am happy with my CV, my application process, etc. Those I can change, I cannot change who posts how many jobs where.)",

I have a good friend who has his masters and teaches regular and advanced history / social studies for highschool students, and he's had some uncomfortable insights about AIFor the first time since we've really been recording this information, my friend has been seeing an inverse bell curve; meaning the average score is no longer in the middle ~70%, there are two polar opposites: students that care and are trying, scoring 90%+ and those who just don't give a shit at all. So to give the younger generation some credit, there is a big group of students that see what tik tok and AI are doing to their attention span and are determined to succeed in spite of that. But there just as big of a cohort that are straight up turning off their critical thinking and letting AI take the wheel.Because critical thinking, making decisions really is the skill AI threatens to take away the most. Most of these failing students just refuse to put in any effort that requires them to think beyond a surface level.So to reiterate, this is genuinely new. This is different. Previous technologies like the Internet certainly changed education, but a huge emphasis was placed on digging beyond surface level Wikipedia details. Today AI can (appear to anyway) do that digging beyond for you in a few prompts, and the skill to research and analyze information just gets thrown away by a startling number of people",

All the heavy technically benefits can be thrown around all people want but there’s a lot of finance that will offshore with Java for better or worse. I see the Scala because they can make their Java engineers into Data Engineers with little change. Go is very opinionated. And for heavy lifting mirco services or internal platforms WITHIN the fintech, it’s wonderful. But I feel like a lot of ‘micro services’ aren’t that micro and so things get entrenched in the status quo of Java.

Then when the job market got good again, all of us who had no-name companies made pretty easy transitions into big tech, while the QA/IT guys still couldn't get a SWE jobs.

From what I heard for Google was that they have all engineers do their own QA.I personally think it’s a conflict of interest to consolidate the roles and it’s a bit burdensome, but QA sometimes felt like an afterthought to these higher up chains… so I would stick to dev if you have the choice.",

        "body": "Current SWE (SRE), former Support Engineer.In my experience, Support Engineers are great in theory but in practice the number of truly good Support Engineers is very low.The common anti-pattern with Support is 1. customer complains about something via chat/email > 2. support person copy and pastes customers problem into a dev ticket > 3. now dev has yet another ticket thats probably vague and not actionable out of the box > 4. dev asks support person questions which they relay back and forth to customer until resolution. I call this the **”Carrier Pigeon model of Support” (tm)** and it’s terrible - customers are left thinking “why am i talking to this support person instead of the dev” and devs are left thinking “why is this person making my job harder”. It’s inefficient (latency due to relay) and ultimately makes everyone frustrated. Not falling into this antipattern is hard - customers will pester you (because they want cases solved faster), sales people will pester you (because they want their customer happy), and product/dev people will ignore you (because you’re bothering them and they have More Important Things (tm) to do). What a good Support Engineers does is equal parts social engineering (how do I get this person to help me when it’s not necessarily in their interest) and technical skill (troubleshooting whatever problem the customer has). Generally, I see the following in good Support Engineers:- They learn how to ask good questions - good questions are asked to the right person, in the right way, with the right information in such a way that *makes it as easy as is possible for the answerer to give a response*. Good Support Engineers ask for help from devs in a way that makes it easy to help them.- They manage expectations effectively - sometimes the customer should not be expecting an “urgent fix” for something that is at best a P2 feature request. Good Support Engineers set proper expectations with customers and only let customer urgency bleed onto Devs when its’s warranted.- They are self sufficient and proactive - good Support Engineers leverage resources, the access they have, and their troubleshooting skills to get information. They don’t bother devs about every single question. Thats not to say they never bother devs, but they try to dig up information on their own. Ditto on the proactive - a resource doesnt exist for some issue? They create it. Some issue is happening x times with a common pattern and the org is getting y support cases? They start a thread and start investigating root cause.Great Support Engineers are considerate, thoughtful, and aggressively helpful.",

Management thinks they do the problem solving on their own which isn't the case.However, I have some sympathy for them. I have insight and meetings with the business and we are directly planning on a day to day basis. The support team doesn't get this information and all they get is maybe a 1 hour KT session to try and understand a year and some change of meeting and planning around the application. So of course, they're going to be lost and not really sure why this API is calling this or responding a certain way. Even though I provide extensive documentation, we are serving a business and they need to understand not just the technology behind it all.Overall, it's a frustrating experience though. Idk.",

        "body": "I’m just a SWE 1, but I like to think I have a healthy relationship with AI coding right now. I use it for work daily, but I originally learned and got to where I am without AI.I mentor for lots of college hackathons and I see so many students like you, who are completely reliant on AI to code, and fail spectacularly. It is an **insane power move** (HAHA) when I pull up to a mentee, immediately close ChatGPT or ask them “how do you close cursor?”, skip over all the Google AI overview when I google stuff, and debug their thing “raw” old school and fix it either in 1 glance or in half the time they’ve been stuck in an LLM prompting circle.My advice? Learn without AI. AI is a force multiplier imo, it turns say a level 1 engineer into a level 2, and a level 10 into a level 20. The moment you let things go, you stop leveling up. There is a significant difference in quality and speed between “code me an api for an app” vs “implement an API with these exact 5 routes, implementation steps, pagination, specific auth middleware, database, other layers, and other architectural and security concerns/requirements.”TLDR: better you are, the more effective it will be.“Learning without ai??? That’s impossible.”Yeah yeah, I hear you. You want to be spoon fed everything relevant now. You want it fast and customized. You’ll be better reading and learning without AI, but yeah yeah, it will take longer. Remember that programming is supposed to engage your brain. But if you really want to learn with AI, which I totally get the temptation, here’s what I’ve been advising my mentees at least.It about aligns with how I learned without AI, but adapted to this new day and age:## Use AI as a guide, not as your driver.> in the past, I learned through documentation and stack overflow. I would try copy and pasting code, but it would rarely work without me understanding how it works and modifying it to work with my code.1. Let the AI guide you, not drive for you. Get off cursor or whatever. Do not auto approve changes. Review everything it proposes. Stop copy pasting ChatGPT code. Instead, read each line it proposes, understand what it does and why it does what it does. Never ever put the code in until you know what each line does. Research the documentation, the patterns, everything OUTSIDE of asking an LLM. Too many times, I’ve been burned by incredibly convincing hallucinations I blindly trust.**My company gives me Claude 4.5. I have coded with Gemini 3 in my spare time. Even then, a near top-of-the-line coding LLM isn’t perfect enough to fully vibe-trust for work and for mildly complex projects.**## Ask AI to cite its sources or give it the sources.> I learned everything by reading documentation2. If you ever let an LLM drive (rather, think) for you, ask it for QUOTED sources and links, OR plug in the relevant documentation yourself and then ask for direct quotes that inform its implementation. Then, go back and read that relevant section yourself. Only then, can you hit yes on the code. You’ll learn something, at least, while keeping some momentum and enhancing accuracy. Still—better to learn yourself and feed it what it needs rather than trust it.## Debug without an LLM> Debugging and making effective hypothesis and knowing how to test them is the best skill I’ve learned, and it’s helped me both with and without AI. Trial and error have helped build my intuition and propose ideas on why things aren’t working, and that’s built on a solid debugging strategy, tons of experience, and exploration. 3. Learn effective debugging skills. I’ve had so many situations where students debug via LLM by saying “it doesn’t work, fix it” or “it’s not smooth, fix it”. Instead, when you tell it “I identify a race condition, I’d like to refactor the code by XYZ” the LLM works actually pretty well. But to figure this out, you gotta know how to debug outside of an LLM. Sometimes, it may involve a big or novel switch in approach that an AI in its little rabbit hole cannot suggest. Also, being a code detective is the best part of programming imo, why would you offload the best part to an AI?TLDR: don’t turn off your brain and don’t trust anything the LLM says. Pretend it’s a con artist or scammer and double check everything yourself OUTSIDE of the LLM “scammer ring” scheme.",

I got hit for the first time in my career.I get the next job and within a month they’re talking layoffs.So I get another and on the first DAY they’re talking layoffs.So I get another one (big tech) and they fire someone every two weeks. We got the same copypasta message. Then 11 months later I got the boot. Then I realized that I’ve been doing this for 10 years and I’d have to do it in my 40’s, 50’s, and 60’s.I don’t think I’m a super genius and I don’t think I’m terrible. I can do what you need done and I’m a tad of a workaholic. I’m a woman in tech and made it to age 35 when most women exit tech (~56%). And then I saw great male engineers who were in their 50s struggle and knew the ageism was gonna come for me too.It’s not you. This industry is unhealthy and needs to change. It’s the easiest job in the world and we make it hard for no fucking reason.I returned to nursing school (what I was training for prior to tech) and I work for a hospital for about 1/3 of my wages. Debts gone and we’re managing. I’m happier. When my manager messages me I still flinch. It’s been a compliment or training opportunities.",

The money and flexibility have been great, but after 14 years of working as a SWE the overpaid gravy train may be over for me. Laid off 11 months ago, been actively searching the past 7 months. Dozens and dozens of interviews, no offers.Like you, I always received decent performance reviews. I even survived 4 rounds of layoffs at my previous company. I didn't learn anything above that which was required to move tickets across the board, really coming back to bite me. I've got enough saved up to live comfortably for a decade, but not enough to retire. I'll get a job at the local grocery store, but not being able to work remotely on occasion will be missed.

There are so many devs that yearn for a long stretch of time to just \"go build\" and be left alone to get it done, but I straight up loathe it. I don't want to be left alone to build some future-scrap code. I want to talk to people, I want to fix problems for people, I don't want it to take weeks or more, and I can't stand the forced overtime/on-call crap that is \"just normal\" for these jobsIt's subjectively awful. I spent 6 years on a CS degree, 10 years in engineering, I'm great at getting quality work done and I can bring creativity when it's time to come up with a new solution or solve a problem - but the moment I'm required to work on something big that takes more than a week and doesn't require conversations with others, I generally hit a burnout vicious cycle and it all falls apartAdd in the insanity that we're seeing with AI being used to judge the effectiveness of development, along with major companies \"leading the way\" into a digital wood chipper of approximate solutions and interviews that range from 4 to 10 rounds of incresingly dehumanizing bullshit from 40-hour takehomes to literal video recordings to prove you're not coding with AI when your whole job is fully reliant on the speed AI provides you, and maaaan... I got into this industry to help people, what the fuck happened. I worked tech support and tutored through college and thought that somehow, that level of direct support to others and mentoring would be something I could continue to do at future roles and throughout my career - and I did to some extent, despite the fact that I had to force it, and only in hindsight am I actually seeing that I had to force itI'm starting to understand that the general role of a dev is to quietly crank out text for a computer that does the same thing all of their employer's competitors are doing but microscopically differently - and maybe just a little too late, I'm realizing it's just not good for me. I wish I'd known that before I committed to 15 years of it, back when I still qualified for student aid and could still pursue psychology or education, but worst case the trades are hiring, and being an electrician is a damn good worst case for meMight still have to code for a while, depending on how the current interviews I'm going through work out, but if I somehow score a support role I'm never writing code for someone else's vision again. Maybe I can finally find the energy to build all the cool shit I've put off for so long while trying to minimize feature burnout for my employer",

Of the many questions I ask, I like to ask engineering managers / directors: \"What was the hardest conversation you've ever had with a stakeholder\". What I'm listening for in the manager's/director's response is:1. Have they ever told a stakeholder \"no\" or \"[yes, and](https://galenemanuele.com/blog/power-of-yes-and)\" (which is really just fancy \"no\"). Unless they've been in leadership like ... 2-3 years ... an answer of \"huh, nothing comes to mind\" is a red flag for me. My read on that is they're very likely avoiding difficult conversations to the detriment of their team, because leadership is almost never sunshine and butterflies for everyone. Business is hard.2. What inputs lead to that difficult conversation? The team? A Jira board? An existential threat? Customer feedback? Data? Hopefully something more tangible than intuition alone.3. How did they tailor the conversation to this specific stakeholder's behaviors, values, and goals?And I often ask clarifying questions, or for them to elaborate, if I don't get 1, 2, and 3 covered in their initial response. Covering all 3 in the initial response is a big old green flag for me. I need to work with leaders who know how to \"go to bat\" for their people and advocate for what they believe is best for the business -- maybe that isn't as important to you. A big, big part of having a healthy engineering practice is telling important people \"no\" sometimes, even if they might fire you or advocate for your firing because you said \"no\". But they probably won't fire me, because I've already established through a different line of questioning that this leader values [psychological safety](https://psychsafety.com/psychological-safety-72-personal-user-manuals/).",

You can ask all sorts of questions, like:* When the the last Production issue they had? What was it (roughly), how did they resolve it, did anything change afterwards?* What kind of hours to people work?* Talk about a time a deadline wasn't going to be reached. What was done to in response? * How are technical disagreements resolved?But the problem is that people will sometimes lie, omit things, or stretch the truth. Something else to consider is that companies can change. Maybe they lost a big client, maybe they gained a big client. I've had the best times working for people who were empathetic (treated you like a human and adult), showed attention to detail (cared and understood about the work, could ask intelligent questions and talk to other teams about it), and could say \"no\" to people (external stakeholders and the internal team), including, \"we are not releasing this in its current state.\" I've worked for people who thought they were better than me, and their time was more valuable. Those people are awful to work for. There are people who don't take responsibility, try to blame others. \"Hey, I screwed this up, can you work extra to fix it all?\" It might be a weird thing to say, but having a mix of professional pride, caring about the work, and respecting the people doing the work. Oh, and I always appreciated people who were honest. I've worked with people who intentionally hold information from you. In some cases, it might be a good thing. Shielding the team, maybe hiding that we have some ways to extend a deadline, but pushing the team. Those can suck, but I liked that manager. I worked for someone else who would intentionally withhold information from the team. I got the impression they did this to always feels smarter than everyone.

Pay at an internship ends up being a drip in a bucket compared to your long term prospects. It might feel great to have an extra few thousand over the course of a summer or whatever it works out to. I wouldn't blame you for taking the money! But truly, if you're feeling the squeeze on money in college like I did, you're going to be shocked at how financially comfortable life is landing at a top company post graduation. If you can put that off a little bit more and you're interested in the work spacex does, imo you should take it.",

The startup was fun in that you could ship fast and make decisions quickly. The con was the pay, job security, growth opportunities, etc was not there. The FAANG had the best pay and benefits but I got laid off. I enjoyed my time there as I got to work with smart people that taught me a lot. The con being it was an impact culture that always kept you pushing (Meta). The SP500 Im at now is a great WLB that pays about 20-25% less than the FAANG role. The big con is that everything is a process and leadership is largely incompetent. Lots of rest and vesters who are terrible at getting things done. Also growth opportunities are slow at my current company. Im likely going to try and find another job next year to have a chance at being promoted.",

Figure out how to offset that. No, I don't have suggestions as to how -- ask me 8 months ago -- but that is what I would focus on.

This cut my anxiety with dealing with these people quite a bit.Honestly, a lot of this is just learned with experience. But your anxiety probably isn’t doing you favors. It’s probably making you less likely to push projects forward for risk of offending or possibly being afraid to ask for direction.",

Like when i was applying early this year and talked to recruiters most told me they were seeing an uptrend in positions. I moved to austin when i had 4 YOE. It's a really fun city to spend your 20s in. Not sure what your goals are in austin but it is one of those cities that people seem to grow out of after a few years here. When i got here everybody i knew that had been here for 3+ years talks about leaving. I was always like \"why it's so fun\" and theyd just be like \"give it a few years\". Now i started my 4th year here and i can see why. It's really fun but it's also really young and once you outgrow the bar scenes it makes you want to just find something new.",

The metacognition part is the most problematic part because no LLM model is able to accurately identify when it genuinely doesn’t know something. The output layers only give probabilities for the next token, but those probabilities don’t mean anything real about the outside world. A token having 90% probability to the model doesn’t mean there’s a 90% chance that’s the right answer.",

I work in data, same age and on about £70k. I only got here by being ruthless eg constantly putting myself out there out there at work, learning new things, leaving roles/environments that weren’t suitable etc. Frankly I don’t think any 3-5 month course is really going to do much for you. Many data careers want a masters in maths for example so your bootcamp just isn’t going to be competitive give how many relevant degree holders are going to be in the pool of candidates. It’s not really a career where someone that isn’t passionate about it, will do well because it is so highly saturated. The bubble has popped in that sense. If you do want to do some courses I’d recommend things like AWS certified courses or Microsoft certifications. Not free but might help you leverage some credibility. But the gold standard would be getting any role and leveraging data in that role as a stepping stone to a better job.",

They basically gave me some time in a conference room along with a description of the problem and a pretty good explanation of what it was and a pointer in the right direction (use a trie, in this case).But somehow I took a mental wrong turn early and never managed to recover from it. I misunderstood the problem and thought it was something much harder. When I got home I opened up VS Code and wrote out a really good solution in ten minutes :-(Thankfully I'm currently employed, but I *really wanted* this role! It was probably the single greatest opportunity that will ever be in front of me.They even sent me a nice hoodie from their swag shop! It's in a dresser right now and will probably get donated at some point because I'd feel like a complete fraud if I wore it.",

Neetcode used to have a \"buy-it-for-life\" deal, but I suspect it is not longer around. Maybe some perspective is this job won't be forever, and you have some war stories. I've found genuine stories that show you were really doing work can be helpful in interviews. When (not if) you start interviewing, don't be so desperate to leave your current situation you ignore red flags at a new place. That can get you stuck in a spiral of bad jobs. I've ignored red flags before, and it always came back to bite me. I was once desperate to leave some place, and another time, the jump in comp made me ignore some red flags (a bunch of the people I interviewed with were less than impressive).",

I plan on being as intentional about finding a place that aligns with my values + worldview / desired work life balance as possible. i anticipate the industry will change a lot in a year (right now 9/10 jobs seem to be wrappers around AI) so who knows what things will even look like. but i want to force myself to prep as best as possible",

Do you have experience with it?- docker. Some people have never used it- observability. Again, some don’t have exposure. But a lot depends on what you know going into this. I’d be curious about context. What additional interview steps are there? How much time are you being given?Also, don’t go in with the mindset if the interviews doesn’t work out, it was a waste of time. Think of it as a way of learning some new things. You might want to dig deeper on your own, and these could become talking points during future interviews. A lot will also depend on the people doing the evaluations. Some people want to understand how you think. Others just want to nitpick. Another thing to consider is that some companies also use a project like this as a personality test. Did you go the extra mile? Did you make interesting, thoughtful decisions? There’s not a perfect answer, but I assume you’ll get a decent amount of people on this sub complaining.",

Try to find a mentor if you can (sounds like the wrong kind of workplace for this but maybe?). And most importantly of all - don't worry too much about it. Every single day you spend at that clown show will teach you something.\\> perform betterDo what it takes to make your manager happy. Communicate limitations. No engineer knows everything and learning about the system/framework/language/concept takes time, rational people know this. Try to find someone who will give your work direction and justify it - a team leader, manager, anyone who has someone important's ear.\\> prepare to transition to a healthier companyIn this market? As a junior? Good luck.\\> The whole thingDon't stress over what you can't control, value consistency, look back on and review your work to see if it makes a difference or if you're treading water, communicate honestly with experienced people around you, keep an eye on your savings account.",

I’m grateful to have a job, but I’m hoping to leave once I have enough experienceTruth is that nobody is going to own your growth, learning, or development like yourself. Managers, good or bad, have a strong preference for self-reliant employees. Try to learn what you can at work, but mostly a lot of gaps will have to be filled in on your own. Your seniors are busy trying to drive business value and manage expectations with leaderships. Mid-level engineers might have more time to mentor you but they are not motivated to.> On top of that, I’m assigned high-priority tasks with a lot of ownership, but I drop the ball or I am given no guidance. I’ve felt completely in the dark and left to fend for myself. Feeling extremely disappointed because I am older than the usual junior because I switched careers.> You've got to make sure you nail down requirements and get the answers you need before you start coding. After coding, make sure you do QA, and have confidence in your happy path tests and edge cases. If you're working on a difficult task, then improve your communication and manage up for your PM and manager. Prioritize tasks that unblock other engineers so they trust you and don't blame you for delays.> How do I up-skill effectively, perform better in my current role, and prepare to transition to a healthier company?It's as simple and hard as starting now, practicing consistently, and documenting your accomplishments so you can talk about what you've done and can do.

However I noticed recently companies are starting ti invest in young talent especially last month or two because of h1b fee (I’m in tech tho so this applies more) I headed from recruiters that it was a nightmare to sort through 1,200 plus applicants because most applicants lie about they don’t need sponsorship they get to final round and they can’t give them an offer because they need sponsorship so their forced to look within aka college grads to mold and groom to long term talent so they won’t waste time and money navigating the hoops of h1b sponsorship",

You'll have the most success trying to get into a position with your current employer, or finding an employer you know has an IT department and working in laterally. The days of going from a non-IT position at employer A, to being a fresh grad and going to an IT position at employer B are dwindling quickly. It's not even AI or anything, it's supply and demand, and the benchmark of where you need to be.Unfortunately, I think some of this is due to how easy it used to be to get into the industry set the bar so low, that as requirements increased, that bar raised so high that it's nearly impossible to learn it all on your own at the level they're truly seeking. That's why employers want you to cut your teeth at other employers so they don't have to invest as much into you, and can reap all of the benefits of a seasoned worker.I'm not worried about AI, if you're replaceable by AI, then upgrade your skills like tech workers always have to with all new things. Don't become complacent and think you've made it. Always be learning and moving forward, and you'll never be replaced. If you do get replaced, then something went wrong - either you had an employer who didn't value you enough to keep you, or you didn't value your own time to teach yourself new things.We're human, and humans are still needed in tech, and they always will be. Maybe that will look vastly different in 5-20 years, but you'll know which direction to go eventually. All these companies hyping up AI as a replacement to 80% of jobs are probably heavily invested in it succeeding, and if we were truly there, then all jobs would be at risk, right? There are plenty of easier jobs for AI to do than programming, but you never hear about those people freaking out about being replaced. Just us. You'd also notice AI not being able to be spotted anymore, and it being perfected to a level that it just isn't yet.",

That said it also forced me into a bad place mentally. Being on a pager is rough. Being on a pager for a team that constantly has issues is also rough. I developed severe anxiety issues that I attribute to my on call duties. Had to be at my computer within 10 mins for any p1 issue, and on call cycles were generally a week long.

At some companies SRE's are SWE's who focus on infrastructure, observability, and reliability. At other companies they've basically took the old sysadmin roles, added more responsibilities, and relabeled it to be SRE.I realize I came off as pretty harsh on SRE's which isn't my intention. Many of the SRE's I've worked with in my career are incredibly smart and well respected.

You'll learn a lot.Be careful with your money, though. Ensure part of your paycheck is going to a high-yield (but still relatively liquid) savings account, like Ally. Only live off of what's going to your checking and budget aggressively. You're taking a less stable and likely less paying job now to secure better ones later. But this is exactly the time in your life that you SHOULD be doing things to set up your career for later, not trying to stay and get comfy.Also, to clarify, do you mean that in 3 months you'll be a full-time employee if they keep you on?",

        "body": "MSE-DS is not what is going to get you into a job in Cali. I'm in the MCIT and I would say that penn is very east-coast oriented. Since you have DS experience you can absolutely get a job in Cali, but it would not be because of your penn degree. Also yeah it is true that a lot of the courses will probably have overlap with your undergrad, and look at [mymcit.org](http://mymcit.org) and look at the DS reviews - they aren't great. If I were to go back, I would have applied to a West Coast school as I want to move to Cali too. This would be the optimal choice, but hey completing the MSE-DS is still going to move you forward and is not a bad decision, but just that there may be a better decision for the 3 years that you would put into completing the degree.My humble opinion: apply to an MSCS instead. Your DS undergrad combined with CS masters will make you unstoppable. It does not have to be brand name either. For example, SJSU is heavily recruited by big tech companies. So I would apply to all brand-name and non-brand name schools on west coast and see where you get in. After all, tech is not *as* elitist(unless you get into berkeley/stanford which will give you a massive advantage) as top finance/consulting. So, being on the west coast even at an average school will give you a higher chance of being hired in Cali than MSE-DS.",
