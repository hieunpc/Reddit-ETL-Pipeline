If you do then there's nothing wrong with using them in prod.Some more thoughts: The issue that I usually see in practice is that once you start introducing these things then notebooks' convenience is reduced, so there's a lot of resistance against controls that prevent people from just yeeting something into production. And once you let people yeet their non-important work, its only a matter of time before people start yeeting important work.",

Its real value is allowing systems to adapt as business meaning changes over time, and that benefit is easy to defer.* Tech debt is real, and under delivery pressure the cleanup backlog rarely wins. Even when modeling could be part of the design, timelines usually cut it first.* Storing source data indefinitely is becoming common, which makes replaying historical transformations feel like an acceptable substitute for managing change semantics.* Data teams are increasingly embedded in business units. Without a central steward, consistency across domains erodes even when the same underlying data is reused.* AI increases speed and lowers the cost of repetitive work, which further shifts effort toward shipping and iteration rather than integration rigor.* The idea of a single source of truth still matters philosophically, but if leadership doesn’t care when numbers don’t line up exactly, it’s hard to justify enforcing it.The common thread is that modern data systems are optimized for reversibility rather than correctness. Cheap compute, infinite retention, replayability, and AI assisted iteration all increase tolerance for semantic drift. Dimensional modeling still addresses that problem, but its value only materializes when the organization is forced to care about consistency over time. Modeling is rejected in favor of these other mechanisms which isn't a better approach but it does align with the systems that are readily available.",

We observed that the actual data loads we were processing were never big enough to necessitate a Spark cluster.2. Getting rid of Spark meant we could get rid of the whole complexity of running a JVM using the massive collection of libraries Spark requires (with all of their attendant security vulnerabilities) and replace it with a single, dependency-free DuckDB compiled binary.3. When we tested it against Spark on our real data it ran about 10 times faster and used half the resources (and _yes_, I'm sure the Spark code could have been optimised better, but that's what our testing for our specific use-case showed).Point 3 was the major one that allowed us to convince ourselves this was a good idea and sell it to management.",

There was a small period in time, and maybe it's still true, where it was just throw XGBOOST at it and go sip your coffee, and thats what a lot of folk were doing. But that does a disservice to a lot of the actual data scientists out there doing the maths and actually understanding inputs and outputs.I guess I ranted a bit there, the short story long is, yes, that is common, and I typically avoid it if I can.

I've done the stress of consulting and PE, and I can't imagine leaving insurance these days unless it was to go back to higher ed, but the pay there doesn't compete with the pay in insurance.Insurance in general tends to have a lot of lifers, my team these days has 14 folks, with an average age of 51. Five of us are younger than 40, seven folks are older than 50, and one gentleman still plugging away at 73. Only two of us have been here less than 8 years, and six have been here 15+ years.I was at USAA for about a year before this, and they also had a ton of long-timers. My team there was \\~8 folks and only two of us had been there less than a decade, lots of folks had started in other jobs at the company and then cross-trained over into DE as the company built their org. They want to keep folks who really get the insurance business, that domain knowledge is really helpful.Not sure if I'd recommend USAA right now, though. They're going through a whole lot of flux these last few years, and I think I'd steer clear until they figure things out, maybe 2028\\~2030 or so. The thing that hurt USAA was that they got out over their skis after their big hiring burst during Covid, so they tried to thin the workforce with a ton of early retirement incentives in 2023, and then still had to do their first-ever wave of layoffs in 2024. Morale went from sky-high to the absolute gutter after the layoffs, so a lot of us bounced in the aftermath of that.Once you've seen how stressful consulting and other industries can be, then how unerringly *stable* insurance is, it's hard to want to leave.",

I've handled ingestion, I've also had past lives in reporting, ETL/ELT and web dev, so I'm confident in my skills on any side they want to put me on.

        "body": "My POV is someone who is closely following the work happening in iceberg, arrow, ADBC, data fusion, etc. These are technologies that are making data tools more interoperable and standardized which is what open here refers to.—-So back to my point: The majority of the disagreement here comes from how people are defining “open.” This doesn’t mean open source. If you pay attention to the current developments, it’s about open standards and moving away from “proprietary interfaces” to tools and formats that can talk to one another and in general, enable much more efficient data transfer. These two alone unlock many downstream applications!As a small example: warehouses bundled storage, compute, and proprietary file formats together. That’s where the lock-in came from. If your data lived inside a proprietary format (like in Snowflake), you were effectively tied to that engine.The thing that’s really exciting and evolving is the maturation of standardized components of technological primitives that many modern tools use today. Open table formats like iveberg and delta, arrow (as a shared in-memory format), ABDC for super fast data transfer ,and newer engines like duckdb and data fusion all are working towards the same future. They’re all open source, want to converge to open standards, and if used together, enable an “open data infrastructure”. Which means the engine you use for AI/ML, real-time applications, and BI can all be based on data that lives in one storage layer and yet, can be run in any compute engine. Developers can live in a world where you can work towards running local dev in DuckDB and prod workloads in Snowflake. Minimizing vendor lock-in to me is just the a small side-benefit.Vendors are still vendors. Nothing about this means tools like Fivetran+dbt are suddenly open source. The idea is that they operate on top of this new infrastructure that is less restrictive than the old warehouse model for the technological benefits, but also allows them to compete with Snowflake/Databricks/etc at a completely different angle. If engines are swappable, these big platforms lose a lot of their architectural leverage. Now the power and thing to control is the stuff outside of that (I will let you think through that part as an exercise haha). All of this to say, I try not to take anything with face value. There’s always nuance. Yes “open data infra” is a buzz word and is marketing for sure, but if you follow the current state of technology, there’s real nuance here!",

My recommendation is actually play around with a front end tool like Power BI and understand how data is used and what is recommended for best practices for how data should be structured. If you understand that and refer to the Kimball modeling techniques and can actually internalize it that will get you most of the way there. It’s not really something that is easy to explain in a video I don’t think. You need to be able to really mentally visualize how data ties together and what shape will make it easiest and most flexible to work with.",

Identify and execute projects that support company objectives, develop relationships within the business, that sort of thing. This is why: the next step from senior is often a lead or manager, so to go from junior to senior, you need to demonstrate capability, then when you’re a senior you’ll be refining your capability and starting to demonstrate that you can apply your skill to leading others, which gets you to the next place.And obviously that varies wildly from company to company :grinning_face_with_sweat:",

Also you have seen and probably contributed to a couple of failed/sucessful projects end to end and had to do some maintenance of it after you are ”done”. The maintenance is very important because long term that is where most costs are generated. This is why lots of senior devs are a bit sceptical about ai and the maintenance costs it will generate.So to answer your question: make sure you are exposed to all aspects of a project lifecycle, not just greenfield nice solutions where you have free hands.

Once you know the basics of SQL/Python/basic Data Engineering fundamentals (CDC/Data Governance/OOP/Security/Statistic/DevOps/BI/etc), the questions one can be asked in this industry is so vast that practicing for it may be in vain. Esp in the high pressure screen share environment of difficult questions one might be asked. The longer you work at that job the more senior one can become. Avoid working in/applying to industries/for companies that intentionally use older technologies. By that I mean if they list older technologies in their job positing or the company inherently keeps themselves ancient like Intel/IBM/some pharmaceutical companies/some government jobs/etc. This approach may not be for everyone but I applied to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs in a year. Which, like reading 20 pages of a book a day, can be the simple consistency of a few jobs a day. And when my current job stopped challenging me enough during the pandemic I joined a start-up to challenge myself further. They just wanted SQL which is an easy requisite and through that process I learned Snowflake, and through that start-up/Snowflake experience I later got another job in Snowflake/GBQ/GCP, and through that job I later got a job in AWS/Databricks.I never practiced code tests for any job. Many jobs didn’t want me for many reasons outside my control and it still hurt on a deep personal level. Many jobs I didn’t want because the interviewer was rude/the company didn’t seem fun. But for the few jobs that worked out I have seen a bunch of different problems in a bunch of different contexts in a bunch of different languages in a bunch of different industries. Those things, and factors about one’s personality, seem to govern good Senior/Staff level positions. It’s more about the patterns one has seen in real scenario's and one’s temperament - that’s hard to train for.",

        "body": "Did that move about 3 years ago, can share my 2 cents.Why I switched: I realized the parts of DE I enjoyed most were modeling data for analysts, arguing about metrics definitions, and making dashboards actually useful. I cared less about perfect infra and more about “are people making better decisions with this.” Analytics engineering was basically that full time.Day to day difference: as a DE I spent a lot of time on infra, pipelines, performance, random firefighting. As an AE I’m still writing SQL and some Python, but I’m way closer to the business. More time on dbt models, tests, documentation, semantic layers, and collaborating with PMs / analysts. Less Kafka / Spark / k8s, more “what does ‘active user’ actually mean and can we stop changing it every quarter.”Step up or step down: it’s more of a fork than a ladder. If you like infra and scale problems, AE will feel softer. If you like modeling, metrics, and being involved in product / strategy chats, it feels like a step up because your impact is easier to see. Comp for me stayed roughly the same, slightly higher later because I became the “metrics owner” and that’s valuable at product‑led companies.Branding / career path: I brand myself as “data platform + analytics” now. Titles I see after AE: senior AE, analytics lead, data product manager, head of data, sometimes even PM for data products. You become a good candidate for roles where you’re the bridge between pure engineering and pure analytics.Gotchas:You will write a lot of SQL and stakeholder‑friendly docs.You’ll spend more time in meetings explaining data than tuning clusters.If you hate ambiguity and politics around definitions, it can be frustrating.With 8 years as DE you’re probably overqualified on the tech side. The real question is whether you want to move closer to the business and be judged more on clarity, communication and “does this metric make sense” than on how elegant your pipeline is. If yes, AE is a pretty solid move.",

I work with a DE only people and ive noticed a here a huge difference in design patterns. Their solutions tend to be one off purpose built imports. They almost never parameterize their solutions and any meta data used is typically a json file in the app and locked behind version control.When you are tasked with modeling an enterprise asset, you're forced to figure out ways of genericize your solution to support future initiatives. Alot of times this means data driven solutions for DE tasks... and I dont see many DE only peers that use data to drive their pipelines.

Quicksight wasn't really considered as an option for either project - one was in the public sector and they put a lot of value on the governance baked into Looker, and the other was scared off of anything primarily UI driven and really valued the idea of BI as code.The public sector project was pre-acquisition. I don't recall the costs from back then, but I'd bet that it was less of a factor than today.Quicksight is way less expensive, though I still doubt I'd choose it if I was the first data hire at a standup today.

As an example, I have worked for a few SaaS companies where the data collected was never viewed across clients and client insights only required a semantic layer for self service analytics.

There is not strict time limit - if you have a new job offer in hand, then it doesn’t matter if you were at your previous place “long enough”. However, if your current stage is promo from senior —> staff or switch from dev —> management, you usually need to do that by staying at the same company for a while. You usually won’t get that promo from switching companies.",

We have a specific workflow for each type of model that the LLM follows to generate the docs. Moreover, we instruct the LLM to produce the same structure of documentation for each type of model.For example, curated (mart/gold etc.) models are directed more for the end user and contain sections such as purpose, business use cases, metrics ect. So not too technical. Intermediate models ,i.e., models used to split up complex transformation logic are documented with the developers as an audience, so they are much more technical and basically explain what we are doing CTE by CTE.For most models #Business Logic is a section where we explain the specific business logic/rules implemented. The LLM infers these business logic by lopking both at the RAW query and inline comments. Also if it detects a business logic from a query, we instruct it to add short inline comments explaining it. So it goes both ways.Using LLM to generate documentation increases the doc coverage in our project and increases the uniformity of documentation structure across all models. In turn this documentation is then indeed used to power AI Agents for Data Discovery - think chatting with agents to discover which/where data is stored to answer specific request, so they don't answer the question, they just point the user to where they can probably find their answer. It may be also a documented exposure, not model per se. And eventually it could also power AI analytics, where they actually access a semantic/metrics layer or directly query the database based on all of the context. So yes, we document business logic and use LLMs to do so for uniformity and completeness.",

Another suggestion would be to avoid hardcoding the countries and the category, but put them into two seeds `top_countries` and `top_category` (these could become just models in future) and reference them in the query, so it's clear that you are picking the top countries and category and from where.",

You can minimize the harm by equalizing story points available across the team, and using discretion to add points (or subtasks) dynamically for things that wind up being more complex than estimated. It still puts a LOT more pressure (somewhere) on estimating and updating points. And you will still get people trying to cherry pick tasks with the most ROI (points to level of effort) or pad the points numbers. Have fun with that!I would still rather have a performance review from a human who knows all the nuances of what I did and why.

(trying to keep the context brief)So take my response as someone basically shooting from the hip:Bring it to your team and decide together.Just be straight with them that you've already objected and have been overruled, and you want input from your team so you can make it as fair as possible.I assume leadership wants the metrics to be presented in a style they're already used to and may already be defined.This is probably a situation where you're guaranteed to end up with someone who is upset. But at least you can sleep knowing you tried your best to be fair and respectful to your team. And they should appreciate that you gave them a chance to suggest things that affect their livelihood.Also, will you be able to try things? \"Ok, let's try these KPIs for 3 months and see if I agree with them as the manager or whatever\". Your call if they'd be impersonal enough to present to your team as well. If you feel like the KPIs suck, at least you'd have a starting point.",

Measure the product, not the people. Your leadership should care about things like uptime, error rates, and performance/cost improvements. I guarantee that fulfilling your leadership's ask here will result in a worse outcome for delivery and more employee turnover, but hey, it will also get them the pretty numbers they want, so I guess they can count that as a win.",

I don’t think it’s very good when people use it to create code they don’t understand or could t write themselves with more time, but right now it’s just a fact that it can write out code that manually would take me hours if not sometimes days and generate it in a fraction of the time. At this point I think it’s just a required tool to stay competitive, if one dev can get a solution in two hours and another takes a week doing it all manually it’s just not even a comparison.",

Other times I'll guide AI much more to get the results of my liking, because I need more control of how it's done. Other times I'll ask a lot of questions about things it did, and ask it if it could have been done differently because I'm exploring / learning.It really depends on my purpose. Using AI to get immediate results without knowing how it works isn't inherently bad. We all use tons of libraries and we didn't reviewed their code. But you can't do it always like that. For the same reason that makes using AI during a training stupid: because our job is based on knowledge.",

I don't know if we're just lucky but what you describe sound too much for pipeline maintenance.For Salesforce and Netsuite we are using Stitch as an ELT provider to do the sync. 0 maintenance with the ingestion part. Stitch is ugly and cheap. But it works and it's cheap!We are also using the ELT Service Provider for Marketing related sources like Google Ads, Bing Ads, Facebook Ads, Google Analytics, etc. as these sources have breaking changes every once in a while.In all of our self written data downloaders we use the JSON format to store the data and load it like that in the the landing zone. This means that whenever ppl are adding new custom fields, they will be synced. Of course new custom fields have to be added in the data transformation when flattening the JSON structures in the silver layer.",

You can do that on your own site or with something like Cloudflare R2 + a little static page. To the client it just feels like “click link, click button, done,” no portals, no weird ads.If your clients are a bit more tech friendly, WeTransfer Pro is still decent. The free version is where you start to get the sketchy vibe and limits.",

Without some kind of framework, the modern stack is just hard to keep sane.You’ve got orchestration, ingestion, dbt, data quality, catalog… all different tools, all doing their own thing. You end up spending more time wiring stuff together than actually trusting the data, and governance is always the thing you promise to “add later”.What worked for us was putting everything in one place. Governance stops being a separate project, and the bonus is that AI can finally use the context properly which speeds teams up a lot.Without a proper framework around it, it's not an easy job to do it. In modern data stack, there are lots of tools that you have to bring together. Orchestrator, Ingestion, Transformation, Data Quality, Data Catalog, etc.",

Doing this with gemini, open metadata, and a tool that feels like microstrategy before it was a bitcoin company. They can call down decent data from a lake or table and bitch to high heaven but my plan is basically to tell them that their excel files are trash and they need to clean them up or start learning. The tool foeces data into a standard and offers some agents for clean up. We have a fundign and culture problem though. Also, once the 50% that are eager to do things with data are showing the leaps and bounda they are making over other departments, we may get another 20 to 30% adoption.

You can always load golden data into redshift (or clickhouse) to support certain query patterns that the lakehouse may be less suited for. The issue with having golden data only exist in redshift is that it'll limit who can consume it. A spark job for example will not perform well when reading 100gbs of behavioral data from redshift (and the load will degrade query perf for other users)You mentioned not doing cdc yet but definitely don't stream cdc (or anything) from your oltp into redshift",

Then at runtime, the individual vizzes would join in the relevant data, and any viz that doesn't require the joined data won't join anything.Otherwise, in my experience (and this is obviously dependent on a number of factors), creating a single pre-joined table generally yields better report performance and potentially better dev experience. If this isn't an option, then my instinct leans towards leaving it as denormalized as possible.",

I'd like to ask a little bit of clarification.ACCOUNT\\_CODE and SERVICE are the two main tables (with several attributes), and they will be kept separate in any model. My two issues are: \\- Where and how to store the attribute account\\_code x service (which has a 1:N relationship): 3NF, Denormalized, Bridge Table, i2b2 model... \\- How to join this information for reporting (e.g. at the SQL level as a table, as a view, or at the reporting level with Tableau Custom SQL or functions)All of the models listed have a single pre-joined table other than A. B connects each account code to the service, but then the aggregation has to be done at the reporting level (in this case, Tableau). I'm sensing that you'd recommend D (denormalized), in which in the service table, there's a column with the grouped account codes (e.g. Service B - 1-3101, 1-3102, 1-3140) and there's a bridge table that connect these groups with the individual account codes. But I'd appreciate if you could detail a bit more.Thanks again!",

Sometimes, teams decide to go with small improvements like standardizing ingestion and transformations, while sometimes they decide it’s a good point to redesign the whole stack.Where does most of your time go today, getting new data into the warehouse, or shaping it into something usable for reports?Thank you",

Even a small end‑to‑end thing like that looks way better on a resume than “finished X course”.If you can share the second course’s link or syllabus, people here can usually tell pretty fast if it’s just rebranding the same basics or if it actually goes deeper.",

It's been the go-to solution for 30 years since in the early 90s we often didn't have any choices. But it's been 30 years - of watching these solutions fail **constantly**.Today the go-to solution should be data contracts & domain objects. Period: * Domain objects provide pre-joined sets of data - so that you don't have to guess what the rules are for joining the related data * Data contracts provide a mechanism for validating data - required columns, types, min/max values, min/max string lengths, null rules, regex formats, enumerated values, etc, etc.Schema evolution is just a dirty band-aid: it doesn't automatically adjust your business logic to address the column, or the changed type, or the changed format or values.",

SQLMesh seems to be a great solution to this, but it doesn't have the same market share as dbt. I tried to convince my tiny team to switch over to it and everyone was too scared. Since the company was actively trying to sell, moving such an important part of the infra to a new, more niche tool seemed unwise.If you could figure out a dbt plugin that manages state for you and can easily tell you missing batches, that'd be pretty cool.",

We are mostly not SAP specialists as data engineers, and it would be a much larger chore to have to remember and translate the acronyms every time I want to use a column in any layer.Now for the Polish to English translation - can you expect this codebase and data system will be maintained by Polish people forever?Cause if not, the same thing as for SAP applies.After all it would be far more overhead than for (I suppose) you - a Polish language specialist. If it's a core service of the state infrastructure, then it may fly to not translate.And from the other perspective - if this wasn't data, but software engineering - if you were integrating with a system that for some reason was written completely in Polish, would you also write yours in Polish to ease debugging? For me - in 99.99% of cases the answer is no. Any translation to Polish would be in the frontend in this case.",

So every round going to the Silver, we will perform those translations, same goes with testing and debugging.Speaking of the next layers, where data objects are prepared in more 'unified' way (say Invoice, Order, Customer..) 100% that's all in english onwards.Even on top of SAP tables on previous project - we just learned the tables, as it's so much easier without the extra renaming layer (and I am not a SAP person).Would this make sense?",

Yes it sounds silly to copy paste the same table three times without changing anything but at least you have a clear definition of where data enters the system and where to do the transformations if needed.",

        "body": "unfortunately I think with this level of complexity it comes down to you taking inventory and chipping away at a technical debt years in the making - maybe writing custom scripts to analyze these recursive chains of transforms and logic and at every turn try to scoop it out and decouple simple data movements (EL+T) from transformations that hopefully you can track/version control in one place or start biting off chunks into something managed (say dbt/sqlmesh + orchestrator and some custom python scripts with jdbc/odbc to monitor and analyze things that seem to overlap, data quality differences, etc.) if possible you need help facilitate the organization’s awareness of the variations in what’s deployed vs agreed upon understandings of business logic which leads you to the inescapable joy that is data governance. It’s always going to suck but the alternative is suckier. If you can get to a place where instead of having core logic and business rules/definitions scattered across different pieces of infrastructure in different forms to one where that is centralized (or more of it, start with the most critical data products/reports etc.), and some kind of business glossary/data catalog to capture understanding and drive consensus, you can generate the momentum to start shifting something that is very very deeply ingrained and much larger than likely yourself and team. At the very least some of these things will make it easier to maintain and stabilize the pieces you are able to wrangle and are responsible for even if the bigger effort takes more human power, resources, and/or political capital than you can drum up. Good luck and feel free to dm if you have questions/want to discuss further, in a similar boat myself",

My understanding is that the typical undergrad CS curriculum is not that in-depth relative to what you experience when you've worked in this field for a few years. Even if you majored in CS, you would've had to learn a lot of system design on your own through work experience. Recently, I did the AWS Solutions Architect Associate cert to build my knowledge in this area and I found that it helped to really understand the building blocks of cloud architecture and the purpose they each serve. The course I completed also covered a lot of common architectural patterns. I'm also interested to hear what other resources for system design folks here recommend.",

It’s far better if a consulting firm has clients spread across several business sectors. If you have your business spread roughly evenly across five sectors and there is a downturn in one, two or even three sectors, you could survive as a business. On the other hand, the federal government is frequently good for business.Honestly, the IRS cut 31 contracts with Booz Allen less than a week ago.

You don't want big batch processes to hit Cosmos directly as they can flood its request capacity and cause issues for other processes. The change feed+function+eventhub is very simple to set up as you're just copying data as-is, it is essentially the minimum amount of reads to get the data, and it spreads the reads evenly over the day. Using capture on the Event Hub means you don't need to worry about retention periods or having some parsing error on the document, you get a full binary copy of everything.edit: Also if you ever needed limited streaming options, you can have a second reader on the event hub that does stream processing, while still running the normal capture for batch processing.",

However, we do bring in parquet files that get generated from a stream which gets way more new columns. The way I currently handle that is I check schema and if a new column shows up I alert for it and ignore it in the process so it can at least continue and do the job as the new field is rarely needed immediately for reporting. I basically have to handle that in a very similar manner, I update records for the most recent set of files with the new column data that did not get put in with the run today or whenever the column first came up.",

I like MySQL for other reasons, but I can't think of any circumstance where it is better to leave off the aggregate function (this also goes for ANY_VALUE in Snowflake, ugh). Newer versions of MySQL warn you for doing this and maybe it's even a default error by now, if you don't set a legacy flag in SQL_MODE.What happens is that you get an arbitrary value from that column, instead of something deterministic (as defined by what aggregate function you choose). If I saw someone grouping without an aggregate function (or using the accursed ANY_VALUE), to me that would be a negative, suggesting lack of attention to detail, or not understanding how grouping works.",

The end goal is important. The first thing I would do is trash your lambda fetch. Even a hot-start lambda is going to be slower than a dedicated API layer running in something like ECS. Further, you need to refine your data layer to include a layer optimized for data fetches for your specific needs. Something that could be useful would be building an OLAP layer, with is (more or less) just a vectorized representation of your data for rapid dynamic aggregation. Something like the [elasticube](https://pypi.org/project/elasticube/) library. That might be too much for your specific needs, though, so wait until you add that.In summary:- Get rid of the Lambda fetch in favor of a dedicated API layer that automatically handles authentication- Evaluate your database for an analytical layer to support data fetches (add indexes, split into dim/fact, optimize tables/partitions for the most common queries)- Look into OLAP cubes for better performance if query lag time is still an issue",

Your overall critique is sound; from a type-theory standpoint, you should generally only use classes and inheritance when the child class really *is* a specific type of the parent class. And from a design standpoint, that usually means you have to be *real* sure of your problem domain (classes and inheritance get really sticky when you're prototyping; guess wrong, and you're now forever bending the class hierarchy to fit the problem). It's one of the reasons shapes are often used as an example, because nobody can argue a circle isn't a shape. but is a \"Customer\" a \"User?\" Well, it depends.",

It helps to know that.But: polymorphism -- methods of the same name doing different things based on context -- is a useful thing to understand.But: the more recent innovation of Interfaces is actually useful. It's not nearly as clunky as interitance, and certainly not as clunky as multiple inheritance. And it lets us do lots of useful things.

And if you're making, say, booking software for a veterinary office, you probably have no need to different `Animal` subclasses.The \"easy-to-understand\" examples lead people to think that OO programming is mainly about taxonomy - about building complex inheritance trees that model reality.

Then I got hired and went through an onboarding program at work, became a junior developer, then promoted to software developer, etc.Only in the last 1-2 years or so did I start coding with the assistance of AI. Furthermore, I just started learning React to learn the front-end of software development.AI tools like Copilot have dramatically increased my ability to learn AND to catch my own errors faster.Page not working? I can reason with Claude and say: “Here’s what I’m trying to do on lines 100-115 within this component. I’ve tried x, y, and z but it’s still not loading properly.”Then Claude will run its magic, offer me several solutions and most importantly explain *why* it gave those answers. Then the lightbulb goes off for me. It’s like having a teacher in my back pocket.I *could* spend 2 hours trying to solve a problem. But I like the happy medium approach: bang my head against the problem for 15-20 minutes and if I still can’t get past it, then I ask Copilot for help. It still gives me a chance to use my brain, yet I don’t spend all my time chasing down useless tutorials and outdated answers from 3 years ago.The key to learning with AI isn’t to just get the answer. It’s to understand *why* it’s giving you the answer in the first place. Then the next time you encounter the same problem you know what to do.

The real concern here is that one false fact easily yields more:https://i.imgur.com/ap5dQPt.pngUsing the non-working command as a base, *any* code it generates will not work. I didn't bother correcting it for a bit, eventually yielding this completely nonsensical, useless code:https://i.imgur.com/AR6BDBQ.pngOf course, this phantom `tee -` is just an example - what I'm pointing out here isn't about coding or Linux, but that LLMs not only can give false information, but use those to deduce further falsehoods. Left unchecked, such a process could yield a very large amount of information which seems perfectly reasonable, with justifications that seem to logically follow - but in fact it is all hallucinated.Finally, I chose this example here specifically because it was so simple. When asking more complex questions (involving multiple steps to solve a problem, accomplish a task, etc.), it becomes more likely that some link in the chain is faulty. Presented as an intact chain with each link solidly connected to the last, a weak link (if present) becomes harder to see.Now, as for how this relates to your post: for example,> Ever since I was a kid, I used to love the process of getting stuck, googling, watching half-relevant YouTube videos, reading forums, slowly piecing things together. That \"ohhh, wait, I get it now\" moment was addictive and felt \"earned\". There is still the potential for that \"aha\" moment when using LLMs - namely, when realising that your question is not being answered correctly, or that the reason nothing it suggests allows you to proceed past some point in a process you're stuck at is because the LLM itself is stuck, on some false assumption. The \"struggle\" is then to determine which assumption that is, explain why it is false, and from there proceed to your next question/step. In terms of your \"puzzle\" example, finding an error in the solution manual and proceeding to the (correct) solution by your own means.What you desire: \"feeling proud of understanding something because I worked for it\" hasn't gone away - but the path towards fulfilling that desire may be different.> This is probably what people felt when the computer or the internet was invented as well, eh?Indeed there are many things that those technologies now do for us that before we had to do ourselves. But they also bring new things that we were not able to do before. Focusing your attention and energy on the latter over the former when possible, to maintain a positive attitude and avoid stagnating. For example: \"I cannot sit with difficulty anymore\" - you can and will, because there will always be difficulty. New tools can only change how and where it is found, not eliminate it entirely.",

You will first need to obtain a solid Java foundation before even attempting Algorithms. Both CS50 and CS50p are roughly at the same level of courses - both are *introductory* courses. They are *parallel*, not *sequential* - it's either - or, not both.Last, *Fullstack Open* is a *web dev* course that will only help you if you want to venture into web dev, and if you go that road, basically everything before is the wrong direction. There, [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) or [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org) would be the appropriate starter points.Nand2Tetris is a fantastic foundation course that *can* help you get a deeper understanding, but mainly will help if you want to go into *embedded* development (think SoC - System on a Chip or IoT - Internet of Things).",

Its all practise, practise, and more practise. And once you have this mentality well written inside your head, that is when you can start watching some tutorials again on some libraries or concepts that you can apply to your job or projects.

HTML and CSS are fine starts, but the real value comes from learning how systems work end to end. How data moves, how logic is structured, how things break.If I were starting over at 16, I would focus less on chasing whatever YouTube says is hot and more on fundamentals that stack over time. Basic programming concepts, one backend language you stick with, and learning how to build small but complete projects. Even boring ones. Automation is real, but it only makes sense once you understand the underlying process you are automating.What I would avoid is the pressure to monetize too early. Skills compound quietly. If you can build things that work and explain how they work, remote options tend to show up later than you expect. Keep going. You are already ahead by asking these questions now.",

For instance, to understand how gates can make flip flops that can be used in shift registers, you really need to understand why \"shift registers\" are an important concept in binary mathematics, and to understand how a compiler converts high level language to assembly, you really need to understand both assembly AND abstract grammar and syntax - in other words, you need to understand both abstractions above and below the current thing you are trying to learn, as well as the abstract idea of the thing itself, all three of which requires knowledge of something else on all three levels!!Don't let that discourage you though - you should still be allowed to learn everything, but just don't fool yourself into thinking that there is a \"perfect\" order to learn them in, like go from the silicon to the CPU to machine code to assembly to compilers to higher level languages to abstract concepts - or indeed the other way around. Best suggestion is to start where you are, e.g. learn some Python, and work your way down, look at some assembly, then work your way up, towards more abstract programming concepts, data structures and whatnot, then back down again to another language, maybe C, and understand memory management, up again to understand garbage collecting and compilers, down again to understand addressing and registers in the CPU, and so on and on - not necessarily in this particular order, that was just a random example I made up on the spot.But take a look at \"**Code**\", and try to write programs in your chosen higher level language that handles binary conversion, and select topics based on your current interest.Also, if you are interested in the human history behind the computer, check out \"**The Innovators**: H*ow a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution*\" by Walter Isaacson.",

        "body": "First, domain names are like file paths, just backwards. Instead of /foo/bar/baz/folder/myfile, you have myrecord.domain.baz.bar.foo. The domain name 9gag.com is registered as living on a set of nameservers that the folks at 9gag control, and they can put as many records there with as many levels of dots as they like (up to the limits of the system, which maxes out at 255 characters for a full domain and at most 63 characters between dots).Second, the Internet predates the Web. There used to be many different services that a site might want to offer besides HTTP. Like an FTP server with files at ftp.whatever.com, a gopher server at gopher.whatever.com, a mail server at mail.whatever.com, a USENET server at news.whatever.com or nntp.whatever.com. If you were coming from inside whatever.com's network you might hit smtp.whatever.com to send mail and imap.whatever.com to retrieve yours. Back in the day these would likely have actually been different physical computers. And in that world, www.whatever.com was just another service - \"www\" for \"World-Wide Web\".But it did not take long for the Web to take over the Internet, after which pretty much everything else took a back seat to it. The web was everyone's \"front door\", so they wanted to make it as easy as possible to get to. For that reason, most companies arranged for their top-level domain (\"TLD\"), when looked up all by itself, to point to their web server's IP address. That way you could just type `whatever.com` into your browser to get there. (Later browsers would add this as a fallback behavior; if you enter 'whatever.com' and it can't find an IP address for that, it will give 'www.whatever.com' a try. But originally it was up to the site owners to make that work.)Rather than just duplicating the web server's IP address record, which could lead to forgetting to change both in the future, the equivalence is usually accomplished by making the \"www\" subdomain an _alias_ for the TLD. (Not the other way around, because the root of a domain can't be an alias for technical reasons.) In the DNS database, the value associated with an alias record is the \"canonical name\" that it is an alias _for_, called a CNAME for short; for that reason, they're also called CNAME records, and sometimes aliases are called CNAMEs, even though that's sort of the opposite of what it means. Anyway, your example is one of those: $ dig +noall +answer www.9gag.com a www.9gag.com. 300 IN CNAME 9gag.com.What that means is that when a computer goes to look up the IP address of \"www.9gag.com\", it gets an answer back saying \"use the address of 9gag.com\". So it has to turn around and look up \"9gag.com\" to get the actual IP address. (Fortunately for the sake of net traffic reduction, when your computer looks it up, your ISP's nameserver has likely already done that for you and just returns both the CNAME and the IP addresses - A records for IPv4, AAAA records for IPv6 - in response to the original query.)",

Still, you should follow the advice of your instructor and get practice using them. It's a tool you will need once your programs get larger and having already practiced using them will make those assignments much easier for you.",

        "body": "The reason classes don't click for a lot of people is that they get taught as a way to \"organize code.\" Which is true but it's also the least interesting reason they exist.Think of it like this. Right now with functions, you're passing data around like handing a folder to different people in an office. \"Here, calculate this.\" \"Here, validate that.\" Works fine. But the folder doesn't know anything about itself. If you change what's in the folder, every function that touches it might break and you won't know until it does.A class is giving the folder a brain. It knows what's inside it, knows what you're allowed to do with it, and can refuse things that don't make sense.Now that's great and all but let's think about this from a real world problem... say you have three types of reports. With just functions you end up writing process_sales_report(), process_inventory_report(), process_hr_report(), duplicating logic every time. With a class you define what a Report is once (it has data, it can be processed, it can be exported) and each type just fills in its own specifics. You swap behavior without rewriting structure.The honest answer to \"when do I actually need them\" is probably not for small scripts. But the moment you have two things that are similar but not identical and you're copying functions and changing variable names, that's the signal. You're doing manually what a class would do for you.I almost use classes religiously with the pydantic library when I'm building large machine learning or agentic systems, makes life ten times easier. This video isn't exactly on your question but I think my frame your understanding of the industry a bit better.https://youtu.be/S3fXSc5z2n4?si=90-0Hz9Pa_xOTp99",

It made sense to have a class for reading the entire file, and another class for reading a single line - of course nowadays you could just read the entire file into an array of strings, and then have a single function to split each string, but back then it made sense to me :)But again, classes are just a way of structuring your code differently - the \"problem\" it solves is in how programmers organize code, not in anything the code does.",

You will understand better once you have spent a year re-writing, re-writing and re-writing either your or someone else's code.ANOTHER VIEWLets say you wrote something to track prices on Amazon. There is a lot of setup, saving of files, formatting a report/GUI & overhead to a script that does this.You get it working and it's great.Then - someone says \"Make it work against Timu\" or eBay or some other shopping site.If you wrote linear functions - all the special code that deals with how Amazon displays & stores things is all throughout the code. It takes days or weeks to find all the spots in the code to convert to Timu.But if you had used a class to deal with Amazon - all the logic to deal with the Amazon web site is in a single class. It probably has 7-20 methods. You now have 2 choices:* Copy the Amazon class to create a Timu class and start changing things.* Get fancy and create a base 'website' class. Get the Amazon version working then get the Timu/Ebay version working.Either approach will let you modify your code to do something new a lot faster than if you wrote the original with nested functions.IMPORTANT: This higher-level design of your scripts comes from experience. You can totally use AI to help - but a human must look at the problem and decide how to structure the system. This is the difference between \"Design\" vs \"Implementation\". Let a human come up with the design, then let AI help with the implementation.",

Functions call other functions, and the project works fine.Great that is exactly how any program work. There is no other way actually. The difference is how you look at functions together with data. You may actually code in an OOP style without ceating any classes at all. It all depends on what functions use what data. If you pack a set of functions together with a set of data and limit other functions from this data then you're basically coding in an OOP style.> If functions get the job done, what problem are classes really solving?Classes are useful because they tie data and code together in a very visible and safe way. With a class you can create a group of data and functions that work together and you can protect the data from changes from other functions outside of the class. You can also make the data work as one unit or object and tie operators to the object making it easier to use. This may seem trivial in a small program but in a large program with hundreds of files you can isolate the use of data and you don't need to check all files for usage.> This has become a big hurdle for me because almost every take home assessment or practice project I see either requires or strongly expects the use of classes, and I just can’t seem to wrap my head around how or where they fit.This is not difficult. Just look at the problem from a data point of view. What information is needed and belongs together. This pack of data is a class. What relations does the data have with other data. How many of each are there. What changes to the data is needed, these are the functions, or methods in OOP, that take the data as one parameter.Hope this helps you on the way.",

        "body": "That's not bad practice, it's a common and useful pattern.When people say functions are \"first-class objects\" in Python, it just means you can treat functions like any other value. You can assign them to variables, pass them to other functions, or store them in data structures like lists and dictionaries. Not all languages allow this.one clarification is that you're not actually storing the function itself in the dictionary. you're storing a *reference* to it (called a pointer). The function exists once in memory, and the dictionary just holds a way to find it. That's why you write `\"start\": start_game` without parentheses, with parentheses you'd be *calling* the function and storing its return value instead.Typical use cases:```python# Command dispatchcommands = { \"start\": start_game, \"quit\": quit_game, \"help\": show_help,}action = commands.get(user_input)if action: action() # Now we call it``````python# Replacing long if/elif chainsdef handle_event(event_type, data): handlers = { \"click\": handle_click, \"submit\": handle_submit, \"load\": handle_load, } handler = handlers.get(event_type, handle_unknown) return handler(data)```This is cleaner than a sprawling if/elif block, easier to extend, and the mapping is explicit. You'll see this pattern in CLI tools, event systems, parsers, and state machines.The only things to watch for is to make sure the functions have compatible signatures if you're calling them uniformly, and don't over-complicate simple cases where a basic `if` would be fine",

It’s often just a vector implementation rather than a hash table, but there’s no reason it couldn’t be one. Like, in win32 programming a form button or other event source will have a vector of function pointers (void*) and will loop over them and call the functions when the button is clicked. Very normal.I will say that in a wholly owned system, you won’t normally use this pattern because you know the function caller and function to be called and don’t need an extensible pattern of hooks for third party consumers. You’ll just call the functions or call abstract or interface functions implemented by a known set of child classes. At most you’ll use an IOC container to control which implementation is used through configuration. Keep your system simple unless you really are building a platform.",

        "body": "Tutorials work up to a certain degree.Once people have learnt the fundamentals, people should simply stop using tutorials and start building. Yet, that is the tricky and difficult part. Since in current times, people are hand-held all their lives they don't want to give up being hand-held and spoon-fed. They don't dare to let go and less know how to stand on their own feet.This was very different in the old days when there were no tutorials. You learnt by experimenting, by trying, by failing. But there also was more time and less competition.Now, fast is key. Which is completely wrong. Speedrunning learning leads to nothing.Well back to the original topic:There are good, mediocre, and outright rubbish tutorials and there are *courses* - this is an important distinction.Proper *courses* are e.g. the CS50 series from Harvard, the MOOCs from the University of Helsinki, Algorithms from Princeton, and countless others. Common to all of them is that they have a proper, educational curriculum, are approved and battle tested, and never pre-chew and spoon feed solutions - they all make the *learner* do the work.Now *tutorials* on the other hand, generally pre-chew and spoon feed. They *give* the code and only expect the learner to type it in - which is the totally wrong approach to learning. This is not learning.Worst tutorials are *\"How to build X in language Y\"* tutorials. They are plain useless. You, as the learner will not learn anything from them, not even the skill to build X in language Y on your own. All you will learn is to copy the code.About *proper usage* of tutorials: if you really go through a tutorial (not as a complete and utter beginner - as such, you should take a *course*), try to predict the code. Once the task following is explained, stop the tutorial and try to write the code on your own. Try a good amount of time and make different attempts if your first fails. Then, once you have a solution, or can't think of any other way, continue with the tutorial and compare - this way you train *your thinking* (which is far more important than your *coding*) and the coding plus, you get the final code to maybe learn the one or other thing from.I still think that the best approach to learning is first a solid *course* and then (and along with the course) program, program, program, program. Experiment, try things, break them, fix them, play around with the code. The more you struggle, fail, and play around, the more you learn.",

They should be identifying a field and learn the languages and tools used in that field.If you just learn a random language, you could be stuck in tutorial hell because once you are done learning that random language you may well find that nobody actually uses that language in the field you are interested in.e.g. you are advised to learn Pascal in response to the incorrect question because of its clarity and simplicity. Then you want to work in robotics. Sorry, go back and learn C/C++.## watching/reading but not doingA common problem I see is people complaining that they slogged through the entire series, but then can't do anything.That is because they slogged through the series and everything that went in one ear, got pushed right out the other side.People need to regularly press pause on the tutorial (or bookmark the book) and try out what they have seen. Experiment with it. Try to get it to do something else. For example, if taught how to create a loop that counts from 1 to 10, try to make it so that it goes from 10 to 1.## AIThis will be triggering for some - especially the AI propaganda bots. But AI is a double edged sword.If used correctly, to search, consolidate or explain it can be a useful tool.But if it is used to generate code - especially on anything more than an occasional basis then the risk is the same as my previous \"... not doing\" point. But it is more insidious. IMHO.In another sub that I moderate, we get a lot of posts along the lines of \"I used AI to write the code for the lessons and some basic things, but now I'm trying to do my own unique thing. It doesn't work and I don't know how to fix it.\". Even worse, because they have been copying and pasting the AI gibberish, they often don't have the vocabulary to clearly explain what is going on nor understand the changes proposed (unless someone rewrites it for them).The solution? Go back to the basics, ditch the AI and actually try doing stuff yourself.---These are just 3 common and hopefully easy to understand examples that I have observed over and over. In my career I've seen plenty of other types of mistakes but these are a bit more subtle and complicated to explain.---You also asked about:> ... and still can’t build anything without hand-holding (after doing the tutorials)This one is a bit harder and probably is an it depends scenario. Again from my experience, I've seen the following:* The person is perfectly capable to do it, but lacks personal self confidence.* The person is new to a project and needs help becoming assimilated with the organisation of the code and the standards used in the project.* Some people have learned the technology by rote without understanding how it works \"under the covers\". Example, they know that they can use a `long` or regular `int` and can't understand why sometimes both work and sometimes one might get weird negative values unexpectedly (and I'm thinking C here, but also some other languages).* When joining a new project, people are often on probation and part of the probation involves mentoring.There are other possible reasons including \"they didn't do the tutorials correctly\".",

For example my last project was a fullstack CRUD app in the PERN stack with user authentication and server side sessions. Great stuff. Now im busy building a webscraper in python with a PostgreSQL db and i will add a python frontend using flask. This ETL pipeline project will help me when i start delving into automation and data analytics afterwhich that will help when i get into ML.Im just trying to eat an elephant bite by bite ahile stacking things ontop of each other to gain knowledge and experience. But if i build all the stuff i want at the same time then everything is going to be hald arsed. Rather do something proper and complete before moving on.

Build a small game engine; implement an ECS system, a basic rendering graph, physics, simulations, etc. Share it with others and let them use it; that’s how you learn what *production-ready* really means.

It's hard, we do it anyway. An old-school method that I stand by for learning is working without copy & paste: typing things out is good for developing a syntax instinct.I think there's two big categories of gaps to distinguish though: algorithmic gaps and library gaps.Algorithmic gaps are gaps you have conceptually: Can you even break the problem into steps that are easier to code? This is very important to develop independently, breaking down complex problems into steps computers understand is arguably what programming *is*.Library gaps refer to not knowing specific tools that your language or libraries provide you. You mostly pick these up over time and it's not a big deal to look them up.For example, if you want to convert a string to lowercase, algorithmic thinking tells you that you can iterate through the string, convert each letter (with e.g. ascii code math), and build a new string. You should conceptually be able to write that code in your head in your preferred language, even if you don't type it out. Library knowledge tells you \"in python, you can do string.lower().\"Stackoverflow (and docs) is good for learning library knowledge. As you build more library knowledge in a language, it translates to having an easier time thinking algorithmically in that language.",

This will build familiarity, but won't build problem solving skills.Once you have the gist of how and why some functions work, start learning the terminology. This is arguably one of the stronger skills you will need in the age of AI. Knowing exactly what to look for or how to phrase the parts you are stuck on will help immensely.Problem solving skills are the top priority skills for all programmers. The ONLY way to build this is with practice. Projects are great ways to practice breaking down big problems into tiny problems. If you need to practice tiny problems, chug away at LeetCode, HackerRank, or other platforms that can present a problem to you and give you instant feedback on if your solution is acceptable.All projects/apps/features boild down to this line of thinking: \"how do I break this problem down into chunks that I can work with?\"I generally have a rough idea of what the end-project looks like, then I split that project into milestones, then I keep splitting each milestone into smaller parts until I find a place to start building out everything within the milestone. If your milestones are independent of one another, you can rotate which parts of the project to do if you get stuck and don't want to burn out. If one milestone depends on another, you gotta finish all of the first one before you can work on the second one.All project structures will be different. There are countless ways to solve most problems once they are larger. Usually the \"right\" way to solve something either won't exist or won't be evident until after you have tried a bunch of different things. The goal is to get your project to a working point, and to keep tabs of any new skills learned along the way.Edit to add: you will always be looking stuff up. There is far too much technical documentation for anyone to fully memorize. If you need something done quick, look for shortcuts or similar completed projects. If you have time to learn, deliberately practice your problem solving when you get stuck instead of looking up an answer right away. Try to default to documentation pages before hopping to stack overflow or AI for an answer. Feel free to search error codes if the traceback is too complicated to parse yourself, but don't get into the habit of offloading your learning to other people or AI when you first start out",

Programming language doesn't matter.It is more problem solving than actually writing code. My first professional programming job was in 1983. Today after I figure how or what the structure of the program should be, I sit down and just type. Most times I don't think about the code and somehow like magic, my fingers just type away. But I will tell you this, I learned typing in high school in 1978, not because I knew I was going to use it one day, but because I was 1 guy in a classroom with 29 other girls for an hour every day. It somehow just worked out that I was going to need it and can now type words out as fast as someone can talk. Learning computer language after computer language can also be really difficult. But what amazed me is the structured process of learning another spoken language. Classes always start with \"Who, What, When, Where, Why and How\". With those 6 spoken words, learning those 6 words in another spoken language and building on those, makes learning another spoken language so much easier.I'm fluent in Spanish, and Portuguese as Portuguese is basically Spanish with some French mixed in. I can survive speaking German on the basic level and I know enough Mandarin to order in a restaurant. All computer languages have the same basics as spoken languages. If, do, while, loop, for, next, with a majority of languages also having a switch statement or something similar. If you can get those procedures down, learning another computer language becomes so much more easier. It also makes fitting a square plug in a round hole so much more easier in a different computer language you may not be familiar with.So, don't spend that much time concentrating on the actual computer language and concentrate on problem solving to use the language you are currently working with.And if anyone really wants to know, when I sleep at night I dream in C#.",

What you seem to be describing is a process where you have a problem, and you arrive at a solution by searching for code written by others and copying that.You should be able to do simple things without doing that. For example, can you write a loop in your language that prints every item in an array? (Without looking for help, that is). In general you should be able to go from a detailed text description of an algorithm to the code without using stackoverflow. Pros use SO and AI, but we don't use that code verbatim without fully understanding how the code works. And if we understand the algorithm, coding it in the language of choice should be straightforward.My suggestion is to look for help in a language substantially different from the one you work in. Need a hint on how to do a binary search in Java? Look for Python code to do it instead, and YOU do the translation to Java. That will force you to know Java.",

You don't have to watch all 8 hours, you just go to the middle. If the bike's still there, you can throw out te first 4 hours. So you jump to 3/4 and do the same thing. Every step you cut the possibilities in half, so you find the right point in time in a few minutes rather than having to watch all 8 hours of video. That's a binary search. An index is just a sorted copy, which lets you do a binary search. Without it, the security tape has been cut up and rearranged randomly, so you just have to watch from the beginning and spend 4 hours (on average) to find the thief. That's like doing a table scan, which is what happens if you look up a column without it.",

The best programmers are those that can read documentation, extract the information required to do the job, and implement.I've been on projects where I've seen large 300 page documents full of requirements written in English language transcribed 100% into functional working code.This is what it means to be a programmer: to be able to transcribe the documentation into written code and be able to maintain it.At the end of the day, you're going to have to stop running away from reading. People who just get the dopamine boost of just \"getting it to work\" are going to run into a massive problem once they get into a situation that requires serious thinking about how to implement what was written down.We don't program based on something that someone \"spoke\" about one time. What they spoke about will likely be written down so everyone remembers it, and we implement it based on what was written.I appreciate this gamesmanship approach to learning how to code, but this is only 20% of the answer. The other 80% is reading, and learning how to read documentation. On that note, maybe there's some sort of mechanism to make a game out of reading documentation... maybe that's the actual goalpost.

I definitely failed at learning to code when I was 11 because the resding materials were so dense back then. Also, theres a school of people early on in your programming journey who will tell you to always learn by doing, which you can take a little bit too seriously and think it means that you should just make spaghetti code rather than read docs. Over time I've realised those people are wrong, and the thing holding me back is my patience to read.Honestly I find when you read docs and books programming becomes way more fun. Once you get yourself focused on the reading, you start to find it more interesting because you're engaging so actively with the knowledge. You learnt the whole concept and really appreciate the design of libaries and admire them. Once youve read it, you gain so much understanding it leads to the feeling of being close to mastery which fuels flow state.

If you’re unable to get an apprenticeship, get a part time job that gives you enough money to do what you need, buy some Udemy courses (they’re dirt cheap), watch YouTube tutorials, use AI to help demistify any concepts you’re unsure of, build applications, get on LinkedIn, build a network, attend meet-ups and then start applying…. Don’t even wait till summer to start doing this, do it now.By the time your peers will have finished Uni, you could already be working as a junior dev, with 6 months to a year of experience under your belt and £0 student debt, which means more money in your pocket….

Once you have that, you literally just add a cache (memoization) and you've got a top-down DP solution. The jump from recursion to memoization is way smaller than trying to build a bottom-up table from scratch. Also, focus on the classic patterns first: fibonacci-style, 0/1 knapsack, longest common subsequence. Most DP problems on leetcode are just variations of like 5-6 core patterns.

On one of their courses it just says> To welcome you to Codefinity, we're offering up to 64% off on our courses. Plus, we have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try us out risk-free.We truly look forward to welcoming you to our platform and are committed to making your learning experience easy, interactive, and fun.Only links I found on that link to formal policy link to terms that say all sales are final within the bounds of law. If you go to the footer and click support/help center, then click subscription faq, the bottom faq is a link to a support post about the money back policy. It reads:> Our goal is to help you achieve meaningful results in your learning journey, and if you are not satisfied with the results you’re getting within the first 31 days of the initial purchase, we offer a Money-Back Guarantee. You can learn more about the policy and check the eligibility criteria here.If the conditions are met, you may request a refund by sending an email to info@codefinity.com or submitting a request. Please note that the Money-Back Guarantee is only valid if all criteria are satisfied. If you click the word “here” it takes you to a policy that says: > We are convinced that our product (hereinafter referred to as the “plan” and/or “program”) will bring the user meaningful results within a chosen Subscription period. If no results will be reached by the user, he/she is eligible to receive a full refund, if all the following criteria are met: 1) the user contacts us within 31 days after the initial purchase, 2) the user has followed the recommendations from the provided personalized plan at least during 28 consecutive days within the first 31 days after the purchase, and 3) the user can demonstrate that he/she conscientiously has followed the plan (ex.: provide photos and/or video of completion of recommendations, tasks, etc.).So their money back guarantee requires you use the platform for 28-consecutive days, following their recommendations, and document that you did what they recommended after that on day 28 (after doing what they tell you to), 29, 30, or 31 you have to email them and provide your proof of following their guidance to get a refund. If you get sick, your kid has a soccer game, life happens any time during the 28 consecutive days and you miss a day? Your SoL. If your documentation doesn’t pass there test? Well you’re not getting a refund. Absolutely horrible policy from a company I will never do business with.",

And it doesn't guarantee anything either. Your beefy server could still be insufficientThat's where cloud providers come in.

There's always new problems and challenges to be faced and new things to learn that you haven't quite faced before, every time you think, jeez that was tough, I might just be a programmer now, there's always a new mountain to climb which would make you feel like you're starting all over again.I think it's just important to stay humble and realise that it's not really about reaching a destination where things click and you're now finally a programmer with nothing more to learn, there's always another lesson to be learned, things you can do better, and don't get into the mindset that you're now done learning, because you've learned xyz will make you believe you're more capable than you actually are, I remember reaching many important milestones, thinking I was now great, only to realise there was still things I was struggling at and creating real projects was showing me that. What feels really satisfying is achieving deep knowledge in one specific area, where you feel like, almost no matter what challenge or assignment were shot at you, you'd be comfortable you could solve it in a reasonable timeframe, without having to learn more frameworks or new concepts or doing tons of research and exercises. Realistically you're only going to reach this at maybe one or two niches, and that's extremely satisfying, but I guess my point here is that, stop trying to aim for some 'now it clicks', because it won't, there's always new things to learn.",

The one recommendation I would make is to buy yourself an account on Claude, the Anthopic AI engine, download the Anthopic Visual Basic Plugin and use it and the Web interface to make sure you really understand things inside out. Try to write a tutorial to explain a coding conundrum you have learnt to others; doing that will help you appreciate if you understand it or not.",

Review solutions and see what you missed and grow from it. Your goal shouldn't be \"I need to master React/HTML/JavaScript etc..\" It needs to be \"do I know how to learn to do X\". I would be reviewing jobs that you're interested in (junior front end developer for example) and see what it wants from you and start becoming familiar with those technologies.

The BEST we can do is SOMETIMES detect SOME cases of UB and emit a warning.There's an insidious nature to UB - no one can define it. Signed integer overflow is often well defined on hardware, that doesn't mean the C++ spec or the compiler gets to defer to the hardware. It's still undefined behavior. In fact, UB allows a compiler to optimize very aggressively. If, for example, you overflowed, you cannot reliably detect you've overflowed. You might think hey - just see if an increment of a positive results in a negative. But the compiler KNOWS overflow \"cannot\" happen, so it can correctly optimize the \"obviously\" impossible check out, and code paths that presume overflow didn't happen get a negative value anyway.Thus is the nature of UB. You're not going to win against the compiler's CORRECT assumptions that you're NOT going to fuck around with UB. And you don't know how the compiler is going to act upon those assumptions at any given time. Believe it or not, compilation itself is not inherently deterministic.Further, you may not even get consistent behaviors between program runs, or even while the program is running. And once UB has been evaluated at runtime, you cannot rely on what the program is going to do afterward.UB is to be respected. Your x64 or Apple M may be robust, but UB is what bricks a Nintendo DS, most famously when glitch hacking Pokemon or Zelda; you end up accessing an invalid bit pattern that fries some circuits in the ARM5 core.A lot of engineers are incorrectly dismissive of UB. These engineers would NEVER get a job working on critical systems, where that attitude is going to get a people killed, cause billions in damages, or cause unrecoverable losses.I hear the attitude - \"We're not saving lives, here...\" Yeah? You wanna diminish your company and it's product more? Do that in front of the CEO. You might not be saving lives with every product, but to be dismissive is also putting the revenue streams and the reputation of the company at risk. No one wants to hear it. It's as serious as it can be everywhere you go - and anyone who isn't serious about it is a toxic person you shouldn't be working with.",

However, dereferencing such returned pointer immediately triggers undefined behavior (UB). You can't expect anything specific from undefined behavior.Most modern compilers will detect such an obvious attempt to return a pointer to a local object and *deliberately* punish you for this, i.e. they will make deliberate attempts to force your program to crash in case you attempt to dereference the pointer later. GCC, for one example, will ignore the `&x` in the return statement and explicitly return null pointer instead. This is what your function translates to on x86: getNumber(): xor eax, eax retI.e. it becomes plain and explicit `return nullptr;`.In addition to that, for such an obvious example as yours (i.e. a single translation unit, the function definition is visible at the call site), GCC will refuse to call the function entirely and instead generate a \"crash now\" instruction in the code of `main` (e.g. `ud2` instruction for x86 platform or something similar for other platforms).This is what your `main` function translates to on x86: main: mov eax, DWORD PTR ds:0 ud2Of course, the outcome can easily depend on the specific compiler, its version, is configuration and weather on Mars.

I guess there is a good chance that the pointer still shows to some data where \"10\" is stored. But that is not necessarily so. It's probably also allowed that removed stack frames get zeroed to prevent the data being readable. You could put it on the heap. Something like `malloc(sizeof(int))`. But where would you free it?

Emphasis on \"balance\" because overdoing it makes it harder to read.As for testability, I look for functionality that would be suitable to unit test separately. Functions with side-effects like writing to a database or calling an API are good candidates. It's easier to test when there is a clear boundary between the implementation details of side-effecting classes and business logic. It can also be a good idea to limit leakage of implementation details such models (errors, responses etc) of your internal dependencies.On a final note, when planning and writing code it's good to think about future extensions of that code. Writing complicated abstractions to support future possible functionality is usually a bad idea, but just thinking about how a current solution would hold up in the future can be helpful. Sometimes it can help you design a simple solution that is also future proof, and other times it just gives you a better understanding of what extensions are easy or difficult to make (would you want them).",

It will get you more benefit, both in terms of knowing your work is correct, and, later, being able to hand management a win.OOP is great in the right contexts, but here's the secret. OOP isn't for the computer, it's for the programmers. It's a different way to think about the code, and when you're in an environment where your software has hundreds of thousands of lines of code to maintain, thinking about it in terms of entities instead of functions and whatnot is helpful. You're not in that situation; defining all your objects would be a bunch of overhead with little gain.But correctness is important especially in a database context.",

Maybe it uses the same 5 functions which operate on a bunch of variables. Those can go into a class and you can refactor them by extracting the same variables from them into class attributes. Then you can use that as a black box. Drop in some variables, call a method, and it spits out the report. Collect these generalized building blocks into a library, but there is a catch. If you generalize them too much to fit all use cases they become these very hard to use super configurable objects. Lets say if a class needs more than 5 constructor parameter that should start to get suspicious. To know where is the line, that takes experience :)",

        "body": "In situations like yours, I think paradigms like functional programming are a better fit then OOP.You don't need to lean 100% into the functional paradigm, but I think the core ideas of:1. Having the bulk of your functions be side-effect free2. Using immutable data structures (e.g. don't modify your dicts/lists/dataclasses after they're created)...would be a good fit for the more pipeline-oriented nature of your task. You have data you're slicing and dicing, and want some reasonable assurances that each 'transform' or 'analysis' function you have in your script is self-contained and bug-free. Having a clean divide between IO code vs business logic and keeping mutation to a minimum are two good ways of helping you do this.The OOP paradigm is usually more useful when it's important you maintain certain 'invariants' around data: things like 'my data structure must always respect this property, no matter how it's modified' or 'all interactions with this particular 3rd party API must include these magic headers'. If you have a lot of these fiddly rules to manage, it can often be convenient to create a class that wraps around your data and presents a cleaner interface to the outside world.But I think this sort of need is rare in data-slicing or 'pipeline' style programs.Note that this sort of decision-making has nothing to do if you're writing a script or not. I've written short 100-line scripts that ended up making heavy use of OOP, and longer 5k-10k LOC production-ready services that used it very sparingly. My ultimate goal is to make the code as obviously correct as possible (which in turn makes it both easy to understand and modify). Sometimes objects can help with this, other times they won't.That is, OOP is not the same thing as 'clean code'. OOP is a _technique_ that can _help_ you write clean code -- but (a) it's not the only technique for doing so and (b) it's not a technique that'll be applicable 100% of the time.w.r.t. SWE best practices, I would look into:1. Writing tests and perhaps even a CI/CD pipeline for your scripts, starting with the more business critical / frequently run and modified ones. If people are actively making business decisions based on some of your analysis, you'd want reasonable confidence it indeeds behaves as expected. 2. Creating and popularizing a helper library that streamlines common operations. The goal here is to speed up the time it takes to author a new pipeline.I don't know anything about your company, but I'd imagine both correctness and speed-of-delivery are two factors that matter most to your team and your bosses. So, I'd prioritize applying practices that directly help with both.",

You will probably get more targeted answers in data engineering or data science subreddits.For starters, I would try using something that can translate between notebooks and .py files like jupytext. Would make source control and other checks a lot easier.Based on what you have said, traditional unit tests are often difficult to apply here and tend to provide less value in data workflows than people expect. I would focus more on testing the output instead. Things like row counts, nulls, ranges, schema changes, distribution shifts, and data freshness usually catch issues much earlier.A lot of the unit test advice you are getting is common in app and web development, where the failure modes are different. In data, things usually break because the shape or semantics of the data change, not because someone touched the code.As far as OOP is concerned, you are less likely to run into it in many data jobs. It becomes important when dealing with graphs or hierarchies. Otherwise it is mostly useful for providing structure.Generally, anywhere you are passing a lot of variables to a function or manipulating large dicts, you will probably want to turn those into a dataclass. For external boundaries like configs, inputs, or outputs, use pydantic. Use type hints everywhere, and use a linter and code formatter as well. I'd recommend ruff as a sufficient linter and formatter.I would also recommend arjancodes on YouTube. He has a lot of good content on Python design.",

I’ve done a lot better focusing on procedural, data driven, or functional programming designs. That isn’t to say that OOP doesn’t have its place. But lately I’ve had a lot more success waiting until the last possible moment to start using it. Like when my program is basically working, but I’m getting tired of passing around long lists of parameters, or a function seems to be tightly coupled to particular set of data. Only then will I introduce objects, and if my code suddenly feels cleaner and easier, then I know it is helping and not hurting my codebase. And usually I only end up needing a few objects here and there. Anyway, I think it’s still worth practicing OOP, but don’t feel obligated to use it everywhere. There are lots of other ways to organize your code. It is good to experiment and get familiar with as many as you can, to learn when one approach is better than another.",

Oop just means to group together data as objects with functions for those objects (originally without state, but today state is the center of oop -> state is probably the biggest cause of bugs, given that you test your code)Declarative programming is functional programming, reactive programming or logic programming. All similar, but for fp: you describe a function with other functions, to do that, you write functions that create functions and take functions as parameters, there is no state and a function only does one thing with one parameter… for example in procedural programming adding 2 numbers is done with a function like this: add = (a,b) => a+b Functional programming is a bit different, you have a function returning a function: add = a => b => a+b So, looks a bit unnecessary at first, but you can use functions to build functions… you can do: inc = add (1), while procedural would need a inc (a) => a+1. Increasing the items in a list is also easy: newList = oldList.map(add(1)), in procedural, you would loop over the list, getting every item, adding 1 and then pushing it in a new list. And oop would have a class inheriting from list, then have some build method that then changes the internal state to transform itself. (Yeah, there is a reason people mix paradigms)There are also other paradigms, like concurrent programming (lots of data and shared resources), constraint programming, dataflow programming (aka forced recalculation hell), metaprogramming (manipulating code, instead of data… extremely powerful, easy to fuck up, hell to debug and only really useful, if you know exactly what you are doing) and there is also pipeline programming -> build pipelines…And a few others… but yeah, can recommend functional programming within oop, so constants instead of state and single param functions, as well as higher order functions",

Self-teaching + building a mental model _does_ indeed require non-trivial mental effort.One tip: When I need to read through particularly gnarly code, I like to keep notes in a separate text file or doc.I typically structure this in a 'question -> answer' kind of way, where I create a separate section for each open question or \"line of investigation\" I have. Maybe I'll also create a separate section for quick links, TODOs, snippets of cli commands to run, etc.I find having this sort of structure makes it much easier for me to stay focused, especially in cases where I feel too overwhelmed trying to mentally remember and keep track of everything.> I wonder if that is something that gets better after some time.It will -- as you get more familiar with the code, you'll have to spend less and less time digging, simply by virtue of you already being familiar with more aspects of the codebase.Even longer term, it'll get easier once you've worked on enough systems to start seeing similarities and echos. For example, if you've spend a fair amount of time working with backend and cloud infra, new codebases in the same domain will start feeling vaguely similar. There are only so many ways of reasonably structuring code after all.I'll take time for both types of familiarity/experience to grow though: it's totally expected/normal to feel a bit lost as an intern or new hire.> This is my first in person internship, so I don't know if it is normal to just stand up and walk for 5 minutes. That is what I used to do in remote internships.This is also normal. I've been programming professionally nearly a decade or so, and I also take short breaks once every hour or two. A quick stretch break, refilling my water, etc.If I'm feeling particularly stumped/annoyed, I'll often go on a longer 15-20m walk break, maybe step outside to grab some fresh air...Every now and then, I figure out how to \"enter the zone\" and manage to stay focused for hours and hours, though this usually happens when I'm writing code as opposed to debugging + investigating. I consider myself lucky when this happens: I haven't yet figured out how to reliably enter flow for the latter.",

For example, Blockly with javascript is probably as simple as it gets for learning the basics. A big step up, Pascal is a strongly typed compiled language that was originally developed as a learning language and is available with a visual designer known as Lazarus open source IDE for writing desk top apps.",

If you're working on a project with other people, it probably makes sense to talk to those people and agree on how to format your commit messages. For example, [\"Conventional Commits\"](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is one example of a consistent way to format your commit messages. But for a solo project, it really doesn't matter at all whether you stick rigidly to something like this.As far as the *types* of information you should be putting in your commit messages: it should be enough to explain both what you changed and why you changed it, to a level of detail that you find sufficient. Commit messages are a form of documentation, and there's no one \"right\" level of detail for your documentation. It depends on how much time you're willing to spend on it.If you want some inspiration, you can take a look at the Linux, which generally has very detailed commit messages. Often the messages are much longer than the corresponding code changes. A Linux kernel PR won't be accepted if the maintainers don't think the commit message is clear enough, even if the code itself is fine.For instance, [this recent commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/76ed27608f7dd235b727ebbb12163438c2fbb617) has 31 lines of text (plus footers) to describe a 13-line code change. The first line contains just the most crucial details: the change affects performance monitoring (\"perf\") in the scheduler (\"sched\") subsystem, and it fixes a potential crash. The rest of the message goes into detail about exactly why the problem is happening and how it was fixed.Again, you probably don't need to go into nearly that level of detail for *all* your commits, especially if you're working on a project that's less critical than the Linux kernel. But while you're writing code, you should be thinking about how you would explain what you're doing to another programmer. And then you can decide how much of that explanation you want to put into the commit message.----Note also that deciding how to *describe* your commits goes hand-in-hand with deciding *what* changes to include in each commit. In the example I gave, it's straightforward to describe the commit's purpose because it's a very small, self-contained change. If the commit included other bug fixes at the same time, it would be a lot harder to write a good description.You might think that carefully breaking up your changes into multiple commits is just creating more work, but if you do it properly, it can make things easier for you in the long run.",

Then again everyone has their own style— but definitely do not do `git add .` — source control is your friend, it’s one of the icons on the left hand side of VS code that looks like a merge request icon IIRC. Commit a message for each file, and make it a habit to commit frequently until you get a feel for appropriate checkpoints.Edit: `git add .` is fine for initial project template / codebase, or overall changes — just don’t work on something for several hours and then be lazy / cut corners with it. Proper documenting of ongoing and frequent changes is essential if your goal is to eventually work with a team at any level from small to enterprise. Some teams have a specific recommended standard for commit verbosity and frequency as well!Edit edit: If your mind is searching for a statement for a commit and can’t find it— you can describe what you did to any LLM and it should be able to help you. Eg; “I added a variable that is part of my useState into the array at the end of a useEffect” becomes “Added a dependency to useEffect hook that refreshes the state of the page should that dependency change” — these are equally concise but one is more *technically accurate*.",

Why use a TreeMap over a HashMap?). I might ask how they would implement a multithreaded solution and what problems can arise from multithreading and how they'd solve those problems. I would expect questions on REST API development (maybe GraphQL, but honestly, I've yet to see a valid use case for that). I'd definitely expect questions on unit testing.

That usually leads to frustration because you recognize solutions when you see them but cannot reproduce them later.A simple structure that works well is learning one pattern at a time. Study the core idea, solve a few easy and medium problems, then come back later and try to rebuild the solution from memory. That last step is where most actual learning happens.If you are transitioning from a service company, consistency matters more than speed. Two focused hours daily with review and recall usually beats long random grinding sessions.I built a small platform called [algodrill.io](http://algodrill.io) after mentoring people making this same transition. It focuses specifically on helping you rebuild solutions from memory instead of just recognizing them. It might help if recall and retention are the parts you struggle with, but the main thing is staying structured and consistent regardless of resource.Five months is enough if you avoid resource hopping and focus on depth over volume.",

        "body": "Language doesn't matter that much. It can make a big difference on how you solve these, but just pick whatever language is actually relevant to the kinds of jobs are interested in, so you're not spreading yourself thin for no good reason.I don't have an opinion on the resources you mentioned. What they're mainly good for is narrowing, say, the entire leetcode problem set down to a _much_ smaller subset that gives you a focused sampling of the major problem types. There are more problems on leetcode.com than a sane person has time for or need for, and there's a lot of overlap between many leetcode problems, so you want to avoid aimlessly meandering there and treating leetcode.com as the roadmap. * Start with easy problems only. * Gradually build up your toolkit of data structures so you learn when to apply certain data structures to which kinds of situations, and exposure to issues that can arise when writing code (off-by-one, index or boundary issues, logic errors, proper handling of numbers, concurrent modification issues, reference vs value, mutability issues, etc.)* Some \"easy\" problems may seem hard, and it may not be your fault * IIRC some leetcode problems were mislabeled, and may still be? Those sites that give you a more curated list might help avoid this issue? Anyway, I'd avoid picking random problems directly from leetcode.com itself.* Work on problems one at a time, give them a fair shot, but don't waste inordinate amounts of time being stuck. * Force yourself to think and use the tools you can recall. If you can't solve a problem in a reasonable time because you're simply missing the tools needed to solve it, then just look up and study well-written, non-code-golfed solutions, understand the key pieces, and move on. And plan to revisit those problems later on (put them at the back of your problem queue). Over time your recall of the problem -> solution mappings will strengthen.* Always be putting your solution (and test cases) in its own file that you can _run_ on your machine. * e.g. `node leetcode1-twosum.js`. You can also use a debugger, e.g. `node --inspect-brk leetcode1-twosum.js` when you run into problems.* Try not to see DSA as an isolated thing. * The main thing it boils down to is picking the right data structure(s) that suit the problem and help you meet the requirements, whatever they are. * A hard part is these problems can feel contrived and disconnected, which may be true, or may be an illusion - it depends. There's no one way to feel about it. I'm still deeply affected by having learned the \"text justification\" DP problem, and nobody can take from me. * Try to come to your own conclusions about the need/value of studying DSA problems based on the kinds of companies you're interested in. Feeling bad about this interview style is a common feeling, but not necessarily a useful feeling, depending on what you're after.* Timebox your DSA study so that you can make time for other things * Mostly to make sure you're spending time working on actual projects, so you're slowly getting exposure there. * Personal projects can give you freedom to try things that may be difficult to justify trying at work, and which can have very high learning/growth value. * Some experience solving DSA problems can benefit your implementations a bit, but won't help you learn how to design systems. So they can be complementary.For advice moving from a service-oriented to a product company...* if your current job has lots of greenfield projects with a short lifecycle, take advantage of that as a catalyst for growth, and as freedom to try slightly different approaches and to learn from past mistakes in code design. * Once you move to a product company, that can be less common. It can still happen, e.g. starting new products, or somewhat isolated subprojects or tools, etc. that serve the overall product in whatever way. But a lot of your time will be spent on things you may not be able to change easily.* Don't overly aggrandize product companies and don't belittle yourself and the time you're spending right now. * Have a mentality that your time right now is preparation for what's to come.* In your current job, try to be curious and thinking about your own growth. * If you have some decision-making power over which technologies or approaches are used, try to carve out a little space for yourself to grow, whatever that means. Try to keep it low-risk (don't put projects at risk due to making wild choices, but try to take whatever liberties you can that help you move in the direction of writing better code and making better overall system design choices that meet the requirements of the project). * If you don't have that power yet, then try to keep growing your skills and becoming so good that companies feel compelled to put you in that position and let you take the lead on things.* Prep for interviews, but don't wait too long to jump into the fray. * Usually interviews don't give good (or any) direct feedback, but ideally you have a rough sense of what you did well or not so well, and figure out what to work on. Dwelling on the asymmetry of the interview process won't help you, it is what it is.* Don't be too surprised when interviews don't go well * Just move right along to the next one, and don't get discouraged by the process. * Try to glean whatever you can, and cross-reference how you did with how others do, e.g. watch videos of mock interviews if useful. See what they do well and think about what you didn't do as well.* Ask your interviewers directly what you can do better!!! * Don't leave this up to HR to do (they won't). * Your fellow programmers _might_ be willing to say _something_ when asked directly at the very end. Don't be surprised if some cop out of this, but not all will. Either way, it's better than not asking and then getting absolutely 0 on the tail end.* Make sure to express interest in the company and product/problem domain. * When the interview ends with Q&A, be sure to have at least a couple questions about the team and/or company!! It can tip the scales in your favor a bit.* Don't automatically assume rejections are because you're bad. * Sometimes the company just has to pick between multiple people, and you may have been good but not _as_ good as somebody else. Well, what happens if that person gets hit by a bus, or quits, or whatever. Leave things on as good of a note as you can, you never know when a connection reaches out again, and luck may have it that you're still looking when they do.",

In this case, an initialization outside would just be wasted and needed to be garbage collected (small waste, but still).Also, in Java, it is common to *program against the interface*. This means that the field `elements` would normally not be declared by its full implementation type `ArrayList`, but by the *interface* `List`, so the initialization becomes `private List elements;`.This allows for more flexibility as it is easy to swap the actual *implementation type* when needed.Same thing for the return values. They would also commonly rather return a `List` than an `ArrayList`.",

Following [Odin Project's React course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-setting-up-a-react-environment) you'll see they use Vite to set up a react project. You then create your components in separate jsx files (which is like a mix of Javascript and HTML), then add those components to your App.jsx component. Should be easy enough. Of course it depends how far along you are now. If you're most of the way through your project, refactoring it to some framework may be more effort than it's worth.",

Here's the practical breakdown: If you want to stay close to hardware (embedded systems, robotics, IoT, firmware) - start with C. It maps directly to how you already think about registers, memory, and hardware. Arduino uses C++ technically, but in a very C-like way. The embedded industry still runs on C and will for decades. Companies like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and automotive firms want C + understanding of hardware, which is exactly your combo. If you want to pivot toward software engineering at a tech company - C++ is the better resume play. It's used heavily in game engines, high-frequency trading, operating systems, and performance-critical applications. But honestly? For most software engineering roles at tech companies, Python (which you already know) plus a web language would get you further than either C or C++. The real answer nobody's telling you: your EE degree + programming is a rare and valuable combination. Don't think of it as \"learning to code from scratch.\" Companies building physical products with software components (robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, consumer electronics) specifically seek people who understand both sides. That's a much less crowded job market than pure software dev. Start with C on Arduino since you're excited about it. Motivation beats optimization every time when you're learning. You can always add C++ later - it's literally a superset of C, so nothing is wasted.",

But if that’s “cheating” then this is what I would do. The trick here is to use memoization and working backwards(very common pattern). Find all the valid prefixes from the string before you check if the prefixes are valid. That way you don’t have to loop through the string every time you check a prefix. You only have to loop through it once.If string is “abc” then all valid prefixes are (“a”, “ab”). Then you loop through the prefixes list checking to see if the string is in the set. Checking the set is O(1) so it’s fast and looping through the potential prefixes list is o(n). Then you just append the valid prefixes to a results list and return it.",

Iterate from 1 instead.2. `findminlength` could be better renamed to `findShortestStringLength`.3. Use for loop in `findminlength`.4. Assuming that this is Java, don't concatenate a lot of small strings. Strings are immutable in Java, so you are creating a copy every time you do `string0 += string1`. Use a `StringBuilder` instead.5. Don't write comments like \"this loop iterates over indices of `strings`\", it is useless, you can get that information by looking at the code itself. But you can explain why you start at 1, not 0.6. In the else branch, you set `smallestLenght` to `zwischenergebniss.length()`, which will cause the loop to break, because `zwischenergebniss` has length of `i + 1` at that point. Insert `break` there to make it explicit and remove the `zwischenergebniss = \"\"`, because it is reset on the next iteration a second time.7. `zwischenergebniss` can be removed and replaced by `result`.8. You shouldn't modify the argument passed to the string. Nothing about the function indicates that the function has side effects, it should be pure. Save the first string in the array to a separate variable. Although, in this case it doesn't matter, since this it leetcode.9. Formatting is off. Put spaces between `)` and `{` on while loops and body of a function. Choose whether you want to put spaces after/before `=` or not. Stuff like thatIf I understand your solution correctly, the inner loop can be simplified by a lot. You need to count how many characters match and then replace `smallestLength` by that value. In the end, the `smallestLength` represents the longest prefix length, just return a substring of the first element in the string of that length. int prefix_length = 0; for (int i = 0; i < smallestlength; i++) { if (strs[0].charAt(i) == strs[s].charAt(i)) { prefix_length += 1; } else { break; } } smallestlength = prefix_length; // prefix_length is always <= smallestLength",

If the chance of a hash collision is one in 10^70, radiation bit flipping is a bigger problem.^1 A cryptographically strong hahs function allows to largely rule out attacks on that vector.**2. use hash for inequality** The hash guarantees that hashA != hashB ==> A != B. If the hashes are equal, compare the full data. If you store the hash along with the data, this allows to \"short cut\" many comparisons without accessing the actual data.That pattern is common in deduplication stores: even if you store many elements, only a few (if any) will have the same hash, and you have to compare the full data only against those. A cheap hash (small, fast) is sufficient here.^1) ^(an old number I remember is 1 flip per GB of RAM per week. I hope it's gotten better - but still)",

So the contract with equals and hashCode is that 2 equal objects always return the same hash code.This does **not** mean that 2 unequal objects must return different hash codes. And there will often be such collisions. It's perfectly valid to have a hashCode that always returns a constant - this will just make your hash tables inefficient. If you want to use it for equality testing, this would only cover the negative case (unequal). But when both hash codes are equal you still need to properly compare the objects.And calculating hash codes is not trivial. A proper implementation will calculate the hash code over all fields, just like equals would compare all fields.Hash codes are used for hash tables to quickly find an index into an array.You can also use hashes that are unlikely to have collisions. This is often done for file-integrity. Here the hash is stored, so it doesn't need to be recomputed every time (one of the 2 hashes at least). And file I/O is also slower, making this more useful. Collision-resistant hashes are very useful, but still not cheap to calculate (not cheaper than testing equality), and hashCode* is definitely not collision-resistant.(* I'm assuming you're using Java?)",

        "body": "I don’t know about Dart, but in many languages it’s possible (or sometimes required) to override an object’s hash code function, so (contrary to some comments here) it’s important to understand how they work.No, hash collisions are possible. They’re even quite likely if a developer has written a bad hashing function on their object. Assuming everything else in the system is written correctly, these bad hashing functions will impact efficiency but not correctness.Comparing two objects for pointer equality is generally very cheap, and this is what `==` does in most languages. “Pointer equality” means that the objects are in identical memory locations (whether on the machine or on a VM; the details are complicated but not relevant right now.) This means the objects are really and truly “the same”; if you mutate one, the other will be mutated as well, because they’re the same object.Comparing two object’s hash codes is frequently cheap, but not as cheap as pointer equality, because hash codes are often highly optimized and frequently cacheable. If the compiler/runtime knows that the object hasn’t changed since the last time you’ve computed its hash, it can choose to reuse the result of the last hashing operation instead of running it again.Comparing two objects for value equality can be expensive. “Value equality” means that the objects are conceptually the same. For nested objects, this generally means walking the whole object graph and comparing each piece of data in both objects to each other. For small objects this is cheap, for big objects it might not be. Value equality is a conceptually stronger guarantee than pointer equality, because it tells you that two objects “mean” the same thing, even if they were constructed at different locations. However, this can be fragile in the presence of mutability, because if you mutate one of the objects they might stop being equal.If you want to check whether two objects have value equality, usually you do this:1. Check whether the objects have pointer equality. If they do, the objects are equal and you’re done. Pointer equality implies value equality. 2. Check whether the objects have hash code equality. If they don’t, then they are unequal, and you’re done. Hash code inequality implies value inequality. 3. As a last resort, check whether the objects have value equality. Hash codes are especially necessary as a performance optimization when using objects in collections which have limitations around item equality. `Set` and `Map`/`Dictionary` are the main ones which come to mind. In a set you don’t want there to be multiple copies of objects which are equal to each other, and in a dictionary you don’t want to add duplicate keys. In both of these situations you’re not just comparing two objects for equality, you’re comparing one object to a whole bunch of objects and seeing if it’s equal to any of them. In a big collection, this would get more expensive as the collection gets bigger. Without hash codes, adding N items to a set is an O(N^2) operation. So the way these data structures are usually implemented is by using “buckets” of items which have hash codes in a given range. When you want to add an object, the data structure computes its hash code, then finds the bucket which it belongs to (an `O(M)` operation, where `M` is the number of buckets, or in some cases `O(1)`, depending on the implementation). Then, if there’s already items in the bucket, the object being added is compared to every item in that bucket until an equal object is found. (`O(N)`, for a much smaller `N` than before). All in all this is asymptotically much, much faster.Of course, as I alluded to earlier, mutability messes this whole thing up. If you mutate an object in a way that would change its hash code then the algorithm used by the data structure will no longer perform correctly and it will be left in an invalid state.Hopefully this helps. If you have any further questions about this I’d be happy to answer them.",

Build something small break it fix it repeat. Do not worry about graphics or perfection. As a programmer your goal is to understand how game logic works like movement collisions input and simple AI.

It's one of the steps to understanding that you don't need to necessarily memorize algorithms, which is something that new computer science students often get very nervous about: you just need to understand the concepts, and then you can often derive the algorithm in your head on your own.Graph theory is a very rewarding area of computer science, with a lot of really cool, really fun algorithms (many of which are NP complete, and sometimes where an algorithm that seems it should be easier than another actually being much harder than another, e.g. Euler cycle / circuit versus Hamiltonian cycle).",

A simple way to pick a next focus is to anchor on outcomes you want in 12 to 18 months, like staff track, more backend systems work, platform/DevOps leaning, or just being a sharper generalist.Since you’re already doing Rails and touching CI plus AWS, a strong next step is to go deeper on one end to end slice: build a small service that is deployed the way a real team would run it. IaC, basic observability, a queue or pub/sub, a DB migration story, and a rollout strategy. That turns “learning AWS” into concrete skills that transfer everywhere.Language wise, Rust/Go/TS are all fine, but I’d pick one to go beyond hello world and use it in that project. You’ll learn more from dealing with packaging, testing, and deployment than from sampling syntax. Also, revisiting modern .NET is not a bad call if you want more enterprise options, but it’s easier to justify when it supports a goal rather than just curiosity.",

Since you're already strong on backend with Ruby, Go would be the natural next step. It fills a similar niche but opens doors to systems-level work, CLI tools, and anything performance-sensitive. Plus the Go ecosystem around DevOps tooling is massive (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform are all Go). You'd get two birds with one stone since learning Go naturally pulls you into the infrastructure world you said interests you. The CI/CD and AWS stuff will come along the way once you have a project that actually needs deploying. Don't learn Kubernetes in a vacuum, learn it because your Go service needs to run somewhere.",

Money isn’t an issue either, so that’s the two main things that should cause you that much stress out of the way!I’m a beginner in this field myself, and it’s an overwhelming ocean of knowledge - I constantly see acronyms that I have no idea what they mean, kinds of protocols or algorithms or terms that have no meaning to me. If I came at this with the attitude that everyone knows this and I don’t and that’s why I can’t get a job, by that logic I would never be able to get a job, and I’d freak out. But it’s ok. The thing I just said about everyone knowing it already isn’t true. You will get this - you only need to understand that this is not something you can just master in a matter of weeks. It will likely be years, especially if you work full time like I do too. But to get to a level where you are competent enough to have a few noteworthy projects and seem employable? Not so long. Whenever you learn any new skill, all the knowledge you pick up is fragmented at first. This field has millions of fragments so it’s very daunting. But you will find one fragment that starts to glue others together. And the panic you feel will subside. Trust me.",

Additionally, if you had the poor sense to use such an analogy whilst we were all eating or something like that, then I'd have to restrain myself from my intuition to scold you for such a poorly chosen metaphor in the circumstances.And notice that this linguistic evaluation (of whether you actually shat in your pants) would not change, regardless of your choice or not to include the word 'literally'. This is due to the word 'literally' being 'literally' abused for what appears to be at least hundreds of literal (or \"literary\") years of prose. Personally I think it's just a funny in-joke that keeps getting re-invented from generation to generation (e.g. you literally took that too literally).So, fellow thread-posters here suggesting therapy, methinks you dudes/dudettes are being way too literal.",

This is our thing that separates us from salesman who are used to failure on 90% of the cold calls they do.And this mindset can actually be trained, by solving enough simple to gradually more difficult problems that you become used to success.> whenever I exit the comfort zone by closing the tutorial videoThe tutorial zone is no comfort zone, it's a non-programming zone.

For example `first_number` rather than `First_number`. See more in this guide: https://realpython.com/python-pep8/* Your program will crash if the user enters something that is not a number for the first or second numbers, as it can't be converted to float. For example \"hello\" as the first number is invalid.* As others mentioned, handle division by zero.* Consider making the program keep working after doing an operation, instead of always closing. For example, ask the user if they want to do another operation, or quit. Then, if they want to do another operation, trigger the same logic again (this requires knowing loops, so only if you are there yet or want the challenge).",

Some \"official\" solutions are not optimal even with the learnt skills up to that point.You have to understand that in programming nothing is chiseled in stone. There usually are several paths that lead to the goal. Some are more efficient than others, some are better readable/maintainable than others, and some are good middle-grounds between efficiency and readability/maintainability - that's the ones a programmer should strive for. If your solution is super intelligent and efficient but you are the only one who understands it, it is useless in production, but may be nice for competitions, if your solution is super slow but extremely readable, you're on the other end of the scale and should work on your speed.It's all a matter of experience.

Courses like CS50, MOOC, Boot.dev, and so on, are amazing courses taught by the best; but they will always pale in comparison to any in-person multi-faceted learning environment. It's this reason I enrolled in a CS course at the local community college after having taken CS50x/p/w/g, completed most of boot.dev, and read a little more than half a dozen textbooks on Python, C++, HTML-CSS-JS, Design Patterns, and DS&A. Nothing beats listening, seeing, discussing, doing, and being critiqued all in a 2 hour block.Humans are social animals, and you're human. You should be around people learning like you and get involved in a learning community. You'll find you retain more, have far more fun, and ultimately are all around better off from it.",

Being well-rounded makes is a good skill for connecting with people too.Plus being able to create art you want, even if only as a hobby, is just a good skill. I do programming, a little bit of traditional arts, and digital arts as hobbies and the intersection of them is damn fun. I enjoy being able to draw/create whatever workflow. I quite enjoy employing common algorithms in interesting ways \\[re: not LLM/AI stuff as that wasn't around!\\]; I get to pursue a much wider variety of workflows/techniques since I can draw on a wider skillset.Learning how to paint, the mixtures, pigments, etc \\[I got quite into paint this last year\\] has really taught me the details of finishing, coating, and protecting anything I may make - from furniture to housing. And a quick coat of paint can make a used, cheap piece look brand new!Plus I find learning both digital and traditional art reinforces the core skills one needs to make good art overall. Composition, colors, lighting, texture, detail density, etc - all necessary to practice regardless of the medium.What's the point of being a programmer if you don't also get a bit of time to pursue other topics that you enjoy? I think it's worthwhile to read history, but I can tell you it will not be getting me raises anytime soon!Lastly, when you learn things, it may open doors you previously would not have been aware of. The twists of life might open a door or two that would've been hidden otherwise.Finally, the AI stuff concerning \\*making\\* art is such a strong debate I think all the noise around it always misses the forest for the big tree. Thinking on it, however, one faces the same core issues with generative tools as you did with old school algorithmic/digital art!Say my 200x200 random pixel generator is able to theoretically produce any piece of art ever. (any piece in a 200x200 space of course) The problem is, statistically, most art produced is random noise. It's all \\*seems\\* the same - despite both pieces of noise being very different in terms of data - because both noises communicate the same exact thing to the audience. \"This is random noise\".IMO, to make impactful art, you've\\- You've got to understand why and which elements evoke what you want in the audience. \\- You've got to understand what is important, what isn't, and tightly control what is important. \\- And generate interesting ideas within the work of any sort.The first two require lots of practice and is a soft skill - much like cooking w/o a recipe. The last one, I find, is much easier when I pore over an artwork and let the creative process compound on itself. (And study lots of extraneous subjects or other artworks to pull more ideas from!)Much like you've got to learn how to draw your basics before you can start breaking the rules, I think the biggest problem AI presents is it can undercut the learning process, development of personal styles, & creative process. Much like if you only ever followed \"paint by numbers\" kits and never challenged yourself further.\\[Though once you've got your art down, and you find it has a useful part in your workflow, I figure it becomes a tool like any other -- IP issues not withstanding. Albeit I'm cantankerous and refuse to give up any control to blackboxes : P. And can't really see how'd I use it in a way that isn't covered by photobashing & art archives ha! But I've no need for productivity either, not working in a professional context.\\]",

You're not starting from 0.If your goal is to \\*pay the bills\\* as one, I can't speak on that as it's a competitive space like most art spaces and not one I pursue. Generally more money, time, ability, connections, marketing, formal training, etc makes it easier.

I have about 25 years experience and there are definitely still days where I hit a problem and I just go \"This is chaos.\" But if someone were to ask me to define thinking like a programmer, I think the most defining skills are 1. Being able to look at a small problem and imagine how you could represent it on a Von Neumann machine (read-writeable memory, processor, code, instructions run in sequence).2. Being able to take a problem too big for (1), break off a piece of it (without completely losing the original problem), and treat that problem in isolation. Over and over again, until you get a piece small enough to apply (1).Every problem solved with computers is, at some fundamental level, solved that way. Every game engine, for example, wasn't written by someone \"writing a game engine,\" it was written by someone writing a sound system, main coordination system, input handler, scene representation, rendering system, logic system, and so on.",

Whatever you build, it has to be deployed and has to have a chance at making real money. At least enough to support yourself once it's established. Not a consultancy or something that teaches you to code, either. A real product. Have AI help you come up with an idea and business plan. But it should be something you're at least a little interested in. Building an actual product with real customers will teach you more than your boot camp and CS degree combined.

It's still using the same List unless you create a copy.This saves on time and memory, but it means that different types don't behave consistently.If you use a language like C, you explicitly choose 'copy this' or 'tell me where to find this', and that gives you more freedom with regards to reference vs value.

        "body": "Everything is normal - a lot of people like to confuse things further by talking about passing by reference or value or copying, etc. This usually only confuses things further.Let me try to show an example - first with an integer (code isn't Dart or anything in particular, mostly pseudocode): int v1 = 5; // first we declare a variable 'v1' with a value of '5' myFunc(v1); // then we send that variable as an argument to the function def myFunc( v2 ) { // in the function, the variable 'v2' is now also set to the value '5' print( v2 ) // as we can see if we print it v2 = 4; // but then we change 'v2' to '4' // 'v1' was never changed }Then if we use lists - the result is actually exactly the same: list l1 = ['c','a','t']; // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't' myListFunc( l1 ); // then we send that list as an argument to the function def myListFunc( l2 ) { // in that function, the variable 'l2' is now set to the same list // of 'c','a','t' print( l2 ); // as we can see if we print it l2 = ['d','o','g']; // but when we change 'l2' to another list of 'd','o','g' // the original 'l1' was never changed }Some people like to argue that 'v2' becomes a copy of 'v1' but 'l2' becomes a reference to 'l1' - this isn't entirely correct, and in my opinion only muddies the water. The important thing is that when you set a variable = some other value, it doesn't matter where it originally got its value from, it is gone. And setting v2 = v1 doesn't \"link\" v2 and v1 in any way, it just makes them have the same value.Now for the tricky part!A value like 4 and 5 cannot be changed, setting v1 to 5 and then setting v2 to v1 and v2 to 4, does not change neither 4 nor 5, it only changes the variables v1 and v2.But a *value* like a list, **can be changed**, you can replace individual items, add or remove them - it is still the same list. You cannot replace or remove anything in the number 5.So this code does change the inside of l1: list l1 = ['c','a','t']; // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't' myOtherListFunc( l1 ); // then we send that list as an argument to the new function def myOtherListFun( l2 ) { // and receive the same list as variable 'l2' l2.add('s'); // and we modify the inside of the list! // this has also changed the list for 'l1' because it is the same list }There's nothing magic about it - note that we don't write `l2 = ['c','a','t','s']` because that would change l2 to be another list, just like v2 was changed to be another number.If we could write `v2.increment()` or something like that, we would be able to change v1 through v2, but as that is usually not the case in most languages, programmers like to say that numbers are copied and lists are referenced - although it rarely is like that.",

So if you want to be an expert, you need to pick a field and master it. You can still have a good understanding of surrounding domains and basic knowledge of things further afield, but you need to focus on specific areas to become an expert.For example, lets say you want to become an expert in large data stores for corporations. That means being an expert in databases, accesses methods, scaling and many more things. But it is also useful to understand access methodologies such as Enterprise servers and how they operate. This can contribute to making decisions like performing processing in database (using complex SQL, procedures or maybe even UDFs) or do that processing in the server but requiring multiple fetches to the database. On the other hand, it is still useful, but far less so, to understand the front end technologies and their supporting services.So, what I am saying is pick something (or a small number of related things) and learn them well, but also identify the main things that surround them and be well aware of them. Then identify the next layer of things and be aware of them, but no need to know them as well as the things immediately surrounding your area(s) of focus.IMHO.",

I understood memory management very well at a conceptual level - specifically the heap and the stack. But I had never really had to delve deeply into actual memory allocations - I had once written an exception capture mechanism (i.e. I had to roll my own try/catch/throw mechanism for our C application) which required understanding the stack and call frames very well, but we hardly ever used dynamic memory allocation (i.e. the heap), so I never really needed to diagnose it.But, this failing application did and I had to learn the specifics of how the C runtime managed the heap.So, looping back, I learned the basics of C and the facilities like malloc (so breadth-first), but as I learned them I also delved under the surface. Then when I needed to I drilled down to whatever depth was needed for situations arising.Hopefully that makes sense.",

My advice is use ChatGPT for now as a mentor really dig into details on the prompt like “you are now my mentor I don’t need you to give me code but advice and hints on the code and where to find the answer as well as detailed feedback, let’s keep it simple code and we can scale as well go” something like that.

The best part about Linux is that you have control over everything, which is also the most dangerous part about Linux lolSo you have this environment that lets you do anything, what do YOU want out of it? Do you want to browse the internet? OK, download Firefox. You google how to do that, and you learn that you have to type out ``` sudo dnf firefox```Do you know what that command means? If you don't you've just been given a guide on what to learn next. You research a bit and learn about privileges and using the sudo command. You research a bit more and you learn that dnf is your package manager and why it makes your life easier.Now tomorrow you decide you want to talk to friends on Discord, you already probably can guess how to do it, but just in case you can google how to download the Linux version. You arent surprised by the command they give, because you already learned what package manager youre using and what that entire command does. At first this simple process took a few steps and research, but now you know enough to do it quickly and confidently. This snowballing approach is how you learn Linux, you dont watch a 10 hour youtube video or take a class. You think \"it wish my computer did X\" then you research how to do X. It's like carving a statue in marble, you sand away the bits that annoy you or dont work until you've gotten down to what you want. Anytime you think \"thats annoying\", figure out how to stop it. Ever have something in your terminal spin forever or crash? Thats annoying, and many beginners just close the terminal and start over. That works... buts its kind of annoying. That should be an itch you scratch, and of you look around you'll discover that you can kill that process by hitting ctrl+c. Ever try to paste something in the terminal and it doesnt work? Thats annoying, if you research a bit you'll learn why it does that though. You'll also learn that you can paste directly into the terminal by using Shift+ctrl+v instead. Don't \"learn\" Linux. It's your computer, USE Linux, and if it seems like there should be a better way of doing something, find out what that better way is. Everyday you'll find something that pisses you off, which is great because that means you are being given something to learn on a silver platter.",

I have worked with experienced DevOps who did not know how to configure NGINX, because for load balancers there is AWS ELB.Prioritize cloud platforms like AWS over Linux.For habits, I would stick with CLI tools when possible instead of using GUI for everything. For instance, use git in the terminal. It will help when configuring CI/CD pipelines.By the way, I am a software engineer. Still I think my points are valid. Cheers.",

Then go to Leet Code and work on data structures and algorithms. You don't have to go too crazy there. Answering easy and medium questions and understanding Big O is enough for most. Then focus on SQL. Being good with data and databases and knowing how to avoid things like N+1 queries is critical for production work. But, like I said, be patient. Don't fall into the trap of thinking you have to know all of this before you can build something real. Continuing to build projects *while you're learning* is the single most important thing to do. All the best coders I know started building projects before they were ready. Good luck!",

In many languages this problem is addressed much more simply with phantom types.Correctness-by-construction only stretches so far. It gets more expensive to maintain as you try to enforce more and more complex properties. At some point it becomes better to insert runtime checks and trust your test suite.I can’t help you with a misplaced sense of personal guilt (see a therapist if that’s a common theme in your life) but I can say that you’re taking the wrong approach here. Code’s correctness is multifaceted; complex code may feel safer, but it’s also more likely to contain bugs due to its complexity. A type system is indeed a static analysis tool, but static analysis is only one tool in the toolbox. Maybe focus on unit testing for a bit and explore property-based testing as a cheaper alternative to becoming overwhelmed with your own designs.",

It is easy to learn some arbitrary amount of coding that feels like you know a thing or two. It is very difficult to get yourself to a professional competency on your own. And it is \\*extremely\\* difficult on your own to tell whether you're actually making progress toward a true professional competency.All that being said, at the same time, coding is almost unique among high-wage white-collar careers in the sense that even though it's hard, it's still definitely possible to put yourself on a high-earning path (even if your *first* gig isn't a FAANG hire, it's possible to work your way there eventually still) almost entirely by your own efforts, without any formal training at all. You can't, for example, become a high-earning accountant by practicing accounting home alone.Source: am a self-taught programmer with no college and still a reasonably fancy SWE job.As far as options goes, start by reading the community bookmarks in the right hand sidebar.",

It has a number of competing replacements. Apache Spark is one of the more popular replacements. Apache Spark (or often just \"spark\") is available for the programming languages \"scala\", \"java\", and \"python\". Python is the most popular recently. Java has better \"error checking\" and execution performance, and Scala is the language where Spark truly shines, but is a bit more work to learn.Considering current market trends, I'd recommend using Spark with Python, as that seems to be popular, even if it is not as nice as some options that might be better (from a strictly computer science point of view).",

Sometimes it'll be OOP, sometimes DOP, and sometimes something else completely. (Functional programming? Bringing in a new library or tool? Microservices? etc).Note that if you do this, it's likely you'll end up with a hybrid approach, using different techniques for different corners of your overall project.

If it’s within a function, then you have to make sure it’s compatible with the rest of the function — you have to tell the compiler if you clobber any registers, for example, so it knows to avoid that registers or save/restore it.If it’s at the top level then you have to make sure you’re handling the function prologue and epilogue, as well as the calling conventions so the code can be called from outside.

Your final sentence alone says that you aren't learning programming because you want to make games, you are learning it because you want the game developer job and if it isn't handed to you quickly, you will quit.You haven't even learned the fundamentals of programming yet, nor have you really delved into what game development actually is. This raises my hackles and plants a giant red flag for me with you.Game Developer jobs are unstable and pretty overpopulated with individuals fighting for those positions. It is also the top underpaid and underappreciated markets for developers to be in. People get laid off all of the time because a game got cancelled, the company was absorbed by another company or the game is complete and they have no more work for you.I'm going to be real with you, I don't think you are cut out for game development based off your post and I don't think you are cut out to be a developer based off your post either. The reason for this is because you will need to practice and study for a minimum of 4 years, plus have a BA degree to even be considered for entry level jobs in the field. I don't think you have the dedication for delayed gratification from how you worded the post.",

You can follow code, but generating it from scratch uses a completely different part of your brain.Here's what actually helped me bridge that gap:1. After you finish a tutorial, close it. Wait a day. Then try to rebuild the same thing from scratch without looking. You'll fail the first time - that's the point. The struggle is where learning happens. Check only when you're truly stuck, then close it again and keep going.2. Don't try to write a full training loop from memory. Start with just the data loading. Then just the model architecture. Then just the loss calculation. Build up the muscle memory piece by piece.3. Once you're comfortable with basics, try implementing a simple paper (like the original ResNet or a basic transformer) using only the paper and PyTorch docs. No tutorials, no GitHub repos. This forces you to translate math - code yourself, which is exactly the skill you're trying to build.The LLM dependency isn't bad for learning concepts, but if you want to actually *think* in code, you need to struggle without it sometimes. Treat it like training wheels - useful, but you gotta take them off eventually.",

Yeah you can break out a single 3090 and run a decent sized qwen or deepseek with a bit of quantization but it isn't going to come close to replacing claude. It feels like running a gimped version of an LLM from a few years ago.

No one will meet those promises over the period of a couple of quarters or years - depending on how much they overpromised 4. A bunch of leaders will get kicked to the curb. When you go on a 3-4 year journey where your CEO promised that AI would revolutionize everything and instead you revolutionized nothing, you spent a buttload of money, you laid a bunch of valuable people off, and now you're categorically worse off than you were 5 years ago. In the meantime, you will start seeing some approvals to start growing headcount again because all these companies that cut a bunch of people are going to find themselves not being able to do anything.For context: I am seeing a lot of companies that are already in steps 3 and 4, so this is not purely speculative - the speculative part is whether or not most/all companies will follow.I think some companies will be able to avoid 4 if they didn't overpromise or if they limited their AI investment to smaller subsets of the company. But I've been seeing most companies saying that AI is going to allow them to reduce headcount in the entire company.",

In my opinion, a lot of these managers also tend to be one-trick ponies. They really have no idea how to adapt to different and smaller companies. I worked at company that hired a bunch of former telecom folks and built up such a bureaucracy of middle managers that I was attending 2 hours of meetings a day just to provide status updates to 4 different middle managers. They only reason they did that is because they was just what they were used to, not because the depth and breadth of our org was doing needed it.

Sometimes a couple of side projects teach you more than one big role, with less risk. You can also do what that [developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/) did and keep your resume circulating across the industry, so opportunities show up over time without forcing you to rush into anything.

Even if they're not part of your specialty, you can start to get familiar with them to help out more in the future. Look through the code for any TODOs.2. Scan the code for vulnerabilities. Depending on your stack, there are several tools out there to use. Even if you dont have access to any tools, you can double check no vulnerabilities are associated with any dependency versions on your project.3. Upgrade project dependencies. This one can be tricky and requires a lot of regression testing.4. Update, create, and improve junit test cases and test case coverage. Create/improve mock services5. Improve CI/CD. Add quality of life features6. \\^Build internal tools to help with automation and testing such as a data generator.7. Improve dashboard and alerting capabilities. Check if there are any metrics you can track that will help alert you of any issues with your project. If none exists, create a metrics dashboard or try to get your team/company to adopt one from the various providers. You could even keep it simple and create a cron job on a linux server that executes a script daily to pull metrics from your logs and database to alert you of any issues. Though there better solutions.8. Study anything related to your job. Learn what you need to in order to eventually help your teammates with their load. Learn more about intricacies of the languages used in your stack. Research tools and libraries that may help your project. Sometimes you can be the one to introduce new technology to the stack that improves something you already have or completely replaces it for some benefit or another.9. Update project documentation. You could also create guides for any new people that may join the team in the future10. Innovate. Maybe you can figure out a good way to leverage AI in your project. Don't immediately jump to an LLM. You might not even need AI and an LLM might be overkill if you can use traditional AI/ML.",

The emergency fund is critical, but make sure you are in a location where you can find another job in your field (with those numbers I’ll bet you’re close). Either way, maybe you have to move, shrug. You appear to be doing very well, good luck with the house hunting.Edit: yapped right past the question. No we did not hold off (obviously) and it was a great decision for us.

You gave the guy a very reasonable answer to his question, and he responds with _\"Coding is dead because I know someone in Mag7 derp derp!\"_ :face_with_rolling_eyes:I feel like engineers should start changing the narrative to \"Where is the innovation gonna come from if we just off-load _everything_ to AI?\" The second most used word in software after AI is probably \"innovation\" – IME it has been used so much as to become meaningless, but leaders always ask for it anyway. So, then, boss, if you want me to innovate _constantly_, _**where do you expect that innovation to come from?**_ If we just have LLMs write everything, they will eventually have nothing but their own code to regurgitate because, dear boss, LLMs don't think... not like we do, anyway. They have no mind, hence no motivation. If you tell them to innovate, the best you'll get is some possibly new combination of existing things – **you will not get a new paradigm.** We don't have AGI yet.God, I am so sick of software – it just feels like brainless, shameless greed in a pretty dress.

If you look up the term you will find a two dimensional plot with autonomy capabilities on the X axis and trust in autonomy on the Y axis. Then plotted along the y=x line will be calibrated trust.The simple idea being that if you have a low amount of trust in autonomy in an area where it has high capabilities than you are under trusting it. Meaning you are not taking full advantage of the capabilities it has to offer. and on the other hand, if you trust it too much in areas that it doesn’t have much capabilities then you can be setting yourself up for failure.The reason this pneumonic is significant is because of the term calibration. It is important for companies and indeed individuals to constantly recalibrate, and reevaluate the level of trust they have in these tools. If you evaluated it a year ago and haven’t done so since, then you are very likely under trusting some of the capabilities the professional tools have now. In particular, the models that dropped late last year showed dramatic improvements in the ability to assist in early dev work and project scaffolding.I don’t mean to overhype the capabilities, but I see a lot of posts where people espouse, the limitations of a year ago, as if it were still true today. The reality is the situation is evolving quite quickly, and everyone should be reevaluating on a continuous basis.",

Most of the time you only have enough “social credit” to rate 1-2 team members with top marks, maybe an additional one if you start cashing in chips to go to bat for them.

        "body": "In my experience, the senior leadership just changes the ratings instead of asks me ha. This can be for many reasons, they could have targets they're trying to fit across the orgs, budget impacts, etc. It happens when ratings are the mechanism for budget forcasts as well as professional evaluations. It does stink when it feels like you have a non bias system of evaluation you've applied and then it's updated under you.What I do in this situation is try to keep the feedback details the same as much as possible, remove any references to the specific rating (like, Surpasses Expectations vs Meets) in the feedback. I give them all the factual situations and behaviors that lead me to rate them this way. I walk them through how the company evaluates performance (if it is documented by the company), how I apply those criteria in my own evaluations and aligns those evaluations across managers. This is good feedback for the employee, the things they are doing well keep doing, the things they may want to change, maybe they want to change them, and so on. Did they get peer feedback? Do you have impressions of their work? all great to share. It's hard when they people you manage are asking for specific feedback to get to the rating they want. \"What do I need to do to be rated as Exceeds expectations mr manager?\", but you don't have as much agency as you think.I don't lead with this, but like others have said, tell them the truth if the rating or discrepancy between the feedback and the rating comes up or they ask. Explain the macro conditions and the process for aligning on the ratings that can give them some prospective.For yourself, yes this is the conflict with the job. You could try to change companies, good luck, but these kinds of things come up in different ways at most companies I've found. Personally, I say this because I do it myself, you may be feeling inadequate or like a failure at justifying your ratings to your non-technical boss and retreating into stubbornness or rigid principle as a defense mechanism. Try to separate one from the other.I try to find value in the human relationships with my team and the coaching opportunities between me and them. If they flourish in this system, and the team flourishes I feel like I'm doing a good job.",

But all the jobs I'm getting are in series-B startups, and they are completely incompatible with being a parent to a child with high needs. I actually tried, but things are just so unstable now. I got fired from a job after about 10 months despite busting my ass on it, and then the next job I found, I got laid off in about 8 months.Tech careers are so all-consuming, and if you want to run a family while in one, it means you're spending a ton of money on daycare, babysitters, after-school programs, summer camps, cleaning, and meal services. You can't turn on and turn off these things at will. Like I get my kid into a pretty expensive daycare that's taking 30% of my take-home, and then I get laid off... I can't just pull her from the daycare because I currently don't have an income, and then put her back in when my income stabilises. I have significant savings, but this type of uncertainty and demands means I can't actually build enough savings while I work, and my savings get depleted fast when I'm between jobs. And I'm not actually able to be a good parent if I'm constantly worried about getting fired or laid off.And AI is cool, but it feels like I'm expected to be up to date on using AI in my job, and I have to spend time outside of work to explore AI and stuff. Which I really don't have the time for. So I'm going back to school to get a teaching credential. There's a huge shortage of math and science teachers. I need something stable that offers benefits, so I'm not constantly worried about the high cost of COBRA coverage when I'm between jobs. The biggest benefit is, even if the job isn't flexible, I'm just DONE at 5pm. Even if I have to grade papers at home, it's not as cognitively demanding as being on-call at 2am when the server goes down. There are a lot of bad things said about teaching as a profession, and I personally know lots of teachers who got sick of it and quit, just as I got sick of tech and quit. But at this point in my life, it feels like a better career choice. I still love programming, and in my spare time, I am constantly coding apps, helping friends with their startups, and consulting. I actually have the bandwidth and energy to do it because I'm not busting ass programming all day. This stuff is much easier with AI as well.",

They want employees to be in a constant state of fear, anxiety and subservience to their manager.The solution is to have a huge 1 to 2 years of monthly expenses saved up. Then you dont have to give a fuck about your performance while you wait for the inevitable layoff. I keep $100k in hysa just for a layoff scenario - it took 5 years to accumulate, which was tough at the time, but my anxiety level was greatly reduced. This hysa stack is seperate from stocks/bonds/401k/529/real-estate etc - those are not your emergency fund. Some people say $xxx in cash is too much - but thats not my problem. This is what I need for my mental safety net and you may need more or less for yours.My last layoff, I got $20k severance and 2 months where I was paid salary but could spend the time searching - and I luckily got a job lined up before the clock ran out. The time before, it took me 2 months to find a job, but severance was only $10k. So I had to dip into my savings, despite unemployment checks. You should look up the weekly max unemployment benefit for your state and factor that into your plan. TLDR: Layoffs are inevitable. Stressing and extra effort will not save you from it. Fuck your employer. You need to stop worrying about stack ranking and layoffs, and instead worry about reducing your expenses and stacking your emergency fund. Use your anxious energy to plan and prep. Once you are prepped and have enough stacked, your anxiety will go away.",

I recommend you do so.The buzzwords “prompt engineering” or “prompt first” have been invented by non-technical people who were previously reliant on developers to build their product (they mostly don’t like developers because money).So when suddenly a new thing allowed them to cosplay as builders and be treated as knowledgeable they ate all that shit up.Now they’re threatening you with “falling behind” as an emotional tactic to make their conviction feel validated.

I don’t know what it is because I presumably never worked with you, but it’s something about you that makes leadership not trust you. One thing I can tell you from your post is, stop trying so hard to chase the next level. I have seen this trap from so many different people (my self included), from juniors to staff+. I have seen people get bitter and go “I’m doing the same work as this other person, why I’m I X and they’re X+1?” But almost always, there is something that is really holding them back. I worked with one mid level once who was extremely bitter that they were not promoted to sr yet (the left amazon as a sde1 or 2, applied as a sr to my current company under the impression that they’d get promoted to sr quickly, and then quit 3 years later as still a midlevel). They were extremely difficult to work with honestly, and mostly because of that bitterness. They couldn’t take an ambiguous piece of work and deliver it. You had to really hold their hands to get them to deliver code. And it wasn’t even because they didn’t know what they we were doing, they did. It’s because they were so focused on proving themselves as sr, they fought against every single plan and needed to fight every little suggestion. They wouldn’t take any feedback, seeing feedback as a ding against their capabilities. They’d write “clever code” that was hard to read and often had edge case bugs, and if you mentioned it during a PR, then they’d just complain to the manager that I’m holding up the review. They’d publicly call out their manager when there was a decision that was made that they disagreed with. These behaviours are what held this person back, and it’s the same kind of behaviour that I’ve seen over and over again. Often times, just focusing on what’s on your plate and delivering outstanding work there is all you need to do. And then you have a convo with your manager and say “I’ve been building great stuff here, and I want to make it to the next level, give me more work please.” Promos are often not done by just your manager, they are done by a committee. You need a manager who is both respected and willing to back you for promo, and other managers who know your name and not willing to fight against your manager to their people. If you piss of another team by being difficult, then you can be that manager is going to bring that up and it’s going to hurt you. You need to be open and collaborative with others. Work with your manager to line up work that aligns with your strengths and weaknesses and focus on knocking those out of the park with out the expectation of promotion.",

I don’t think you have a clear grasp on the difference in responsibility between the levels.Ask yourself these questions:- are you influencing direction across teams or does it feel like no one listens to you?- do you focus on building relationships across your organization so that if your team had to for example, setup a new authentication flow, you’d already know which teams to connect with without needing to ask your manager or someone else?- are you designing work that will be implemented by multiple teams (not just yours) and have you seen the results of these implementations?- are you helping other employees at your level or below build up their skills and learn how to navigate the organization? Especially employees outside your team?- when others start a new feature / project, are you pulled into all day meetings to help them design it even when you will not be involved in the implementation?- when nasty production issues arise, are you pulled in to figure out a path forward? If so, is it just for your team or is it across other teams as well?- do you help identify future work for your team or do you just wait for product to tell you what to do?- do you help management negotiate resourcing requirements for a new feature / project by doing things like creating POCs and then following up with your recommendations for an implementation plan and the amount of teams / engineers involved?The key difference between staff/principal and senior is this ability to navigate the landscape outside your team. You are seen as a technical expert that will influence the direction of your organization, not just your team. If you’re merely leading your team by helping them break down work and reviewing their PRs, that’s senior level work, not principal/staff.Spend the time focusing on the relationships with other teams and becoming invaluable outside your team and the promotion will eventually come.",

I’d organize them better. A reader has to kind of figure things out. I thought you had GraphQL listed twice at first, and my first boomer instinct was “if this person can’t proofread their own resume, why would I bother interviewing them if they care so little?” You are dealing with people with short fuses when people are reviewing your resume. Organize/categorize it better, so someone can digest the info more easily. It’s similar to the snark on Reddit when people joke about paragraphs. - “Contributed” sounds extremely passive. It sounds like your team built a feature while you were working on something else. Work on that section to show more involvement. Even something like “Developed a highly scalable…” might work better. You can add “team” somewhere if you are that self-conscious about it. It’s a mix of passive word choice, and I have literally interviewed people who tried to take credit for the work of others. It just raises an eyebrow because it’s kind of an odd word choice. - Were these different projects or a single one? If they were different projects, you could list the tech stack of each. You could possibly say when you used bigger name tech for certain things like you did with the Solr example.Good luck, it’s a tough market.",

It had a context that could fit like 100 lines of code but it was also low quality context that was forgetful. It hallucinated a lot and lacked knowledge in general. It could not reason or do any thinking. There were no tools it could use to be agentic or even look up things online, didn’t work with images, was very slow, and could barely output anything.Now as of like two days ago we have gpt 5.3 codex. You give it a goal and it will do it autonomously. It can handle not hundreds, or thousands, but millions of lines of code with reliable accuracy. It can use tools, search the web, understand images, even use the computer. It still hallucinates but orders of magnitude less. The world knowledge is more broad than any single expert on earth, even teams of experts. In terms of knowledge depth it outperforms the most elite specialists and only loses to top tier humans at the moment. It can reason and solve real and unseen problems, such as imo competition math problems and even open research problems where no solution exists online. It is also not only hundreds of times faster but also cheaper by like 20x I think per token. It can outputs thousands of lines of code, actually it’ll just find and edit the files it self, push the changes, do the testing, and so on. But yes atm you still need a knowledgeable human in the loop.Anyways this will sound like glaze but it’s stuff I’ve verified myself over the years. Now imagine 5 years down the line, with in mind that progress is actually speeding up and more compute is coming online very soon. So yes, unlike most people here I plainly see what’s happening and is about to happen. Bear in mind I’ve been saying this since ChatGPT launch to many downvotes but not only has everything happened but faster than even I thought and I was already very optimistic.In short fields cooked yes, a lot of things are, this is much bigger than jobs but I won’t get into that. What should you do? Live as normal, not much you can do to prepare and there is no guarantees things will play out this way. Just don’t be dumb and waste 120k on a degree that you may not be able to pay off.",

The way you use AI and particularly the kinds of questions you ask plays a huge role in how it impacts your learning rate. Are you trying to understanding what you're building or are you just full delegation hoping AI figures it out? People who are just full delegating to it appear to be crippling their understanding and learning with it. The long term impact of that on the industry is not fully understood. I suspect some people will be forever juniors.

I'm well into the architecture phase of my engineering career so the raw implementation details feel like grunt work to me. I've only kept that implementation work close to the vest before because I've learned the hard way \"If you want something done right, do it yourself\". But AI now lets me have my cake and eat it too; AI does the implementation grunt work 20x faster than I ever could, yet I get to stand over its shoulder for every line of code and mentor it in the right directions when it gets a case of the stupids. All without any of the drama from overly sensitive juniors who need me to tiptoe around their feelings just to explain why xyz is a bad professional practice.I have no idea how the next generations of senior+ engineers will get the experience they need to actually be senior+ quality engineers in a world where AI is eating the junior to mid engineering roles alive, but that's an industry and C-level problem not something I can solve. I'm only grateful I'm at the tail end of my career rather than the start of it...it's going to get a lot rougher for newer engineers before it gets any better.",

It’s deeper storyboarding in collaboration with the product team. It’s more fine grained contracts between FE/BE/Devops. And then you start to build things and code review them and get multiple parts of a service build for horizontal scaling and personalization up and running so you can start to test how it scales. What’s happening is just another layer of abstraction on both sides of the engineering team that allows engineers to shift the engineering focus from how it connects to other services and third party apis and and towards how they interact in practice.",

Are you someone who needs to move fast without bureaucracy?- What LOB (if told) would you join? The cost centers at Capital One face more attrition than profit centers (like Card Tech). The PIPs fly faster in other LOBs.- Are you okay with mediocrity? Not sure about your offer, but some teams don’t do flashy work. The tech stacks are bloated and poorly written by contractors. Some may have modern stacks.- How long do you see yourself working there? The WLB is fairly good, but the performance culture grinds years off your life for a mediocre pay and no RDU.&nbsp;I’ll also note, SA while a shit pay, will offer more shelter from PIPs than for PAs.

C1 tries to operate as if they’re AWS, the problem is that they’re not paying AWS money. They like to intentionally over-hire & rely on pip culture to incentivize employees to overwork themselves to be ranked appropriately. That leads me to my next thing, they do stack ranking for employees. This means that you’ll be ranked against employees at the same level as you & normally that would be fine, but a lot of orgs have company lifers. These people have been there their entire career or the majority of their career & they know the company inside & out so they’ll consistently set an incredibly high bar that new external hires have to adhere to within a few months of working at the company. With a company so reliant on internal systems that are poorly documented & long drawn-out (again, poorly documented) processes it’s hard to learn all of that while also navigating all the levels of bureaucracy & compliance that comes with fintech. Quite frankly unless you grossly overwork yourself on a regular basis for a year or two or you’re just an incredibly talented engineer it’s unlikely you’ll succeed there. Here are some additional things that you may find useful to know:- They reorg frequently, I’m talking every 6 months at least. So you’ll constantly be shifting teams or lose team members- Everything there is reliant on tons of internal tools & many basic things you’ll have to do will take significantly longer than expected because you have to ask many people who to contact about something then you have to fill out a form & then message someone to tell them you filled out the form then fill out the form again because you forgot to check a certain field on the form- The way the company operates with pip culture breeds a lot of toxic behavior between employees so you’ll encounter a lot of terrible behavior throughout your interactions. Plenty of good people there, but the amount of bad interactions you’ll encounter is relatively high.- as a woman you might find it relevant to know that there’s not many women working there in the engineering departments. I was there for a little over a year & I found out about 3 different serious scandals there involving harassment & encountered a lot of higher ups who are not very respectful towards women. All that being said, they do pay pretty decent, but in my opinion they do not pay nearly enough for how much it sucks to work there. If you’re up to date on your interview skills I highly recommend interviewing elsewhere. Many other companies pay equally well or even better that aren’t as terrible to work for.",

A day later, tell your recruiter you have some concerns you want to clarify. They’ll likely ask if you want to meet with the hiring manager or anyone else to discuss them.

I think at most I would go down to 5 hours, and even then I wouldn't claim I then worked for a full 8 hours.It's reasonable to not always be 100% engaged at all times. personally I aim for at least 6 hours of work a day and only occasionally go under that.So as I see it, yes it is normal, but there is a limit to how much is reasonable.",

        "body": "Mostly excelling as a technical manager is a good path. I did that for most of my career. But I’ll have to admit there were times a new leader would come in and they expected all managers to actually spend most of their time coding. So it sometimes depends on your organization.One rather dorky leader who came in was very forceful and said the success of my team is not my success. He basically wanted all managers serving as individual contributors. Which means we weren’t developing our teams or actually managing at all. I ignored him. Wasn’t best for my career at the time, but he eventually was gone.Find the team and leadership that best resonates with what engages your passion. And you’re probably still staying technical. I’ve definitely had to go into contractor code and fix some of their issues when they said it was impossible or exceptionally costly to make a fix. Best of luck.",

After 5 days I stopped worrying that no one was watching critical component X and they're just gonna have to experience being the one to manage it - and I trusted I left enough instructions and trained my team well enough to cover it. I also kept in touch with them and still do in case they have questions.After 2 weeks, and a ton of sleep, I started making jokes again. My eyes are less puffy. My back hurts less. I smile more. I love that I get to be with my family more. I've begun to cook and find other ways to contribute.But I feel a sense of loss. 14 years on a single project that I loved and helped to build... It's a lot to let go all at once.I have started applying for some roles that I want to contribute to.

The client hated me (they were actually an extremely petty person who burned through a lot of people, so it was not solely on me). But my boss/CEO started becoming a bully towards the end of my time there. I honestly start wondering if he was just trying to make it unpleasant enough I'd quit. I do believe he's done that (or at least tried) with other people. He would start changing requirements midway through development, constantly sending extremely harassing messages, etc. It was very stressful, and I had been worried about losing my job for a while.The company had a major issue, and suddenly, I didn't have a job any more. And it was such a great feeling. I didn't have to deal with any of their stupidity any longer. I was lucky because I had started speaking to another company casually, so I didn't have an extended period of unemployment. I did ask for a gap in start time, and I caught up a ton on sleep I had been missing out on. I make a little less now, but I'm soooo much happier. I'm working in a much healthier environment with people who just treat people decently. I did lose out money on the time I wasn't working. There's no way around that. And I know there are others who lost theirs jobs around the same time I did who I think are still looking. There's some luck in how things play out. If I hadn't found another job, on top of that one I really like, I'd probably feel very differently. There's risk, because what happens if your partner were to lose their job? If it takes you a long time to work again (either by choice or by market), do you run the risk of alienating them? What does recovering your mental and physical health look like, and how supportive will they be? If you're just playing video games on the couch, that could cause problems in the relationship. You need to make sure you're communicating with them, and not just that you're miserable, but understand how they'd feel about you quitting your job. What kind of position are you in to interview? Are you too slammed to interview? Are you not prepared? Or are you not getting any interest?",

The real world experience of coding was nothing like school; I enjoyed support a lot more so I moved into getting work doing on site technical support on contracts at oil extraction sites.It was relatively easy to hop from contract to contract, make a lot of connections, and eventually I moved to do on site IT support for a regional authority.Having the various experiences from the contracts and the programing experience really helped out with seeing problems in a different light and finding unique solutions.I rarely program now, mostly it's just problems that come my way that no one else can figure out because they don't know where to begin. Really it all comes down to being able to understand how to parse large datasets into useful information.I can understand it, I can explain it, most of my team can't comprehend it; so I rapid prototype the solution, meet with various teams, and we get a usable product that prevents us from having to do a RFP for 5 to 10 million dollars a year.I assume there are other roles that are related to computer science that exist in which you can still use your education, training, and knowledge; but it might be a pretty niche job market - regional company, not huge, but not tiny. Big enough to pay we'll, small enough that 5 million dollars a year on savings makes a difference, also in house IT. Contractors aren't going to care and are going to insist that you can be in 3 places at once doing 5 things because they can't read a map.",

The chat system at my previous company allowed us to mute certain chats but get notified if we were @‘ed, if the message contained a variation of our name or someone else’s name, if it contained specific keywords, if it came from a particular user, if the bell was rung, etc etc. I would have lost my mind on week 2 if I had to get notified for each msg in our general chat.",

The engineering is up to us, not a bunch of corporate stooges and their worthless \"AI up-skilling\" powerpoints. I’ll give you a basic run down of everything important I've learned in the last year:1. Write an AGENTS.md file that gives a broad view of your repository with high level details like tech stack, folder structure, etc. Also point to which docs should be referenced if the agent needs to expand further for more details. This prompt will be injected in every conversation so keep the information broad/horizontal instead of deep/vertical.2. Learn how to sandbox your agent so you can run the agent in yolo mode and afk it. The 3 most popular options are: Claude code’s builtin sandbox mode, vscode’s dev containers, and docker’s new sandbox mode for running agents.3. Learn git worktrees so you can have agents work in the background without disrupting your normal workflow or if you want to parallelize work. (I recommend not trying to parallelize too much, most work is inter-dependent and it's usually easier to just work sequentially)4. Utilize skills and have a directory full of detailed instructions for each common task you do. For example, a frontend task that goes deep into detail on how you want your frontend code to be written. Unlike the AGENTS.md file, you want these docs to be deep and detailed. The agent will use progressive disclosure and only invoke those skills when its relevant so your context isn’t overloaded5. Learn about the ralph wiggum technique. This is essentially breaking extremely long tasks into subtasks and running the agent in a loop so that it can work on atomic tasks with a fresh context each time instead of trying to one-shot it and getting its context window trashed. This will involve: - A PRD doc explaining the feature and requirements in depth. - A tasks.json file with subtasks and acceptance criteria for each task. - A notes.md file so that it can jot down any information that might be relevant in between tasks. - And finally, a bash script to run your agent continuously. - There’s some good info [here](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) along with more stuff if you google ralph wiggum.6. Standard engineering practices apply. Tons of high quality tests, linters, formatters, and strict type checkers.7. Set up a way for your agent to test changes. Whether thats setting up staging environments for backend work or setting up browser automation for frontend.8. Avoid MCPs like the plague. 99.99% of them are useless and will clog your context with useless tool definitions that the agent isn’t even good at invoking. The only mcp I recommend is this for browser automation: https://github.com/remorses/playwriter (NOT THE OFFICIAL PLAYWRIGHT MCP. The official one is trash and not optimized to preserve your context window)9. Learn your agent’s plugin system and write scripts to automate tasks that should be run deterministically. Example: Writing a stop hook that executes code quality checks like I mentioned in bullet point 6.",

I quickly got tired and discouraged, feeling like an imposter, so I stopped and kept working my meh job.I’m back on the grind now, though, and I told myself I would push until I got something. I’m about a month into getting back into Leetcode and it’s hard. I just did two easy’s that were similar to each other, yet I still needed hints on both. I also seem to really struggle with my memory on problems. I built an SRS app for the Leetcode problems I complete just so I can remember to go back to them lol. It’s a tough battle out there, but I believe in us. Just keep studying, keep learning, and keep applying. I’ve gotten responses back from some big tech companies and some smaller random companies so far. 3 upcoming OA’s and 2 recruiter calls coming up.Also, I think for your position and resume, you could try to pivot it as general “software engineer” or “frontend engineer”. Make sure you emphasize the languages you’re working with and try to minimize how much you mention Wordpress. I think if you can get some personal projects going that are more than just a super simple CRUD app, that would help, too. You got this!",

I don't know that I agree fully with your perspective on what it's nice to learn, but intense interview prep is absolutely not mandatory.Zero prep is pretty stupid, though, as then your first few interviews will just be your prep. Everybody in every industry needs to prep for interviews.You don't have to go crazy with months of leetcoding, but you should craft your stories about your past work. There's a big difference between a story that you actually wrote and one that you tell off the cuff. That's the important stuff, once you get out of the entry-level zone.For some companies you need to do leetcode, but it is very far from mandatory across the industry. If you want to work at a high paying big name tech firm, then you play by their rules. If you want to have a job that still pays pretty good and is maybe kinda chill, then don't worry about it. Prep like anyone preps for any job. Don't jump through the tech hoops.I've done less than 5 hours of leetcode across 8-9 years in the industry. It absolutely cost me offers, and in turn has definitely extended some of my job searches. I've failed plenty of tech screens that I know I would have passed if I was studying DSA.

I used to feel like you do, and I did not want to spend time making myself more marketable or worrying what recruiters thought. I just tried to do a good job at the job I had. Eventually I realized I was unhappy there for reasons that weren't going to change (in my case, it was extreme boredom, but it could be a lot of reasons.)I had a strong history in... C++, which even then was waning in popularity. Plus several weird proprietary languages and a whole weird proprietary stack and tools, so none of it was transferrable anywhere else. I had also failed to make connections outside my immediate co-workers, so I had very few connections at other companies or even people to serve as references.

I got severely depressed and it triggered my early hair loss. After getting the job, it took my like 6 months almost doing bare minimum just to recover from it mentally. Fast forward till now, I built a job scraper and have prepared for interviews/leetcode questions for almost a year in advance. I started the job hunt last month (I'm still employed). No interviews so far, rejections everyday, a bit discouraged but no where near as bad as the last time. I think preparing yourself mentally that this process can break you is the best advice I can give.",

This is because trash schools do not prepare you to pass the interview. You are better off doing community college for first 2 years to get the required classes out of the way for cheap. Then you take a few basic computer science classes. Then in state tuition nearby for the last 2 years.Real computer science is hard and time consuming. If you can't handle that, you won't pass the interviews. WGU or any of the for profit trash does NOT prepare you to go to work or to PASS THE INTERVIEW.So basically there are 3 tiers of schoolsIvy league or equivalent. These will get you interviews you may not get else where. You have to pass the interview.All other not for profit colleges have similar material. Most of these will prepare you to pass the interviews.For profit trash that is useless diploma mill crap and you will fail the interviews.Bottom line: Do ivy league or do instate tuition. Id also argue that any other private college is a waste of money because its much more debt and won't prepare you for the interview. Id also argue that community college for first 2 years to save money is a good idea too. Most of the computer science classes will be at the regular college. You are basically saving money on required bullshit classes. Interviews are HARD and getting HARDER.",

        "body": "Okay so first I'll answer the general question, but then explain why this is less relevant for your specific case- Ivy League/high-prestige engineering schools- Specialty engineering schools (co-op programs, niche in-demand fields, etc)- the majority of schools (4-year mostly in person schools)- 100% online, shorter time period tracks, community college (for some employers)- non-accredited, non-standard degrees (e.g. I knew a private school that only did liberal arts degrees with \"focuses\") The perception of online schools is that they dont train you well for a work environment and they're easier to pass. This is about the same view as bootcamp-only people--its better than nothing, but it's just taken as nowhere near the same as the above.THAT SAID, for your specific case of already having a different degree **and teaching the subject**, I think WGU is a pretty good option. You already clearly have the interpersonal and project management skills needed to be functional in a workplace, and youre even more aligned since you have actually been doing some amount of programming already.I think you'll still struggle to get those first few jobs just because the career track is so railroaded towards the typical \"new grad with internships climbing up the ladder,\" but you absolutely can do it. I STRONGLY recommend freelancing to get your foot in the door, since it'll mean not needing to drop off of your teaching job. Tbh, if you can convince someone to let you build them a plugin for their website or make some open-source contributions, I think you could even end up with a \"typical eng job\" without a degree (though I don't recommend this).Anyways, my advice to you is1. Get the WGU degree2. While getting the degree, really really seek out a project or two from peers nearby. Maybe the school website could use some updating. Maybe your buddy wants clients to be able to schedule an appointment online rather than call him. These jobs will replace the typical \"internship\" experience companies want.3. Afterwards, seek out workplaces that can leverage your background. There is a TON of education tech being made by folk who have no idea what educators need.4. Be resilient. You're entering into a tumultuous field later than your competitors. There are going to be instances and people that make you feel small. Forget them, I really truly think youve got some great experience that'll be super rare and valuable for where you end up.You got this!",

If you can get it up and running and making a small profit, you can later stretch the dates on your resume and explain the gap away as wanting to pursue this idea. Then, you can talk about why you want to get back into the traditional work force from there. It would still be a tough sell, but at least there would be some chance. Otherwise, I’m not that sure there is any shot here with a 5 year gap :slightly_frowning_face:",

From what you wrote here, your project portfolio is probably terrible as it seems as though you don’t program often enough to finish projects . You also have a huge gap in your work history if you haven’t been doing anything tech related the past 5 years. Yeah the market is rough but from what I can tell that’s not the issue here; it’s more the fact that you, atm, are not a good candidate. People on this sub don’t recommend getting a masters if you have to pay out of pocket but in your case, since your dead in the water anyway, I would so you can apply for internships. The structure of learning and coding might help with the issues you’re having with producing code. It’s a bit of a gamble but it depends on if you really want it or not. If you can maybe even look for a job that will pay for the degree, I think Amazon has tuition reimbursement.",

They will lay you off with a two-sentence email or send you an auto-generated rejection, for instance. Just be aware that if you're being repped by a third-party recruiter for the opportunity you're declining, you're likely to get heavy pressure, potentially bordering on unprofessional, since they see their commission vanishing after getting you all the way to the finish line--but their opinion of you doesn't really matter.(A couple years ago, I had a third-party recruiter scream at me and cuss me out for backing out after the initial phone screen with the hiring manager; all because the recruiter didn't understand a condition that I gave him at the start and just reassured me that wouldn't happen [or he did understand and just lied to me, also a possibility]; I backed out because that condition did happen)",

Something to consider is why you chose one over the other. Was it purely money? If they really liked you, they may be willing to pay more. It's then your decision if that changes anything, if you want to notify the other company, etc. I would warn not to try extending it and make them keep bidding. That will get old quickly for them and may sour them on you. What you share really depends on why you chose one company over the other. You don't have to tell them anything, but it's good to keep the relationship professional, as you never know what can happen. There may be an opportunity to work for them again down the road.

The first 3 jobs within the first 5 years of my career made me feel so completely out of my depth (either cos the code base was so vast, or deliveries were too hurried, or me simply no understanding anything) that I used to break down into tears after some meetings. Sounds ridiculous writing that down.To this day its hard for me to describe what the hell I was feeling at the time. Why I felt so out of place. Why I felt like everyone looked down on me. I dont even know what I expected from myself to cause such a dissonance in contrast with the reality I was living. I still don't feel remotely competent in what I do. But I have never once been reprimanded for a weak performance.So after many years nd now over 30 I decided to no longer care. I have decided that until someone isn't pleased with what I do, i will embrace my mediocrity, embrace my stupidity, ask the stupid questions, learn to champion the colleagues that put in extra hours of work for fun (because they still live with their mums or girlfriends and have a very different time budget to their lives than me) to learn from them by proxy instead of feeling like I need to compete with them. This is how I'm surviving, because I learned that its in this mess that development happens. I am neither in social, embedded or health, so the stakes arent high anyway. This way I keep my sanity, my humility to keep learning from everything and everyone, and mental peace to grow outside of work and give my energy to my family.",

It doesn't help you in any ways (if you go the extreme route) and your boss might think you are worse than you are which can impact your end of year performance reviews. You have to at least show you are putting in a lot of the effort to catch up so your manager understands.>How do I stop feeling so dumb?Sponge up all the knowledge as much as possible. And emulate what your teammates are doing. Catch up ASAP.>How do I earn the respect of my coworkers?What I just said above + do your stuff well + make sure you are a team multiplier in some ways or another.>I also feel like an idiot sometimes in general because the product itself and the code is very complex. The product is for a niche field I’m not very familiar with.I know redditors hate to hear this but spend more hours (this means outside work hours) figuring out wtf is going on. And if there's little to no documentation on what you think is important knowledge, document it and share it to the team (this shows you are 'team multiplier' and will look good to your performance review). And if there's any documents regarding the product, just read through it even if you don't understand it multiple times here and there again and again (so your eyes at least get used to the technical jargon, etc).Type or screenshot everything in your note taking app or whatever per day. Every command you ran and so forth so you can look back. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I recommend it if you don't use a note taking app (it's very bare bones and light). And I have Calender plugin on it.If your company allows you to use AI on the codebase, abuse the heck out of AI and ask all sorts of questions on it.Schedule 1 on 1 meetings with your teammates and ask questions on topics you don't know much about. Don't schedule and just be like \"I don't know\". People don't like that. People like you put in SOME effort to try so show you put in the effort to try to make sense and are confused/lost. And screenshot every single step your teammate is doing so you don't forget or lose (so you can help organize later). Also, DM your teammates with help you need (do it to different team members a time so you don't overload one teammate). And make sure that DM (Slack setting or whatever is set to never delete). And again, screenshot/save any command, etc that comes out of it.Type more shit about your status and what you are doing in your team channel more. Last thing you want is to look invisible. Invisible == Looks like you aren't doing anything.I abuse the heck out of screenshotting in this field. Everything in every meeting when I see a screen is screenshot. I don't care how trivial. From the URL to what not I just screenshot.If this is in office, bribe your team members (and other close by office workers (from where you sit)) with occasional cookies/snacks or whatever. Look optimistic and happy and eager. It goes a long way and will help you with your performance reviews indirectly (welcome to life).Ah and the biggest thing. **When you are given a task, stop trying to focus on the task. Try to understand the bigger picture first (the REASON behind the task and so forth). Make sure you focus on that in 1on1 when asking your team members for help on a task.**If you focus on 'code logic' context, then you are f-ed. You need to focus on the business/overall reason for why this task was given. And from there form your own opinion and maybe you might come to conclusion \"why is this task needed?\" and so forth which you should be free to ask/voice out. That's critical thinking. That's what software engineering is.>I (26F) have been working at my job for exactly 1 year.Took me like over 4 years just to not feel this. And even then I always constantly worry I am not performing to my level. And I studied CS directly unlike you.Took me over 3 years alone to stop thinking in terms of 'code/task context' to the bigger picture. It's normal. Just put in the hours and your hours will not betray you in the longer run. Fortunately for me I was able to cover up for my incompetence in this side by being extremely proficient/fast at coding but if I didn't have that I probably was truly cooked.",

I don't think that says that much about you. And for that matter, often times, issues with deadlines is not an individual dev problem, but a management problem.> And more than once, I had to (not by my choice, but it did sort of help once) go on weekends to catch up.I know the pressure can be hard to avoid, don't work weekends. It's common that deadlines slip and stuff takes longer than expected. It shouldn't generally be a \"work extra\" thing, particularly not for no extra pay. From a practical standpoint, I understand it if your job is on the line (the economy and all), but resist the pressure under normal circumstances.Overall, sadly, intern positions on solo projects aren't that uncommon, yet are obviously bad for the intern. Mind you, you also don't fit the typical case of an intern, as you are actually a new grad. I think the biggest thing to get used to is the idea that it's okay for work to not be finished. You're not actually being paid by task. And yes, solo projects are strictly worse for a new person (or arguably any person) in pretty much every way (hard to get help, isolating, more likely to have incorrect estimates, etc). You'd probably have a better experience working on a project with an actual team, though I'm not sure how realistic of a possibility that is for you on the short term.",

But once you're burned out, that's it there's no going back. The most you can do now is manage what you can at work and take care of yourself better and hope you get better over time or if there's not much in your control then you probably need to leave the situation.The only other thing you can do is reexamine the situation to see if there's an end in sight.

But if it's not caused by a specific situation but rather the environment there may be no end in sight and spinning your wheels hoping it'll get better will just lead to worse burnout.To me it sounds like you're in a bad environment where they're trying to take advantage of a cheap intern. Internships in the dev industry are supposed to be intros to the company so that an intern can decide if they want to take a job there or not, or they might be part of getting college credit. Smart companies don't make long interns manage a whole giant project with moving parts and deadlines, that'd just be idiotic of them.

Let’s be realistic your internship isn’t being extended so you may as well try to control the personal damage as much as you can.",

I used to do interviews for a company, and they gave us zero visibility into what the candidate experience was. It was just \"here's a resume, interview this person, let us know what you think.\" No guidance, not much communication, etc. I've also worked at some companies where I did a pair interview with executives who would just say, \"I'll let you lead,\" because they didn't bother to look at the person's resume. We've also dealt with situations where online tests didn't work, or the prompts/questions were wrong.

You usually have to oversee other engineers. I’ve been there, have friends that were/are there and I have yet to find someone who enjoys it.Staff is a job role focused ONLY on tech. They’re usually responsible for defining the code patterns, general architecture of the whole company. Or making big decisions along with the PM. All of this without any worry of managing anyone or anything. A lot more fun to me.This is what I notice, but obviously it can be different from company to company. Don’t know about pay though.",

That’s still the main attraction for most prospective applicants. Money and stability. Also many pre health students are just ignorant to the job market realities of their discipline. Most of them ( Pre Pharmacy, dentistry, podiatry etc) assume their to be job market is as robust as their physician counterparts, which isn’t true. By the time they’re privy to the reality of said market, they’re in too deep. Jordan’s anecdote is the exception, not the rule.

When the feature needs to be \"done\" by tomorrow, is that code complete or feature complete? If it's code complete, I'd think you still need to leave time for testing and bug fixes before release.Also, where's your EM or Tech Lead in all of these convos? Finally, healthy friction between Product and Engineering is normal as you're working together from different angles to move the project forward.

But I know engineers making anywhere from 150 to 700k with 4-5 YOE. Yes, there are bonuses and the size depends on the firm. I think most firms are flat so your title won’t change much and salary progression is usually pretty meritocratic. As far as what you do, for most engineering positions it’s working on internal libraries, tooling, execution, order routing systems. My role involving pulling market data off co-located switches/servers, so I often felt like a network engineer. We also maintained all of our own servers, so a lot of the work is around maintaining / migrating those. Not a whole lot of cloud being used due to obvious reasons for HFT. Did I enjoy it? It’s a job. I loved being surrounded by the smartest working on hard problems in a competitive industry. I enjoyed having to think about computers at a low-level, digging into OS internals to write the fastest C++ code. But it’s not incredibly meaningful if that matters to you and I felt like my skills were becoming highly specialized—a good thing if you want to stay in trading your whole life, but the longer you stay the harder it may be to jump into a different space. For example, you won’t have any experience creating a product for real users. I do think most of these places offer some of the best jobs you can find that balance pay and work/life. Also, it being so specialized may help you avoid the layoffs that plague other tech jobs. It’s more like finance than tech in that way.",

The issue is newbies go for the one shot which is where all your problems get generated including increased token consumption from hunting down problems.But once people figure out how to divide up tasks into simple functions and stitching them then it becomes pretty good with a high success rate. Afterwards asking for basic architecture problems become the next step and so on. Right now there will be a lot of junk but we are still in the transition phase where everyone is still trying to just play around. When the min/max occurs then things REALLY change for better or worse. I use to think AI was dog shit but I keep reading how staff engineers love it and produce 5x work. After messing with Claude code specifically  VS older gens of gpt which hallucinated constantly, my opinion did a 180. Not saying you are part of the group. But this subreddit clearly hasn't used the right Ai tooling or their codebase/workflow is highly niche. Otherwise a lot of swe general development is handled very nicely by Claude.",

Excellent WLB.It took me 3 tries before I felt comfy. Then I began rock climbing, backpacking, and shredding powder on my evenings and weekends, all while making cool stuff with cool people 8:30-5pm (beers at 4pm on friday)I'm still there now, 10 years later, making 130k now.I could have chased the money, and I could be making 200k right now, but I opted for happiness. Even now, I'll casually interview for places. But ultimately I don't put my heart in those interviews, because I am happy now.Also I have a toddler and am expecting twins now lol so I really don't want to risk any instability......In any case. people cancel after accepting jobs all the time. But do know, that you essentially break all ties then.Hopefully this helps.Anyways here's my advice:Accept it, continue interviewing, and then decide if you want to burn bridges at first place or not. I wouldn't renegotiate though.",

The main difference from devs is that you’ll probably be located where the client is and you’ll be working on software solutions specific to the client.For other companies like PWC it’s closer to consulting/sales.

For Forward Deployed Engineers, I've seen the range of:* A post-sales position, helping implementation. They usually want people with a variety of technical skills, as each client will have different needs. It's a mix of a technical consulting role and integration engineer. A lot depends on your company, and what kind of product they are selling.* I've seen some sales engineer roles just shift the title to copy Palantir and sound more hip.* Some solution architects, who are just kind of glorified technical sales positions, trying to get more work out of a client.I think you need to get clarification from any company you're interviewing with what they actually expect from people in the role. Ideally, you'd speak to/interview with people in the actual role and ask what type of work they've been doing. I'd personally be open to the first, although having gotten out of consulting, I don't think I'd want to go back. The latter two would hold no interest for me. It's like how some Engineering Managers are pure people managers, and other still write code some percentage of time.To clarify with \"technical consulting,\" I've seen some people who actually write code and have deliverables. And then there are people who are purely in an advisory position. Again, you need to find out what the specific company is looking for. It will vary.",

If you come out the other side and all you can offer is a few more years of Python, there's already a crowded market for that. You can market yourself better by learning and understanding the business processes. You can market yourself very by learning and understanding complex systems and infrastructure. I met and worked with this guy a few months after he got out of school. Nice guy, friendly, and solid technical skills, but didn't seem impressive. He switched teams every few years, learned tons of stuff, refined his leadership skills, and 10 years later, he's out doing tech presentations for the firm. And he was really good at it. A couple years later, he left for Google.Some places are toxic and end up being exercises in futility. But most aren't. It's what you can make out of it.",

A good next step is to take on small leadership tasks where you are, mentoring, running meetings, owning a project end to end. That will tell you a lot before making a big jump.",

Get familiar with those.Chances are, you're spiraling from worrying about some vast surface area of unknowns when you come across a new challenge, instead of just focusing on the one thing in front of you. The reality is you will never be able to tackle that vast surface of unknowns, the field is just too large, and you need to be able to recognize that never knowing everything and making incremental progress over a long stretch of time is normal for everyone.For tech projects specifically, the tool you probably want is called a work breakdown structure (WBS). The idea is take the nebulous scary thing and break it into smaller pieces, rinse and repeat until things start to look more concrete. E.g. for a webdev project, maybe there's frontend and backend, and then maybe in the frontend there's pages, and each page has components, and so on, down the rabbit hole you go, until you've got a list of concrete tasks that can be unambiguously be marked as done or not done.If you can't tame your panic attacks, then the pragmatic option is stick with your non tech job. Not everyone works jobs they love.",
