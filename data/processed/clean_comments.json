Once you hit a certain scale, a lot of the “work” becomes coordination, approvals, and moving changes safely through environments rather than writing code.

Insurance is especially heavy on this. Some teams do manage to streamline it with better self-service, platform teams, or looser controls in non-prod, but 60 to 70% overhead isn’t unusual.

Before AI was being used widely it was ghost interviewers and people whispering answers or at least typing answers in a screen the interviewee could read. I've had catfishers interview then a different person onboards. It happens, we just need to be better at detecting and stopping it. There will always be people who lie their way into jobs though. Just last week I interviewed a guy who seemed to be using AI to craft his answers. Although some answers were obviously not scripted, and he seemed to know what he was talking about, he still seemed like he was using an AI interview tool. After talking to some of the recruiters familiar with his region of the world it was apparent that this was VERY common and candidates felt they had to do it to stay competitive. We had a follow-up interview where we told him that we all use AI tools in out jobs and that we can't fault anyone for using them, but we wanted to hear his answers unassisted. We made it clear that it was OK to say \"I don't know\" or \"I don't understand the question\". The interview went much better. There was some language barrier and he didn't understand all the questions as asked, but when clarified he was fine and gave good answers. When he didn't know something he said so. It turns out his resume was real, he did know what he was talking about. I think going forward we will address the use of AI, let them know it's ok for some aspects of their job and even for helping them interview. We also need to get good at asking the right questions. Not to \"trick\" the AI, or to somehow catch them in a lie, but to help us understand if they have the basic knowledge we're looking for.",

Modeling will make you ship faster with AI-assisted coding. It's also important for certain hyped features such as text-to-SQL. Unless the LLM bubbles burst (meaning it would be prohibitively expensive to use), LLMs will be come one of the main data (model) consumers.As for your question: do proper data models and then code with Cursor or Claude Code. It will be much faster than you hand writing transformation code.",

I know engineers that have been working longer than me that don’t have a clue about data modeling, because they always just try to brute force whatever’s needed to get to a flat table. In terms of getting experience, find an actual project you want to work on. Make a Pokédex or work with data from sports or games you like, it doesn’t matter. Important thing is that you try to apply those concepts to an actual problem you want to solve, and more importantly, actually follow the guidance documentation that’s out there. One of the big steps people miss is the conceptual modeling stage, whether that’s an enterprise bus matrix/business event matrix, etc. If you don’t define what you’re trying to do and how you expect everything to tie together conceptually first, then it’s unlikely you’ll have thought through everything you should be.",

A good answer in interviews is often explaining how the two map to the same execution engine and when you would prefer one for readability or maintainability.

Other types of certs, like a python/sql/etc cert or a generic data engineering cert, or even a boot camp mean next to nothing. You should have a portfolio or be able to walk through some project details to demonstrate the higher level knowledge that would be covered by those certs. For me personally, I would pursue a cert as a means to learn something new and to be able to brag about it online afterwards:squinting_face_with_tongue: kinda kidding. As an example, I’m using Fabric for the first time and would consider the cert as a way to guide and test my learning. I’d put it on my resume to validate that I can use the platform. But if I’m learning something like data modeling, I will probably try to find a toy project to add to my portfolio instead of a cert. If I saw a candidate with a data modeling cert, they better be able to back it up with some hands on experience otherwise it’s meaningless by itself.",

Instead .replace operations you use assignement. Strings and datetime gets some changes as well as categorical types. Some changes with pd.read_excel as well. Slicing and a lot of your operations need to be explicit now instead of implicit. Whats going to bite you the most is numpy rather than pandas here.Second Answer:Use polars + pandas, especially once you get everything setup in arrow types, its a seamless transfer of the dfs; while working with my team I use polars for the heavy stuff like merges, concats and stuff. ANd pandas for anything that needs to be verbose and redeable, like mathemtical operations or column based functions. Polars sucks at the whole thing because their approach of map_elements is inconsistent and expects something everytime. Polars also breaks their apis and their intended behavior quite a lot.Just 1.0 to 3.0 from numpy to arrow should be about 4x boost in perf, polars + pandas can be 5-20x and pure polars can be 10-30x.The main thing I love about polars are sinks and lazyframes. And the streaming engine, I had some pandas code which took 64gb of ram, mixed it with some polars and sink and now its down to 10gb of ram",

Once you have an initial chunk of code that does what you want, parameterise it and stick it in a function. Then write some tests for it, ideally. A parameterised notebook is not all that different from a very lengthy function. You just want to separate the code in your notebook into functions so that each function is doing a single thing and returning/producing a single thing.It will be slower at first because you're rewiring your brain to use a new process and interface, but you'll get faster and the benefits can be great if you're doing anything that's a deliverable and you want some quality assurance.

And your choice ussually boils down to are we already running a spark cluster or a kafka cluster.I have much more experience with Kafka Connect and sure it has it's pain points but it is the best in class solution for real-time data at scale. Although i will add Red Panda is an increasing an option that I would keep on the table.The problem with the managed solution is they become expensive and slow if you are working with any volume of data or any high update frequency. If you have small data or don't have real-time requirements the managed solution are all great. Currently we run Kafka connect and Open Source Airbyte. We are slowly moving away from Airbyte, but it works great for all of our small tables that need to be updated ever 15 minutes or less.",

I've built houses, boxes, fences and doors. I know how to frame, tile roof, and even straighten a car bumper with it. What tool should I learn next? Im eyeing a skilsaw, nail gun, and even power drill.\"Instead, focus on the meta. That is: engineering for solving business problems. The tool you use to build systems doesnt matter as much as successful execution and bringing value to the business. Can you model processes? If someone gave you a process model, can you translate that into technological implementation? Can you translate a process model into a data model?If you wanna get better at python, do leetcode exercises and learn data structures and algorithms. By accident, you will learn how to program in general— in any language. The real value is in learn how to think abstractly and creating an algorithm that will solve the business need efficiently and correctly. The brand of language or server is a political opinion or strategic decision (eg: python has the best tooling for DS).If you want to learn system design, build a python app from zero, no framework. It'll teach you how to organize code, how to build mental models around your code, separation of concerns, IO, dataflow, system orchestration, deployments, etc. Learn what tools exist within your ecosystem of choice. This will give you what you need to think abstractly— macro decision making, not micro. Focus on big picture like a tech lead (not like a CEO or CTO, thats too big picture).You know how to use a hammer very well already. Time to become an architect, too.",

My path away from Microsoft started with an EdX free course on learning Linux. I learned that Shell scripting could do way more than I had realised. Powershell was in its early years so this increased my interest in Powershell too.Because of the deadly duos rabid hatred of Microsoft I had to learn a lot in a short space of time on an alien OS and with a lot of alien tech. One of the system admits taught me some basic Docker skills. This let me build a small set of images for the tech we were migrating to. As a Dockerfile is a very small I could reproduce it at home to build the images I wanted.I'd say basic Docker skills are essential even if all you do is build your own learning labs. Look for courses by Nigel Poulton.For Python, make sure you get comfortable with virtual environments. Again, ring fenced learning but you will need this in a Python environment.Learn about PyTest and Behave for testing your Python code. There are some specific data testing libraries out there. Once you build learning labs and are comfortable with testing approaches, life becomes a lot easier.I built an ETL framework using an early version of Spark. It was effective, what the CTO insisted on, but was overkill for the barely TB data we had at the time. I'm amazed its so widely used given that few companies genuinely have Big Data problems. Databricks has Spark at its heart.Learn for the job you want and to keep the job you have.",

The first 6 months I couldn't really do much because of how much I had to learn, it gets better afterwards!",

What you’re feeling is pretty normal because DE has a huge surface area, and learning it feels endless at first. Every topic opens three more doors. The trick is not trying to learn “everything.” You don’t need mastery of every tool you need a solid mental model of how data flows end to end. Once that clicks, new tech becomes variations on the same ideas, not brand new worlds. Your PM/BA background is actually a plus. Understanding requirements, tradeoffs, and why pipelines exist is something a lot of younger DEs struggle with. Focus on building a couple of boring, real pipelines and ignore the noise. Feeling overwhelmed doesn’t mean you’re behind it usually means you’re learning the right things",

Penn State Uni has one of the best program in the states. I heard their GIS program is also top notch. Doing generic IS/IM degrees won't add any value in the future.",

IMO whenever you’re job searching you really need to have your resume(s) pointed towards what you want to work with. Most companies have only a few tools for data engineering, orchestration layer and logic layer. Airflow and databricks for example. Pick a cloud provider, orchestration tool, data lakehouse/warehouse platform and start doing little projects. Like airflow orchestrates databricks notebook that pulls a dataset from azure datalake storage and then run a databricks notebook to convert the file to a delta table. Or durable function pulls API data and writes to bronze layer of databricks. You can pick whatever tech you decide I just mentioned those because it’s the route I decided to go down but I also incorporated snowflake just for a more overarching reach. Python can be learned along the way but it seems a little aimless to just sit down and “learn Python” for something that is as specific as data.engineering",

But one thing I know for sure is we’re both incredibly underpaid and our only solution is to find new jobs. It would be kind of a waste if you switched career paths instead of leveraging the skills you’ve developed to increase your pay.",

Converting SAS to Databricks can be really complex or it can be rote work assigned to any warm body. With 2 years of experience, you should be able to pass DE interviews that would double your income. If you can't pass interviews, then either you need to improve your general interview skills or work on skill gaps.",

Id honestly aim for job postings with anything to do with Databricks.But yeah good luck. I havent looked too hard but I assume most postings have been for senior or staff roles.",

The major warehouses are shipping with CDC tools to replicate data from your Postgres/MySQL/etc so that you don't have to build that anymore. And more and more SaaS vendors will export data directly to your warehouse, so that you don't really have to build those either. AI will be able to do a lot in terms of glueing that together. Where I think data engineers will spend much more of their time in the future is on something much more valuable, actually building data products (internal and external) that derive value from the data. Every org I've worked at wants to be data driven, but the people in the business domains have really weak \"data reasoning skills\". I don't think AI fixes that because it won't help you if you don't know the right questions to ask. So my bet is that you'll have data engineers/scientists/analysts converging more and more into a role where they need to bridge that gap to make all this data we've collected valuable.",

What people call “AI engineering” today is mostly solid software + data engineering with AI components layered in (APIs, embeddings, pipelines, infra).In production, the value isn’t knowing a model, it’s building reliable systems around it. The fundamentals still matter. The buzzword won’t outlive them.",

They isolate DAGs per batch, manage lineage, and prevent silent exits due to metadata growth. If you stick with batch loops, you need a mechanism to restart the Spark context periodically and checkpoint and clear lineage aggressively, but that is more fragile. Tools like dataflint can also help flag where your plan or metadata is growing across iterations so you can catch it before it silently exits. Structured streaming gives predictable long running behavior and scales better on YARN for production workloads.",

Unless it's highly critical and you are allowed to maintain a live copy of production in test environment, the test data is inevitably less complete. The smart and efficient solution is to have a proper analysis of the different cases existing in production, and use them to build your test data, ideally by the upstream team that is responsible for this data. Consider that it cannot be complete, try to make it good enough. Don't think you can predict all future use cases, the solution for those is proper error logging, monitoring and alerting, so you can react fast when they will happen.> In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing.Teams should be free to have their team-only development environment were they can break everything, but there should be another test environment that is relatively stable to allow downstream usage of data like you need. I think you need to talk about having such a stable test environment with the engineering management, in my experience it was mostly called \"staging\". It's not supposed to be a copy of \"production\", and it's better if it is not for information security, but it should be a good simulation of production cases to test the code edge cases (as I described above).In our case, our dev environment is our local laptops. We have hand crafted test files crafted to represent the different cases, and we are able to run full flows locally with either our tools running locally or mocking. Local allows to iterate much faster than if you have to deploy and rely on non-local tools. The unit tests and full flow tests are automated to be able to run in CICD or on request on PRs if they are too slow for systematic run. Then there is the company's staging environment that is fed by upstream teams with simulated data representative of production, and the same code and tools as production. There we can run our code in the same tool environment as production. > Upstream tables aren’t versionedWhat does this mean? If the code that creates/alter these tables is not versioned, that's pretty bad. The process needs to go through a proper CICD. Or do you mean there's no number you can track to know if the table schema changed?> schema changes aren’t always communicated. When that happens, our pipelines either silently miss new fields or break outright. Is this common? What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?Upstream table changes need to be communicated. This is not negotiable for platform stability and needs to be taken to engineering management. They need to establish a proper channel, for example: ticket (with PR links), documentation page, announcement in dedicated channel, regular meetings to plan changes and exceptional meetings for emergencies. A team should only be allowed to deploy such change once the communication process has been respected and the reception by downstream teams has been confirmed. This also means the upstream team is responsible for updating staging so it matches the change and you can properly test it in staging.",

There are some rare scenarios where it doesn't happen all the time - like the upstream system *never* changes, or is run by the exact same team doing the ETL work. But in almost all other cases it's a complete mess.Plus there's other bad cases like where the upstream system adds a new column, you're using a solution that provides some schema evolution capabilities like Fivetran, so your ETL process just silently ingests the new column - but that new column isn't actually used by anything - and it now has 50% of your costs allocated to it from a different column everyone is using.> What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?Data contracts & publishing domain objects: * Upstream system publishes a \"domain object\" any time any field within the domain changes. A domain is a higher-level abstraction like user, customer, invoice, supplier, etc. And the domain object is typically a denormalized collection of related info. * The domain object could be published to a messaging system, which could get ingested directly, or simply redirect messages into a file on say s3. Or maybe the upstream system just writes all pending domain objects to s3 every 5-15 minutes. * And the domain object is locked down with a data contract. This contract is kept in version control, and both the source & target teams can use it to validate all data being sent & received. I prefer jsonschema for this, and use it to identify columns, their types, as well as info like min/max values, min/max string length, null rules, enumerated values, regex formats, etc, etc, etc.",

Are you querying a subset of staging and/or production data (possibly sanitized) to cover edge cases, or is it a fully manufactured dev dataset/table that you run queries against?It's a small file included in the Git repo, something like 3 to 10 records. We use either JSON (easy to edit manually) or AVRO (Kafka source), depending on the source of the flow we are testing. If the test flow's source is a table, the source file is turned into the table format we use first by the test logic. Usually, data comes from staging since we already have representative but fake data there that is safe to keep in Git. It is potentially manually modified to add some cases that we need to test.> Also, just to confirm my understanding around environments: staging is what you always reference in test (and possibly dev, depending on your answer above), correct? 1. When a team member submits a PR, it is required for them to prove that their change works in staging, typically sharing a successful flow run with the different run modes (normal scheduled run, backfill, or whatever specific parameter). That's really the minimum that should be expected for any change affecting flows. 2. For any function that does not rely on integration with external tools, we require the very classic unit tests. Those take a few ms each, so they are always triggered in our CI tool whenever a commit is pushed.3. A bit more recently, we have been adding \"local flow tests\" that can be run locally on our laptop and in the CI tool. This means we can validate that the flow logic works locally, and we are able to use a local debugger, which is pretty amazing for ETL work. We can also run it on request with a comment during the PR review; the results are written in the commit status on Github. We don't run those automatically at every commit push because they have quite some overhead to set up a local flow environment (especially Spark's overhead); they take something like 30 to 90 s for each flow. This was a lot of work to create, but it is now extremely valuable. > If that’s the case, then in theory our “test” environment should fail, and alert us, whenever there’s a schema change that isn’t properly communicated. Is that the right way to think about it?For the tests to fail due to a schema change, the test data needs to have changed accordingly. For local tests, your team controls the test data, so it cannot have changed if you didn't know. Where it should fail is during the staging run, if the upstream team has correctly updated the data they are responsible for in staging and actually ran their change in staging. So, it still relies on the upstream team doing its job properly, which requires engineering management to enforce it if they are not doing it by themselves.If it failed in staging, you can check how the data changed and modify your local test data to cover the new situation. But, you shouldn't have to find it by yourself like this; the chances to miss the changes even if it is in staging are still too high, for example, if it only affects a small subset of records.So again, the most important solution is that there should be a mandatory communication channel for them to announce the change and collect the confirmation of the downstream teams. At minimum, something like a Slack message where downstream teams are pinged. With this information you can at minimum make sure your staging run goes through the change. If you have a local test, you can then directly modify your local test data and comfortably check on your laptop with a debugger what the consequence is for your flow. Ideally, there is the data contract system mentioned by others. Every schema is versioned in Git; it serves as the reference for every dependent project, and any change needs to be approved by the downstream teams in the PR. But I think very few companies have this level of maturity; even in my current company, where it is already very high considering the quality of testing I have described above, it is only partially implemented.> - Upstream Staging -> Our Dev/Test> - Upstream Prod -> Our ProdThe staging environment is supposed to be shared by all teams that have dependencies, so the integration of the different projects can be tested just like in production, except the data is a simulation. The only difference in terms of code is that staging may have the newer version of the code that is being tested. So it should be like this:- Staging environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects- Production environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projectsLocal testing is a separate environment that is defined in your Git repositories, so you wouldn't expect the upstream team to modify it, just like you wouldn't expect them to change the code you own. - Local test environment (only your teams): your test data (possibly based on staging upstream data) -> Your project -> your data- Staging environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects- Production environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projectsYour company could have another shared testing environment before staging. I can imagine a \"testing\" environment being for unstable testing; expect things to break regularly because teams will test early versions, and \"staging\" for stable testing; things should not break too much so you can test in production-like conditions. In our case, our local/staging/production is covering what we need, so I wouldn't see the point of having a 4th environment.",

ETL Pipeline: Ingest data from public APIs (maybe weather, finance, or social media), clean and transform it, and store it in a cloud database. Visualize results or build a simple dashboard to display insights.2. Data Warehouse Project: Set up a mini data warehouse using open source tools (like PostgreSQL, DuckDB, or even cloud warehouses if allowed by your school). Populate it with multiple sources and practice schema design, partitioning, and basic analytics queries.3. Batch vs Stream: Compare batch ETL (e.g., with Airflow or Prefect) and simple streaming (Kafka or just a basic pub/sub) on a dataset. Even if you use sample scripts, explaining the trade-offs is valuable.4. End-to-End Analytics: Choose a topic (like campus resource usage or student performance if you can get anonymized data), gather, clean, and enrich the data, and display it in a lightweight front-end. This gives you a taste of the full stack.Don’t worry about building something massive; depth of understanding matters more than shiny complexity. If your team isn’t super technical, you might look into tools that let you build simple frontends for your data without writing a whole web app from scratch; it’s a nice touch to showcase your processed data to non-technical folks.Best of luck on your capstone!",

Add some basic data quality checks and maybe a simple dashboard or query layer on top so people can actually use it.

Adding another data platform sounds like the easy fix but it by far is not. There is so much overhead (DR, maintenance, increased complexity, etc.) having to manage multiple platforms that would be better served by just setting up one platform that has the right controls in place.",

For example, when just writing to a database and you KNOW you’re using a PostgreSQL database, it might be better to use psycopg2 directly instead of calling SQLAlchemy so you have more direct access instead of going through an intermediary. You might also consider adding in some basic orchestration to this project just to demonstrate you’re able and to understand how orchestration is handled. I would also look into how you would want to transform the data. I always recommend Polars over Pandas if you’re going with Python.

I've personally used python but mainly just to grab data from an API and store it in a database. I'm comfortable putting whatever python script together but would need Google until i worked with it enough. I did manage an AWS account but mainly used it like on prem, RDS, S3, glue but wanted to focus more on the data instead of solution architecting. Now they've almost combined the roles from what I see. I felt like I didn't understand the new data model because I was pushed to NOT use facts/dimensions, basically just create a bunch of clean datasets. My current position didn't help with this either because my boss had the debate with the consultants and he basically told them to screw off and we got offshored instead of getting trained. Do you think this is too much of an uphill battle? Do you think I could take a databricks course and bridge this gap? Should I think about sliding back into BI work and take a power BI class?

Don't overcomplicate cloud. It's nice to know Python well when you write more complex code and libraries, but at the of the day if you're familiar with syntax, pure data engineering PySpark API does not differ much from how you think in SQL. At I can hear you know Python good enough to start working with it. If you like Data Engineering - go for it. Learn Databricks, play around and you should be fine. If you got options to work with cloud in current role, by any means do it. Google a lot, understand what's under the hood and don't be afraid of it. Just make sure to not run any cross-joins or other stuff that can skyrocket costs (but these are usually equally inefficient in on-prem and cloud).",

Viewers are typically high level execs. You can make the UI very friendly to non-tech people but my org didn’t get there. The primary use case was to write back to Snowflake, but we found out after some trial and error that the “write-back” was actually writing back to a view instead, which makes sense since the data / columns in Sigma could change pretty quickly, it just wasn’t super clear at first.I don’t think there is an AI agent, the agents we interfaced with were real people.

If you know it great, otherwise learn it. Im migrating people from oracle to Databricks and git / branching is a big big change for them.I am a DE for about 10 years now.  I only know Azure.

For actual looping use either (1) do the loop in a driver notebook or (2) keep ADF as the orchestrator and just trigger Databricks jobs. So no, you don’t have to write everything in notebooks, but the foreach part is usually code or external orchestration.If you redesign, the main win is fewer tiny jobs and fewer cluster spin-ups. One job run that reads the control table and processes a batch is usually cheaper and faster than 200 little runs. Also, if you are ingesting lots of files, people often go auto loader or DLT to cut orchestration overhead.Also lol at being told six hours ago, classic.",

I whipped up a quick POC and established a similar architecture as mentioned in 1)One Orchestration Notebook and a child folder in the same directory which has the child notebooks. Orchestration gets the metaData from DB and does a foreach on the dataSet to call relevant notebooks to pull/stage/replenish/stamp watermarks respectively.Wrote couple of functions runOnServerless, runOnCluster to accordingly run a certain notebook on relevant compute. I should build a utility so it can be used for other implementations as well.Each notebook does a notebook.exit on success or failure and returns a json with relevant pieces of information for audit and easier debugging.From a cost perspective, the batch approach (which I am using right now) should be cheaper than DLT or Autoloader, right ? I am right now going through the DLT and autoloader documentation to see how these can be used to ease up migration.Again, really appreciate taking time out to share your experience.",

Athena adds another engine, catalog, and permission model to maintain. So yes landing the data first and querying it later is usually the cleaner pattern.

Think of Lakehouse as the overall architecture, data lake + warehouse behavior on top of Delta tables (not a traditional warehouse, but it fills that role). Lakebase is newer and more OLTP oriented. It’s meant for serving low-latency app workloads while still integrating with the lakehouse for analytics. You dont need it for most DE use cases unless you’re mixing transactional apps and analytics tightly. Lakeflow is basically Databricks opinionated pipeline layer. It wraps ingestion, transformations, orchestration, and governance together (Delta Live Tables, auto ingest, quality checks, lineage). It’s not a new storage layer, it’s about how data moves and is managed. Rough mental model would go like this, Lakehouse = where data lives Lakeflow = how data gets there (and stays clean) Lakebase = optional transactional sidecar Once you see it that way, the pieces line up a bit better",

I basically have to join together a dozen or so of these views to actually create a base table that is in the format our clients need. After the first \\~12 or so queries run to create that base table, the subsequent queries are a mix of special transactional financial tables or views that are filtered for specific clients.I drop and reinsert to just get the latest version of the data. Since most of the tables are not transactional, I have to query at midnight because insurance reports have to be as of the end of the previous day. I did not learn SQL until 2021 so being self-taught and not having any other data colleagues, thats what I did based on my research but I am sure there are better ways to just create a table once and overwrite it rather than dropping/reinserting. I initially did this in SSMS Agent Jobs but a few months ago I had issues with it running so I decided to trigger these SQL scripts using a Python script.All of my end reports in Excel and Power BI are tied to these SQL tables and views. I basically just refresh queries tied to the SQL database in Excel & Power BI so that all of the heavy lifting is done by SQL instead of Power Query or VBA. Basically we have a bunch of Excel reports with queries in them in OneDrive, some of which are shared and some of which I have to email out. I don't know much about cloud environments so thanks for the recommendations.

I do back these scripts up in OneDrive and GitHub so I can restore to previous versions if needed but the only tables that I keep permanently are two master tables that get appended monthly with the newest version of the data as of the end of the month.I just review the run log daily and if it ran in the approximate normal amount of time and all of my data quality checks are good then I do not look to performance tune anything.",

From there you also need to export each referenced job, crawler, and trigger using `GetJob`, `GetCrawler`, and `GetTrigger`. In the target account, you recreate the workflow with `CreateWorkflow`, then recreate jobs, crawlers, and triggers so the DAG lines back up. This works well for a one-time move, but you still have to fix account specific things like IAM role ARNs, KMS keys, S3 bucket names, connections, and any hard coded account IDs in job arguments.The cleaner long-term approach is to turn the workflow into infrastructure as code. Glue workflows and triggers are supported in both CloudFormation and Terraform. Once modeled, you can deploy the same definition to another account with only variable changes for account specific resources. This avoids ever doing a manual rebuild again and is what most teams settle on after the first migration.In practice, if this is a one-off accident recovery, scripting against the Glue APIs is usually fastest. If you expect multiple environments or future moves, converting the workflow to CloudFormation or Terraform is the better investment.",

You are right that this is a way to become senior - I'm quite good at this - but I am really very bad at standing up a new system from scratch. I'm way too far down the spectrum of pragmatism (do whatever works and move on to the next thing), way too focused on using stuff that already exists (libraries and tools), way too risk-averse. And way too slow. A typical day for me changes one or a few lines of code. I understand the implications of the change deeply,  but when there's a file header that needs a thousand lines of new code added from scratch, I'm not your guy. I never was, never needed to be.",

Not just bubble sort, but how to balance a binary search tree, skip lists, sorting algorithms. You need to know how to implement these, what the pros and cons of each algorithm are, etc. you should know the difference between a breath first search in a graph and Djikstra’s when doing a shortest path. And on and on.This requires putting in time. Lots of it.Your post seems to imply that you’re just going in with little to no practice. That’s not going to work in today’s market. The competition is fierce. Especially for the higher paying jobs. I’ve worked at and/or been offered a job at Microsoft, meta, Amazon, Google, Netflix, several hedge funds, etc.I put hundreds of hours into practice and training. I’m older and was out of college for a while and got rusty. There was no other way than to put the time in to build my skills back up. In addition to developer skills, interviewing itself takes a lot of practice. Learning how to answer systems question and the soft skills that require you to have your stories straight also takes a lot of practice.

But it's not telling me that you understand CS fundamentals, how hardware operates, mainly CPU and memory. By doing algorithms, not only are they testing your CS knowledge, but also the depth of your thinking and planning, if you only think in terms of solving a problem, but not about efficiency of the solution - that's a problem.Algorithms mainly test your understanding of cache, which is low level programming. Data packing, paddings, cache line size, they make you think in how much work does a CPU have to do, in order to solve a real world problem, instead of just - I follow tutorial X to make Y therefore I know how to code. There's a lot of code monkeys around who know 15 different frameworks and libs and believe they're great engineers but they don't have a senior understanding of how computer actually works. I don't even think that you should care about the code editor, or even write the correct synthax, that doesn't show you're a good programmer. You could open a notepad and start coding in an arbitrary language, nobody gives a damn about a language, you and me could write a new programming language tommorow, languages and frameworks change over time, to me personally it doesn't matter. But what matters is what does a candidate **think** about, when solving a problem, what **concerns** do they have. Because that will tell me more about themselves than any learned framework or library or programming language they know. Any programmer can answer almost any **how**, because there's a billion resources out there, but very few can answer **why**",

Almost every interview now requires very deep knowledge across many technologies, some ask for “LeetCode” stats and want to see code for projects you’ve been working on, or they’ll make you code on the spot, and unless you’ve been doing this for years, you’re going to get absolutely dunked on. I’m still hanging on by a thread where I currently work, but they’ve cut down our department by at least 70% and we no longer hire juniors for any position (not something I agree with, but just the reality, at least where I work).Furthermore, since there have been so many layoffs that means competition for positions is incredibly high, so you’re going to compete against people like me who are industry vets, as well as younger people with advanced degrees, etc.It might be worth diving into if it’s something you’re truly interested in, and hell, maybe it will end up working out for you, but I’d definitely have a backup plan.I wish you luck no matter what you choose,",

It's also in literature, called \"writer's/author's block\"> like i want to make a simple budget app. i know it needs to track expenses, show totals, maybe some charts. but where do i even start? database first? ui first? do i need a framework?Neither point is the actual starting point.The actual starting point is to prepare a *\"Functional Design Specification (FDS)\"* document. Write everything that you want the program to do down. Specify it. Every feature, every function. First, in a coarse overview and then flesh out each feature/function in detail.This document is the base for your programming. Everything in there is what you need to do. Not more, not less. If you have an idea to extend it, *append* it to the document, but do not yet even think about implementing it. Get the basic functionality working first. All that you append is \"optional\".The key to everything is the FDS. The more time and consideration you spend on it, the better you plan, the easier it will become to implement.Vague specifications help nobody and lead only to the block you describe.> someone suggested tools that help you plan before coding. tried verdent and a few others.Dedicated tools are not necessary. A simple text editor, or a proper text processor (like Word, Libre/OpenOffice Write, Google Documents) are all you need to get started. Don't overthink the tooling here. The more specialized a tool is, the more time you have to spend *learning* it, the less you can focus on the actual *content*. Simpler is better in that case.> theres so many decisions before you write a single lineAnd this is exactly what is necessary. The better you plan, the better your outcome.*Code* is the unimportant part of programming. It's only a necessary evil that we need to tell the computer what we want it to do. The *planning*, the *decisions*, the *considerations* are what really count.*Code* can be implemented by every \"code monkey\", but *planning* is what makes a *software engineer/designer*.I can give a well prepared FDS to somebody who can write code, but doesn't understand anything about the type of software I want to make and they will be able to program it.Yet, there isn't a detailed FDS, even the best programmer will be completely lost.-----Where you actually start, at the database, at the main functionality, is a different matter and often preference.I like to start with the database so that I have my fundamental construct.Then, I work on the main entry point of the program - this is the very first actual *code* that I write - it's sort of the \"ice breaker\".The biggest hurdle is always the first line, the first few statements. After that, the flow becomes natural. Yet, of course, this requires experience, and it will get easier with gained experience.----As always with similar posts, some books to consider:+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold",

You already made a partial \"list\" in your post. And then implement these one by one. Does not matter if you make a UI first, a database first or a backend/API first. Then it is just however you test that the thing works, it differs. With database you have to use SQL queries. With API you have to use REST calls (unless you use something other besides REST). etc. The order does not matter in your case.Yes, there is a system design and architecture and such in real life projects and some things do have an order, but you are just figuring out how to implement a thing and how a stuff works. Do not consider how the things are done in the real life. Before you haven't made a working app.And yes, there are many decisions before you write a single line. The same way there are many decisions before you lay the first brick when building a house. You can't just lay bricks anywhere you want or however you want. Software development has a planning phase. But this is where the splitting it all into pieces and putting into a list comes in. Why I mentioned it in my first paragraph. Create a list of achievable micro-goals and start implementing these one by one. Your app is an \"app\" (e.g. a mobile app)? Cool. Pick some totally random tutorial for getting the most barebones mobile app up and running. If it is not an \"app\" as a mobile app but a web application then pick a simple \"Hello world\" web application tutorial, to get it to return \"Hello world\" when run. If your application has a graphical side then get whichever \"canvas\" type working first. And then just add features on that canvas.",

Others have suggested specific design document formats but I think the most important thing is to have something you can use to guide your programming. It should be detailed and specific enough that you could hand it to an experienced programmer and they’d have enough information to start implementing.I’d also suggest having a concept of an “MVP”, or “minimum viable product”. What’s the absolute minimum set of features that constitute a version of the idea that you’d be happy with? Start with that, add the rest of your ideas afterwards.I personally find that it’s easiest to start with something that I can actually see working, so for example in your budgeting app you can start with a page that displays your budget overview. Where does the budget information come from? Don’t worry about that yet, just add some hard-coded numbers. Once you’ve done that pick a number that you want to be “real” and build that, hooking it up to the UI. Now you have one real field and a bunch of fake ones. Pick another field to actually implement.

The other day I was coding a game and about halfway through I realised that the graphics library I was using was too slow for the game I was making. I had to swap to a different library and luckily (this time!) my code did not contain many assumptions about how the graphics work, so the swap was relatively pain free. **Write down sentences that are simple statements about the process you are trying to automate:** E.g.: * The app tells me how much money I have left. * I enter something I have bought.* I enter something I wish to buy.* What I have bought has a name and a price.You can think of these as questions you need to answer. If you were the budget planner for a large organisation, there would be questions people would continuously ask you. If you wrote those down and for every question you wrote down how come you know the answers, you would have the beginnings of a system.Real processes used by real people can tell you a lot about what your app must be able to handle. If you start with \"I would like a steak cooked by a Michelin level chef\" you are probably going to get there slower than if you start with \"what goes into a really good steak and who can tell me this?\"**Identify then build the core functionality first:**If you want to start a website that can handle a billion requests per second, start with the code the takes then dispatches the requests (load balancers). For a much quieter website you would probably tackle other tasks first.If you want to make a game in which you fly a space ship, fight pirates and trade goods, make sure the ship handles well (i.e. the interface in which the user spends 95% of their time). Figuring out what the core functionality is though can be the real brainteaser.If there are parts of your app that are a known quantity (i.e. others have already solved this bit and documented their solutions) and parts that are not, the latter might be a good candidate. What is your USP, what makes your app stand out from the others?Example: [how the video game Lemmings was designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5-lH3lZqrg) (YT, 4 mins).",

I've been assured by every exec ever that anyone can build apps with LLMs now... /sAssuming we're talking web applications, after I've got the spec/requirements down I've always liked to start with the data. So I will usually design database schemas to 3NF and write the DDL. I can then use this to bring up a database instance. Then I write a quick DML seeding script. Then I put together a server application in whatever language I've chosen. I've been around a while so I've written a good few auth/perm systems so I have code for that in JS/PHP which is usually what I'm using. Then I work on the back end API, adding things I need as I go (e.g. job queues, caching, etc.) Finally, I put the client together (personally my least favourite part, maybe why I do it last if it's me doing it). There's usually no reason you need to do back/front in any particular order and it's common to do them in parallel too (different teams etc.). I do think that starting with the data, which flows through the entire app, adds a certain clarity and certainty to things, but really anything goes if you don't mind lots of going back to revise.My \"plan\" is usually my thinking beforehand and any diagrams I've doodled, as we don't create formal design docs as part of our process. We gather requirements, write software, document the result. I will put effort into writing a technical design doc if I'm handing it off entirely though. I basically short-circuit the written spec part if I'm also the implementer.For a personal project, I think the answer is to just think, and make whatever notes/doodles you feel are necessary. How do you want to distribute/deliver it to users? What data is needed at what point? What interactions? How do you want interactions to go? How do you want it to look? Do you need common things that a framework would be able to provide? Etc.Things that you haven't considered will usually present themselves. Things you have considered will change. If you understand how everything works it all comes together as you work on it more, so my main advice is to be clear enough about what you want that you can start work, and then start writing code.",

        "body": "Respectfully, who tf told you Stripe's API was the \"easiest and most straight forward\"? They lied to you. Payment processing is not trivial, and is a terrible way to learn about APIs from a base of nothing.Go here: [https://free-apis.github.io/#/browse](https://free-apis.github.io/#/browse) \\- pick one that has no auth, make a page for each GET endpoint the API has, and display data that you have fetched from the API. Then move on to one with API key auth and do the same, then move on to one that has OAuth and do it again. Once you've done that go to [https://restful-api.dev/](https://restful-api.dev/) \\- try creating a record with a POST method, take the ID from the response and GET it. Once you can GET it, try to PATCH and PUT it, then ultimately DELETE it. You can practice this loop.REST API docs will make much more sense to you at this point when you actually understand auth and what the verbs are for. This knowledge is directly translatable to GraphQL queries and mutations, there are many guides, this is a decent one to see the difference between RESTful GET requests and GraphQL queries [https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/migrating-from-rest-to-graphql](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/migrating-from-rest-to-graphql) APIs are typically intuitive because we have common conventions, but you have to actually understand those conventions first. If it puts your mind at ease, well established APIs (like Stripe) are rarely a point of friction when you actually know what you're doing, but you're trying to build a house starting at the roof tiles.",

Instead of memorizing a line of code, you should know how to build a line from scratch when you need it; how to plan for an outcome and put together any variables, math, functions, etc, that you need to get there.If you are studying code to learn it, don't think about a code line as \"the solution\" or the only next step, think of it as a row of tools or objects that each do something special and that do something together.

That is, in a client-server environment where the client runs on a machine controlled by somebody other than you, you must always assume that the client can be compromised.That means the client can do whatever they want with everything in your static files and everything that's returned from every API endpoint. If there are particular kinds of data that only specific users should be able to read/write, then that **must** be carefully enforced on the backend.When you write any kind of frontend code, you're essentially sending it to users and asking them nicely to run it as-is. Ordinary users will do so (or rather, their browsers will). Attackers will ignore it and do whatever they want.(Corollary: if the user themselves is not malicious, but their client machine has been compromised by somebody else or by malware, then there isn't much you can do to protect them. The best you can do is protect yourself and other users from their attack.)",

I spent so long doing boring tutorials and then quitting because I had no interest and the combo of boring work + difficult work made getting into the flow very difficult. So what I did was start a new project (it's a console-based resource-grinding game with some light story set in The Elder Scrolls universe) and starting very small with just some dialogue and choices. I set up a Trello board and broke all my tasks into \"main quests\" and \"side quests\" (things I'd like to do but are on the backburner) and broke them down into SUPER small pieces. That has given me nice dopamine hits when I get to check off those tasks as complete. It's also way more interesting to me because I love games, and this is something I actually look forward to playing myself when I get it into a more complete or at least MVP state.Also, (this may be controversial) using AI to talk through the issue or design I'm thinking off. Not ***ever*** using it to solve the problem or make me code, but rather \"I want to do X in my project, give me a word or two I can google to start my search\" so I have something specific to look up on Stack Overflow or the Ruby docs. That way when I get stuck I'm not just banging my head against the wall because I'm not even sure what to search, I have some breadcrumbs that get me started but I'm never actually relying on the AI to code for me or even give me the full answer.I work at a large tech company and those are the tips that a programmer friend gave me and I've been finding so much more success in the last few weeks than ever before :)",

You're 21. You don't have to have everything figured out. I'm almost 40, and I have a bunch of different skills, but I still don't have my shit figured out, either.

        "body": "> it demoralizes meFirst up, school has misled you on how easy it is to learn new things. They didn't mean to do it, but they did. What do I mean by that? You spend years slowly spiralling your knowledge and understanding of a topic over years, probably for 12 or 13 years at the minimum. As such, when you are introduced to a 'new topic', it's 98% old knowledge. It is built on structures where a lot of the new thinking is given to you and slowly removed bit by bit until you are doing it yourself. This teaches you are taught that learning isn't really too hard, and you should be succeeding almost immediately before moving to the next topic. When you learn something novel it's not a slow progression over years, it's probably a logistics function of logistic functions for each topic. That is, the initial concept is pretty easy, then it becomes hard as fuff where you feel like an idiot for ages, but you eventually learn the concept and it gets easy. But, because you are constantly learning, at no point do you ever feel like a master, or even competent. I firmly believe that 'good' programmers are people who accept that they will always struggle stuff that they are just learning and can realise exactly how much they've learned. So, what's the lesson for you?- Accept that you might need to take smaller steps, and that's okay. - After you learn something, make your own version of the questions/problems, and solve them as well. If you can't do that, go back to their questions and just change one small thing (like a variable) and write down what you think will change when you run it and then run it. Document if it runs the way you thought, and if it doesn't, keep playing until you get it. Then move to two things, then as many things as you can. - Think back to other things you've learned and ask yourself if you can incorporate those things as well, if so (and you probably can), make your own versions of those problems. You'll likely find that giving yourself that space to learn how to solve those problems will mean that the next step will be easier.",

If we ever do try to build our own POS, we would need to scale up our team significantly.Maybe you can find success if you identify some niche, are very opinionated with exactly which features should exist and how things should be done, and then successfully convince restaurants that your approach is worth it. But to go head to head with the big players in the space, there’s so much scope you are going to need to handle just to get to the point where your POS is sniffing anywhere close to feature parity… I just don’t see one or two people pulling it off.",

It isn't that learning some technologies deeply won't matter eventually, just that you're probably a few thousand hours away from the point where that matters.Basically, if you haven't reached the point where you already know a few languages and are starting to have opinions of their upsides and downsides, it is too early to worry about focusing on anything.

And once you have gone through the basics, anything more advanced you want to know will be applicable to your specific project, and you can always find either articles or videos, or most of the time, just look at example projects.What I think is the hardest part of learning React is not writing all the syntax, or memorizing all the different hooks, but simply getting an idea of WHY you create variables with useState rather than plain variables, WHY you use props or contexts, WHY you need routes, etc. And Codecademy, Freecodecamp and all the rest suck at explaining the WHYs, even when they are excellent at demonstrating the HOWs.So I wouldn't have expected much better than your experience, but thank you for sharing anyways, as it might encourage others to skip those kind of courses!",

The best way is to do both Jonas course and Odin project side by side else you'll get stuck in tutorial hell.If you think your teacher is using old way(it is always going to happen) just start building with latest way and navigate through errors. For eg- In react course Jonas intentionally uses \"create-react-app\" which is deprecated now but at that point if you've gone through js+odin you should be comfortable enough in this world to look up and use vite.",

Also, \"everyone\" does not agree on anything ever.Why can't you learn as fast as others? People learn at different speeds. I learn almost anything very fast...but learn to code insanely slowly. It just doesn't come naturally to me even though my brain basically thinks like code is written. You're not a natural & neither am I.Also, feeling like banging your head on the wall is very common when learning to code, especially when asking for help (traditionally). That's why utilizing AI can be an incredible tool if you use it to learn. For example, I learn coding well by seeing correct code & dissecting it to reverse engineer it since I learn best by understanding what each part does & why it does it. AI is not perfect, nor is any other learning tool or person, so no matter what you use, check the work to ensure it actually works & that you understand it.",

I don’t ask AI to build me the thing, I ask it what boiler plate examples look like, then why each thing is needed, and how each is supposed to work together. Then once I think understand that, I implement it myself and see if I can get it to work. You just have to avoid using code from AI you don’t understand how it works. Thats the part thats not learning.For some people though (it depends on your learning style), the quick answers can make retention harder, which is important to be aware of. You may have to work extra hard to recall the information you just learned to retain it in your brain. On that note, your should look at what your own personal learning style is. Do notes help you, or flashcards? Does reading it make you understand or do you need to do the thing to learn it?Personally for me, I can’t learn a lot from a lecture or a reading i’m a tactile learner.

Build up your savings until you have six months of wages to fall back on (easier said than done but the more the better.) Then, just focus on your job.

Then one would refactor the stuff into the design, and keep the design intact going forward. The problem is that design has been so maligned that few people even study it anymore, and after you study it you need to gain skill in it by doing a few projects, and projects that actually involve designing as any step (before or after) are so few and far between that you get \"shooting from the hip\" designs that are often inconsistent and difficult to use, if you get them at all.APIs are supposed to be the most stable portions of integration.

Developers update endpoints and forget to update swagger, add new required fields without documenting them, deprecate stuff without marking it in the docs.If your automated tests can't detect when an endpoint changes, there's something wrong with your architecture.The structure of your response objects should be formalized in a file somewhere in your server: an schema, model, DTO or something like that. Your API server should not be able to return a response that doesn't comply with your formal description: it should throw an error.If a PR changes the formal description of a response object, a simple automatic test should compare it with the documentation and report any difference.In fact, an automatic process could simply write new documentation from the method signatures and response objects in the source code: you don't even need Swagger.

No memory allocated yet for the integer value itself. If you deref this you get garbage.&x // This is the address of a pointer, and is therefore of type int**&n // This is where '5' livesx = &n // Now x points to an initialized value.```Pointers are primarily used to create references to resources that are already owned by other variables (we need not copy them) with the understanding that the resource being pointed to will out-live the lifespan of the pointer. Imagine that \"x points to n\", what happens if 'n' gets destroyed by GC, a perfectly normal circumstance: 'x' Will be left pointing to uninitialized memory and thats what we call a memory leak.Just thought I'd go into detail",

You don't go outside and shout \"I am now networking!\".At your age it is typically going to come through friends, mentors, professors, job fairs, extra curricular events at uni, etc. You need to find ways to connect with others on a professional level.If you're a developer join coding events. Invite people to work on projects. Find out what projects other people are working on see if you can help. Apply for internships. Reach out to hiring managers.You can't approach it strictly transactionally. Don't expect that you offer to help another student on a project and now you have 8 job offers. The idea is by being engaged and interactive on a professional level consistently will mean more opportunities will be surfaced to you over the long term.",

        "body": ">Would love if someone could break down what networking actually means for a student who is not from a top collegeShort background, graduated in 2009 during recession from a school that probably doesn't exist on any CS rating radars. Took 1 year to find first IT job, 2 years to find first dev job. I was in similar shoes and my advice is what i've done.>I started posting on Twitter and committing to GitHub, but obviously nobody is watching. I don’t know if I’m supposed to keep doing this until someone magically finds me or if I’m doing it wrong.Is networking just talking to people online? Is it internships? Is it Discord servers? LinkedIn? Meetups? Or is it just something people say for the sake of saying? Networking is getting out and talking to people, not shooting messages into the avoid and hoping someone looks at your social media and goes \"this kids a genius\", thats not networking.You need to find meetup groups in your area and start attending, meetup.com. This is a good way to get out there but with networking, you get out what you put in.If you just go, attend, and don't talk to anyone, no ones going to know who you are / what you are doing tech wise and what you're looking for. So if you aren't socially outgoing, start working on that.>I kind of feel like I wasted most of college procrastinating. Now I’m doing DSA and web dev, but its late-very late and I know it. Also I’m from a tier 3 college and people keep saying if you’re from a tier 3 college you basically HAVE to network or no one will even know you exist, so no one will give you a chance.I had similar experience, didn't do internships, didn't really hit my stride until my senior year of college when things started clicking for me and i felt like i was finally getting it. So the issue is jobs currently want experience / proof that you have some semblance that you know what you are doing. You're not going to like this but my suggestion to you is to work for free for a while.You can either keep shooting resume's into the void for months / a year plus on end hoping for the best or you can get the experience you need to set you apart from your peers at similar points in your career.Sure, you'll find the rare hiring manager that says \"i dont care about experience, i just want them to be curious\", in reality a lot of hiring managers are kind of dumb, don't know what they want, and just pray they don't hire an idiot and the best way to do that is to find someone that has proven experience.Assuming you can build / deploy an app (i tutored college students online and you'd be surprised at the number of students who could barely build something in their senior year much less know how to deploy it), I would start with chamber of commerce website for cities near you that you'd be willing to drive to if necessary. So call it a 25-50 mile radius.From there, look for non-profits and call up their volunteer coordinator and see if they have any needs / opportunities to build software / automate something that they don't have the money/expense to spend on. Off the shelf software / monthly subscription based software isn't as expensive as it was when i graduated these days so maybe they are more inclined to pay for services these days, but you'd be surprised the shoe string budgets some of these nonprofits operate on.Often times they are taking paper applications and manually retyping it back into a computer which wastes time. They setup temporary shelters and take intake on paper where if they had a laptop there, they'd cut that part out.Look at rec leagues in your area and see if any of these rec leagues have a need for software to manage teams/schedules/rosters. Some leagues barely have enough money to run the league itself much less any extras so they manage the league in spreadsheets. 1/2",

I listed the biggest tech companies in my local area and messaged asking for advice on applications, the job search and just questions about the work they do and how it links to university.Try to be remembered and don't message with the intent of asking for a referral, for now just focus on building a rapport. I would also recommend connecting with campus recruiters and hiring managers the same way through LinkedIn, that way posts you make are going directly to the people who you would want to see them.

And many Python libs are just wrappers for C/C++ libs anyway - use the original libs directly. For max performance and min mem footprint, go full legacy mode !",

Give it a go, build a minimal version of the project you want, try using only the core features, for example, and create a product that allows you to see what you are trying to accomplish.As a game developer, when building games, I focus on only building 1 file at a time. Therefore, if I can stick the whole game in 1 file, then that's all it will take, and I organize the classes and methods based on what gets called first in the render method. I remove all need for fancy features, such as special effects, game-ending scripts, and features that don't add to the product's goal, such as cosmetics, unless they unlock the exact feature or mechanic I am trying to highlight. Hope this makes sense. So I will end up with a game that just plays, and that's all. No fancy features, lol. No finishing the game yet, either. Just a fully featured game without any effects, or a game that just plays your core-gameplay loop. Amen and selah.Hope this helps. Good luck with all your endeavors. Peace and love.",

Conway’s Game of Lifehttps://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_LifeNot very hard conceptually, but full of interesting edge cases. The result is visual and rewarding, and some languages make it… entertaining :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: Life in COBOL, anyone?2. The simplest “AI” you can think ofYou think of an animal. The program can ask yes/no questions until it guesses what you’re thinking of.If it guesses wrong, it asks: “What question should I have asked to get this right?”Store that answer, and it improves next round.Once you understand linked lists and binary trees, this is very doable and surprisingly satisfying.Not for everyone, I know. You may think this is boring or slightly insane :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:But for me, these kinds of projects teach a language far better than grinding puzzle sites.",

PlayCanvas – browser-based 3D engine, no install needed, has a visual editor. Phaser – a JS framework, good if you’re okay coding in JavaScript/HTML5 (you already know some HTML/CSS so this will click). Godot – powerful and free, can run on Chromebook using Linux or the web version, a bit harder to set up but worth learning. Scratch – if you just want to start experimenting with logic and visuals.Basically, start small, make simple games, and build up. You *don’t* need a powerful PC or expensive software to learn these free tools are perfect for getting started.",

That way, we didn't have to deal with re-pointing nameservers, changing billing, or other nonsense (usually, biggest issue was stuck caches).The clients that didn't have an existing host service I would recommend use the host I had been using who - at the time - had good rates, solid customer service team. I...don't think I'd recommend them as enthusiastically today.How they want to pay is up to them; usually yearly got a discount, 3 years even further, 5 years a crazy discount. They set up the payments, I didn't want to get involved with that.When working on sites my contract broke the project estimate into a series of phases. Work on each phase wouldn't begin until a down payment was received, and I wouldn't start on a subsequent phase until the previous phase had been paid in full. That always seemed to be the safest - breaking a site into, say, 3 phases, with incremental payments. Better than working for 2 months on a $15k job only to find out the client never intended to pay me.",

Python's standard library is 1000x better.2: There tends to be a lot of asynchronous activity, which is a can of worms and makes subtle bugs.3: Some of the syntax is just weird, like ===.My advice is to work on programs that you will actually want to use, and keep trying to have fun with it. Think of programming as a creative medium, and don't be afraid to write small and/or weird programs. Not everything needs to be a showcase project. Don't be afraid to tackle concepts that confuse you.

It has state (variables), flow (code execution order), branching, looping, and much more. These are completely new things if you transition from markup/styling to actual programming.Now, you're battling two fronts: JavaScript as a language with its vocabulary and grammar and *programming* - which is like learning a new spoken language while learning to write a meaningful, comprehensive, fully developed novel in that language. So, it is absolutely natural that you struggle.JavaScript being one of the most anarchic languages around doesn't make it easier.

Having something in mind you want to build gives you the motivation to keep going, even if it takes years to get there. If programming just feels like doing homework or meaningless exercises (like Path C sometimes can), I think sometimes people lose motivation before they've really gotten into it.I would say, be cautious about Unity or Godot since those are generally more 'intermediate' than beginner level. Your intuition to start with something like Ren'Py is a good idea. I'd also recommend Game Maker since it's even easier to get started with something fun/playable (though it uses a slightly weird programming language that's not useful anywhere else). Pygame and Love2D are also popular although maybe a little outdated at this point.",

I don't know what exactly is not clear to you. Maybe the problem is that you try to \"translate\" your code. It's probably better to not just translate it line by line but to think about what objects there will be and how they communicate. Calling a method is how that works in OOP. And they can have side effects. There are books. Some of them are bad many are outdated. The problem is mostly that they spend a lot of time on inheritance of state because it's so problematic. That chapter has to be in the book, but it should just be about what you prevent as much as possible. And beginners think because there's so much about it in the book it must be important. You probably need a type for each expression in your syntax tree. You could use an abstract class as a base that has a field for the token(s) from the tokenizer. But you really don't need this. Just design each class as a final class and it's a lot simpler. Use \"record\" instead of \"class\" for immutable types. \"permits\" on your types when you know the subtypes.",

Then whenever you want to add, you pass the integer in the array to the function pointed to in the array. *This is called a field and a method*.This is an oversimplification.

With this approach you will get nowhere.Yes, there is a lot to learn and the learning never ends in programming, no matter what domain you take.The way to go is to not look at the vast amount that is there, but to look at what is next, just like when climbing a mountain, you don't look at the summit but at the next step, at the path ahead.Take a *solid course*, not random youtube videos.For web dev:+ [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org)+ [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)and later [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)For Python, we commonly recommend the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki.> The barrier to entry level is very high for a beginner like me. No, it actually isn't. *You* made it high because of jumping around. As I've said already: stick to one thing and learn it in depth.Learning anything is not a sprint. It is a marathon where slow and steady wins the race. You cannot speedrun learning.For Python alone it takes upward of 6 months to become somewhat proficient yet far from competent, experienced, and good.For web dev, you can learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS in about one or two months and then it takes another good 6 months with JavaScript and to puzzle everything together. Give 2 years and you become somewhat competent.> I've spent 80% of my time basically studying on paper everything, and 20% actually coding anythingThat's the reverse ratio to what you should be doing: 70 to 80% practice, 20 to 30% theory.You can only learn through active practice, not through reading.",

This is maybe atypical but it’s my experience. To offer a silly analogy, you were walking along a path and now you’ve encountered a wall. You have to pause and knock down the wall and then you can keep walking until the next one. I don’t have concrete advice, I’m just empathizing.For something like that algorithm, I would start by writing down some examples and running them on paper to form an understanding of what it’s doing and why.

And only after that do you dive into the real differences, where you either start appreciating the language, or not.There are some genuinely weird languages out there, like Lisp, Prolog, R, or SQL. But many will feel fundamentally less different than you might expect. And even the weird ones are grounded in concepts you’ll recognise once you’ve learned enough languages.Have fun with it.

        "body": "I hate to give advice without knowing you a \\*lot\\* better. But ...I learned programming a long time ago. My first compiled language was Fortran 77. In those days we wrote out the entire program on paper, ran through it (still on paper) assigning numbers to variables, etc, to do the best we could to simulate its operation. Why? Because the program had to be typed onto punch cards and fed into a card reader, then run usually overnight. You'd get a printout with a mass of compiler errors the next day, look at the various other reports, mark up the printout, and repeat until it ran correctly. The point of telling you this is that it took such a long time to get computer output that we did everything we could to ensure that our logic and syntax were succinct and correct before submitting a job. So we used flow charts, pseudo code, walk-through discussions, and anything else we could think of. This mental exercise made writing code in different languages relatively easy. As you know, that's mostly syntax and punctuation.So I would recommend that you try programming without a computer. Say, with a book of algorithms (Maybe Cormen? I haven't read it.), or [a book on threaded interpretive language](https://archive.org/details/R.G.LoeligerThreadedInterpretiveLanguagesTheirDesignAndImplementationByteBooks1981)s -- build yourself a FORTH-like compiler -- or join a number of folks from the 80's and build a C compiler. If that sounds interesting, you might want to read this: [Has anyone read \"Writing a C Compiler\" by Nora Sandler?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1lu9sjd/has_anyone_read_writing_a_c_compiler_by_nora/)Hope this helps.",

Then add a few div, deal with row and column, under how content is showing in a page. 2-Css: you know how the page looks, now how to make it sexier. Right? Apply css by id, fonts, style, padding… etc. then at this point, you got an idea about front end. 3-JavaScript: you can’t skip this. You need to understand how to apply a function to an element, Id… then, use JavaScript to get some sample data. 4- data: instead of static content, now thing about dynamic content. Questions like, how is data look like, what i want to show in the html? At this stage, don’t need to have a backend yet, you can just have a fake raw json file. 5- backend.

That said, I still stand by my comment that if you think you are \"up for it\", then \"go for it\".This is more of a \"being on the same page\" when we are talking about system calls.Back in the day, when I did assembler programming on MS-DOS systems, system calls was pretty much the only option available. I also had to do this on some proprietary operating systems such as TMX (which was an NCR proprietary OS running on M68K CPUs).It was a PIA. Back then, in MS-DOS, the interface was pretty straightforward, but tedious.System calls are pretty basic as you are directly invoking functions that the underlying operating system supports - for example, openning, reading, writing and other file operations. Or, forking the current process and replacing the image with a new image (fork and execute). Terminate this process and other \"basic\" operations.In DOS, you setup the parameters in various CPU registers and invoked a software interrupt (INT 0x21 if memory serves).Linux is very similar.If running on Intel hardware, there is a special instruction `syscall` (added in Pentium class CPUs I believe) that is used in place of the INT 0x21, but you still have to set up the CPU registers.Perhaps have a look at this: https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/linux-constants/syscalls/#x86_64-64-bitThe CPU registers that need to be set are listed at the head of the table,Note that there are no \"graphics\" system calls - I don't know how this would work, I imagine it is some sort of IPC between your process and a kernel driver which manages the display hardware. IPC could include any combination of:* Shared memory (shmget, shmat ...).* Semaphores (semget, semop, semctl),* Message Queues (msgget, msgsnd, msgrcv...).* Pipes (pipe, mkfifo, open, read, write...)* Signals which operate like interrupts (kill, signal, sigaction...)and possibly others. But the same thing would apply, there would be some mechanism (defined by the driver) that defines how parameters are supplied and functions invoked.If you want to learn system calls (and the above is what you are talking about), you might try doing some basic File I/O using the system calls, perhaps some IPC between two processes that you create (and thus know the protocol being used for them talk to each other) - perhaps a simple command interpreter that can accept commands, fork and exec a sub process.",

        "body": "Good news, this is a super traditional thing for budding programmers to get into. If you were learning to program as an undergrad CS student, there'd almost certainly be a course in your second or third year that would involve writing a simple HTTP server in C (hint: implement HTTP 1.0, not 1.1, it's way easier).There's something really cool about having something you're already familiar with, like your web browser, having a real, successful conversation with an app that you wrote from scratch, and displaying some cool result.The exact mechanics of how to implement will wildly vary by language, but really understanding what ports and sockets and addresses and listening and such mean is very helpful, and the concepts will transfer as you move between languages.There are lots of famous textbooks in this space. The Tanenbaum is probably the most famous, that's \"Computer Networks\" by Andrew Tanenbaum.There are also many great college courses covering computer networking with all of their lectures and assignments posted online. Simply going through one at your own pace may be a great way to get an expensive education for free (excepting the benefits of being able to ask questions). Good example: [https://sp26.cs168.io/](https://sp26.cs168.io/)One thing to be aware of: writing HTTP servers quickly starts to involve parallelization and running multiple threads, and then it becomes partly about memory sharing and memory management, and then you're learning about mutexes, and pretty soon you'll find that learning networking quickly begins to overlap with learning systems programming and operating systems. This is a good thing, but it can be somewhat confusing how books on operating systems will often seem to be about web serving, and vice versa.",

But it's not the only way! You could also hard code every ability into your character and have a series of boolean flags for if you have that ability or not. Big name games from developers like Nintendo still do this today. This strategy can be easier and faster to write and perfectly adequate for your needs.Basically if you catch yourself writing code that seems like 3000 line crazy spaghetti functions, consider how you could redesign it to use classes. If you're writing a million types of classes, each with almost no logic inside of them, consider how you might write this without classes or with fewer classes.",

Devs are more concerned with how manageable, scalable, and flexible the code is.For example, if you were to add a new feature later down the road (which is not uncommon), how easy would you be able to implement it without having to rewrite everything? There is where things like SOLID principles come in, such that applying those principles in your code design would generally make your code more robust.For example, suppose you wanted to implement abilities.You can certainly create every skill as its own class for example. An AttackSkill, a GuardSkill, a FireballSkill, and so on, such that when you execute a skill, your code can handle them uniformly and if certain skills have some unique properties, you could just override some parent logic and it probably just works.Or perhaps you might decide you only need a Skill class which takes an ID that references a table that describes the properties of the skill itself (eg: damage formula, animation, use conditions, etc).Both approaches are valid, and certainly allow you to add new skills to your game without too much extra work.If your game has complex skill interactions, it may be necessary to implement every skill defined by its own subclass because you have special logic for all of them. Perhaps you might come up with a custom \"skill effect\" syntax where you write them out in a text file and the game simply interprets it as you go.There is no particular right answer. Try different approaches and compare the pros and cons of each of them. Maybe you'll get some insight that you can use for future code design.",

Python or JS could work for very simple \"retro\" style games, but you won't get very far making a modern game title in them. For that you usually pick Unity or Unreal, so that means C# or C++.As far as C++ being difficult to learn, that's somewhat true, but Unreal Engine does simplify it a bit by being opinionated. They have a way of doing things. And it has libraries that handle the hard stuff like memory management for you.Take a look at Unity if C# is more your speed. It's a lot \"cleaner\" than C++ IMO. But Unity games can't really match the rendering quality and performance of Unreal.",

At this point you are using C++ to investigate the concepts. Actually learning C++ well and becoming conversant in the language is an entirely different issue and frankly takes years of study and practice. At some point in your Computer Science study you should also be starting in on a second language. Python is a good option here, but if platform specified programming is in your future, the common language for the platform. For example Swift for Apple's products. Don't stop with C++ for now.",

Seniors have great advice when it comes to protecting against risk, and many people in this thread are not wrong. But the biggest risk here is that you get so caught up in following other people's advice that you might lose interest if it doesn't work for you; worse you stop coding because you are trying to follow the advice of 100 people, and never end up developing the skills.The simple test you will have to do would be to see if you can create something without AI.

Deliberately or by mistake. You have handled that one. “If you didn’t request this message, please ignore it.”2. User carelessly leaves account logged in on a public-access computer by mistake. A Cybercreep attempts to steal the account by changing the email to his own. In this case re-acquiring the password will slow the creep down, and notifying the old email account will alert the careless user. Re-acquiring the password when the user enters the one-time code before updating the email also slows down the creep. You may also want to add “if you didn’t request this message please contact support” or something like that.3. Somebody manages to break into the system and send these emails for many accounts. The notification emails alert users to that.If you’re doing this for a popular service that deals in sensitive personal data, you really need to work with some white-hat hackers to imagine the particular threat profiles you face. And then counter them.Oh, and if the one-time password is wrong,never ever explain what’s wrong with it [expired, wrong username, whatever]. Just a generic “huh?” message.",

Not locking the user out of the account might mean that the bad actor will get another chance to update the user's email undesirably, and that again is a security risk.

Checkout to a new feature branch. Push both the unpushed commit and also the failed merge between your changes and your colleague's changes. Yes, stuff will fail pipeline in your merge branch but it does not matter.Now you have clean state, locally. Check git history to see the commit hash for first pushed commit in main branch. Checkout to that. Then, do a hard reset for your local main branch. Your local branch will be then in the state where you were after pushing your first commit successfully. Fetch changes. Do \"git pull --rebase\" to apply your colleague's changes over your changes. Solve possible merge conflicts. Ensure that all the tests pass locally. This should ensure that your first commit works and your colleague's commit works. Contact him if the conflict is too difficult, to understand reasoning behind his changes.If you did any changes in fixing merge conflict then commit these. Don't push. Your local state should pass all the tests both for your first change and also for your colleague's change. And should have no untracked files or uncommitted changes. Git status should remind you of unpushed commits.Cherry pick your second commit from that temporary feature branch you made. And apply over your clean and working local state. Possibly fix merge conflicts, if any. And then push your changes. If all is good then delete your temporary feature branch you made earlier.A better approach is avoiding such mess. Either use feature branches (one developer pushes to one branch. Nobody else) or use trunk based development where every commit MUST be safe and working.

        "body": "Yes and no.There's several layers to this question and your intuition to be sceptical is correct, but there's some small things in between.First: on the entity level, there are no ids. On the entity level, you only talk about relations between entities, not how you model that in Java or in the database. This distinction is important precisely because the materialisation may end up completely different than the logical view.Next, ownership. Ownership is a special case relationship that usually isn't really fully expressed in ER lingo. What we mean is: the owned object must not exist without exactly one owner. The owner controls the lifetime of the owned entity and must delete it or move it to a different owner if the owner is deleted. The reverse relationship may be of a weaker kind. Most many-to-one relationships are just to look something up in the parent, but in many cases you can throw those out by not having the logic on the child element.For real teams and tournaments you wouldn't have an ownership here because teams can outlive the tournament. Both would be full business objects that can exist independently.Now, that's the logical entity view, but you still have to materialise that in Java and the database. And that's where the trouble starts. If you simply give both Tournament and Team a slot of the respective other type, you can not handle them atomically any more. You need to create both and then link them. You need to break up the links before you delete them. This gives you all manner of nasty chicken-and-egg problems when dealing with constraints and temporal integrity of your data, so we usually avoid it where possible. It's even worse in the database, because now you can't but referential constraints on your data any more - again, because it needs to be in an inconsistent state for a very short time.It's even worse in languages with a ref-counted garbage collector. There, the GC will simply count how many times an object is referenced by others and so these circular references will leak memory if not broken up manually. Luckily Java's GC is not ref-counted, so that's one problem less.What you usually do for your specific problem is to move logic away from dependent entities. If teams cannot exist independently and you need information of the tournament, then the logic that acts on them should take the tournament and the team and sit outside of your entities as some sort of service actor.That of course would mean that any api endpoint working on players would need all three ids, which is stupid. Luckily that's where the separation of entity and database model helps us. Because one-to-many relations are usually stored inverted in the database anyway, in the database each team knows its tournament directly. In the entity view it does not. So instead of calling an accessor in Java to let JPA fetch the relation, you take a tiny detour and ask the database to look up the tournament (likely through a native SQL or similar query method anyway, but the thought counts!). That way your entity model can model ownership unidirectionally while the database can do what it does best.",

        "body": "At the moment, it's hard to give solid recommendations on how to best structure your data. We don't know what operations you want your program to support (what 'verbs' you want). This in turn makes it challenging to figure out the best way of representing your data (what 'nouns' you need).I think this is a common trap for beginners: you start with nouns, trying to create a 'model' of some real-world scenario you're looking at. But instead, you should start with the 'verbs' you need and work backwards to figure out what you need to build to support those actions.Anyways, without further context, in this scenario I'd probably set up a SQL database to be the source of truth for your teams/players/etc -- maybe sqlite to start, to keep things simple? I would then run sql queries to perform steps like 'grab a list of all players belonging to team X during tournament Y'. There are two advantages to this:1. This side-steps your problem, since you can grab data in exactly the shape you need for each distinct operation, instead of being locked into one specific one. (In this case, your `tournament -> {teams, players}` shape)2. More generally, it gives us maximal flexibility in cases where my verbs are unknown.If you want to stick with your current structure, I would perhaps consider changing Tournament no longer store 'Player' objects and instead have those be stored under 'Teams'. The 'Tournament' class can then implement helper methods that iterate over teams to return an iterator or list of all players.Though granted, this is not perfect either, since a team could potentially belong to multiple tournaments, and a player could belong to multiple teams over time... To support this in full generality, you would most likely end up creating your own 'querier' abstraction -- basically a database, or something conceptually similar to it. So, we're back at square 1.> Is avoiding bidirectional relationships between domain entities generally considered best practice in this case?Bidirectional dependencies are usually suspect, yeah. It's not always a problem, but it's usually a sign that some common functionality could be refactored out, or that the 'shape' of the data is not quite clean. Having to keep both directions in sync is a bit cumbersome and potentially error-prone, and it's better to design our code to avoid having to do it if possible.> Is it more idiomatic to allow Team to hold direct Player references and rely on invariants to maintain consistency, or to keep entities decoupled and move cross-entity logic into a service/manager layer?If the data is fully immutable -- never changing after it's first created -- I'd probably be ok with allowing both Team and Tournaments to hold player references. To make this work, you'd want your 'Tournament' object to be a fixed snapshot of a specific point in time instead of the source of truth and handle updates separately.But if it's mutable, then I would prefer to avoid having duplicate references to reduce the odds of human error, where you accidentally break some invariant. (After all, the best invariant is no invariant.)That said, it's sometimes useful to have duplicate references in cases where it would materially simplify your algorithms or improve performance. But we would need to understand the desired verbs of your program first before exploring this path.",

If a player can play in multiple tournaments, it would seem that you would need to duplicate player state, which isn't what you want.2. If a team holds a reference to a tournament, does that mean a team can only play in one tournament? Or does the reference mean the \"current tournament that the team is playing in\"? If so, what does it mean to get player ratings with respect to the current tournament? Is a player's ratings dependent on which tournament the team is currently playing in?I feel that based on these two observations, there might be an issue with the overall design.",

You can start now. Target companies that automatically give OAs, start-ups, and small local ones. It might help if you speak in person, reach out to them somehow, or curate quick projects related to them. Continue your learning as you dedicate that time. If you don't want to learn for free, attempt to build things that can generate revenue, freelance, get a contracting gig, make the jump to open source, or offer your services to spruce up small local company sites. Otherwise, get used to building for fun as your skills improve. Carpenters don't get better by simply working for cash. They build a lot of things. You're a builder/maintainer now. Target skills related to the job type you're looking for. You might want to search for \"essential skills for getting a fullstack job\" and see how you size up. What you suggested as a learning path isn't what I see hiring managers focus on. Your easiest path might be from actual connections, so don't be afraid of tech meetups and stuff.

When you are writing stuff in Typescript then during the compilation process it compiles to a regular Javascript. You can't say that nobody is using Javascript.Now, should you stick to a MERN stack or you should pick something else? Decide it based on your local job market. Are the companies using Node.js?

If you roll your own authentication system and deploy it to a project, and someone finds a vulnerability and exploits it, you have a very big problem you could have prevented by using the right tools for the job.It's not really necessary to understand all this low level detail to be a productive professional developer. But if that's your interest those are the places to look.And yes, understanding how to build systems in other languages will help with your low level understanding. They also use abstractions but use them differently.",

That's because a certificate program varies wildly in what is taught, while university programs tend to coordinate and ensure a similar program (or transfers between universities would be impossible, you'd just start over each time).FCC has a great program, and one day it might be the gold standard of such programs (if it isn't already) but it's akin to a vocational trainging school. Universities teach a lot of stuff that's not programming as a requirement for you to get your degree. They aren't comparable. A College / University will also study more theory, and less on practical skills. Both are valuable, but one is harder to get, which is why it's seen as more desirable.",

Always have it \"working\".The alternative - what you should not do - is spend a long time writing code for different pieces of your system without putting them together. That will likely lead to huge gaps in knowledge and dead ends.So for example start by making your homepage. Then make it load items from a database. Then add an \"add to cart\" feature. Then add search. Then add a recommendation system but where the recommendation is pregenerated. Then make the recommendation smarter.And so on. Don't bite off too much at a time. Each new feature should only take a day or two.If it takes longer, stop and break it down into smaller pieces. If you can't make a shopping cart in a day or two, break it down. First make a shopping cart icon on your app. Then make it so that clicking Add to Cart increments the count. And so on.",

They have a course on edx which you can take for free.Another really great one for web development specifically is called The Odin Project, so I'd recommend that as well.Both courses require no prior knowledge/experience whilst still covering a lot of content.As for game development on the other hand, unity is a great game engine so if you want to learn that they have a course online at learn.unity.com. You can also check out pygame, which is a python library for gamedev which teaches you a lot about development as you get to do a lot of the work yourself.Plenty of other courses out there online but these are some pretty good ones.",

If you want to get started with web dev, html, CSS and Js, maybe check out coddy, like the Duolingo of programming but it introduces new concepts in hands on ways that you can test and see why it works, some lessons are veryyyy basic so you can skip them but once it gets more complicated, it could become beneficial?.

Look at your initial state, look at your goal state, make a plan about what you need to be able to do to get to your goal state, and then apply the tools in your toolbox to transform the initial state into a solution.If the answer to all of those is \"No\" then it isn't a programming problem. It is probably an attention span problem and a lack of mental endurance to work through a problem and think hard about it. I find having solutions always just an internet search away make this problem much worse - you train your brain to never think too hard about a problem because it always knows you'll find the solution and you won't have to work at it.Often it seems people think that they should be able to just look at a problem and instantly recall a solution, and if they can't it is too hard - without every putting serious mental work into solving it.Anyways, if you're in that boat you probably need to focus more on building your attention span and mental endurance first and foremost.

They do try, and they do insist that they do it well, but a lot of the time they hallucinate ways of writing code that have only been invented in later years.And when it comes to low level assembly they absolutely do more harm than good - I haven't seen a single example of working code, or even being able to explain assembly code delivered to them. Doesn't matter if it is for x86, ia64, arm, 6502, 680n0 or any other CPU, they simply don't understand that kind of code.I have had quite some succes with getting help for fairly advanced C programming with complicated pointers though - maybe because there are so many college-courses with hand in exercises on exactly that :D",

Otherwise it might do something you don’t want it to.

I understand you are not keen on using AI but I believe you should at least know the basics and keep yourself informed on the subject. Continuously trying to isolate yourself from it will only hurt your career more.I personally understand people who choose to not use it out of principle or because it is not yet there.

Even front desk staff can usually answer that without needing manager approval. If getting access to a real hotel is hard, some people survey multiple sources (small local hotels, internships, or even detailed hotel websites + booking flows) and document it as “observational survey data.” The key is showing your entities came from real processes, not whether the dataset is perfect. Your lecturer mainly wants to see that your schema reflects how a hotel actually operates, not a fantasy system. good luck brother",

Lots of folks don't realize the sheer human scale of operating a massive platform with years or decades of features built by thousands of engineers.For example: adding a single column to a users table is simple in a small shop. But at a large place that column on a critical table like such can likely: break 3 other teams downstream systems, add millions in costs in various places for storage, affect multiple critical APIs from added latency of making the payloads larger through out the stack, lead to bad downstream decisions who mis interpret the column perhaps (it happens a lot), not to mention new scaling concerns for > millions of rpsThat's just a few things off the top of my head but now factor that with how many sub features those big platforms have across multiple systems. There are literally thousands of sub systems at larger places that need coordination at human scale.The pool of engineers who can navigate this tends to be limited to a smaller circle, since lots of folks can code a system from scratch but many companies don't have such a scale. I see a lot of folks who join into this type of scale and either leave or take a few years to \"get it\" then some more years to really be valuable contributor.",

Not one. Every job I apply for has 100+ applicants in less than 24 hours. Even the ones at 40-50% of the average salary range, which I apply for just to see if they'll call back. Some of them stop accepting resumes, then reopen a month later because they didn't find a qualified candidate the first time. Then they get spammed again. Then reopen a month later.A friend of mine had a guy on his team (offshore) who never turned his camera on. Would be told in meetings turn your camera on, \"I can't figure out how, it doesn't work\". Sent a new laptop where they verified that the camera worked, wouldn't turn it on. 1:1's with the boss, no camera. They terminated him because his job with them was one of 6 jobs he was working at the same time.AI has broken the ability of companies to match talented people to roles, by filling the intake process with incomprehensible amounts of noise.

And fewer startups get funded and the ones that do would get smaller cheques. Fewer companies and smaller budgets also mean they'll spend less on SaaS products, which also means less revenue for those companies. Harder to borrow + less revenue means they have to shrink their budget. Cutting headcount is always the easiest thing to do, even compared to making your infra spend more efficient. This has further effects as well to non-tech companies that also can't borrow money as easily. They'll do RIFs which also means fewer seats for SaaS products which is another way revenue drops. All these factors reduce hiring. Not to mention the number of people wanting SWE work has increased a lot leading up to the recent years.",

Those three together put you ahead of the majority of people complaining on this sub. Layoffs in this climate are also not frowned upon so I wouldn't worry about your 5 month stint too much.The market is not great but it's also q1 and nearing the beginning of some companies fiscal year so you're in a better spot now hiring wise than if this happened in November.That being said as someone (now 8-9 yoe) also in the nyc area that was laid off at the beginning of 2025 and in 2023 and had 3-5 offers each time in <3 months for solid comp (no prior faang or really big name experience), I would say your situation is definitely not insurmountable.If you need a little time for your mental health take it now, imo no longer than a week and I wouldn't travel or go on vacation unless it's to visit family. You don't want to distract yourself you want to decompress emotionally and let your new reality settle in, low stimulus time.Once you're ready to start hunting then you update your linkedin and get your resume together. Take your time but don't take too long, you can always update it more as you apply. Start sending out apps, I would aim for at least 50 a week. Personally I never did the tailor the resume per application and fuck that cover letter shit, but at the same time apply for places where you're a reasonable fit. Apply for startups, big tech, and everything in between. At this point you just want to pump the numbers, get your feet wet, and collect data.Track all your job apps in a spreadsheet listing out what platform you applied, what version of your resume you applied with (if you modify it), and if you were rejected or not. This will help you tailor your strategy and give you success rates to A/B test approaches against. I had about a 5-10% callback rate on cold apps and a 20% callback rate on recruiter DMs/inmail (moved past the screening round). This is a pretty solid ratio to have in today's climate.Also start connecting with a ton of tech recruiters and if you see a job with a good fit DM the recruiter directly with a short message, the job link, and your resume.Aim to spend half your day doing leetcode /system design and the other half on job apps. Always be interview ready and at the beginning take every interview you can get even if it's something you would never accept just to build your confidence.The big thing is to always rethink your approach and try tweaking different strategies to see what gets better results. It's a shitty position to be in but it's one that you can turn into a positive growth experience if you handle it well.Keep your head up and work hard! Also stay the fuck off of reddit, you do not need this negative shit filling up your head! Good luck!",

But we've got enough money to survive for years (or maybe even for good - FIRE would be very doable outside of the US and I do have EU citizenship). Wife who was stay at home mom went back to work after 5 years, she makes enough to pay bills, food, etc. I'm now the primary caregiver and shuttle my son to/from school, etc. and work of my startup. One idea - if you have some savings and are at least little bit business savvy (or willing to learn), buying a working physical business seems like a great option. US at least is extremely business friendly and if you buy the right business this can make you a very good living and if you are able to improve it/expand you may be able. to sell it in the future for a lot more as well. A friend who was in tech as well did just that with his wife and they are doing very, very well, I'm sure their incomes are several times of when they worked as well-paid professionals. Obviously, there is risk involved, and it's probably not for everyone, but it's potentially a viable way to make very good living.",

He corrected some misconceptions that I had and explained that their primary business model was to compete with banks. Banks are also pretty predatory to their low-income customers, but that's a couple steps above things like payday and title loans, and, honestly, I probably would not have had similar concerns about an offer from a bank. The meeting convinced me that the company's business was above my own personal ethical line. I ended up working there almost a decade.I now work for a fintech that facilitates money movement for the customers of our clients. Most of the payments that we facilitate have very high fees, but our clients are crypto companies and legal gambling. I consider their customers' desire to transfer money into and out of those accounts to be discretionary spending, and the customers of those companies choose to pay the high fees for very quick transfer of funds. So, I that also falls above my personal ethical line.",

        "body": "Preface: I'm currently a remote SDE at Netflix, but I'm only one opinion, others might have different views obviously.First let me point out two facts:1. Getting a call != getting the job. You are getting the cart in front of the horse a bit, so I'd highly recommend you not get too excited. It is very hard to get an offer from Netflix, I've seen jobs stay open for 6+ months waiting for the perfect candidate to come through. Also, if anyone is ahead of you in the pipeline and they accept an offer, Netflix will immediately cancel all interviews with anyone currently in the hiring pipeline. I'm not telling you this to get you down, I've just seen too many folks surprised and disappointed by this.2. Lets be honest, if you get an offer you are going to take the job. It doesn't really matter what I say after this.To answer your actual questions:>What's the catch?There's no catch. Its a good company to work for, but the keeper test is a real thing. You need to do good work to stay employed. There are people who definitely coast, but that's not common.>Are remote workers more likely to get laid off or get plateaued on their salary growth compared to the ones who go to the office every day?No. I suppose if you were the type of person who wants to go from Engineering Manager to Senior Director or something I'm betting it's a journey only to be successfully traveled with a lot of in-office ass kissing.>How’s the pay growth like in general on the base salary every year as there’s no bonus?I would say to get the idea of \"pay growth\" out of your mind. First of all, based on you saying you were at a financial company, I'm guessing that your pay will probably double when coming to Netflix. Given that, if it doesn't grow from there, would that be terrible? Netflix has terms/acronyms for how they do or don't increase pay, I won't bother spelling them all out. The TL;DR is if pay in the industry goes up across the board, then Netflix pay will go up. If it doesn't go up or it goes down (like it has for the past 3 years), Netflix pay will stay the same. You will never get a pay cut at least, but you also won't get a pay raise. In the 2018-2021 timeline people were getting huge raises each year. For the past 3 years, pay has been flat.>How well do they honor the unlimited paid time off policy? How many vacation days do y’all take every year?They honor it. I don't take a lot of time off, but that's a personal choice, but there are people on my team taking 30 days off per year easily. We don't really keep track honestly, there's no place to click some button to take time off. I just tell my manager my plans and then set my self as out-of-office on my google calendar and slack and that's about it.>How’s the parental leave policy and do they honor it wellAFAIK they do. There was someone in my greater org gone for nearly a year after their baby was born.>What do you think about the health insurance they offer?It's fine, pretty standard. The HSA plan is usually the clear winner.>Are there any signs of remote roles becoming fully in-person anytime soon?No, not at all. My org is almost entirely remote. The only rumor I've heard was from the Ads org requiring in-office, but that team is almost all ex-Meta and ex-Amazon, so who knows what those nerds are up to.",

They don't have to adapt as much as people who lets say change jobs every 2-5 years. So they usually don't stay as sharp because they didn't have to. They are used to the processes and they stop questioning them and so on. Of course there are some exceptions but so far thats what I've seen.",

Last i heard they shut down whole departments and replaced them with teams in India. Tbh i wasn’t surprised by the layoff since it was going around. I’m haven’t graduated so can’t tell what life will be like after the switch but what i can say is that while i was a coder I really couldn’t see a path that i wanted to take to further my career but as a nurse I do. Plus the lack of constant volatility in job market compared to SWE is great.",

That’s why I’m considering more “infrastructure” roles.I’m also thinking about moving out of IT completely, but I don’t know where to go.

Costs too much. They want someone good enough to grind hard without pay, and not ask questions.TLDR; the software market is declining hard (from interest rates and incompetent corporate leadership) and you might have to wait til 2027 when all this schizophrenic AI hype implodes for good.

I've worked in projects where, after several years working daily on the same codebase, I still only knew about 60% of it. Some people don't get past it, and continue struggling, but that's clearly not your case. And quitting your job probably won't help because on the next company you'll face the same problem, probably with less internal knowledge or stack familiarity.That was the psychological part. For the practical side, something that's really helped me recently with dealing with spaghetti codebases: use a tool like Claude Code or some other other CLI assistant to just analyze the project for you, explain succinctly what the major parts each do, and help you set up your dev environment.",

I'm in good health and active, and will work for another 2-3 years at least. I'm relatively up to date in many areas and tops in database / interoperability / architecture work. I had opportunities to work at FAANG maybe 20-25 years ago but uprooting the family wasn't worth it. Choices. Right now i take a solid month off every year, WFH, etc and it's pretty good overall. The biggest issue with us geezer coders is that we're often too critical of the current state of the art. I mean, i wanted a WYSIWYG React builder like what we had 30 years ago for X windows... You begin to see flaws with current technologies and processes (real or perceived). But you don't care to make noise about it.

Anyone who says the job market is fine is smoking something, but there are still some companies hiring, and I'd wager that new year new budgets new headcount is a thing.Where I've seen hiring is in the startup world. Big companies are all up their own ass about AI this and that, but the startup world still needs actual people.I'd say the same is true for some defense companies because their pockets are typically so deep that they will still hire people to build stuff.As for answers to your questions, I don't have any specifics, sorry. As for projects, I've put together some projects that had practical use and would be worth talking about. One idea was a file conversion script that could take medical imaging files (from ultrasounds, MRI, CT scans, etc.) and convert them into something actually usable by a normal person like a jpg/png. That took some thinking, but it's a good learning experience. Motivation for this one was personal experience in how godawful most of those systems are and how inconvenient it is for you, the patient, to see your own images.Another idea, albeit small, was to implement some of the common file compression algorithms and essentially make my own version of WinZip. There are a few \"easy\" ways to do it, but there are some way fancier methods out there that I found worth exploring.",

For DE roles specifically, focus on showing you're still sharp with the GCP stack since that's your strength. Maybe build something that showcases streaming data processing with Pub/Sub and Dataflow - like a real-time analytics dashboard for crypto prices or weather data, something you can demo live during interviews. 8-12 weeks is tight but doable if you split time between leetcode (maybe 30%), system design focused on data pipelines (40%), and building that one solid project (30%). Backend roles might actually be harder to break into without recent backend-specific experience, so I'd stick with DE where you have proven expertise.",

Doing some tinkering with AWS and getting familiar with their primitives would probably be one of the most impactful things you can do to increase your value in the job market, since it'll naturally open you up to lots more companies/stacks.Some thoughts inline for your other questions:> If you took a break or had a gap, what helped you come back and get hired?Get your story straight. Ideally, both your internal story (for yourself, what you wanted out of it, what you ended up getting) as well as your public story.But if you can only do one, get the public story *concise* and have the elevator pitch ready to deliver when the inevitable question comes up in the interview. You want 1-2 polished sentences about why you took the time off, what you accomplished, and how you're thinking about your return to full-time work.Practice telling the story, over and over, until it sounds natural.> Should I focus on DE roles again or pivot to backend/SWE?Remember that you also need to like the job you end up getting. ;) It's okay to focus, especially initially.If you do end up going for general backend/SWE roles, make sure to have different version(s) of your resume for those roles.> What’s a realistic plan for the next 8–12 weeks that actually improves interview outcomes?One underrated tool is mock interviews. Hire paid, experienced mock interviewers that actually have work and interview experience at the kinds of companies you want to join.Schedule at least one mock interview every couple weeks. That way, you're getting *real* feedback every couple weeks with specific guidance on what to work on.For me, right before my real interview, I also then loaded up one last wave of mock interviews to get in a bunch more practice.It gets expensive, but you should be able to make back everything (and more) with your signing bonus.> What do recruiters/hiring managers in India care about most when they see a 6 month gap?Oops... my advice is from experience in the US. Adjust accordingly. :)> Any suggestions for 1–2 “resume-worthy” projects that are actually useful (not a toy) and can be finished quickly?Paying for a training or a course certificate *from an actual credible source* can be a nice bullet point. It shows you're willing to invest in yourself, literally, and it shows you can learn on your own.Good luck! And don't beat yourself up about taking a break. It's *very* common. Professional athletes prioritize their rest days and rest weeks. It's totally okay for you to take care of yourself and prioritize rest in the same way.",

        "body": "welcome to adulthood.I felt a similar when I graduated. I was working in a hometown suburb parrellel to mine. And all my friends who stayed put, were turning into degenerates, getting hit hard by the opiate crisis, drinking, partying, etc. All the friends I respected moved to cool cities, were enjoying their life. I made a bad choice.I remember being alone in my apartment after college missing the chaos of my roommates and crying because I was so bored and lonely and nothing felt right. The girl I loved was still in school and she cheated one me, I had a lot of decision paralysis on what I could even do on my free time. Nothing felt good.So I researched \"Best cities to live in your 20s\" (this was 2015 mind you) and Denver popped up. I love outdoor activites, and wanted a city center where I could make friends. I wanted a fresh start. Most importantly, I did have an uncle who lived in a suburb there, and 1 single friend I could hangout with. It wasn't much, but it was enough of a safety net for me to take the leap.I changed my linkedin and resume address to say Denver.I got picked up by a recruiter, and they flew me out to a job in Denver for an interview. The culture was warm and chill, in a cool place, laid back, not overly corporate. It had plenty of other fresh grads, I could hangout with them. Beers in the fridge. End at 3:30 on friday and have some beers with my coworkers on other teams. I took a pay hit. Man I miss those days of pre-covid.Office cultures vary dramatically from office to office. Sounds like you have a shitty one.And it was so chill I'm still there today, even though I did switch teams. I also found my wife in this city.Everyone has different needs. Hopefully my story helps.Sadly it's a lot harder to land new jobs than it was in 2015. I'm currently shocked by this. But maybe you can investigate a similar approach that I took.EDITED a bit to add more context",

Everything is doable but if everyone aim for faang dont be surprised if 99% never get call back or are crushes during stupid interviews.Dont rely on crybabies on reddit because here is also specific bubble that complains on everything besides themselves.But straight to the point - project was something that sold me to the company. During interview i wasnt the best from theory and bullshit questions but i nadweręż on most of them anyway. I defended every decision i made in project- thanks god it was before shit AI times because probably i would then just copy pasted everything and then cry that no one calls me.I created pure backend api project with complex approach. Modular Monolith, DDD style modelling etc. Almost no one uses it in real life but at the fiest sight technic person seems that you didnt paste yt tutorial todo list but did something real. Obviously i got a lot of luck anyway but in my country leetcode style questions are uncommon and people try to find someone who solves real life problems and thinks about system, architecture, database.",

        "body": "Your resume has significant room for improvement I have some recommendations that could make a major difference in how recruiters perceive your candidacy.The most critical issue is your experience section. You have too many bullet points per role (standard is 3 to 5 maximum but since its one company around 5 is okay, maybe 6 if it’s really really worth it), and more importantly, they lack substance. When you write something like “Diagnosed systemic product-line defects, implemented robust fixes,” you’re not telling recruiters anything useful. What defect did you find? What made your fix robust? What changed as a result? Right now you’re describing tasks instead of demonstrating impact.Every bullet point should follow a simple structure: what you achieved, how you did it, and ideally with numbers to back it up. Instead of listing what you did, show what happened because you did it. Compare “Implemented automated testing” to “Cut deployment time from 6 hours to 45 minutes by building an automated testing suite in Jenkins that caught 80% of bugs before production.” One is forgettable, the other proves you deliver results.Your summary section needs to go entirely. It takes up valuable space without adding value, and it creates a wall of text that makes recruiters skip to the next resume. Remember, most people spend under 10 seconds scanning your resume initially. Every line needs to earn its place.With that space freed up, add more projects. Keep a rotating collection you can swap based on the role you’re applying for. Tailor them to highlight relevant skills for each position. Your current project description is far too vague and you’re missing an opportunity. If university teams are actually using what you built, name them specifically. That transforms a generic claim into proof of real-world impact.If you want to preserve some of the context your summary provided, move your skills section to the top. This immediately tells recruiters what you bring to the table and helps them understand everything else they read through that lens.Your formatting also has problems. Company name, job title, and dates should all be on one line for ATS compatibility. Include months with your dates, not just years. Separating projects from education will also improve scannability and make both sections easier to parse quicklyHope I don’t come off as too harsh. Good luck!",

VB basic? Nope, now on your resume is your built it with C#) etc.. etc... Companies do filtering on the keywords on your resume and if doesn't contain the words/tokens that are looking for , you will never get an interview.

It ended up being over a year - late-2021 to the end of 2022.Going into that hiatus I had no idea how long I'd stay jobless, and really it was more luck and timing that brought me back to the field more than anything else.> And how did you spend that time?Some of the bigger stuff...* Getting much more into cooking - I stopped dining out as much (somewhat for financial reasons, but also health reasons), and started focusing a lot more on actually cooking most of my food, and learning how to make a lot of different things* Started running - The pandemic and transition to WFH really did a number on me, health-wise. During my year off I ran nearly every day - I ran about 2000 miles in 2022. This is one of the lifestyle changes that really stuck with me even after returning to work.* Some trips - went camping, went on a few domestic and international trips* Seriously learn Japanese - I had been learning Japanese off and on for years, but toward the end of my hiatus I lived a few months in Tokyo and attended a Japanese language school. Massively improved my skills.* A lot of reading - normal literature, not tech/business books.* Getting _more_ cats - Through an unexpected confluence of events, I adopted a third cat.I basically did not touch a computer for the entire time I was off. I did do some light coding on some open source projects, and built a tiny service for a friend's workplace, but I'd say ~95% of the hiatus my computer stayed closed.> Did the time off change your definition of success, or your relationship with work?Not really. It instead changed my relationship with my finances.> Would you say it was worth it?In hindsight, yes. I really enjoyed my time off, though the biggest things I had to face were...* Actually needing to dip into money rather than have an income - My entire year-plus was funded by savings and dipping into investments. For reference, I'm married and at the time I left my job, I made 25x what my wife made (she was launching a business). I had no plan for any of this, the mental hump was huge after an entire career of never having to touch savings or investments.* Health insurance is fucking expensive - I live in a decent state when it comes to healthcare and insurance, and I had to buy marketplace insurance for the entire time I was unemployed. $1200/month for two people, for a medium-level plan. This, after spending years of paying $0 to a pittance for top-tier insurance from any employer I had.* Having a lot of unstructured time - the first couple weeks were almost surreal, waking up and having literally nothing to do.* Getting back into a \"I should probably work again\" mindset - I could have gone on for longer, though by the 12-month mark I was like \"yeahhh, I think my tech ennui has passed.\"But in terms of just having all that time to myself and thinking about how it got me to where I am today, yeah, worth it.",

He said while those times were enjoyable, having essentially end date looming really dampened things. Savings going down, bad job market, AI boom, and grueling interview process was weighing heavily on him in the second year so much so that he became a bit depressed towards the end. It took him closer to a year to find a job and get back to work and by then he has begun to dip into his retirement and moved back to his parents for a short stint. Nowadays, he seems to be doing a bit better but since the job is essentially the same he’s afraid of getting burnt out again sooner this time. Its getting to a point that hes thinking about switching career.Overall your mileage may varies as I have also heard of more positive case but one thing he did stress to keep in mind is that unless you gain some clarity or switch career you will most likely be getting back to the same type of job that burn you out in the first place.",

It’s usually far apart and u don’t have time to decide simultaneously. Yes u absolutely have to sign with the first one before their deadline. Ask graciously for an extension first (long one if possible) but if they don’t then u sign and if u renege later they will understand it’s due to their short timeframe.Another Strat is to use ur 2nd offer, if u get it, to negotiate the first one higher. Then if they refuse, then u renege and wont look as bad either.",

New Customers tell us what they use currently, And what they want from our software. Sometimes we already have a solution and I can change designs on the fly to meet their expectations or even create new dashboards while with them. But most of the time I specify new features with them. Then I also have to estimate how long it would take and cost. Back home we then create tickets. Plan them, put them in a sprint. Develop it, test it. If everything works out. I will call the customer again. And ask when they want to update. And if they need training on site. For the first 10 years I did this alone. Since we had only 4 developers in total (company was rather small with ~20 people)Since the company got bigger, we are now our own small team. 2 developers (including me). 1 sale. 3 consultants. While we all work in our corresponding department with others. We 6 have separate meetings where just the 6 of us plan customer requests, bugs new dashboard layouts or trainings for internal and external users. That whole experience changed the way I develop, since I do learn a lot how our customers actually use the product. And what is important to them. Most of them just want to see red or green numbers. They don't really care about how fast the filter is in the background. As long as it works and isn't \"slow\" they accept it.",

Im 8 YOE and im a mid-level in big tech (possilby could be senior by year's end). But if your manager is saying you are doing great, then id believe him.

I might've had a task like \"make bulk purchase orders from sales orders\" or something like that, and before I could even *begin* to think about creating a button to automate that, I'd be thinking \"what was a purchase order again? Who receives that and who gives that? Does that go from vendor to company? Or company to customer? What's the significance of this in the business process?\"The loops, conditional statements, SQL and variable fields were the easier parts of the job. But understanding why I'm doing what I'm doing was hard, and it made completing a task a much more monumental task than for the average business-knowledgeable person. And part of the job was scoping business requirements of clients, and providing advice for how to improve how they do things to have better utilization of the software product. :skull: So you can imagine how tough that was, when I have a surface-level \"i just Googled this term\" knowledge base. I remember my manager training me on how to set up a customer portal or a web form and in my head I'm thinking \"what are these? What is the point of these?\" My manager wouldn't cover that preliminary background knowledge, but would be covering how to implement it. I'd be too afraid to ask \"why?\" directly because I didn't want my manager to think negatively of me. I'd try to broach the topic by dancing around it with tangential questions, but I think my manager picked up on it and gave me feedback that I was asking too many common sense questions. :crying_face:>I've been an engineer for over 10 years from minimum wage at start-ups to $400k at big tech. I don't know what those things are either. Oh wow, so I guess it isn't necessary as a software engineer? My mom has been telling me to avoid client-facing jobs and do software jobs that are just me talking with people *within* the company. Maybe that's the move for me... but maybe one day I'd like to try being in a client-facing technical role (like Solutions Engineer) one day. Out of curiosity have you worked for a company that was in a business-related industry? Like Stripe, Paypal, Shopify, Salesforce etc? Does it hold you back there? I thought you'd need to know more about the business concepts to create new features or product changes for those kinds of companies.",

I don’t think you need to rush into it though. I would much rather focus on growing your SWE career, then getting into management and do well there. Once you’ve got good rapport and strong technical and managerial impact to point to, getting the MBA then can help you get to C-suite or give you leverage for starting your own business.

I was getting ready to switch careers a few years ago and then decided not to after the market turned for the worst. I still lurk this sub sometimes in case things change.Right now my teaching career is actually peak. I’m so experienced that nothing phases me anymore. I know my curriculum like the back of my hand. I don’t even need to plan anymore and can just walk into the classroom with nothing but a topic I’m supposed to teach and I can instantly deliver an engaging lecture on it. I have a huge arsenal of assignments that I can use to match my lessons. Most of the assignments are auto graded and my workflow allows me to not take any grading home at all. The kids are good, never give me any trouble, and generally speak highly of my class. I make 115k doing roughly 1300 hours a year and will get a fat pension when I’m done so I don’t have to really save for retirement at all.HOWEVER.The first 7 years were absolutely brutal. That’s the period of every teacher’s career regardless of how smart or talented you are that you just have to grind out 9-10 hour work days 6 days a week during the school year just to keep your head above water. There’s no way to avoid it. Nobody tells you what to do, which is a good thing until it isn’t. Your main motivator to actually work this hard is that if you don’t actually deliver a good lesson, your classroom management goes to shit. No matter how good the kids are, if you start disengaging them or showing up unprepared, kids will eat you alive. They lose respect for you very quickly so you’re putting in the hellish hours just to make sure that you’ve timed everything out to perfection and that every moment is interesting (don’t forget your competing with TikTok brains these days).Oh and you likely won’t be able to teach all AP CS or whatever you’re interested in. You’ll likely have to teach 2 or 3 separate courses over the 5 classes you’re given, which means you double/triple the amount of planning you need to do for no extra pay.It’s an absolutely exhausting job that turns into a still exhausting but easy job after you’ve put in the first few years of hell.",

I think that gives a slightly misleading impression ie developing iOS itself vs developing iOS apps. Secondly, like those skills feel nothing-y to me. How is a language a skill, then you list all the rest of it and I can’t tell if you’ve just copied a list of buzzwords online. How skilled are you at using any of that? What’s your level of exposure and proficiency in all of that? finally, it’s best practice where I am to put your most recent job first then old jobs afterwards. So you’re supposed to lead with your most current experience which should obviously be your strongest experience ie they can see a sense of progression from where you are now vs before. Instead I’m not seeing any progression on your CV, you’ve actually added more bullets on your oldest job than your newest job? That makes me think your newest job is a downgrade as you’re not working on things worth writing about. Plus you’re listing a bunch of tasks but I can’t see where you added value or what you did well or anything that makes you better than another candidate. Even in your education you’ve given no context as to what you actually studied- not all degree programs cover the same content. What did u study that specifically is relevant to the job? Highlight that.",

It’s definitely harder than getting a regular job but honestly just requires a lot of preparation. The more experience you have the easier it becomes as well.My current company only really hires interns and new grads from top 10 schools, and in the case of new grads you need 1+ FAANG or similar internship as well.For intermediates and seniors though, we hire anyone who we think is experienced enough and can pass our interview.My advice to you is spend the next 3-4 years excelling at your current job as much as you possibly can, and take on as much responsibility and difficult projects as you can.When you’re ready to hop, spend about 4-6 months slowly preparing for interviews. I did 1 hour of leetcode per workday and 8 hours of system design and behavioural prep on the weekends for about 4-6 months and was able to get multiple offers.",

From what I've seen, there's a good number of senior level people from the linkedins and instacarts of the world applying for those roles, so that's your competition.Ideally, you'll have gone through at least one project end-to-end (from design to maintenance) to be able to speak about it coherently, and there's specific interview structure formulas that you'd normally want to practice.If you're planning to boomerang, then you don't necessarily need to target the high end jobs in SF, a lot of regular roles in US pay more just from currency exchange, but also not all of them are necessarily open to dealing w/ the legalities of TN visa expiration.",

I can count up to 10 projects that I would begin and then never have the motivation to want to finish them. I struggled immensely with backend development. It was so hard to pick up and start that when it came time to work on any backend stuff (after finishing the frontend) for my projects, I would just cave in and give up.

This isn't the same for everyone, but I have definitely started to enjoy working on projects more at home. Hopefully when you start your new position, you can use the knowledge you learn and apply it to your personal projects. That is what has helped me gain motivation to want to create and develop personal projects on my free time.",

Adult hackathons are usually more like marathons/sprints, because we don't have time or energy for those 24 hour deadlines. Usually more like between 1 week and several weeks. Having a deadline and a team will make you feel obliged to finish something (even if it's not great), while also having a ton of creative freedom because you have no manager or customer expectations.You could also propose to your HR / manager to do a corporate hackathon, but that's more of a move for career progression than fun.",

I'd imagine the pay wasn't great, and he probably compensated for it with equity. I don't know for sure, but my expectation is that's the norm.It's a lot like getting an internship. They don't have money. You don't have experience. You meet in the middle and you both win a little and lose a little. It's not great. It's not terrible.",

And also, from an industry point of view, your skills in AI don’t really sound like anything useful. At this point in time a majority of companies still need software engineers that know how to write resilient, secure, and easily-maintainable software. That is what is driving business value, not AI in the slightest. The only companies where any of your project “experience” would be worth a damn, are a select very few (and very elite) organizations, and even so, they aren’t hiring juniors with a Bachelor’s degree to do that type of work. You were sold the great big AI lie. Go write some crud apps with high quality code, learn SOLID principles, and demonstrate knowledge of programming/architectural concepts.

I bartended previously, and tripled my income when I accepted my first job. fwiw I graduated in 2022 when the job market was more favorable - it still wasn't easy back then, and it is *much* more competitive now and it is actually very hard to enter the industry.That said, there is opportunity in this field, but you should know that it is extremely competitive and difficult to enter, and the work can be very demanding. When job hunting for my first role, being a mid-life career changer played to my advantage because I was up against 22 year olds with no attention span and no adult workforce experience, so I was an easy choice against them. Being in school was actually fun, I made great relationships with my professors. But the job itself? Not at all what I expected it to be. I love computers and I love building things, I like writing code and I like problem solving, I taught myself PHP when I was in high school and I got a 4.0 when I got my CS degree. The reality? This job is mostly meetings and paperwork and politics and all of that corporate doldrum, paired with high expectations for intellectual output from deep task work that you are expected to somehow find time for between all those meetings (or do at home after hours). You know that feeling when you were in school and it was exam day and your brain felt like jelly at the end? I arrive home every day feeling like that. This is only my experience, and I am only 4 years in at this point and this is anecdotal, but honestly I am actually considering switching careers again. Others surely have had better experiences. But for me- the job is insanely stressful, the constant pressure to meet a perpetually raising bar and always learn new things, the horrendous demoralizing job search process, the on-call expectations and non-existent work life balance boundaries, the corporate politics hunger games, the cognitive dissonance of contributing to immoral corporations, the inability to escape AI, the constant anxiety of pip or layoff and the stack-ranking... the list goes on. My financial life has improved considerably, but my health in literally every other way has gotten considerably worse. I would love to take a more relaxed lower-paying job, but can't find one. I know that people love to say that engineers don't know how good they have it unless they've done manual labor or been in other industries, and I do think that is true in many ways. The money is insane if you can land a job at big tech and can be life changing, and it is true that many engineers seem to have no clue that they are rich and that this salary is not normal. But also, I was a service industry worker for over a decade, so I have perspective on being at a low income person and, well, I actually think I was healthier and happier and had it better back then. This is not sustainable but I feel like I cant leave because I don't think I'll have opportunity to make this kind of money again. I look around and most people at the office don't seem happy, they all seem stressed out.",

Remote work also means you're competing with the entire country or world.People who are only in it for the money, or very average, are going to have a hard time finding work even if they have experience or a CS degree.If you really enjoy technology, have a knack for computers, and like building things, then it might still be worth a shot.

Phrase it as a company focus for efficiency. The more tests you have, the faster new features can be created and the less time you have to spend fixing unseen bugs. As the sole developer, this should be part of your job, find the ways to speed up development without sacrificing security.

So if you're working in a space largely related to web/backend for example, then things like a raytracer or an emulator aren't gonna be relevant, whereas some sort of web app probably would.Recruiters in general can't tell how relevant something like three.js is or isn't to e.g. CI/CD pipelines.

For the hiring manager round, we'll want to ask probing questions to see whereabouts you are in terms of your engineering competencies and hopefully get some indication that you would be able to ramp up on the target role.

There's SO little in this niche to compare to. I've talked to another founder that had been in business for two years with 32% churn, but they also had a free trial AND they're dying now so IDK lol.Most churners give price or lack of features as the reason. My pricing is pretty standard compared to the closest popular equivalent services and may even be a little low (multiple MBAs have suggested charging more) so I'm guessing the best play is just to hammer out more features.I feel great about the numbers but at the same time there's a lot of signals that would traditionally be red flags, but may not necessarily be for this endeavor specifically.

If volume is part of your strategy (and at this point it kind of has to be), SimpleApply keeps coming up when people talk about this exact problem.It automates the application grind and tailors your materials for each role, so you can hit way more positions without burning out on the repetitive form-filling. Worth checking out since you're already in spam mode anyway but need better targeting and customization. Beyond tools tho, get someone to review your resume.No-name school doesn't matter as much as you think if your projects are solid and your resume isn't getting filtered out by ATS for dumb formatting reasons. Also look at smaller companies and startups, not just the big names that get 10k applicants per role",

I speak as someone graduating from an online masters program while working fulltime.Yes, it's effectively a soft reset on being able to seek out internships and new grad roles.Ask yourself, how much better is the master's degree you're going for than your bachelor's degree? Are you a lot better at leetcode now compared to then? Do you think you could land internships that would improve your resume?Your outcomes will depend entirely on the prestige of the degree, and internships and/or research you do during your degree. Think about it though, that's exactly the same as undergrad.But yeah, it could be beneficial if you take advantage of the opportunity fully. It might not be worth it financially unless you landed a big tech job or unicorn with equity, but I do have friends who did exactly that. Either way though, as long as you land some role in the subfield you want, you'll be able to pay off the tuition eventually and you might be happier in the new role than your current one.If you're just doing it for money or something, I'd just stick to part time online.

On the one hand, failed side hustles are all too common, but on the other hand, compound interest eventually becomes a runaway train in terms of effort-to-reward ratios.If you're looking to scratch the hustler lifestyle itch, then sure, keep at something until income grows to some ramen profitable range and beyond, that takes time and commitment through possibly years worth of rough patches.Time is the one thing that you can spend that you will never get back. There's different ways to think about it, from hustling hard in early years to free yourself up later (FIRE) to balancing WLB such that you get reasonable chunks of free time throughout your otherwise busy life.",

Ask what they expect of you, get a clear framework you can work with. Pair program with the seniors, ask to be involved as someone who watches and learns. I think it's also really valuable to make yourself known to other teams. See how other teams work and how you fit into the bigger picture. See what their pain points are. I made myself valuable by starting to understand work processes and bottlenecks and evaluating how to improve these. I suggested for example a custom integration for slack with Jira. This was one of the problems I worked on on my own to improve friction points for the wider business. My first end to end solution for a problem basically.I think being proactive is great. There will be an amount of hand holding of course, but showing you see the bigger picture makes you a valuable asset for the company. Learn the codebase. Use the search function and see how things were implemented. You can learn a lot by seeing and understanding how others before you have built things.Learn about the industry you are working in. I work in fintech and had no prior knowledge before in this industry. It felt overwhelming the first months but being a year in now I feel much better equipped understanding industry lingo, regulations and what matters when building solutions.I think the anxiety of not delivering good enough value is very normal in the beginning, even my partner who is a senior has this in every new role.Document your wins!Good luck, you will be amazing!",

I would definitely say, probably like a lot of people, my biggest challenge is identifying things to act on. Guess it makes sense to feel uncertain though.
