Some candidates tried inviting an AI \"note taker\" to the Teams call, that was denied access and was an immediate red flag (not one of them \\*asked\\* if they could do so).We then had people who seemed to hesitate before answering any question. Once or twice, nerves, every single question? It's pointing the way of stalling before waiting to see the text appear for them to regurgitate! There's also the tell of the eye darting off screen to read something... could be notes, but... given what they then said, it just gave the impression of reading from either someone else googling on their behalf, or AI LLM output.But every single one was derailed by this one simple trick... as hiring manager, I was interviewing the person for them, not their technical skills. There was some of that, but more in approach and mentality, rather than specific abilities, that would come in the next round. So I would just say to the candidate \"You have listed these ETL tools on your CV, which is your favourite and why?\"Every single time, the ones reading AI output would turn into a marketing bot, sounding like an advert for the tools, bullet point after bullet point. Not one of them highlighted a favourite without being asked again, and then couldn't actually answer definitively as to why they chose that above another, almost as if they'd just picked one at random. The humans answering that question would do so in a conversational manner, often immediately blurting out their favourite and then going through the pros and cons as to why.I can see the appeal of using AI to help, to act as a pointer to guide your answers, especially in areas of theory where you're rusty because you've been at the coalface for a while. But don't rely on it 100% to the point where you cannot actually hold a conversation with the person you're talking to.",

Many “new” platforms are abstractions over familiar engines (Spark) anyway.Most content creators aren’t learning everything from scratch each time; they’re reapplying the same approach to new tools. Once you’ve done that a few times, picking up a new stack is a breeze. Also, free tiers and cheap cloud setups make experimentation easy. You don't have to break your bank to spin up a Spark cluster. I’ve worked across multiple stacks as a consultant, and my approach has stayed the same: understand data, compute, movement, and modelling. The tool is just the means to get there.",

I ask chatGPT to write scripts, read logs, research solutions, etc. THIS is the new iteration of software engineering and by extension data engineering. If you’re not using AI at your job, you’re falling behind. Having said that, I’m still up to date on technology, I still read documentation, and I review every single line of code chatGPT writes without exception. If I don’t understand what it’s doing, I research it. If I’m skeptical on what the script does, it does not make it into prod. No exceptions. A word of caution, we had someone on our team write a script with AI and run it without reviewing. They deleted a bunch of data from the database without knowing. We had back ups, but there was data that went missing. When asked about the obviously ChatGPT written script they could not explain what it did or why.",

This collection is my own, sure I may have learnt some of the technique from Stack or documentation, but the code in the log is applied to my own circumstance so the knowledge is retained better.

However, I've had a totally different Fabric experience. Never had anything fail, been working super efficiently, and easy to debug. Granted, coming from a 3rd party tool with zero visibility. My data complexity, scale, and user base is a little higher than what you listed, but my entire backend fits easily on an F4.For my approach, I only used Spark (pyspark or spark sql) and a medallion approach. All the cdc pipelines work great, and I haven't had any issues.I have to ask, how come you can't use mirroring for your on-prem sql? Or at least spark if not mirroring.For the front end, I just approached it via segmentation of capacity. So, each business domain only throttles themselves. But that doesn't happen much since nobody uses paginated reports, and the data models are pretty clean.Honestly, I'd still rather use Databricks, but my problem is I can't justify it to my organization since I made the Fabric site work too well on its own...",

Everyone rushed pushing pipelines into production without proper models, processes, conventions and standards in place. Data Modeling is not easy skill to obtain and requires lot of effort, time and multitude skills. My current teams uses data vault and dimensional modeling frameworks, it takes time to get to final data marts and views on top but we rarely have pipeline issues (DBT, Snowflake). We spend lot of time upfront, which saves lot of money and reduce development time and effort down the line, which is the right way of doing things. When we face any ELT issues, then we go back to the data model and analyze on how to de-couple, optimize the model without breaking the grain at times. It saves lot of load times in some of those big fact tables.  The issues I also noticed and I made those mistakes as well, shove tons of metrics into a fact table and calculate them at the fact table level. Instead those metrics should be calculated at one layer up (business vault or raw vault) layer and just load them as is into fact table. Fact table should be a simple select * from xyz tables. There's so many things that can go wrong in a pipeline and data model can solve many of those. We normally do a hands off to our DE's of our data models and mapping docs, it makes their life whole lot easier and efficient at times.",

Unfortunately CTOs will lap it up because data modelling takes time and expertise, and therefore money. AI produces superficially easy results that appear reasonable enough on first glance. But AIs don’t actually know anything about your business so they will confidently tell you things that are completely wrong, or which are true but not the correct answer to your question. Data modelling is not primarily a technical discipline, it is about extracting human-understandable meaning from what is otherwise just a bunch of ones and zeroes. It requires understanding your business deeply, and understanding what the business cares about and needs to measure.  This meaning is often not directly available in your raw data. You have to translate it for a business user.Now this is where the AI grifters will tell you “oh sure the AI isn’t great at that now but it’s going to get better with better models”. And sure, it will. But even when you have better models that can more accurately translate the user’s intent into a correct answer, you will still have the problem that each individual user is having a separate conversation with an AI. Bob might ask for revenue figures for last month, the AI asks him how to define revenue and gives him a correct answer based on his definition. Jenny has a separate conversation with the AI and gives a slightly different definition and the AI gives her a correct but DIFFERENT answer. So how do you fix this situation and ensure that Bob and Jenny get the exact same answer for revenue? You have to make sure there is a source that has the correctly calculated and verified definition of revenue ready for the AI to use. And what do we call this process? Data modelling!If anything, data modelling only gets more important in the age of AI. Since in the past when you had highly technical data and BI analysts answering the questions for you, you could rely on them having enough knowledge and expertise to work around the complexities and problems of the data. But in a world where every Bob, Jenny, and Harry with no technical knowledge expects to be able to ask the AI for answers themselves, you better be damn sure that it is working off a highly curated and verified source.",

It's not just one pattern though, it's sticking with whatever pattern makes sense for your company and ensuring it doesn't end up in a pile of irreconcilable shit. I don't see a huge reason to do dimensional modeling anymore other than your downstream tools may like it and it's useful if you have a lot of cross-subject rate calculations that benefit from conformed dimensions. A lot of businesses don't need that though and are fine with stuff like OBTs and master data and those help them move faster.I am also skeptical that we are going to see a lot of usefulness with LLMs and data any time soon. I think AI is very useful as a tool to help build pipelines and tools, but not as much for accessing data right now. Data models can be massive with lots of tables, columns and semantic descriptions for the content, so you end up flooding the context window and confusing the model (most of which is irrelevant context to the problem). A lot of the definitions are weird so don't align well with the model's training and people also ask the same question 20 different ways, which can lead to inconsistent answers. The way I have seen people trying to make AI systems that work is by slowly building up the model and keeping it small (i.e. not the enterprise model you are used to). So in the end it can only answer simple questions like \"tell me how much revenue we earned from product X in the last three months\". Given how much time you spend building and tuning the model until you feel like it works most of the time, isn't it faster to just give them a dashboard with the same capability and better accuracy? Also the user community is thinking that they will be able to prompt the model to do a deep dive that an analyst would spend a week on and that's just not reality.",

Departments will build their own vision on top of the mess you supply them with. I had a discussion lately with a professor ranting how multiple versions of the truth can coexist but believe me, companies just want 1 version. In the end, you don't want to have senior level management have a discussion in a meeting about what a cost center is, what data is correct, on what date FTE stats are calculated for reports and what the source is of all of this (that, in effect, will surge your indirect costs, drop the trust in your solution and eventually have management question why in gods name they hired those engineers).",

Using AI is completely fine as long as you understand the code it produces and could reason about it yourself.Same idea with tooling. A GCP or AWS cert is useful, not because you will be an expert in every service, but because it expands your mental map of what tools exist and what they are good at. You can always go deep and learn them properly when you actually need them.",

You're lacking that mercantalist attitude and, without realising that the market is pretty solid right now letting organisations pay you a junior level salary (yes, a junior salary for companies with a strong tech culture) with 4 YOE.This isn't always a hard skills problem. This is also a softskills problem. Sorry to break it to you but markets do not operate on merit alone. It's also who you know, who you get to know, and timing. I was working a junior salary for the longest time (40k a year junior dev) and then I went right up to 170k/year as of today. I was lucky to have the Elixir slack group back in the day sit me down and have this talk with me and make me realise I'm letting myself get hustled (or fleeced if you're a northerner like me :) ) because I lack the self confidence to apply for positions that pay a respectable income, in the UK, above what a copywriter makes. I think you need to work more towards becoming a software enigneer and less of a tooling engineer. But even with your experience I'd estimate you should be able to pull at least 30k more in more of a devops role. There are a LOT of companies with broken data pipelines. Your job is to get street wise.",

Understanding what needs to be measured, how to measure it, and then building the pipelines.Some core skills that you need to be really good at in todays modern data tech stack world are these:- Strong SQL, i.e. its like reading and writing english- DBT, don’t let a new tool intermediate you, it’s just SQL queries orchestrated in an autogenerated DAG. - Data QA, building pipelines where data quality tests are first class citizens. The moment your dashboard shows one wrong number people instantly loose trust in your data assets. Better to delay data availability then delivering and redacting later.Some tools to look into:- Airbyte for data ingestion- Superset and Metabase for BI tools- Duckdb",

However, IME for very complicated jobs, the catalyst query optimizer behind Spark performs better than the other two - if you have more than 10ish non-broadcast joins in a given query, I would rather trust spark. You will need to spend more time on a dev setup (e.g. unit tests are awfully slow without a spark connect server which you fire up each morning), but you also get some goodies such as Spark UI/History Server and a really powerful and stable API.- As you are using Delta, I would be cautious with duckdb. Afaict, write support is not yet there, and even for reads I had undocumented not-implemented errors bubble up from the internal c++ code (on1.41 if I remember correctly). The API there does not yet look super stable.- On the off chance that you are in a corporate environment where your development machines run windows, strongly prefer polars over spark. Delta spark on windows is possible but a pain because of the Hadoop dependency.",

        "body": "100% agree but in the past 6 months AI agents have really changed how my team and I work.As I was writing the stuff below I realized it became too long... so here's a summary.TLDR; going from first using agents to improve our data pipelines and stack, to eventually creating a more self-service system where our data consumers use AI agents to interact with the data. For some context, I'm leading the DE team of 4-5 people (1 mid/senior, 1 junior, 2-3 interns) at a company where our end product is predictions for highly specialized industries (e.g. renewables, transportation).At first it started with using our data platform's MCP with cursor to just lookup documentation, then I started asking cursor to read our data pipelines and query the dwh directly to find the specific part of a query or script that was causing some issue.But in the past couple months, after creating some extensive agent rules/instructions documentations as well as creating a md file for each pipeline that contains some business context, I have been able to fully rely on cursor to build pipelines or make major changes.A recent example is that I spent \\~1 hour creating a details requirements document that I gave as the prompt, the agent make changes to \\~10 files (mostly sql models and some yml configs and a python ingestion script). About 3-4 hours of back and forth with the agents to make some adjustments, update documentation, and runs tests and validation. The entire process was done in a single workday, whereas normally this would've been 2-3 days of work.Its not always about \"saving\" time for me but rather its about doing things the \"better\" way - a clear example of this is having the agents create/update documentation, build/run tests, perform adhoc validations, etc. which translates into time saving in the futureI know what I've said above is not related to \"AI on top of broken data stack\", but the reason why I'm talking about how AI is helping data engineers is because I think it that is the sole reason/contributor to speeding up the process of fixing and improving our data stack.By fully utilizing the combination of cursor, mcp integrations, internal rules/instructions/context documents, and access to query our data warehouse, we were able to \"slap AI on top of our data\" as in:\\- other teams (i.e. data science, software engineering, product, etc.) to also close our data engineering repos and have conversations with cursor to ask it about the logic behind data models (e.g. does table\\_xyz contain data from source\\_abc? how often does table\\_xyz get updated? what is the calculation method for kpi abc?)\\- integration of an AI Slackbot (provided by our data platform provider) that queries our dwh and returns insights - as a result, we have seen people in data science, sales, execs, etc. move away from using dashboards and instead asking the slackbot directly inside threads things like \"what was our prediction accuracy last week?\" \"how did model A perform vs model B last year?\"I think this only became possible because we were able to quickly (within 2-3 months) clean up our data pipelines and data models, create a lot of documentation and context for AI to utilize, and break down the barrier between data consumers and the data itself - this way as the data engineering team, we are no longer a bottleneck and things have finally trending towards the \"self-service\" utopia we've always dreamt about.",

This can be a specific person/team or it can be one of the checklist items (if your company is small enough) that every system owner is required to certify for acceptance.And it has to include backups, logs and analytics. It is a lot of work up front, identifying the rules and what that needs to look like, but the maintenance part of that is generally straightforward.Honestly, in my experience the hardest part is getting the requirements clearly defined, as business users seldom want to give up old data; which is exactly what this is about.",

There might be other tools (BI tools, proxies, etc) that have built in support for more popular platforms that won't work with MotherDuck out the box. None of these are particularly insurmountable, just costs you should be happy to take on in exchange for the experience you like. One thing you might do to hedge is store data at rest in Iceberg on GCS and self host a catalog like \\[Lakekeeper\\](https://docs.lakekeeper.io/). Then your data is completely portable. If you for some reason determine you need to switch to Snowflake or Databricks, they can read data form this catalog and you don't have to move anything. Or you may even find out you want MotherDuck for most things but have specific use cases where another engine like Clickhouse is useful. This approach lets you separate the concerns of how the data is stored from what product(s) you use to query it.",

It is not a super complicated stack but it *is* work and creates an additional point of failure, especially with the networking and security side of it imo.

After 2-3 months I had established myself and most of the team would run things past me/listen to my recommendations on how to tackle things. I felt like the grown up in the room and slowly leaned into it until my boss suggested that he wanted to put me on track to be the senior at the next evaluation period.

Then after that, become familiar with at least one major cloud provider. AWS, Azure, GCP. Be strategic here. I’ve noticed specific industries prefer one vs the others. Your data analyst background should have given you ample knowledge on how to create tables (ideally in sql, but I think understanding excel tables and pivot tables help too). Data exploration is an important skill, but understanding schemas and how they fit together is the crucial part. Your data analyst background should help with data modeling as well. Try to focus on roles that highlight these things in the job description. Also be aware that there are different flavors of data engineers. Being analytics focused means you’re more on the business intelligence and dashboarding side. Highlight your storytelling and data vis exp. If you’re on the ML side, highlight how you productionize ML models and maintain workflows.",

Picking up AWS on top of Azure is way easier than starting from zero.For getting your foot in the door, I’d stick with Azure as your “primary” stack, but get just enough AWS exposure to be conversational and not blocked in interviews. You don’t need to master both.Also, product companies preferring AWS isn’t a hard rule, it’s just more common historically. Plenty of good teams care more about how you think than which cloud you used last.So no, you don’t need to panic learn everything.

Management say 'I want real time' and a data engineer hears 'use Kafka' - but what management actually mean is 'i check this every morning and want it to be up to date' so you could probably get away with orchestrating a batch update every morning.I've also seen people use pyspark for data that is easily small enough to handle without spark. They just think 'but this is what everyone else is using so I should use it'.The annoying thing is, if you have good judgement and figure out the most appropriate tech to use, that can get in the way of upskilling if you settle on a simple, cheap but more mundane alternative.If you want to learn some of the things you listed:- if you're using snowflake, why not just start using dbt + git to manage your SQL?- how is data getting into snowflake in the first place? If that looks quite manual at the moment, maybe try setting up airflow to schedule data extraction / loadI think you could probably find opportunities to do things you want to - obviously not all of it but maybe have a think about what's possible",

Once you have that understood the next big thing is fixing stuff which is broken / diagnosing issues / defensive coding in advance before it breaks - here you learn patterns, what can go wrong, why backing loads off and re-running isn't magic. From there you should be able to design decent overall data models, talk with people in detail about what approach should be taken and point out issues in advance before anything has been coded, at this point you're working as much on people skills as hard technical skills.It's tempting, because of the flood of shitty job ads, to think you need tool X or intricate knowledge of language Z, but the reality in terms of being capable has nothing to do with those, unless you're a typical recruiter.",

You’re spot on about batch jobs quietly being the best fit for so many “real time” requests.On upskilling, experimenting with dbt + git is a great move even if it’s not in prod at your current job. Same with Airflow—just automating even one small pipeline can help you understand DAGs and scheduling. And if you want to broaden a bit into API stuff but aren’t getting those projects at work, there are plenty of open datasets out there you could ETL into Snowflake as a side project. Sometimes the best way to get experience is just faking a “business need” for yourself.Ultimately, don’t sweat the trend-hopping; being able to design and maintain stable, clear data products is way rarer (and more valuable) than knowing every tool under the sun.",

It’s never happening, don’t try.My advice: be practical and treat the old stuff like it’s cancer that needs to be cut out.Don’t try to document the mess you have. Instead build or fix things one piece at a time and document that as you go. Build in parallel, dual run against the old things, and when you know the old tables and batches are redundant, take them out back and shoot them in the head.Also, forget AI. It knows when I’ve forgotten to close a print statement in my shitty code, but it doesn’t know architecture or systems design.If you want to automate this, try the missing index reports. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-missing-index-groups-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17Be wary, this reflects what queries are written and run (probably by the same useless engineers that made this mess) rather than the actual logic and definitions that matters. So a badly written query moving data no one needs will be boosted in the output ranking. But it’s the clearest indication you’ll get of what the entry patterns into your tables are and what is missing and will help you prioritise.",

It's great.Where I work I use the MySQL v8 ODBC in a Windows server running MSSQL in prod, and push tables across the network truncate/load in a remote staging tables of a MySQL server (that the Wan IP addresses & ports are fixed and whitelisted for security). Once the load is completed, a stored proc is called remotely to signal the MySQL to process those staging tables.It's an annoying process though, I would rather create flat files, push them somewhere, and an event triggered at the remote end (like a datalake container/folder) processes them. I could then make JSON data and send that, also based on events.IOW, JDBC/ODBC between servers is a \"work-around\" solution, and it's slow. Like 45 mins to send 2 gigs of data.HTH",

There is 0 gain from making it a snapshot and eating the storage and eventually processing speed. I wouldn't worry too much about what others think of how and where the data should work in theory. Theory rarely ever applies in the real world, the data and how you get it dictates what you do and in this field most cases, you have 0 control over the source of the data. Which means almost nothing operates like it should and you just have to get the data as accurate as possible, as efficiently as possible space, and processing wise. To me, Bronze always matches source, or at least as close to it as you can possibly get. If it doesn't, you are going to have a horrible time running down why things don't match up. Snapshotting like option A is really only good for if you need to see how things have changed over time, or doing day to day comparisons at the Bronze level and I'd rarely ever want to do that because that's honestly a waste of space and processing. As for Option C, I would avoid anything that makes data right after the fact and there's a point in time where non-dirty read data is inaccurate. That's asking for someone or something to query it when it isn't fixed yet and you running down nonsense for a day.",

It’s broad but Snowflake-specific: architecture, micro-partitions, cost/performance tradeoffs, security, time travel, data sharing. Not hard conceptually, but very “do you know how Snowflake actually works.”The advanced certs are role-based rather than general:* Architect / Admin are very environment and governance-heavy* Data Engineer is focused on data movement, pipelines, performance tuning* Analyst / Data Scientist are narrower and more SQL / workflow orientedThey’re aimed at people with \\~2 years of real Snowflake experience, and honestly feel more like validation than learning tools.For recruiter visibility, Core is the one most people recognize. The advanced ones mostly matter once you’re already operating in that role.If you’ve done GCP DE/Architect, the biggest difference is that Snowflake exams go deeper on platform mechanics but stay inside the Snowflake box instead of testing broad cloud design patterns.",

Chunking with pandas is a solid approach for memory management, but you do have to be careful: some operations just don’t make sense chunk-by-chunk.Chunking is great for row-wise, stateless preprocessing (cleanup, type conversion, basic feature engineering). But for anything that needs a full view of the data—global normalization, deduplication, calculating rare category frequencies, finding global min/max—you’ll either need multiple passes or a clever accumulation/aggregation step.A typical workflow for your scenario:- First pass: Scan over chunks to gather global stats (means, stds, value counts, rare category thresholds).- Second pass: Use those stats to transform the data in chunks. Outlier detection, normalization, etc. can be done chunked, but with knowledge of global parameters.- Save intermediate files as Parquet if possible, for speed and compression.- Tools: Dask and Polars both handle these kinds of workflows better than vanilla pandas, especially Polars for very fast I/O and multi-threading.- For Colab: keep an eye on disk (mount Google Drive if needed), and be ready to restart if you hit session limits.If you ever need to empower less technical folks to safely interact with this data (without risking direct DB access), there are platforms nowadays that let you build internal apps over your datasets via drag-and-drop, or even AI chat interfaces. Could help with democratizing those big data insights beyond just the Python crowd.But for now: chunking + multi-pass over Parquet files + Dask/Polars is the combo I’ve seen work well in similar RAM-constrained settings. Good luck wrangling those 30 million rows!",

Sorting 32 million rows lazily before streaming isn't stable or either crashes in colab.

At 30M rows, this almost always triggers an OOM (Out of Memory) crash in environments like Colab.​Serialization Overhead: Converting DuckDB’s internal format to Pandas and then to a model-ready format creates unnecessary CPU work and memory duplication.​Moving to Polars solved this because it feels like it was built for the 'Model' part of 'Data Science.' Since it uses the Apache Arrow memory format, it integrates seamlessly with XGBoost, LightGBM, and Scikit-Learn with zero-copy potential meaning the model can often read the data directly without doubling the RAM usage.​The Lazy API and Streaming mode let me handle the full 30M-row feature engineering pipeline with way more stability. I can build complex transformations (scaling, encoding, joins) and only 'collect' the data when the model is ready for it. It's definitely the move if you're looking to build a scalable, production-ready ML pipeline!",

Then for every IsDeleted propagate into silver and gold according to the business rules what they want to do. So convert, yes, but see how some things can be improved later. Not having staging but having a DL and bronze only is a future headache. Especially that cloud distributed databases like Snowflake do not enforce any constraints.",

Two quick pushes though: I wouldn’t drop line items entirely (you’ll want them for margin/returns/cohort/LTV and subscription analysis), but you can keep them in a separate table/partition and only join when needed; and I’d strongly consider adding a lightweight transform layer (dbt or even scheduled SQL) so your “business tables” (orders, customers, subscriptions, spend) are stable and not raw connector schemas.For costs/lock-in: biggest surprise costs are usually (1) Looker exploring raw wide tables, (2) GA event data blowing up, and (3) Airbyte sync volume if you pull too much too often. oh yeah also get budgets/alerts in GCP day 1, partition/cluster core tables, and create curated views for Looker so analysts aren’t querying raw. Also, if you ever want less lock-in later, keeping transforms in dbt + storing raw exports (GCS) makes migrating much easier than relying on tool-specific modeling.",

Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam is an excellent university for Data Engineering studies, propably TU Berlin as well. That said, Munich (TUM is excellent for CS), Frankfurt (finance) or Cologne/ Düsseldorf probably are also solid choices.

A few design things that usually matter more than model choicee would be like always ground generation on the actual schema + metrics layer, not just table names. Most failures come from the model guessing joins or columns, Add a validation step before execution (dry run, limits, blocked queries). Don’t let raw generated SQL hit prod blindly. Start narrow, Constrain what users can ask for (time ranges, metrics, dimensions) before going fully “chatty”. On the knowledge side, most teams I’ve seen keep it simple, Use RAG for business logic, definitions, metric semantics,Treat schema and relationships as structured input, not embeddings.GraphRAG helps when relationships are complex, but it adds a lot of operational overhead.Solr *can* work for retrieval, but it’s usually better as a search layer than a true graph store. If relationships matter a lot, a dedicated graph or just explicit schema metadata often ends up clearer and more reliable. and correctness and guardrails beat clever architecture early. If users don’t trust the numbers, they won’t use it, no matter how good the UX is",

        "body": "Just like another commenter suggested, the text to SQL is not the hard part, it’s the trust in the data, queries, and establishing context using metadata and business jargon. Example: “give me annual revenue for fiscal year 2025” will always fire a query for financial data from Jan 2025 to Dec 2025. What if my company’s fiscal year begins in March and ends on last day of Feb? That’s business knowledge that your solution needs. Full disclosure: I work at Databricks, and since you mentioned Azure in another comment.. just reminding that Azure Databricks is a first party PaaS offering in Azure. I have helped many customers with this problem and truly believe that what Databricks gives is a high quality text2sql solution with AIBI Genie. You can find lot of information on Databricks Genie and its benchmarking results.Its a hard problem to solve especially around the biggest requirement which I see from analysts or power users, which is the need for quality and deterministic SQL code. This is where traditional BI does well, whereas LLMs could hallucinate.Best practices in Genie include using well curated metadata about each dataset, column definitions, semantic understanding about the data etc. These become non negotiable with agent based solution, since that's the only context for AI.Something like Genie being a tool in your arsenal will help your overall agentic solution. And best part is that you don't need data to be in Databricks. Databricks can connect into your database via Lakehouse federation and understand the layout of data.",

        "body": "The biggest shift for me was realizing that “thinking like an architect” is less about tools and more about trade offs. In real projects you are almost never designing from scratch. You’re reacting to constraints like messy data, changing requirements, cost limits, and systems you didn’t choose. So the thinking becomes things like where this pipeline will actually break, what happens when volume doubles, what can fail safely and what cannot, and what’s expensive to recompute versus cheap to store. If you’re not on a DE project right now, the closest substitute is to simulate real pain. Take a public dataset and design ingestion, transformations, and reporting, then deliberately change assumptions like schema changes, late arriving data, backfills, or higher volume, and force yourself to optimize for cost and reliability instead of elegance. Books and blogs help with vocabulary, but most architectural thinking comes from asking what the simplest thing is that won’t hurt you later, then being wrong a few times. Reading postmortems and migration stories taught me more than polished tutorials ever did. You don’t really learn architecture in a vacuum, but you can train the mindset by constantly reasoning about constraints, failure modes, and long term impact",

Talk to few of the senior data engineers and they will give you better advise. 2) Data Analytics degrees are cash cows and waste of time and money. You'd learn whole lot more if you were to build your own pipeline portfolio, load them on GitHub. Perhaps, look into bootcamps if that interest you at all. 3) Data Analyst is generally an entry point into data field. Can scale up from there to senior DA roles or pivot into data engineering, data scientist, AI/ML, Data Architect, Solutions Architect roles. 4) Don't leave your current role if the pay is good and career is stable. Job market right now is pretty harsh, will not make sense to leave a good paying job. Take full advantage of FAANG stocks, benefits and their free online courses taught by FAANG on coursera. Check with HR to see if transition is possible as an internal employee into tech, what would be the process. Find out data engineers internally on outlook, teams, slack and setup 1-on-1 with them, ask all kinds of questions about the skills needed, about their career path, etc. 5) The most fundamental skill required for any data role is SQL, there's no shortcut to that and one cannot survive without knowing SQL at good level. From here skills will pivot based on the role. Ex: Data Engineers require strong data modeling, distributed systems (ex: Databricks, snowflake) storage and compute skills. Tools don't matter at all, focus on the core, basics, foundations as everything else is build on those.Data Scientist: Strong Applied Math or Applied Stats skills, domain knowledge helps a lot.  Feel free to dm me if you want to talk more.",

Even though you say these are one-off parsing datasets in my experience there's still a huge need for: * writing code to handle a lot of backfilling - go pull 20 years of whois data in daily csv files... * building *tested* library modules to do common things - log record counts at each step along with reject counts by reason to a common table that can be used for audit reporting - and that you go back to when people are using the data later & have questions. * rerunning the parsing *numerous* times until everyone is satisfied - on things like whether or not which fields get url-decoded, what to do about fields that were decoded or encoded multiple times, fixing fields with multiple timestamp formats, etc. Recently we had to do this with a nasty vendor feed - and ended up writing code to loop through about two dozen timestamp format attempts until one worked - for every record.If you spent a few years doing this and wanted to go back to engineering and interviewed with my team and then told us that you thought the work would be fun, and you learned a lot, we would have no problem with that. But some teams might though - so I would see if you could get them to title you as an engineer. Not a showstopper for me if they wouldn't though.",

        "body": "You want to have a landing area for the data that is your single source of truth. This would be a Datalake if you cloud storage it. DLs have cool uses, like Events. Snowpipes can be triggered when a new file appears. Airflow deposits the file in the DL.Then a staging area (schema) that links to the landing area and allows hashing to eliminate dupes. No transformations here. All columns varchar. A reject schema for data that cannot fit into bronze due to an error. Then Medallion architecture for schemas bronze, silver, gold. Bronze (column transformations to correct types) from the staging. Any data rows that do not conform go to reject schema. Also Bronze is a great place for SCD2 tables. Silver is new & inferred data that is valid but doesn’t exist in bronze. Like splitting customers by geographical zones based on their address. It can make sense for some silver tables to be SCD2, but that’s rare. For geolocation you go get another single source of truth, stage it and bronze it. Then the silver combines two different bronze tables. The silver geolocation could be scd2 for tracking the moves that PK did. And so on. To meet all Gold requirements, for dimensions and facts. Gold is dimensional tables that Kimball and Snowflake are famous for. DIM and FACT. Using Airflow for pushing the data in the Medallion layers is standard practice. To go from BigQuery directly to Snowflake FACT, this is called a Proof Of Concept. Nothing wrong with that. Suggestion, put it in a Dev environment and build a Prod environment. Dev & Prod (maybe UAT eventually) can simply be different database names, same Snowflake account, same Datalake account. You do NOT want the PowerBI people doing their own “fill in the blanks“ that’s how you get data silos. They Will Do This !!!For example (true life example) the PowerBI people will go get their own geolocation data from god knows where and make mistakes, so that Sales Dept will have X$ in one zone and Finance Dept will have Y$ in the same zone for the same time period, as each Dept will have a different PowerBI person. Data must be centralized. For SSoT to work, and in every data row identity the source system for each PK. Maybe as part of your naming convention for the column. Don’t be afraid of typing long column names. Use acronyms when it makes sense. If you haven’t already, take an online course on Medallion and Kimball architecture.",

(“EU data must stay in EU”, “India must stay in India”, etc.). “Each country in its own region” is usually not the real rule, it’s the vibe.If data residency is actually required, then yeah: you can’t do Firebase → Bq → Snowflake US for everyone and call it compliant. The sane pattern is raw + PII stays in-region, and only aggregated/anonymous data can move cross-region (if allowed). Practically that means separate regional stacks (EU BigQuery dataset + EU Snowflake / or whatever) and your Airflow just orchestrates per-region configs. Start with 2 regions (EU + US), keep schemas identical, and create a “global” layer that’s aggregates only. Biggest footgun is mixing PII across borders and hoping to “fix later”, get the rule written down first, then architect.",

        "body": "Man, I feel your pain. Being the only data person at a startup is a trial by fire. Your founder is right to be concerned about regional compliance, it's a huge headache waiting to happen if you don't address it early. We had a similar situation at my company. We're a SaaS platform, and we started getting customers in the EU and APAC. Suddenly, we had to deal with GDPR, various data residency requirements, and a whole bunch of other fun stuff. Our initial setup was a mess data scattered across different databases and cloud services, no clear understanding of which customer data resided where, and absolutely zero auditability. It was a compliance nightmare. The initial thought was S3 and Iceberg like your mentor mentioned. That adds a ton of complexity in terms of infrastructure and data management. Imagine having to manage multiple S3 buckets and Iceberg catalogs, one for each region? Plus, you'd still need compute instances for processing, potentially Snowflake instances per region as you mentioned. The operational overhead alone would be insane, not to mention the cost. What we ultimately did was implement a virtual data platform that sits on top of our existing infrastructure. It basically created a unified view of all our data, regardless of where it was physically stored. The really cool part was that it automatically discovered relationships between different datasets and identified Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It even flagged data quality issues, like duplicate customer records with slightly different spellings. This would have taken us weeks to untangle manually. Once we had that unified view, we could easily define data policies based on region. So, for example, any data tagged as EU customer data automatically adheres to our GDPR compliance rules. The platform also provides a complete audit trail, so we can easily prove to regulators that we're compliant. And here's the thing that really saved our bacon: we built automated data pipelines using a no-code interface on top of all of this. Before, marketing and sales were constantly bugging the data team to pull reports, create custom dashboards, and integrate data from different sources. It was a huge time sink. Now, they can do most of that themselves with the no-code tools, freeing up the data team to focus on more strategic projects. It sounds like you are running into very similar problems. The company we used has a referral program, so I'm happy to connect you. Full disclosure, I get a little something if they end up helping you out. But honestly, it was such a game-changer for us that I'd recommend them even if I wasn't getting a kickback. They really helped us get our data under control and avoid a major compliance disaster. Happy to make an intro if you think it could be a fit.",

At other companies working conditions apart from workload are usually pretty good. I also found that regularly working from home made me much more motivated for learning, including non-technical skills. And both working from home and not having a super strict manager also make you much happier.Just start applying, and see what happens. You can always decide to stay. I do this once a year since I started working 15 years ago, even if I'm happy where I'm at. This is also helpful to understand your value/negotiate pay.",

And when I do it, I assign it so everyone knows it's taken. If you don't have a modern ticket system, just talk: \"I'm getting this ticket if no one is on it already\". If all are taken, ping the manager: \"I need a ticket\". That simple.",

Since you've been working as a DE for a number of years and you're trying to over-employ (?!) I'll assume somewhere at the mid-level. I'll note that I've primarily worked at startups so mid-level in my mind may have higher requirements or expectations than mid-level at MNCs.At the mid level or senior level, I'd expect a DE to get assigned a few tickets at the beginning of a sprint and, during standup, note that they're looking for a new ticket if they're done with their existing work. I'd also expect them to keep us abreast of any developments in their work so it doesn't fall behind, etc.For ad hoc requests, if there does not exist a triage system (for example: if no one picks this up in 15 minutes, it's fair game for anyone and respond to the request) then I would recommend suggesting one. If the style is \"whoever sees it first\" (like my job right now) then either the DEs must adapt to that style or communicate with one-another to enforce another style (like triage and sprint protectors or something); to ignore ad hoc requests or to require others to triage is putting extra work on the team --- and it seems like you've already been talked to about it, so it's possible that the team doesn't love that you don't pick up ad hoc stuff. The big word here is _communication_, and it's extremely important to have team-wide communication open.\"Oh, but my job is so hard, and it's impossible to do XYZ...!\" Yes, I know, there are a hundred thousand excuses for why any of us don't like our jobs and why it's impossible and why the workload is intolerable. The reality of the situation is that you either adapt or fail to thrive.---As I finished this, I saw this comment:> I had mentioned how things worked with me in the past and I thing it is really simple and clear if engineering lead or manager just informs me if they want to pick any issues up. Im thinking proactive would come eventually but not in a forced manner.I would never want to work with a mid-to-senior+ level DE who has this mindset. How do you expect being proactive would come _eventually_ if you aren't practicing it at all and making your lead / manager do all the triage _for you_ (which gives them _more work_ to do)?EDIT: Apologies for being so blunt here: I've had a few coworkers in the last year with this mindset who made my job significantly more frustrating than it needed to be. I want you to succeed in your company but it looks like you reply with a lot of excuses to well-meaning comments so I'm trying this approach.",

If my manager was like be more proactive and assign yourself work then I would have probably done that. Find a middle ground that works both for your style and your manager style. We also have rotation where if a pipeline breaks the person who is on call works on it + his tickets and everyone else just does their tickets. This keep changing every week.

Those \"let's just do x for now\" always bite you in the ass. It seems today's strategy is to limp things along until the business is fed up enough to wait for an entire redesign. Then the tech team and manager are replaced and you don't even fix all the tech debt because the people aware of it left! Tech debt NEEDS to be tracked and talked about regularly. Where I'm at they pushed anyone technical out of those discussions and it's only been band and worse. The consulting team they brought in pointed the finger at the data/tech team, promoted mid level managers with no tech background into those leadership positions (now they have to lean on the consultants for EVERYTHING AND EVERY DECISION! So much wasted money and time but theres no one technical to explain anything, even WHY things are as messy as they are. I saw this happening and tried to get my boss to understand what was happening. Instead he fought her about design differences instead of division of responsibilities. The consultant got 2 years to work with the analysts (who from my outside perspective were much further behind the engineers) while pointing fingers at the engineers/data. He needed to be bringing up all of the things the analysts and the business side need to do to make teams like this successful.",

There's some tools out there that claim to do this but i havent used them. You can probably guess what part is killing performance looking at the types of joins (broadcast joins are fast vs big fact to fact table joins will be slower, sometimes range joins can be slow if they're not optimized, etc), knowing your data and how it's being joined will be super helpful too.",

If you have a visible prioritized workload it is much easier to say “Bob said this is top priority and put it at my #1 as you can see. Cindy if you want this sooner go talk with Bob or whoever is at #2”Plus the better visibility and tracking makes it easier to generate justifications for more people.

That cost should be separated, since it is a different discussion than the rest of the CDC discussion, unless you design a solution that needs to be re-initialized regularly. Eg. I think Fabric's \"mirroring\" involves re-seeding every time the capacity is stopped and restarted. The \"after that\" part of your answer is probably more interesting to OP. This is where the underlying CDC magic happens. Most databases implement CDC by feeding the database transaction log to the subscriber. This can be done asynchronously, at a lower priority than anything else that is happening. In other words, the normal clients and users of the database can be given priority, and the CDC work can take place whenever there are free resources. I wouldn't necessarily agree with the \"5-10%\" increase in server usage unless the server was very small. This overhead would be based on a number of factors. If you had a TB of data and 32 cores on your DBMS and only 100 CUD operations at the source a day, then the amount of transaction log activity would be neglible and the CDC workload would be virtually zero. All things being equal the CDC workload would increase as the transaction log becomes more busy. And even then the source DBMS wouldn't prioritize CDC activities over regular database usage.",

If you want to keep it free, there are open source ones used by actual companies like Apache Airflow. You can use this on the open data sources mentioned. I’ve been through many DE and DE role adjacent interviews, and SQL almost always comes up. Know some technicals like order of execution in a SQL query, CTE’s, Window functions. I have never been asked any python technicals (have done a few OA’s though that are typical leetcode style, but these were not the norm), aside from Spark concepts.When you scour job postings, you’ll see a company can be entirely on Azure, AWS, Databricks, Snowflake, etc. But I also see a lot of postings that are Airflow, DBT + Snowflake for example. Airflow and DBT are free and you can use a local RDBMS instead of a cloud DW for a project to teach you ETL concepts and data orchestration, warehousing, modeling.Get good at one stack and apply for jobs that use those. Before your resume gets to a human, an ATS will scan for all the relevant key words in your resume with the JD. I have only worked with Azure & Databricks so I immediately stop reading a JD when it’s asking for AWS or Snowflake. In your resume, emphasize the results per experience (ex. optimized X by Y%) first, responsibilities second. I think you can definitely give your many different roles to chatgpt and ask it to reframe those roles to be more DE-specific.As for certs, I have noticed consulting roles seem to value those more than product company roles. If you’re fine with spending money, a Databricks DE associate cert, AWS DE, etc could make you stand out more as an entry level candidate. If you want to work with the cloud, AWS is more commonly used over Azure and GCP. Having worked in consulting before, the certs are how the firm pitches you to clients and gets you staffed (and therefore make money off of you).Lastly, use Linkedin and have all the relevant DE skills and experiences on your profile. It’s a lot easier for recruiters to find you first instead of the other way around. Good luck and I’m happy to answer any more questions you may have!",

That doesn't run a count(1), it's getting it from metadata. So it's O(1) time relative to table size. Obviously a PITA to do this if you had 100s of tables, but since you only have two tables, dead easy. In theory you could query the metadata directly to get this programmatically. It's one of the sys views, but I never remember which.Other than checking table counts, I guess the important question is how is the server migration being performed? If it's a backup of the old DBs being restored onto the new server, then this is a pretty bombproof approach, so long as:- writes to the DB have been completely stopped first (e.g. put DB into read only mode first)- the backup is run with the checksum optionSo in this case, I'd focus more on making sure the process for the migration has been thought out fully - then you don't have a lot of validation to do. Otherwise you're just validating that a widely used quarter-century-old enterprise RDBMS doesn't have a certain type of seriously fundamental bug.If the data migration is happening via some bespoke approach then you do need to validate further. But you first need to ask why they're not doing the more obvious simple backup/restore. For further validation, you really need to take the hit on slow scan queries and make sure the time needed for that is built into the migration plan.Gathering stats is the right approach but I'd focus on sum() of numerical columns that mean something to the business (currency values, quantities, durations, etc). Just sum the whole table with no group by. It doesn't have to be a useful KPI /metric that way, it's just a number that would be very sensitive to anything going wrong in the migration. And if all those numbers are unchanged, you can be pretty confident that whatever you use the data for will still work.",

Generating high quality Q&A from 100k word documents with a 70B model is always going to be slow and expensive unless you constrain it hardWhat usually works in practice is breaking this into stages. First chunk aggressively not just by tokens but by semantic boundaries like sections or topics, otherwise reasoning quality falls off anyway. Then do cheap filtering or summarisation passes first, either with a smaller model or heuristics, to identify which chunks are even worth turning into Q&A. Only send the “interesting” chunks to a large modelFor cost people often mix models like small or mid size models for chunking, summarising, and question generation, then a stronger model only for refining or validating a much smaller subset. Trying to run LLaMA-3 70B end to end on a million long documents will blow your budget no matter the platformAlso, be realistic about “challenging reasoning” because most synthetic Q&A pipelines degrade if you push for depth at scale. You usually get better results by generating simpler questions at scale, then curating or rewriting a smaller evaluation set manually or semi automatically.",

Are they fine at that point that the roll-up for ID=1 will change to the v6 value?\" -->** We have two sets of these gold fact tables. One set will always be updated, so it will always get the v=6 record when it comes. The fact table I was writing about in the post will remain at v=5. Business reason comes from our Financial Controller. When the data comes in, we expect that after X days after a reporting period, if there are no upstream data changes, we consider it official. There is an audit requirement to keep a permanent record of this official data for that time period because this is the data that was reported. There is a main gold fact table that will always be up to date and that's used for other purposes, but will always be accurate.We are implementing 'write controls' on the gold layer partition to limit this, but it won't be perfect. We're also going to store the snapshot of this data that can never be written to outside of the gold layer.**\"I'd be more concerned that the record can be updated and they don't want you to propogate the data up through the layers.\" -->** Generally, yes. But we have a pretty unique requirement here. We are fully propagating to gold but also maintaining a separate snapshot that will keep that snapshot in time for reporting purposes. (They need to report on what was reported at the time as one requirement even if what was reported used an older version of the same record).,",

When you're on the cutting edge, there is nothing to fall back on. Everything I could copy was just very basic stuff and I only ever really copied it from myself 1000 lines ago. It is only at this point that code really started to click and docs became incredibly useful.

While all of them have this idea that they're using AI \"as a tool\" that is \"no different than a calculator\" or \"no different than using stackoverflow\" it is fundamentally different and they don't have the knowledge to realize it. Even more, they will use AI to solve the basic questions, the ones that are DESIGNED TO BE EASY so that they can learn to work with these technologies, and then complain that the later exercises are too hard.

And each of those generates new questions, and you spend all your time in a frustrating cycle that generates facts but no wisdom until you get discouraged and quit.Imagine trying to learn how to program by reading [the Wikipedia page for Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) and just following all the links to related articles. *\"Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp tradition\". It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.\"* Holy cow, there's five links to click on just there, **none** of them useful for someone who wants to start learning Python.That's from the second section after the intro.

But it's on week 10 and still not in prod, because the details i want, are difficult for her to wrap her head around. And i have been coding for something like 25 years and a friend of mine, has been out of school for 5 years and some things he can do, i wont even attempt, because those are concepts i don't really understand. :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:",

The only thing that helps you get faster is experience. As you do more, you get faster. When you first do something, you go slow, you're learning something, you're making sure you're doing it right, then as you do it more, you get faster, get better, then it gets easier, etc... it's a cycle that feeds itself.",

The original requirements were wrong, and only once coding had started was this identified2. The original requirements accurate, but the time estimate was wrong3. You struggled to understand the requirements resulting in lots of false starts and wasted effort4. You fully understood the task but you're just really slow at coding. Next question, ask why?All of those outcomes are possible (and no doubt there are other possibilities as well), but only two of those issues are caused by you.Now if option three tends to be the cause, that means you need to spend time creating a plan on how you intend to tackle the work, and that is not some rigorous planning exercise. Just spend an hour creating a plan using nothing more than pen and paper. I would even suggest taking your plan to a senior developer and spending ten minutes discussing that plan with them. By doing this you will get better at planning your work.",

You jsut sit there typing, pushing buttons all day. A monkey could do it.\" ... Next up is the plethora of books that promise \"Zero to Hero\" in what ever language or \"Learn X in 24 hours!\" or what ever learn quick scheme flavor of the month that flooded the market in the late 90's and early 2000's... lots of people bought into that. I'll admit, I flipped through many of them - usually at the library, I tried not to buy them if I could help it - some were decent, but not many. Most were jsut fluff and not worth it. Those were quickly replaced with BootCamps and youTube videos promising the same. Which leads us back to point one... people thinking it's easy, when in fact it isn't. The next problem people run into is that they vastly underestimate how big and vast programming really is. How many languages there are. And how complex those languages are. They become so overwhelmed, they don't know where to start. That leads to the inevitable posts of \"How do you experts memorize all this shit?\" ... hint: we don't. If I actually memorized everything I've come across throughout my 40+ years, my brain would melt. So I index stuff. I remember patterns. I memorize the important things, but for the most part, 90% of programming is pattern recognition and realizing \"wait a sec... I've seen this before... where was it....\" and digging up some old code, or googling some key words. Do it enough times, you stop having to do that, and it just becomes second nature. It becomes a habit. I wouldn't say memorized, but it becomes habitual.That leads to the third mistake - underestimating the amount of time investment needed. I just ran across a post, I forget which subreddit it was in, but the poster was asking where he could find the best place to learn c the quickest because he has a test next week. What? Excuse me? No other context. So no indication of how much he needs to know, but still, you can't really learn a new language from nothing in a week. Maybe some basics, but still. At this point he's going need a chef because he's cooked. And the last point - using the wrong approach. Youtube videos. Sigh. YTV are fine for shyort quick intro or quick how-tos, but you need (or should) already have an understanding or a background in what you're learning. It shouldn't be a place to learn programming from ground up. That said, I am aware of a FEW youtubers that have produced excellent quality tutorials, they are the exception, the outliers. Most YTV tend to fall more into the \"you need to have some knowledge or background\" in advance before starting. People get frustrated with that. What they really need is a well laid out, \"start here at Point A, progress to Point B, Then C, end at Point Z\" progressive lesson. Something structured. There's a lot of those available online, many for free too. Some are more rigid and structured than others, some a bit more flexible. But the point is they are laid out in a \"before you can run a marathon, you have to learn how to crawl first. But you also need to learn to also stand too before walking.\" All of this contribute to people's various frustrations of learning to code/program at various points, and to various degrees. I know I've struggled with some of these pain points over the years too. I'm sure most of us have to some degree. But we're still here. That's because we stuck with it and overcame it somehow. Sometimes it's because we just brute forced it, sometimes it's because after a while it \"just clicked\".",

This of course won't fly for many leet code problems, and some platforms don't even allow one to use many functional languages and set hard time requirements for execution time of the solutions. Parallelism and code cleanliness is given no thought. You can write all shit code with single letter variable names mutating shit everywhere, and it will accept your solution more likely than a very clean functional solution, that is trivially parallelizable and would scale (if ever needed).Looking at LC mastery mostly selects for people, who have ground that stuff hard and memorized that stuff (which won't be of too much use on the job for actual real world problems) or people, who think that this kind of procedural mutating way of programming and the typically associated languages are the end all be all, and have limited experience with other things.I much prefer advent of code (AoC) style puzzles, where you can use any language you want, and you just need a number as the solution.I feel like solving AoC puzzles has improved my ability to solve problems the functional way, even, if they at first seem to not lend themselves well to the functional paradigm. I found some pretty neat functional solutions at times. Like for example using bitboards represented by numbers as an underlying data structure and boosting performance of my previously too slow solution by a factor of more than 1000. I had to sometimes write functional versions of well known procedural algorithms. Things like A-star algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm, depth-first-search, breadth-first search. I've had to interpret how they work and how I can replace data structures they rely on with functional versions, and how I represent a graph or create it in a functional way.",

        "body": "I'm going to go out on a limb and argue this: It's not programming, it's the way school taught you how you should learn. School education is built on spiral patterns and a tonne of scaffolding. Both of these together make the natural position of learners so that it is clear what they should do to solve a given problem, so if they don't know what to do the assumption is that it is your fault. When in reality, learning is complicated, messy, and difficult. I'll give you an example. In maths, let's say that we are learning how to move variables around an equation. We provide the proof, completed worked examples, worked examples that are partially solved with hints, partially solved worked examples without hints, simple problems that are basically worked examples without hints, and some problems that can be breadcrumbed through multiple worked examples above. The end result is that you probably can go from start to bottom without encountering any trouble. Teachers might make questions that are tricky, compound, or both, but you've probably encountered *everything* before. The problem is that you've never learned how to synthesise something new (to you), and that's what you are trying to do here. I'll give you an example. You might have learned how to make an object. You might have even learned how to assign a variable to an object. But when you have to make your own simple data structure that stores a bunch of data like an array, but can dynamically add and remove stuff without empty spaces or resizing arrays ... well, all of the steps to smash your face into designing or inventing a linked list are really, fuffing, hard.So, what happens is that learners sit there and go: \"Man, I feel that fancy maths is easier than this because I always know what I'm doing,\" because they've hit a problem that could have a dozen or more possible solutions. Instead of simply accepting that they don't know and starting problem-solving, they just feel bad.I'm also going to extend a programmer's olive branch: I've been programming for twenty years. I'm not bad at it. I've built all sorts of complicated systems in multiple languages. Yet, every single day I'll be coding something, and I'll mutter to myself \"holy fuff I'm stupid\" because I couldn't solve some problem. I also couldn't tell you how long I have smashed my face into problems trying to understand how to build it, only to discover that once I learned the underlying systems, it was actually pretty simple (after I did a lot of work to learn new stuff). This is natural. In fact, I often wonder if you don't feel like this regularly, you probably aren't programming. edit: Lastly, I've been learning how to write novels. Not really to do anything with, but just to tell stories. I'm constantly frustrated at how hard it is to express what is in my brain in words. It has been a year, and I've learned heaps, but I'm still not good at it. Sometimes I forget that just because I am good at programming, networking, writing formal documentation, and teaching, it doesn't mean I will, or even should, automatically be good at other things like creative writing. So, be kind to yourself.",

I’ve had my own versions of this, albeit with a very different story and background.I think it’s really important to find ways to enjoy programming and that might involve taking a few weeks away from it to reassess where you’re at and what you want to do with programming, as well as reflecting on your learning process and what ways you approach it that lead to good results and what ways you tend to get into frustration.It becomes fun and exciting when you figure out how to learn and pace yourself properly in projects. These negative associations with bad experiences are real and I think it can really be unhealthy if it accumulates up into an emotionally frustrating burden. People say the word trauma is overused but I think that it can be the accurate word to describe accumulated bad experiences that you don’t find a resolution to.You’re young and have had a ton of experience for your age already - take a short break and jump back in when you feel excited about it again. You’re miles ahead of the version of yourself that doesn’t even start until his twenties or thirties or forties.",

This can be programming it to send automated texts to your parents when it realises that you won't be home by 9pm, it can be a reminder to drink water every 3 hours and so on.As a human you write computer programs to make it help you in random small tasks, eventually you automate and get used to writing all of these programs that you move on to other bigger tasks in your lives. You one day realise 'wait a minute i would like a simple website about my new bakery that im opening up' so you do just that. You make multiple games and you realise that manually writing physics is a pain for each game so you decide one common code that handles this physics for you and call it the 'game engine', the name is all fancy but at the end of the day its just a bunch of code doing physics.You find it difficult at the moment because you're not starting bottom up, you don't start with a basic necessity in your life that needs to be solved and work from there. You start with knowing zero programming as you mention in your second and blindly just copy paste tutorials which are more complex and use stuff that you do not have the prerequisites for. You think you got far because you copy pasted the tutorials but the truth is you have to accept that you know very little about programming and start writing simpler programs until you get the basics right.Codeforces / Leetcode / <insert similar sites) is meant for two kinds of people - Folks who just enjoy puzzle coding and folks who are into competitive programming / want to pass interviews at companies where leetcode is askedI don't think you are at the stage where you enjoy programming so much that you should be getting into the hobby of puzzle coding? The problems there are deliberately difficult on purpose because its meant to be competitive and you need to go in having practiced a huge bunch of algorithmic ideas and topics. Its like you wanting to take a leisurely walk to get fit but accidentally ending up signing up for the local extreme parkour club. Both achieve the same thing but are meant for different kinds of people with different kinds of mindset",

You didn't learn any of the other things that are normally taught in the first two years like patterns, web development, databases, intro to security, or general theory. Of course, programs can vary. I haven't seen a single one that's like \"C++ 101 and nothing else lmao.\"Secondly, you had to pass those classes to be going into your third year. So you passed a C++ class. You certainly had to build basic programs. You were able to follow guidelines, design by the prescribed principles, and received a passing grade. You also took an OOP class and passed it. Now you can't make your own basic programs at home. This does not make sense.Thirdly, you're just figuring this out after 2 years. You paid money to be bullied and ridiculed for 2 years. You didn't go to your counselor or program director to ask if this was normal. You just dealt with the abuse, passed your classes, then immediately forgot what you learned. This is not believable.Of course, you could be telling the truth. Maybe you have an undiagnosed learning disability. Maybe you ended up at a particularly cruel CS program that only teaches C++.

The work has become more enjoyable over time - not because of obsession, but because I've gotten better at it and avoided stagnation.The key has been continuous variation. Initially, I learned the essentials: variables, conditionals, loops, and basic control flow. When BASIC felt too restrictive, I moved to Pascal and C++, which introduced new challenges like pointers and object-oriented programming. After a brief period with Perl (which I didn't enjoy), I transitioned into web development with PHP and JavaScript. JS proved interesting because of its prototype-based inheritance model - a completely different approach from classical OOP.The pattern isn't obsession - it's sustained engagement through novelty. Each language shift brought fresh problems to solve and different paradigms to master. I didn't chase the same dopamine hit of early discovery; instead, I built deeper expertise while regularly introducing new complexity. The \"addiction\" you remember might have been beginner's excitement from rapid skill acquisition. That specific feeling doesn't return, but it's replaced by something more durable: the satisfaction of solving increasingly sophisticated problems with accumulated knowledge. You don't need to recapture obsession - you need new challenges that match your current skill level.",

Also, C-M-p then logically becomes available for reversed down-list, which lets you move at every combination of in/out and forwards/backwards of delimiters.Very useful at jumping, say,```|function foo (param1) {...``````function foo(|param1) { ...```or ```function foo (param1) {...|...``````function foo (param1|) {...```",

Keep paying attention in your classes because what often happens is some penny drops and you remember all the stuff in that context, so it is not necessarily lost.

Looking things up again is not failure, it is reinforcement. What usually makes things stick is reusing the same concept in slightly different contexts, like writing small variations of a script or combining it with something you already know. Over time you stop remembering syntax explicitly and start remembering patterns, which is what actually matters. If you feel like you understand it faster the second or third time you look it up, that is a good sign, not a bad one.",

Part 1 would be a preparation for the exam done at home with whatever tools they want (ai, colleague,...) and they could take any code they would have done to part 2 (which was the actual part cut from Internet).The first part had exercises centered around getting every child from a node in a tree (and going deeper till getting the last).The first exercice from the second part was going up the tree till the first node was found and then, the exam was basically going down the tree either from top or from a specific node with the eventual join here and there on another table.All that to say : if you understood your code from the first part, second part should have been no problem at all. going up a tree being so close to going down but a lot less complicated to implement - It's a sole loop. And once done with going down and up, every other exercise could be done with some copy past from your own codeWhen the result was in, most of the student had the first part nailed in tight. But some would have no idea at all about what was what (one exercice asked to check the depth of the tree and one of the student thought that just taking the node.parentId was the answer. Not to throw shade at the guy (I'm pretty sure he's one of the smarter) but he clearly didn't understand the first part that was, most likely, generated (or copy pasted from a student. But since I checked every file before allowing them to bring them to part 2, I have some idea.)In essence, ai didn't write bad code. That's not the point.The point is, they used it in a way that didn't make them grow their understanding of what they were doing.That's the part I'm really critical when in comes to ai use in learning... But in general too. No matter if you're a junior or a senior. If you don't learn, you, at best, stay at your level.",

Software engineering is like art, you should always be doing something new or solving a new problem in this world. If you're building the same thing over & over again, you're doing something wrong. AI usually helps with automating repetitive stuff, but anything else than that is total unprofessionalism to me. Why did script kiddies became vibe coders? If you're not doing something unique then here's your problem on why AI is so useful to you. AI can literally identify problems in the world. Just look at the school system, it's trash & thats why AI is so useful there, because exams are the dumbest thing in the world. There's so much other useful use cases for AI, but coding is not the one, at least for me. It just struggles when you're an engineer in a very specific project or area, like embedded programming.If you aren't the one solving specific problems & showing and discussing them with your client and sharedholders & reiterating, you're probably doing something that shouldn't be in your role.There's also so much other examples on this, but I don't have time",

These recordings will probably hold up well over time.

The risk is not shallow knowledge, it is hidden gaps that you do not realize are there. Projects are good at exposing those gaps naturally.Exploring multiple stacks can help you see which concepts are universal and which are just implementation details. Over time the fundamentals stick because you keep encountering them in different contexts. That usually beats trying to learn everything in isolation before you build anything real.",

You can’t learn “the whole thing” at all. You can only learn the parts you need. There’s many things I’ve used over 20 years and I still don’t know even nearly “the whole thing” because I’ve never needed all the things there is. As long as you know all the things you will need, and have understanding how they fit together then you can go piece by piece and learn those parts. It’s much easier and sticks much better when it’s “ok I need to do X so I’ll look that up and learn it and do it” rather than “oh yeah I looked it up a week ago, but now that I need it I don’t remember it anymore…”Also one tip: write down some things you feel are useful or important to remember from the start. Like “ok when I use this way to connect to database I need to set that up” and whatnot. It’ll be handy later when you jump between things and definitely will forget things.",

Most people don’t learn a whole stack end to end before building anything, they learn just enough to make progress, then deepen the parts that keep breaking or slowing them down. Surface knowledge is fine early as long as you circle back and firm up fundamentals once you hit friction.What usually bites people is not the breadth, it’s skipping the underlying concepts that repeat across stacks, like data flow, state, error handling, and tradeoffs. If you understand those, switching stacks becomes much easier and less scary. Think of projects as a way to expose gaps, not as proof you should already know everything.",

Everyone feels this way at one time or another, even those who doesn't appear so.2. Also, instead of giving in, to feelings of being an imposter, actively identify and address the weaknesses you've already identified, and do something about them.3. E.g. Note down terms you don't understand and learn/clarify them for yourself. Ask here. Or research on the internet. Or start a conversation with Claude or ChatGPT and say \"I am a programmer and I ran across the concept/term of 'dependency injection' \\[for example\\] the other day. I don't know what this is. Write me a short treatise on this subject including references so I can get up to speed. Include examples and exercises.\" (for example.)4. You also observed you do nothing outside of work. Well, that's a hint/tell: Start doing something outside of work then! (\"Doctor it hurts when I do \\*this\\*\" Doctor: \"Well stop doing it then!.\" You get my drift.)5. For example, start answering questions on a programming site, or try to. Sometimes you'd have to do some research in order to answer. From doing this, you will learn.6. Try sites like: [exercism.com](http://exercism.com), [codingame.com](http://codingame.com), [codewars.com](http://codewars.com), etc7. One final point: AI is no magic bullet. The presence of AI is going to increase the demand for competent engineers that can also be AI whisperers. You can get ahead of the curve by incorporating and learning and developing the art and science of making effective use of AI in your current job context. As time goes on, I expect this skill might be more important that your naked skills, important though they remain too. (You cannot effectively use AI in anger if you cannot properly judge and evaluate an AI's output. So your human intelligence + experience is essential for the effective use of AI.)The software industry is wide and deep, give yourself time. Rome wasn't built in a day. Read Peter Norvig [here](https://norvig.com/21-days.html). I have been in industry for more than 25 years now and not a day goes by that I don't learn something. Make peace with not knowing everything, that is not where your most important skill lies.",

I worked in C and C++ professionally until 2013, when I switched to Java with a spring in my step and a song in my heart. So when I say I disagree with Mr Spolsky, it’s not because I’m defensive about not knowing C or pointers.I guess if you want to contribute to the Linux kernel, it’s got to be C and you need to understand pointers like you understand your native language. Ditto drivers. But 99.9% of programmers aren’t getting that deep in the weeds with things. Even in 2005, they weren’t. People can’t come out of undergrad knowing everything. You’ve got to pick what’s important to get started.Also C is hard in a lot of stupid, picky ways that have nothing to do with intelligence. Mostly it’s not portable the way a lot of modern languages are. Programs that compile and run fine in one environment won’t in another because the libraries are in a different directory, or you’re using different compilers, or different versions of the compiler, or different levels of optimization (it shouldn’t matter, but I’ve seen cases where it does.) Or all kinds of stupid crap. This was already a serious obstacle to collaboration and knowledge-sharing in 2005. It’s gotten way worse as more knowledge is shared online. It’s why Java was such a hit—the intermediate bytecode step meant that it works the same everywhere. (I mean, you *can* find incompatibilities between the Oracle JDK and IBM Semaru or whatever, but you have to be doing something really obscure.)

What makes them qualified to do the job is the wisdom and experience they've gathered that helps them figure out the right way. My day job is working around a group of technicians. I've never seen them pull a tool from their tool box that I don't know how to use. When something on their unit is broken their experience tells them what tool they need and why they should start there. I think the same basic concept can be applied to programming professionally. I can write multi threaded code. How do I know when I should write multi-threaded code?Learning to use the tool is different from applying the tool to the trade. One is easy. The other can only be gained through time. A willingness to change, take criticism, and improve plus persistence is the only \"correct\" part that matters to me.",

For me, I think the answer is no. As others have said, starting a project is a really effective way to learn. Then your code can be your notes and you can refer back to code when you want to remember how to do things. Regarding how to take notes, there are studies that claim writing notes by hand makes you learn the material better than typing.

Some bugs are fairly trivial to detect and fix, others can take months or years.The important thing is that this does not fully hinge on a given programmers debugging skills. Bugs only become easy to detect and fix when* the programmer is somewhat good at debugging and familiar with the codebase,* the code has been written in a way that facilitates easy debugging,* the infrastructure has been set up in a way that facilitates easy debugging,* the programmer has tools available that facilitate debugging.People can have different preferences for how to go about achieving these things, but they're likely to involve stuff like* [Good error messages](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/error/index.html#common-message-styles)* Observability setups (logging, metrics, tracing)* Access to actual debuggers* Tests (both unit tests and integration tests)* Automated builds and common integration & testing infrastructure (to eliminate the \"it works on my machine\" situations)* Linters / rule engines that prevent certain code from being merged* Static typing and a [reliable type system](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) (there are some people who swear by dynamic typing, but Typescript is gaining ground over Javascript, and it's pretty common now to have type hints and typechecking for Python too, and apparently PHP)* Various code architecting styles, though preferences there _really_ vary, but see e.g. \"make illegal states unrepresentable\" and \"parse, don't validate\"I.e. a lot of the work we do is done to make debugging easier, and avoid bugs reaching production in the first place.But depending on situation and the technology involved some bugs can still be pretty hard to figure out. There's [a talk from CppCon 2017 by Louis Brandy, _Curiously recurring C++ bugs at Facebook_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkgszkPnV8g) that has a lot of examples of stuff that can stump professionals. (And they're specifically _C++_ bugs. Lots of companies are switching to Rust, and those bugs aren't present in Rust, and probably not in most other languages either.)",

What I really lacked was some sort of project to put all that together and the knowledge to break that down into the necessary steps. After all sorts of tutorials on YouTube and Udemy that didn't really have any good projects to walk through, I found a great tutorial from Tim Corey that built an actual app. It was an app that you would use to track a 3v3 basketball tournament for your office. What clicked the most about his approach was going through the planning phase of what the application needed to do. It needs to register players, register teams, and assign players to teams. It needs to keep track of who paid the $10 entry fee for the current tournament, it needs to track the bracket and match ups for the current tournament, etc. The code was done in such a way that it would be platform agnostic, meaning you could build it as a desktop app that saved the data to both a text file and a database or it could run as a web app on your phone and connect to a cloud database or something like that. That's the kind of tutorial I needed, and it sounds like you need more hands on learning with the planning part. I knew the syntax for all the loops, how to create functions and call them later, etc., but I never knew how to sit down with a blank project in the text editor and start building something. That tutorial did a great job showing how to go from an idea of what you want to make to breaking that idea up into smaller steps. It also did a good job of identifying what you needed for the MVP (minimally viable product--the bare minimum features to be a functioning app) vs what were \"nice to haves\" that could be added in future phases. I ended up abandoning the whole C# thing when I got a job as a data analyst several years ago. I've gotten by with just SQL so far, but I'm getting ready to start a peer mentorship with one of the folks on my team to learn python and predictive modeling now that I have a project that would benefit from it. I still use what I learned in terms of planning for my projects now: what are the essentials the customer needs now, and what can wait until phase 2 or phase 3.",

        "body": "You have to think of a web application project as an ongoing project. You have to start by breaking down the application's main objective into smaller, realistic goals. As you say, you need to know the fundamentals of programming, but you'll acquire them during development. If you don't start at some point, you'll feel like you're in an endless learning loop: you learn the basics but never apply them to the real world. Obviously, depending on the complexity of the website, you'll need more or less knowledge, and you have to be sure that the resources and skills you possess are sufficient to reach the goal. But this part relies primarily on research and patience.Basically, what I would do if I wanted to prepare to create a project is to create a sketch. It could be a diagram, a text document, or both. I write a brief outline of the idea I have in mind, then a list of the workflow, resources, and basic knowledge I need.Once I have this, I start working on gathering resources and coding. The first thing I do in a web application is the design. I establish the typography, icons, brand colors, and that sort of thing. Functionality is what I do after I have all of that in place.Keep in mind that you can never know for sure what your project needs at the beginning. You should try to prepare to start as soon as possible; don't waste time or energy trying to have everything under control from the start, because it's pointless. You'll learn to program by programming.Establish a work plan by setting short- and medium-term goals and adjust them as you go. If something blocks you, move on to something else, and at some point, you'll find what you need to unblock what you were creating.",

Like, for example, why don't you think of some things that are out there, like a contact form, or a blog, or just some tool like a calculator, and figure out how to build them from scratch.With a contact form, if you're building from scratch (don't use a 3rd party form), then you have to figure out not only how to accept data, but allow a user to submit, and then where does that data go? that's a project. Maybe you want the data sent to your email or to the cloud or stored in a Db, so maybe you need to learn Azure or SQL, but that'll get your brain thinking about a real, functional projectFor a blog, you need to get user data to print/post to the screen, but again, do you want to be able to store/archive data, if so, what tools will you use to make that happen.You can make a calculator look real with html and css, but how about accepting user input (when they push buttons) and the calculations behind the scenes to do the math and then display it.The best thing you can do to learn is to break down these projects to figure out what parts will be HTML and CSS, but knowing what else you'll need to make it functional.Check youtube for beginner html css javascript projects.",

I’ve leaned so much and I’m only halfway through. You learn the entire life cycle of full-stack web development, from creating your first React app locally to deploying your app on the web through Docker and Google Cloud. You definitely need to have a basic understanding of web development and programming concepts, but it’s still a book I’d recommend to anyone who is wanting to go into web dev. Hope this helps :)",

See [Locality of Behaviour](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/)> how to keep things readable without over-engineeringYou need to set the encapsulation boundaries the right way. If your compile time hierarchy of encapsulation matches the domain model, you will have a hard time managing all the different interactions and variations. An example for that would be an inheritance hierarchy where each class implements its own behaviour (Vehicle -> Car -> Truck / Bus; Vehicle -> Train -> ...; Vehicle -> Bycicle -> ElektroBike; Vehicle -> ??? -> MotorBike; ...)Instead, start with separating your data from your logic and keep your data in simple arrays. E.g. a List of Orders, a List of Products, a List of Deliveries, A List of Customer Account. This can be an exact match to how you design your database btw.. Also, have only 1 ID across **all** types of Entities. This will allow you to combine the Components at Runtime easily.Then write functions (not methods) that operate on those lists. One function may check whether your are going to be out of stock for any product and create a new order for your supplier. Another function may go over the recent orders by your customers and create an aggregated report of what has been ordered and how much. And so on.Think about your logic as systems or laws of nature. Similar to how gravity affects the trajectory of a ball thrown up, instead of the ball gravitating itself back to earth.You will see that a lot of stuff that is challenging right now will become trivial.Good luck!",

I’m not sure what kind of abstraction you’re working with, but I always found that advice to be very actionable and easy to relate to.—You have to start somewhere.For any beginner task, keep things as clear, simple, and easy to understand as possible.The code you write will almost certainly not be optimal and that’s just fine. When you’re starting on a project, you need code that you can bring other people in on. You need to be able to talk about it, debug it, and write tests for it.Build time into your long-term plans for refactoring. There will come a time when the original code isn’t meeting your project’s needs anymore. - you’ll need to be able to read it and understand it to make it better and solve whatever problem you’re experiencing in the future.",

Once you've built a few projects and feel like you can see at least the direction of the tunnel if not the light at the end, then you should take a pause and take the recommended course sequences that every college student goes through: data structures, computer architecture, operating systems, algorithms. Those will make you a much more efficient programmer. Then you can go back to building more advanced projects, or make your earlier projects better.Udemy courses are helpful to get you started on a topic, similar to reading Python docs + some examples to get you started. It's helpful for exploration. But they're not that helpful for depth. You can use some of them to figure out what you want to learn next. (Protip: Never pay full price for Udemy courses. They have regular deep discounts down to $10-15 for a $200 course.)",

You could take the remainder of the deltaPopulation and carry it over to the next step, this ensures that the population still keeps track of the fractional progress. A second approach would be to keep the population as a decimal digit and only use a getter which floors the value upon access by anyone else.",

A population of 4119.4 means that there is only 4119 people currently in the population, but anytime soon a new one will appear. And a population of 4119.7 means the exact same, but RoundToInt will round the previous result to 4119 and this one to 4120.So, use Floor or `FloorToInt` whenever you want to use the population in any other calculation - and also use `ints` for all other population-numbers, like `previousPopulation` and `deltaPopulation`. Basically you'll have \"population used in calculating the population\" as a float, and \"population used for everything else\" as an int, calculated by flooring the previous float!",

No more rounding issues:int previousPopulation;int deltaPopulation;void UpdatePopulation() {previousPopulation = population;// do growthdeltaPopulation = population - previousPopulation; // clean int math}I'd go with Option 2 + FixedUpdate.

        "body": "I recently had a team member staffed with me whose background was pretty much all js. His code (in java) was very weird at first: lots of methods taking and returning Map. I eventually figured out that as a js developer, he was not familiar with strong typing or even class type definitions. Of course JS6 and TS in particular support those, but JS does a lot with anonymous functions and weakly typed, ad-hoc key value pair objects as a programming norm. Memory management is also completely under the hood and so the whole idea of a pointer or reference type was new as well.Where I'm going with this is, the basics translate, but I still maintain that C/C++ is great first language followed by an OO-first language like Java, Python, or C# because it makes you internalize these concepts and gets you ready to write scalable, non-browser code. I don't prefer JS as a first language because it's hard syntactically to keep track of exactly what each construct is and the patterns, while syntactically concise, can easily be confusing on those points.JS is great; learn something else too. At least get to a point where you understand the difference between a function that's a method, a class template, or an instance of a class, understand variable typing, and understand why you might want strongly typed code and by extension what the typescript project was going for and why it was widely adopted by large js code bases.",

There are a LOT of shortcuts. There are a TON of Unity assets you can buy, or for RPGMaker (bajillion versions) if you want to make stuff that way. There's GameMaker, ClickTeam, GameToolkit, etc. If you know Python, there's Ren'Py for visual novels or PyGame if you want more coding. In fact, there are TONS of engines out there for almost every genre on Github or such. And there's of course, Unreal, Godot, and other 3D engines besides Unity. And you can always study classic game sourcecode as many of them have been released (Wolf3D, original Doom, etc.) if you want to learn how those work (may not apply very much to today's gamedev, but everyone starts somewhere). You can stick to making mods in the short term. The company who made Terra Invicta started as XCOM2 Mod Maker (mod was called \"Long War\"). Valve even bought a couple Half-life mods and published them back in the days. So, what are you interested in? Pick something.",

The program will tell you higher or lower until you are correct. - hang man - tic tac toe - go fish - checkers - text based choose your own adventure game - simple pokemon like rpg As your programming maturity grows you’ll have a better orientation around the general world of computers and you’ll be able to navigate where to go. Eventually you will want to start working with a game engine like Unity or Godot but if you try this too early it will just be overwhelming, so just work on coding first. From there you can learn more about the theoretical parts of game design, graphics etc etc. The Coding Adventures YouTube series is a great place to get your appetite wet for how various graphical ideas can be made with code",

It’s silly to conflate watching a course with the act. Learn by doing and throw something together. You might find that it is very fun and cool, and can bring a lot of joy",

It places restrictions on the object which can be used to ensure you don't do things you shouldn't with it, and can be used to refer to automatically allocated objects.You can pass a unique_ptr, the implication being that ownership is handed to the callee. Or const unique_ptr, meaning the callee can use and modify the object, but not move ownership to something else.You can pass by shared_ptr, ownership is shared and lifetime managed by the pointer. I rarely used these. There are also weak_ptrs but I've not yet had to use them.Sometimes it's perfectly valid to just pass a copy too.I try to avoid using raw pointers in c++ unless forced to, e.g. using a posix or third party C API, and if given one, I'll try and wrap them in a unique_ptr with custom deleter where and as soon as possible, so I don't forget to clean them up. But you can imply similar semantics with the constness of the raw pointer, you're just relying on other developers more than the compiler.Experts please feel free to correct me here.",

        "body": "What you are describing is commonly called *tutorial hell*, the frustrating cycle of trying different introductory tutorials but never feeling like you actually learn *how to create your own programs from scratch.*At this point, people usually give you two pieces of bad advice: \"Work on your own projects\" and \"Contribute to open source projects\". Well, not *bad* but not without caveats.Working on your own project is definitely a good idea, but beginners aren't in a place to know what sized project to take on. Especially because these days beginners might think, \"I want to make an AI\" or \"I want to make my own Instagram\" or \"I want to make Minecraft\" are good projects. If you pick a project that's too large, you'll spend two months on it, not finish, and then be left even more frustrated.The solution is to **pick small projects**. You might not know what counts as \"small\", so I wrote [a free book with 81 small Python programs](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/). They all use text for output, including small ASCII art when needed. This may seem old-school, but the benefit is that every language has `print()` so you can use these projects even if you're not using Python, and there's no graphics libraries to install and configure on your computer.My definition of \"small\" is roughly \"under a couple hundred lines of code.\"If you work on your own projects, make a list of *negative* features: things your project *won't* do. It's too easy to let \"it would be cool if...\" expand your scope into something you'll never finish. (Every programmer who started making a game by first making their own 3D graphics library is guilty of this. It's a great for a learning experience, sure, but my money is that the game will never be released.)There's no one moment where everything \"clicks\" but rather a series of small clicks. Finishing a dozen tiny projects is far more fulfilling and keeps you going than one half-finished giant project.\"Contribute to open source projects\" is not good advice; you do need to have some level of experience making complete software applications to meaningfully contribute, or find someone in the project to mentor you. Open source projects would love to mentor someone who will contribute in the future, but it's hard to trust that the person they invest time into will actually stick around.I tell people to write their own blog posts or tutorials of what they've learned, because that process spotlights any gaps in your understanding. (Writing programming books certainly does that for me.) Post it somewhere online under a pseudonym where it will have zero readers, but *do* post it: this forces you to finish it. I have a hundred files in my blog drafts folder and they aren't doing s*** for me.I'm going to get off Reddit and go write up this advice into a blog post now.",

Why don’t you stop and go learn about something you feel good about? Do you like programming? Do you like the idea of programming? I’m not judging here — just looking for the other side of your story.2. A lot of programming involves not knowing the answer. Very often, things don’t work the way you think they should and you have to figure out why. You have to be very open to the idea that you might be wrong, because accepting that is often the key to finding the answer you’re looking for. You have to be okay with feeling frustrated for long periods, and you have to be persistent. Being good at programming is less a matter of knowing all the things and more a matter of being good at figuring out what you don’t know on an hourly basis. If those kinds of feelings make you uncomfortable or unhappy, programming may infeed not be a great career choice.3. The thing that hooks a lot of people is making stuff work. Seeing your program work exactly the way you want it to feels like an amazing combination of magic and certainty: it’s inspiring even though you know exactly how and why it works. It’s probably the same feeling someone gets when they fire up an engine for the first time after months of rebuilding work. If you’ve never experienced that, you might want to hang in there until you’ve built a few things to see whether you enjoy that part — it might make the rest worthwhile.",

Now, I'm trying to apply to other companies, but I'm scared of the coding assessments. Back in 2025, whenever I applied elsewhere, I would receive LeetCode-style assessments before even getting an interview. I lost hope immediately and didn’t continue with my applications.Right now, I’m using freeCodeCamp, but I struggled with one of the CSS labs, so I decided to take a break. I also started The Odin Project this new year, and I’m trying to learn it slowly.Since last week, I’ve been studying DSA because it feels like the only way to get hired in this job market. I try to code on my own first, but I get stuck—especially when there are nested loops. My brain just can’t comprehend the logic. I understand bubble sort and selection sort, but I can’t code them without looking at examples. I don’t know what will happen to me in the future; maybe if I keep learning, I’ll get better. The Odin Project says I need to practice a growth mindset, but studying DSA is so hard that it makes me wonder if I chose the wrong degree.I didn't choose my degree, my mother wanted me to take it, and I don't really know what I wanted to take before, so I just went with it.Back in college, I almost failed college algebra and my DSA subject, but I still managed to graduate on time. For algebra, the only reason I struggled was because I didn’t have eyeglasses. By the time I got them, it was already too late to catch up since I couldn’t see what the professor was teaching. For DSA, I didn’t really understand coding and syntax at first. I only started learning properly in my second year.Maybe I just got lucky before, because my first two jobs only required math assessments and quiz-style tests. If they had required coding assessments, I’m sure I would have failed and not gotten the job.I wish you the best OP, please know that you are not struggling alone.",

A person with a degree can prove that he has knowledge and experience in things on a certain level. Otherwise he would not pass the tests, would not pass the exams, and would not get his thesis defended. Yes, one can graduate with the lowest passing grades and one can graduate cum laude, and there is a difference between a degree holder and a degree holder, but even these lowest passing grades usually show that the person at least is introduced to a number of topics relevant to the field and has passed these courses.Also, during your degree studies you will get connections from your course mates, from your professors, perhaps from the computer club you are joining, etc. Everybody of them can later on help you with finding a job. I got recommended to my first workplace by my course mate. Which connections you'll be using when studying on your own?Yes, universities/colleges differ. I have seen people telling how they learnt nothing really during their studies. I have read how in India the studies are mostly theoretical and people are unable to produce a code that compiles. But where I live, the studies were very practice heavy. We actually learnt stuff relevant for the field. We built thesis projects that were taken into an actual use by people. So, universities differ.But, assuming you will get lucky with your university then that is any times better than trying to study on your own. When you are studying on your own your picks on what to study and what not to study, these picks are subjective not objective. You do not know what you do not know. You learn what interests you and you leave what seems boring. Yet in a university professors teach you what you have to know. Even when you think it is irrelevant, too difficult, or boring.Yes, a degree alone will not get you hired. Your knowledge, skills, experience you gained during your studies, your projects you built, that gets you hired. But that is what usually comes when doing degree studies.Going back to what I told about hiring then having a degree will make you have much better chances in being called to the interview. Without a degree the HR person can just skip your application. And, from your post it is clear you do not have a clear idea about which projects to build. That does not compete with people who build hobby projects and that using these when it's done.So, if possible, go for a degree.",

This is based on your resume versus the job requirements for the job you're applying for. Without a degree and without experience in lieu of a degree, I imagine all recruiting companies will auto-trash your resume.Yes, I would highly recommend a degree. Speak with a counselor at a school you're interested in, just to find out your options, various programs, degrees.

You may be in for a pleasant surprise.The beginner stuff is usually not that big of a deal and does not require you to have the latest and greatest hardware. And even if you get to a point where you need more processing power, you can find cloud-based solutions so you don't have to buy a new system. Worry about hardware restrictions when you encounter them, then you also will know what to look for in a solution.Again, my main advice is to just start with what you have. Edit: Typo.",

You haven't written lots of useless comments, and the few you have seem suitable. You have made a good choice (generally, but see my next paragraph) on naming things, which many beginners suck at. My main criticism would be the name of the function `generate_board()` - I don't think that's an accurate description of what it does. The board is already \"generated\" and present in the `board` array. This function just *displays* it, so I think a name such as `display_board()` would be more accurate.There are many areas for improvement once you learn more and gain more experience, though. For example, your `check_winner()` function could be split up to make it shorter and more readable, e.g. create a function `bool is_tie()` which encapsulates the tie determination and returns true or false appropriately, then call that from `check_winner()`.You could try separating the game logic from the input/output. By doing that you make it easier to change how the game looks (such as making a GUI version, where the logic is the same, but the display mechanism is entirely different). For example instead of `check_winner()` printing the result, it could return a value that indicates the state of the game. The main game loop would then use that returned value to decide what to output.",

Avoid global variablesRight now board, playing, size\\_of\\_board are all global. This works but doesn't scale. Pass them as parameters instead:void check\\_winner(std::string board\\[\\], bool& playing);2. Use char instead of std::string for single charactersstd::string for \"x\" and \"o\" is overkill:const char X = 'x';const char O = 'o';const char SPACE = ' ';char board\\[9\\] = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};More memory efficient and faster comparisons.3. Use std::array instead of C-style array\\#include std::array board = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};Then you get board.size() instead of the sizeof trick.4. Tie detection bugYour tie check breaks early if it finds a SPACE, but that's wrong - game isn't a tie if there are empty spaces. Should be:bool is\\_full = true;for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {if (board\\[i\\] == SPACE) {is\\_full = false;break;}}if (is\\_full) {// it's a tie}5. Use ternary for turn switchingcurrent\\_turn = (current\\_turn == X) ? O : X;6. Consider an enum for playersenum class Player { X, O, None };Prevents invalid states and makes code clearer.7. Magic numbers3 and 9 appear everywhere. Define them:constexpr int BOARD\\_SIZE = 9;constexpr int ROW\\_SIZE = 3;Overall solid for a beginner. The logic is correct (except tie check), code is readable, and you handled input edge cases. Next steps would be wrapping this in a class and adding a simple AI opponent.Keep building!",

What you can do is to have functions that don't touch IO at all, and just take parameters and return values. For example, `generate_board` returns a board object (or sets a global variable for now, if you haven't learnt classes yet). `set_cell(x, y, state)` sets the value in the cell, `check_winner` returns the winner. Then you'll have a method called `render_board` that renders the board on to the screen. Separating your program into various parts helps in testing (later), and also you'll be able to easily change parts of your program without breaking the other. For example, you can use the same tic tac toe logic, but instead use a GUI window.",

Web site files get read by browsers, and the browsers do whatever the files say: show some text and images and apply css rules to make them look the way you want.But the browser doesn't fetch the web site files you just saved **unless you tell it to.** After you change your .css file, try **holding the shift key and pressing the refresh button** in Edge. It's the little circle at the upper left of the Edge window. That tells Edge to reload the HTML file it's showing and all the linked images, .css files, .js files, and other objects.Or **hold the Shift key and press F5**. That does the same thing. It's what I do.There are software solutions to make Edge (or other browsers) automatically refresh themselves when a file changes.

After that, I pick one and move on. Bad choice? I'll refactor later. Most \"wrong\" decisions cost way less time than endless deliberation.**My take on your specific case:**Singleton for input is fine for a hobby engine. Big engines avoid it for testability and flexibility, but you're not building Unreal. The simpler mental model of `Keyboard::Get()` is worth it.**The real skill isn't picking the \"best\" design - it's getting comfortable refactoring when requirements change.**Ship something.

But other people work differently: they like to start by understanding the basic building blocks, then seeing how they're combined.For larger projects, there's an argument to be made that it's best to have all of your helper functions living in separate files, with the main function living just by itself in a single top-level file. This does sidestep (or at least defer) the problem a little.> The first multi line script i did upon running, made it difficult to refer to a variable in the top level function.This seems unrelated to the order in which you define your functions. Maybe we can give more advice here if you give an example or describe the scenario in more detail.",

Here's how I think through projects:# My Project Planning Process1. **I figure out who the project is for.** Who's going to use it? Even if it's just me.2. **I figure out what the user wants or needs to do.** I write statements like \"As a User, I can do \\_\\_\\_ so that \\_\\_\\_.\" Basically I'm figuring out what the user wants to do and why.3. **From there I usually start getting ideas for pages and what will be on the page.** I write them down. I draw some rough sketches. I mean actually write with pen and paper. You don't have to but I find that stepping away from screens for this preliminary planning helps me think better.4. **I like to take those sketches and bring them to full mockups.** I don't know that it's necessary, but it helps me to not have to think about styling and layout when I'm writing code. You could also use AI tools to make these mockups.5. **Then I get to building the project.** I try to follow TDD (Test Driven Development) and scaffold things out. I try to procrastinate the implementation details as much as possible. That way I can answer those questions about how to structure the project and everything one at a time",

You had fast access and slow access memory.One example was drum memory. At the most basic, there is a [write][erase][read] head over a spinning magnetic drum track. You had to wait for your data to sweep under the read head to get it - however long that took. This was a destructive process, because then the head passed under a magnet. This data was either written a moment later at the read head, or a write was scheduled to intercede the passive loop.They then put a smaller, faster access loop over just a few degrees of the track, and had a larger, slower loop for the rest of the track, and this would take a couple sets of heads to pull off.But this tech got faster still, and this is the one you can mimic - they used coils of wire, and sent modulated signals down it. Again with the feedback loop - if you wanted a piece of data, you had to wait for it to come around. If you wanted to persist that data, you had to immediately write it back on the wire. If you wanted to change it, you had to intercede the passive loop. You could add more storage with a longer wire, you could get lower latency with a shorter wire.So that's what you can do - send data to an echo server, one on the furthest computer on the opposite, most remote destination to you on Earth or as ambitious as the DSN, and the data is stored ostensibly in the transmission itself. Want some data? You'll have to wait for that data to get back to you. Want to persist it? You'll have to send it back out. Want to change it? You get your chance as it's coming back to you and it's time to send again.Call it a time sequence data cache.---If that doesn't quite fit the bill, then google \"fountain codes\", and implement your own bit-torrent-like protocol.",

        "body": "> My question after all this intro is, is it possible to apply DDIA concepts to personal projects for the sake of it?Yes. Basically, what you should do is weigh the importance of having applications that can:1. Horizontally scale, and2. Tolerate/self-heal from outages ...much more strongly then you normally would for personal projects.Usually, we ignore reliability for personal projects. But if you're trying to practice distributed systems, it makes sense to make it your main focus, even if there isn't really a need for it.> Is this viable in the slightest to learn these technologies? While I understand the theory behind them, distributed systems is not something I'm learning or will learn at my job and it's something I found super super interesting.I think it'll be possible for you to pick up a solid basic understanding of these tools -- enough for you to get an understanding of their strengths/weaknesses, and when to use them.Picking up a truly in-depth understanding may be harder. Usually, that deeper intuition comes only after either dedicated study or after spending an extended amount of time using the tool in production, seeing first-hand the limitations and quirks of that tool.> If this is possible, are there ways for me to simulate many users or requests without breaking the bank in something like AWS?Some suggestions:1. Deliberately give your app very small amounts of cpu/mem, and/or deliberately add in sleep statements and such into your app to forcibly handicap your app so it can handle only 3 QPS or something. This means even modest amounts of traffic will cause a naive app to start becoming overloaded, which in turn gives you multiple opportunities to practice building support for horizontally scaling.2. Look into setting up automatic horizontal autoscaling of some sort, to automate downsizing your application when you're not currently stress-testing it.3. Alternatively, if your app is inherently expensive to run, just completely tear it down every time you're finished for the day. To reduce tedium, look into using terraform or something to automate the setup and teardown.4. Eventually, consider using something like Kubernetes to run everything. This will obviously take a lot more effort -- but doing it does mean you can test locally by setting up Kubernetes on your local machine, using VMs to simulate running on a fleet of machines. Aside from simulating traffic, also be sure to do chaos testing of some sort, where you randomly kill your machines to simulate unexpected hardware failures and/or temporarily network blackhole them to confirm your application as a whole can tolerate it, not lose user data, not enter an inconsistent state, etc.> Lastly, I know that Kafka is a little bit of an overkill for a toy project but I kinda wanna simulate this for learning purposes.Yeah -- I'd say it's overkill in general. In production, state is the enemy: the moment something is stateful, you have to worry about keeping it backed up/replicated in some way so you can tolerate unexpected hardware/network failure, which in turn often places constraints on how you can scale, etc...This is why DDIA spends so much time talking about databases and such -- figuring out how to manage state is by far the hardest part of designing and maintaining a distributed system.So for a prod system, it behooves us to go out of our way to design our architecture to keep as many of our components stateless as possible. (Stateless == they may maintain a local cache, but it'd be perfectly fine and safe to abruptly nuke a replica at any time.)But for a toy project, I think your instinct is correct. Now is the best time to play around with different technologies, even when they're not needed. This may end up causing your overall architecture to be more complex then needed, but I think that's perfectly acceptable if your goal is to become comfortable with different cloud/distributed-systems building blocks.",

Do you have a sort of mental checklist that a project needs to qualify for before doing so, or is it more just a second nature kind of thing?I know you may never need a microservice as it might introduce more complexity than it's worth, for example, but I'm wondering when you are like \"yeah okay, we need a microservice here\".Example from my experience of when to decouple was, and I know this super small fry, I added a lambda to run some puppeteer code to generate PDFs on AWS as we ran into some strange IIS worker processor quirk where the chrome process was executed twice when running this on Node/Nest. Spent about 2 days trying to figure it out until I went the AWS option instead. This came with the benefit of not having a heavy dependency like puppeteer in our bundle, although it does come with the cost of vendor lock-in to a feature, which I'm okay with in this case since there's a daily S3 cleanup and the function is used 10 times a day most, so cost is non existent.Also thanks again, this really has been invaluable feedback/input, I wish I could upvote you more than once!",

Alerting when discrepancies hit thresholdsLearning: building reliable payment integrations is WAY harder than docs suggest. Stripe's API is solid but reconciliation logic across different payment methods is chaotic.The data science angle: this is just supervised classification on transaction pairs - pattern matching code does what humans do but without typos. The problem isn't technical - it's that nobody wants to build \"boring\" tools.But this is exactly where first-principles thinking wins. The market doesn't care if your SaaS is sexy - they care if it saves them hours of manual work and prevents chargebacks.",

If you are using arrows or lines or pseudo-syntax (that does not compile), it is up to you. The point of pseudocode is to convey the idea of the process/method. I will give an example:1) if [boy.name](http://boy.name) starts with Ü -> the boy is most likely from Europe. if [boy.name](http://boy.name) starts with Ф -> the boy is most likely from Greek or Russia.You can look at it and instantly understand that you are checking the name of a boy and based on how the letter looks like, you are assuming where he is from. Because different countries use different alphabets and different letters. I can claim that what I wrote are two \"if\" sentences. Perhaps part of a \"switch\" statement. But no way what I wrote compiles or runs in any programming language. It is a pseudocode. Understandable to a human but not runnable by a machine.2)public static String getFamilyName(some person) {name = getNameFromDatabase(some person)familyName = splitTheName(name)return familyName}It is more code-looking pseudocode. It even uses a little bit Java syntax. But will it compile? No. Will it work like this? No. Will it tell what happens? Absolutely.You can see that a method gets some person as an input. Then you retrieve his name from a database. And then you split the name and return the last part of it. The flow is understandable. How you are accessing the database? Not important. Will it work with names like Alfonso Maria de Borbon y Borbon? No. It assumes the person to have only first and last name. But will it give the idea of the process? Definitely.By an idea a pseudocode is something that even a non-IT person can read and understand. Free from language-specific and syntax-specific things.But why the first option is answer to the question you asked, that got answered by others.",

I think they want you to think of the 'name' because when you're writing code, that's usually what you're working with, and so they're being very literal about it. the question is almost getting to the point of having answers like \"you use your keyboard to type up the variable's name on the right side of the expression\" which is even more hilariously specific. it might be helpful for some students but for most is prolly making it sound overcomplicated for no reason.",

Once I realized that, writing recursive functions became easier for me.That seems obvious now, but the professor who first taught recursion to me didn't hammer that concept into me, probably because he thought it was already intuitive and obvious. (It wasn't to me.)And writing the rest of the recursive function (the non-base case part) takes a *leap of faith*: You have to believe that the recursive function you call from inside your function will return what you want. Once you decide what you want for it to return, you have to work with that output. And after that, you will have to make sure the internals of your recursive function returns exactly what you want it to return when you called it. (Sorry is this is very abstract, but recursion is a very abstract concept.)And you may have noticed that reading already-written code is often more difficult to read and understand than writing new code (even if you're the one who wrote the code in the first place!). This is especially true with recursive code, so when you're calling the function recursively, add comments to explain that you're doing so, preferably with some explanation as to what the recursive call is doing, in contrast to the current call.",

Very easy.But how would you do it recursively?You could break down the process into two steps1. If there's only one number, then we return that number. This is the base case, and where the recursion returns2. otherwise, we return the first number plus the sum of the remaining subset of numbersBased on this definition, we can write each of the following inputs as such* sum(\\[1,2,3,4,5\\]) = 1 + sum(\\[2,3,4,5\\])* sum(\\[2,3,4,5\\]) = 2 + sum(\\[3,4,5\\])* sum(\\[3,4,5\\]) = 3 + sum(\\[4,5\\])* sum(\\[4,5\\]) = 4 + sum(\\[5\\])* sum(\\[5\\]) = 5Now if you look at sum(\\[4,5\\]) and you sub in the value of sum(\\[5\\]) you will see that it is equal to 4 + 5 = 9And then for sum(\\[3,4,5\\]) you can sub in the value of sum(\\[4,5\\]) with 9, which gives 3 + 9 = 12The key to solving recursion is to identify how you can repeat the algorithm on a subset of the input so that when you solve a smaller problem, that solution can be used to solve the larger problem.The same applies to node-based structures. Every tree has a root and a bunch of children attached to that root. children also has its own sub-tree with the child as the root, and a bunch of children.So you can create a recursive algorithm where you pick a root and recurse on the children, until you reach a leaf node which is a tree with no children.",

It's not made easier by the fact that there are very few examples that are both (a) intuitive and (b) more easily done with recursion than iteration. This means you either get examples you don't understand or examples where you don't see the point of recursion.Let's think about computing the height of a tree. The height of a tree is the longest distance from the root to a leaf node (we'll assume that a tree with just one node is height 1 and a tree that isn't there at all has height 0).Suppose you want to compute the height of a tree. Imagine I tell you that the height of the left branch is 7 and the height of the right branch is 4 (how? I'm magic. I just know these things). Can you tell me what the height of the whole tree is? If you think about the definition, the longest path to a leaf node is going to involve going either left or right from the root. If you go left (that's one step) then you know that the longest path to a leaf *from that point* is 7 (because I told you). If you go right (also one step) then you know that the longest path to a leaf is 4 (again, I told you). So the longest path from the root is `1 + max(7, 4)` which is 8.This solution, unfortunately, involves a magic step, where you ask me what the height of the left and right subtrees are and you use those results to determine the height of the overall tree. Wouldn't it be great if you had a function that would tell you the height of a tree so that you could use it to determine the height of another tree?You do. It's this function we are talking about. We just change this: func height(tree) return 1 + max(ask_lurgi_for_the_height(tree.left), ask_lurgi_for_the_height(tree.right))to func height(tree) return 1 + max(height(tree.left), height(tree.right))There is one thing missing from this, which every recursive function needs: a way to stop. There has to be some state (we call it the \"base case\") that you can work out immediately, without doing any other steps. This should be the smallest possible example. How about the empty tree? Not a tree with just one node, but a tree has no nodes at all. We'll say it has height 0. func height(tree) if empty(tree) return 0 return 1 + max(height(tree.left), height(tree.right))",

It's not really a loss if you quit and get ANY other temp job.",

        "body": "> from being paged at 3AM to chasing tight deadlines to preparing for weekly ops review in front of all the members of the orgsI've actually had all of those, for about 8 years:1. I was part of a tier-1 on-call rotation at my org. The money was amazing (I made ~55k a year from just the overtime oncall bonus). I do get paged about 2-3 a week when I was oncall, but we had a good playbook and heavily automated the triage to get rid of false positives. The frequency of 3am pages was just about zero to once a year per oncall, with 95% of pages coming in during work hours. That said, we were very disciplined about our oncall debt (proactively worked on making it as actionable as possible), so that was a major reason I never really minded it. (Fun fact, I actually helped promote one of our L3s by staffing them on reducing our org-wide oncall flakiness problem)2. Chasing tight deadlines - this is a function of how good your immediate upline leadership is. The more you feel like you're always on the offensive trying to hit arbitrary deadlines, the more that it's a sign of unstable leadership. Unfortunately, at a big tech company, you usually don't have too much direct control over this. I would sit in every planning/ops review and push back on unrealistic timelines, but if your L9 just sets a timeline (either you guys hit IO or we're not funding the product), well, then you only have two kind of shitty options. I've been fortunate to have had good sponsors/uplines for most of my career, who took me at my word when I tell them - no, it cannot be done, but we can descope or find a different launch target. The reason I eventually left was because we got a new VP who didn't listen to any of their area leads telling them that their timelines weren't reasonable. So, to answer your question, I probably handled it poorly by just bouncing when the going got tough :)3. Preparing for the weekly ops reviews - this is a cultural problem in big tech. We LOVE ops/steering/product/eng/design/anything reviews. Now, as aspiring TLs will likely know, there's a \"good\" reason for them - visibility with L+2s/L+3s who can vouch for you on your promo statement. The cost are these random blocks of time where you need to get together with a big or small group of people you don't really often work with for vague / unnecessary reasons (to shoehorn in collaboration when none really exists) but where you all know you sort of have to be there to play the game. The good news is that once you have a good TPM/PgM, they generally care a LOT more about these meetings being highly polished than you will, so they'll usually do the heavy lifting work of writing the slide templates, filling them out week over week, and setting the agenda. The bad news is that once you have dedicated TPM/PgMs, then at least 20% of your week will be taken up by these different types of reviews where you're either getting or giving visibility to/of someone else to help advance your/their career. How do I cope with this? I just play the game. At the end of the day, a career in big tech is really just figuring out that you're playing the game. 9/10 times, you're going to be in a team who pays a lot of lip service about meritocracy but will continue to operate like any other big complex organization - there will always be an in-group, the favorites of the org leads who get tapped with better opportunities and are set up with faster career advancement. If you want to advance, you will unfortunately have to play that game.That said, one thing I was very passionate about was ensuring that none of the people around me had to be exposed to too much shit, so growing my team from 4-20 people while still being able to remain an IC was actually rewarding enough for me to still feel pretty happy for most of those 8 years.It's also a double edged sword. They paid me well enough that I make more passively than at the job, so when I got annoyed by our new leadership direction, the constant churns, the vague threats of being given less work but at the same pay (that's legitimately how they threaten you, I never understood this psychology), and just the general lack of direction under the new leadership direction, I just bounced.---Edit: I forgot to mention. The thing that was most stressful for me are all of the ducking red tapes to launch even the smallest bug fixes. I still have anxiety nightmares about having to beg for a launchcal bit for a prelaunch review.",

Their FMV hasn't recovered and my stock is almost worth less than when I bought it. It went from a place where we would avoid hiring someone if they're an asshole to asshole behavior being tolerated everywhere under the guise of \"making better software\". ICs were ignored in favor of leaders making decisions who didn't know what the fuck was going on.

Everyone keeps saying you have to post on LinkedIn, you have to network, you have to build a personal brand. I don’t like talking to people outside of work and family, and the amount of bootlicking and fake enthusiasm you’re expected to show just to impress corporate types and land a job feels insane.Most of the cracked engineers I’ve worked with or know don’t do any of that. They’re loyal at their jobs, keep their heads down, and just want to do deep, meaningful technical work. On the flip side, a lot of the fake people I’ve seen spend more time crafting LinkedIn posts than actually improving their skills or doing real engineering work, and they all seem to have some hidden agenda.I literally saw a dude interview for big tech just so he could create content and attract more juniors to pay for his coaching side hustle.

Yes, there are more opportunities here but it's not surprising to me that you're having difficulty being considered for them. I think you'd do yourself a significant favor by being open to relocating, even if it's out to somewhere you'd rather not live. What you need right now is experience and you need to be open to whatever you need to do to get it. That might mean living in Boise for a few years or something.If you have to stay in the bay, then you need to network hard. You're not likely to get a job by spamming your resume at automated filters. You need someone to take a chance on you, and that's more likely to happen if they know you, not just your resume. Go to meet ups, see if you can find a start up founder or something who just needs warm bodies willing to work for less than market rate and just get some years of experience under your belt. The more experience you have the easier all this gets, but you may have to eat shit for a while to get it.",

My most recent layoff was this most recent spring and I started a new, better job 3 months later.The thing I've learned is that worrying doesn't do you any good. Always stay sharp on your skills and build confidence that you can be resilient to whatever life throws at you. You don't have to keep your head in the sand, just learn to build yourself up so you can land somewhere if you need to.I also highly recommend therapy as a way to work through stress and identify ways you can find agency a chaotic career.

I, a software engineer working for the last 7 years as a developer, can’t easily find a job now!I think it is really hard to make that first step, so you have into your cv something dev-like, but I’ve seen difference when I included some of my personal non-work related projects in my cv in the interviews count.I propose you forget what you knew and start over by trying to create an easy MVP project from zero. MVP stands for min viable project. It could be a todo list, because it is something we all know how it works, so the specifications are clear to you, and uses all the CRUD you could ever need. Just create a simple list with no ui first, and keep on adding until you understand how it works.After getting back into developing, I would start a more demanding project to differentiate from most junior developers. Something with user permissions, or just update my list app to have more features along with permissions.I don’t know if these would help, but this is how I would do it today! At my first developing job back in 2019 (ai graduated near the end of 2018), I kept making personal projects the first two years and it seemed to have helped getting me a new job back then.",

However, during OLR, they always get called out for stagnating in role and get labelled as quiet quitting. The stigma stems from lack of visibility in delivering large features that leadership team cares about or just lack of demos in general. This may not be the case across all companies, but it was the case in FANG when I worked there.From a performance perspective, “lack of ownership” let’s call it, will lead to the SWE act defensive towards bugs and user feedback. Sure the AC might have not required this or there is scope creep, but ultimately the company pays you to own the end user experience end to end. So the tension between SWE and product manager, even if the SWE is in the right is seen negatively.",

Passion makes the job a lot easier - doing what you love, and all - but professionalism, doing the job you were hired to do well, is what really counts. I will say, though, if you’re dragging yourself into work in the morning, you should really question whether this is the right job for you, and I’d be concerned for you if you were doing this at the expense of your mental health.More generally, you’ll find that a lot of people in the industry are like this. They don’t hate their job, find it challenging enough, but it is isn’t their undying passion.

Do not view this guy as your friend, he is not that at all.>they both seemed genuinely sad but idk I expected my manager to say more knowing he knew but he was just tucked away quiet.He threw you under the bus lol.

For the real time chat interface did you implement it via REST, websockets? Did you persist the conversation history client side via local storage or backend in a database?

Anyway - You need to apply to 1k+ jobs if that's what it takes and you need to be willing to relocate. I'd only focus on roles that are in your old tech stack, that are in office, and require 0-3 years of experience.I'd also highly recommend the OMSCS at Georgia tech. It costs 8k and has a great course catalog. It'll give you a hard reset and gives you an opportunity to apply to internships alongside applying to full-time roles. As for your resume, you need to look at Jake's resume, it's a standardized template. Have gemini distill your experience and format it to fit in Jake's resume. I feel like gemini has the best creative and visual model so it'd be the best for this use case. There are other standardized resume templates, I'm not positive Jake's resume is still the most recommended so do your research. I remember his resume template being referenced all the time a few years ago.Use a mock interview platform to find where your weaknesses are (idk what they are, I think pramp is one?). Pay for it and utilize it as much as necessary. Once you fine-tune your ability to conduct interviews, grind leetcode for 3-4 months, 30 to 60 mins a day with one day off a week. Use neetcode.io. No excuses. Stretch it to 6 months if you want to target highly paid roles at tech companies. Take whatever salary you can get, even if it's 60k it doesn't matter. You need to get back into the market, rebuild your marketability. After a year or two you can focus on more desirable roles. Seriously you can do this, I don't care how bad the market is 2.5 years is unacceptable. You're unfocused and undisciplined. No offense. Be hungry and tenacious. Good luck man, I believe in you.",

You really need do everything in your power to stand out nowadays. I’m sure you’re applying to jobs frequently like many others and I’m sorry to take the tough love approach, but you need to try harder.Some advice I can share however is looking for production support(L2 or L3) roles. These roles have a lower barrier of entry and you work adjacent to software engineers to resolve production issues. Not the most exciting job, but can lead to something better with time by having some dialogue with managers about your skillset if openings become available internally.Also as some others have said, your resume could definitely use some refactoring.

Rejection emails were my daily bread and i am not sure if it was my luck after completing studies on November end, I was already on final round interviews for two companies.Do not stop applying and also refine your resume throughout every rejection, I tried new formats, new keywords, placements and everything also I did few certifications too that might help depending on your tech stack.

One of the other orgs also reached out since she accepted the offer. This was an easier job search than her last one post-layoff in 2023, much harder than the one in 2020 when everything was going crazy, and easier than her new grad search in 2017-2018, though at the time she was looking at a pretty narrow set of cities where I could continue my unrelated career, too.Some relevant factoids:* She was employed (albeit at a pathetic pay rate after a 2023 layoff) beforehand.* 4.5yoe as a SWE with 3yoe as an SDET or QA prior.* MS in CS from a so-so state school. Unrelated BS.* After a handful of general applications that didn't produce even a \"no,\" she hyper-focused on job postings involving GIS experience as either a \"must\" or \"nice\" to have. She had this experience first from a previous career as a wildlife tech and more recently has 3yoe doing something similar as a SWE in her current soon-to-end job.* The pay in her new job is by no means silicon valley, but she's very much interested in quality of life and stability vs the brass ring. She wants the Lenovo and not the Macbook, so to speak.* She will be building flood prediction and mitigation software for a huge civil engineering company. Her current role is for an environmental consulting company building a land use planning and ecological footprint reduction app for corporate clients.* 80% increase in monetary compensation, drastically better benefits, fully remote.",

You're not the only one with no replies, even if you are senior level.Third: Isn't engineering what you love? Are you as good and passionate about anything else than this? If your financial situation isn't super tight, you should really pour your heart and soul into your next startup, whether it's something you've tried before or something brand new. It might take months, maybe years, but if this is what you want to do, you have to approach it as something you love and not something you're nervous it will fail. If your financial situation is tight, then you make ends meet with jobs perhaps unrelated to software, but you keep working on a product you have in mind on the side. If coding, programming and software development is what makes you happy, you should do it regardless of income potential.You seem confused about one important thing: you meld successful career/income with engineering. I think you should shift your mindset - if development is truly what you enjoy, do it regardless of success and income. Nowadays, those who succeed as engineers are both talented and lucky. So the most important thing to do is to continue developing software while networking, applying for jobs and/or trying a new startup. I know the latter might not seem very appealing to you, but it's the only way to sustain income while continuing to do what you love.",

If taking that position is attractive and wouldn’t hurt your home life then why not take it? It shows growth at your current company which can set you apart from others. Basically you getting “promoted” at your current job is a better indicator than you getting that same position elsewhere.

        "body": "First off, I'm really sorry to hear about your role being eliminated—that's a tough spot after 11 years, especially with the added pressure of relocation. It sounds like you're weighing two solid but very different paths, and that's a stressful decision.Given your situation, here are a few thoughts that might help:1. \\*\\*Assess the internal role beyond the travel.\\*\\* A tech lead manager position with direct reports and higher comp is a significant growth opportunity. If the exciting industry aligns with your long-term goals, the travel might be a worthwhile trade-off. However, consider the practical impact on your life in Florida—would it be sustainable? Sometimes a role that accelerates your career can open doors faster than a job search.2. \\*\\*If you lean toward taking the severance and job hunting,\\*\\* don't let the current market scare you into a rushed decision. With six months of salary plus savings, you have a generous runway. The key is to use that time strategically. Since you're not targeting FAANG, you can focus on companies where Leetcode isn't the sole gatekeeper.3. \\*\\*Your resume will be crucial.\\*\\* With your SRE experience, you have a strong foundation in reliability, automation, and likely cross-functional collaboration. Instead of a generic resume, tailor it to highlight pain points you've solved—think outages you prevented, cost savings from automation, or improvements in deployment frequency. Companies hire for problems they need solved, not just a list of skills.4. \\*\\*Research companies deeply.\\*\\* Look beyond job boards. Find companies in industries you're passionate about, then dig into their engineering blogs, Glassdoor reviews, or recent news. What challenges are they facing? Maybe they're scaling infrastructure or dealing with legacy system reliability. Your SRE background could directly address those pains.5. \\*\\*Transferable skills are your friend.\\*\\* Even if you move into a management role internally or externally, skills like incident management, capacity planning, and mentoring junior engineers are highly valuable. Frame your experience around outcomes—for example, \"Reduced system downtime by X%\" or \"Led post-mortems that improved team response time.\"If you do decide to job hunt, I built a tool called Resonant that helps job seekers research company pain points and match them to their resume skills—it's designed for situations exactly like this, where standing out requires more than just keywords. You can check it out at resonant.iamdelrio.com. It's free and might help you",

I assume that as soon as you knock the rust off in 3-6 months, you will leave for a Senior role with Senior pay. It’s too risky to hire you.​The Better Strategy:Instead of lowering your title, lower the company tier temporarily.​Avoid Big Tech/Startups for now. Their interview loops are brutal on 'rusty' candidates.​Target 'Boring' Industries. Look for Mid/Senior Data Engineer roles at insurance firms, hospitals, regional banks, or manufacturing companies.​The interview bar is often lower (less LeetCode, more practical SQL/Python).​The pace is slower, allowing you to re-learn on the job.​Rust ≠ Junior. You still know how data pipelines work; you just forgot the syntax. That comes back in 2 weeks. Do not reset your career clock because of a temporary confidence dip.",

It's an absolutely awful market, and there are people more skilled than you or farther ahead of you applying for the same roles as you, and forming part of the N hundred other applications for each listing you see. How are you going to prove yourself better than them? How are you going to convince hiring managers to move forward with you, and not them?If a while passes after you graduate and you've still got nothing in hand, I'd seriously consider going to grad school, but for a non-CS field. Some fields others here have mentioned include nursing, teaching, business (MBA), law, medicine, or some form of engineering. Some of these are harder than CS, but offer stronger career outlooks and better job security. The trades could be yet another option, but know that a lot of their hype is even more inflated than that of CS, and they're genuinely not for everyone.Don't wait around hoping for the economy to improve, either, because it genuinely might never. Did the automobile jobs ever come back to Detroit? Did factory workers ever get their jobs back? Exactly. And don't expect AI to \"create new tech jobs\" either, they're not going to be junior jobs.I'm sorry, I know I'm sounding pretty negative right now, but I don't want to give anyone a false sense of hope or security. It really is that bad, and we're all in the same boat. Just prepare for a rough next couple of years.",

My advice would be to dip you toes in backend. Be full stack. If you're getting blocked by backend bs, build some solutions to those problems. If they're good, you become the product owner/go to and then you really can't get replaced. I have a friend who had similar issues working for a large real estate company and left. within a couple months of leaving, he was offered nearly triple his TC to work as a contactor and maintain the systems he built. I'm trying to do something at my current company; large healthcare servicer, so we're probably dealing with a lot of the same issues you are.If that's not your thing, build stuff you're interested in. Doesn't matter what it is or if it's related to your current role at all. Just build something interesting to you so you're motivated to dive deep and and really learn the low level nitty gritty. When that gets boring, try building something else. If it doesn't get boring, maybe you can build something really high quality and useful, and now you run your own company, definitely not replaceable.",

I do honestly think I would be happier as a manager or an architect but applying to roles like that with an extensive SWE resume seems to be an uphill battle. When I apply to product/managerial roles, I hear crickets - this absolutely could be a resume issue but it doesn't seem like it based on my experience that I have no trouble getting interviews or hearing from recruiters for SWE roles (and a preemptive yes, I do have tailored resumes for product/engineering/architexture/etc).Whenever I have these conversations with recruiters or hiring managers, for the last two years I have emphasized that I would like to be further from day to day code and yet somehow every interview circles back to \"Well we want you to code and there will be opportunities for you to grow in other directions here. We don't want to pigeon hole you\" followed by sending me a Leetcode style algorithm test which seems like a pretty good benchmark to me that they either didn't listen or our goals are not really as aligned as they think.",

I’m not making any money but my skills have exploded in the last 14 months.The reason why I recommend it is because you get full autonomy over what you do. No bureaucracy. You get a chance to design, build, make mistakes and own something end to end. It’s just a great experience imo.There’s no guarantee that you’ll learn anything new at a different job or be given any autonomy to work on fun stuff that actually interests you. Not saying don’t do it but I’d really think about it. I went from being at home 3-5 days a week to being in the office 3 days a week.It is miserable when you barely have anything to do because there isn’t enough work in the pipeline but it could be worse and end up being a ton of work with no chance to breathe. I’ve never found the perfect job. I’ve always been buried alive in work or hardly having anything to do most days. I’d keep the job, find some passion projects, and just enjoy the gravy train because good things don’t last forever so ride it till the end.",

The point about big companies having low response rates due to volume and internal changes is spot-on—it’s easy to take that personally when it’s often not about you.One thing I’d add for anyone feeling stuck: when you’re applying to startups or smaller companies, try to research their specific pain points. Look at their recent blog posts, product updates, or even customer reviews. If you can subtly align your resume bullets with challenges they’re likely facing (e.g., “improved scalability” for a growing startup, “reduced latency” for a real-time app), it makes your application feel less generic and more like a solution.That shift from “here’s what I did” to “here’s how I can solve your problem” is what helped me stand out when I was job searching. In fact, I built a tool called Resonant (resonant.iamdelrio.com) to help with exactly that—it analyzes company signals and suggests which of your skills to highlight. But even without a tool, just spending 10 minutes per company to tailor your resume’s top bullet points can dramatically boost your response rate.Thanks for sharing your experience—it’s a solid reminder that persistence and a targeted approach pay off.",

Telling them you really want to do SWE signals that you will be unhappy in the role they are hiring for.​The Role itself (Red Flag): You mentioned 'hardware troubleshooting.' Be very careful here. True SRE is software engineering applied to infrastructure (coding in Python/Go, writing Terraform, managing scale). It is a great foundation for becoming a Backend Engineer or System Architect later.​The Risk: If the role is actually just IT Support/SysAdmin disguised with an SRE title (which the 'hardware' part suggests), it will be hard to pivot back to SWE later because you won't be pushing code.​Strategy: Apply for the SRE role as is. In the interview, ask: 'What percentage of my time will be spent writing code vs. manual troubleshooting?' If the coding is <30%, keep looking.",

When I looked for internal transfers and roles in other companies, I get both SRE and SWE offers just fine. Within comparable companies, the SWE offers were still as a senior, and in smaller companies they offered staff. Hiring managers also seemed to value the SRE experience a lot.I think there's a huge demand for people who can run production systems and understand lower level things.

I understand wanting to be completely candid, but unfortunately, interviewers aren't looking for transparency, they are looking for the most qualified and competent candidate. You are probably losing these job opportunities to people like him.Best of luck!",

Eventually, you're gonna need to interview, and a lot of the good jobs out there will have this as part of their interview steps. Might as well start learning. In addition to it preparing you for interviews, I have the maybe unpopular opinion that studying these things can make you a better developer. It builds muscle memory in your language of choice, and forces you to think about solving problems in certain ways.",

The system isn't about working harder. It's about **making the invisible workload visible** so you can manage it without burning out. It turns ambition into a sustainable action plan.

AI definitely bumps those expectations up, it's almost impossible to move at that pace without at least a basic LLM.I would redefine how you look at AI and what you think you're learning. Writing good code is a premium - whether it's AI-assisted or handwritten. You're still tackling design and best practices, no messy unexplainable code should get greenlit. Code reviews and standards are still a thing, and arguably emphasized more; you'd need to be the kind of engineer who's broader-thinking and knowledgeable.If the job is really a \"joke\" (I haven't heard of any job that is), it probably won't last. I'd consider career growth internally or externally and ask that questionVibes-based interview, you said?

The idea is you can sugar rush yourself very quickly to a work implementation - but something you can support long term is more difficult. There are a lot of ways to do this besides LLMs. For example removing code review would deliver software faster but it’s also just stupid. LLMs are not the first time I’ve seen someone try to push speed as the primary metric (hi management) but I’m guessing it will end just as badly. I don’t think LLMs will go away, you certainly can’t ban them, but we’re going to need to renegotiate our relationship with them.I’m hearing about developers putting out slop right now, and it’s getting caught, but there is no movement from management to PIP or fire those people who keep slopping. They feel like they’re discouraging AI use if they punish someone for creating garbage with LLMs. That’s going to have to change.",

Coding agents are much more popular in product software development where you have to ship maximum value to your customer in shortest time possible.

A 400k salary does well to incentivize source code spelunking whether it's stacked with bricks or spaghetti2. You are not your code. You are not your company. Code is an orchestrator and software are tools that automate or pave some new process to enable business. The end goal is not maintainability, it's money. I think you should focus on writing the minimally maintainable code to generate the most amount of business impact - potentially this could lead to extremely disciplined design before you type a single line, but it could also just as well lead to hacking something together -> ship it -> collect your merit -> get a comp bump and switch context.",

It's similar to Dev Associate. As I understand, Dev Associate is harder (deeper, vs wider). I couldn't tell you if SAA is impressive on it's own, or if both are worth it. Many people do SAA then do Dev. I felt that just getting Dev, the harder, more important one, done on it's own was enough. SAA is still tough too I imagine (2 vs 3 months basically?). I can only speak to my own experience and say I went from 0 interviews to weekly with the Dev Associate. Did I get more interviews because I had Dev over SAA? I don't know.SAA and Dev Associate are both good. Which, or both, I couldn't tell you 100%, but I went with Dev because I've heard it's more relevant to a web dev/full stack/SWE role.Couldn't speak on IT but I know IT is hard to break into too these days.I had very basic AWS experience before hand, basically deploying a couple websites on EC2 and some user permissions for a company. The stuff these certs go over are solutions for very large scale applications, thing basic simple websites don't usually need. It helped but wasn't huge.I'd say just pass the test to get the cert, you won't fully understand the material yet, but the first step of learning is just get the basic knowledge down.

Having a CS bachelors degree helps but not having worked in a related field since you graduated 7 years ago massively reduces it's value. THM/HTB are good for building skills but they're not going to add meaningful value to your CV. Same with certs really. Your problem is that you're going to be competing with fresh grads and people with professional tech experience. As someone with a stale degree, and a patchy work history that will raise serious concerns, I think you're going to struggle to break into the field.Even then, if you do somehow manage to get your foot in the door, is it the right field for you? Cybersecurity can be high stress and a lot of jobs are in consultancy where you'll face those billable hours you dislike so much. If you came across as someone who is super-excited about cybersecurity, I'd be more inclined to say go for it. However, you strike me more as a lost soul struggling to find direction in life who's considering cyber because you're out of ideas. I think you should spend more time reflecting on what you're good at, what sort of work suits your personality and see if you can figure out a field that might be a better fit for you.",
