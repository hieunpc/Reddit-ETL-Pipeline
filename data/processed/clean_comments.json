It’s like your first programming language, hard at first, but after that, new languages (or tools) are mostly syntax and platform differences.In data engineering, the core problems never change:* Where is the data stored?* Where does compute run?* How do I move data or compute efficiently?* How do I model and serve the data?Whether it’s Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, or Spark-on-whatever, you’re solving the same underlying problems with different interfaces. Many “new” platforms are abstractions over familiar engines (Spark) anyway.Most content creators aren’t learning everything from scratch each time; they’re reapplying the same approach to new tools. Once you’ve done that a few times, picking up a new stack is a breeze. Also, free tiers and cheap cloud setups make experimentation easy. You don't have to break your bank to spin up a Spark cluster. I’ve worked across multiple stacks as a consultant, and my approach has stayed the same: understand data, compute, movement, and modelling. The tool is just the means to get there.",

Some candidates tried inviting an AI \"note taker\" to the Teams call, that was denied access and was an immediate red flag (not one of them \\*asked\\* if they could do so).We then had people who seemed to hesitate before answering any question. Once or twice, nerves, every single question? It's pointing the way of stalling before waiting to see the text appear for them to regurgitate! There's also the tell of the eye darting off screen to read something... could be notes, but... given what they then said, it just gave the impression of reading from either someone else googling on their behalf, or AI LLM output.But every single one was derailed by this one simple trick... as hiring manager, I was interviewing the person for them, not their technical skills. There was some of that, but more in approach and mentality, rather than specific abilities, that would come in the next round. So I would just say to the candidate \"You have listed these ETL tools on your CV, which is your favourite and why?\"Every single time, the ones reading AI output would turn into a marketing bot, sounding like an advert for the tools, bullet point after bullet point. Not one of them highlighted a favourite without being asked again, and then couldn't actually answer definitively as to why they chose that above another, almost as if they'd just picked one at random. The humans answering that question would do so in a conversational manner, often immediately blurting out their favourite and then going through the pros and cons as to why.I can see the appeal of using AI to help, to act as a pointer to guide your answers, especially in areas of theory where you're rusty because you've been at the coalface for a while. But don't rely on it 100% to the point where you cannot actually hold a conversation with the person you're talking to.",

Snowflake/Databricks mainly give you less platform wrangling in exchange for cost and lock-in.

This is why most teams cannot afford to maintain it. It's working because our team is very mature. I don't think you can expect it for a team that has been stable for less than 5 years and is still overloaded with requests and production issues. Although, I expect black box ecosystems like Databricks and Snowflake to eventually provide an Open Metadata equivalent out of the box for their walled-garden tools, if they haven't yet, which would be disappointing.",

If delta tables specific, I would say look into the datafusion integration of delta-rs. Its the fatest query engine I have found for delta tables in azure. About 15x faster than spark.",

However, IME for very complicated jobs, the catalyst query optimizer behind Spark performs better than the other two - if you have more than 10ish non-broadcast joins in a given query, I would rather trust spark. You will need to spend more time on a dev setup (e.g. unit tests are awfully slow without a spark connect server which you fire up each morning), but you also get some goodies such as Spark UI/History Server and a really powerful and stable API.- As you are using Delta, I would be cautious with duckdb. Afaict, write support is not yet there, and even for reads I had undocumented not-implemented errors bubble up from the internal c++ code (on1.41 if I remember correctly). The API there does not yet look super stable.- On the off chance that you are in a corporate environment where your development machines run windows, strongly prefer polars over spark. Delta spark on windows is possible but a pain because of the Hadoop dependency.",

Being remote doesn’t mean you can just work your desired time slots.Anything else you’d probably have to ask the manager, find a relaxed role, or earn through hard work.Meetings are meetings, it’s probably somewhat more though because there’s not organic opportunities to interact with people so video meetings are about it.So to directly answer your last point. That desire is probably not going to fly and you’ll be unlikely to land a role if you flat out say that. Unless you are in a way different time zone than the company",

Remote is often misunderstood as \"work anywhere at any time\". Remote more accurately is rephrased as \"work from anywhere within the country you have working rights during specific hours which have been stipulated in a contract\".You also have the situation where if you work in the evening and there's nobody there with you, there's a strong possibility you're doing fuck all/maverick shit which is about to murder production tomorrow and there's nobody there to help.That being said, no harm in asking. You have to be okay with accepting this is really unlikely though.",

The entire company is remote.I can generally work \"U.S. business hours\" but might work East Coast hours one day and West Coast hours the next day depending on what works for my schedule. If I need to be gone for an hour in the middle of the day, I block it off on my calendar. If I need to go to a longer appointment, I'll book it either at the beginning or end of the day, block it off on my work calendar, then let people know in Slack the day before. If I need to flex more than two hours like that, I usually just take half a sick day--I think I get 9 sick days a year? \"Unlimited\" vacation days, though. The assumption is that sick days are short-notice while vacation days are approved in advance.I usually have two 1-hour meetings on Mondays, then no meetings the rest of the week; every 4-6 weeks, I have a 30-minute meeting with my manager. There is a monthly Engineering \"meeting\", but it's recorded, so you only need to join the Zoom if you feel like watching live or want to ask questions in the Q\\&A; the agenda is provided in advance. Everything else is asynchronous, including the daily standups, Product updates, etc., unless you want to ask someone questions \"live\" to debug a project you're working on. Then, a meeting is scheduled. \"Just hopping on a call\" isn't really a thing in my team, because if you need to ask detailed questions on how to do something, that means the documentation needs to be improved, which means someone needs to write more down for the next person. So again: the call should have an agenda prepared and sent in advance.I am on-call 24/7 a week at a time, every 6ish weeks. There are rarely pages outside of business hours, though. Only a few times per year.I would say all the flexibility on my team is because everyone is senior+, so no one really requires close \"supervision\" per se. We also have tight delivery deadlines, so regardless of schedule flexibility, you won't last long if you don't get your work done.",

A lot of good data engineers started exactly where you are, analyst first, then thrown into DE work.Those two books are solid choices, especially The Data Warehouse Toolkit. That already puts you ahead of most people watching random YouTube playlists.A few practical suggestions that usually help in this transition First you should lean hard into SQL beyond analytics use. Window functions, performance thinking, indexing basics, and understanding how queries behave on larger tables matter way more in data engineering than fancy Python at the start.Second, focus on systems, not tools. You do not need to master every framework. Try to really understand things like how data moves from source to warehousebatch vs streaming at a conceptual levelidempotency, backfills, and schema changes If you get those ideas, tools become much easier to pick up later.Third, build small but realistic projects. Not Kaggle-style analytics, but things like:ingesting CSV or API data into a warehousetransforming it with SQLhandling schema changes or bad data Even simple pipelines teach more than watching videos. For courses on a budget, I would look at Data engineering content from freeCodeCamp and similar channels, but selectively, some Udemy courses can be decent if you wait for sales, just avoid anything that is purely tool-driven without explaining why things are doneCloud provider docs and tutorials can actually be very good once you know what to look for. since you are already doing DE tasks at work, that is huge. Pay attention to what breaks, what is painful, and what people complain about. That real-world friction is where most learning happens.You do not need a formal degree right now to grow into this role. Curiosity plus hands-on exposure beats structured programs more often than people admit.If you are enjoying the work and asking these questions, you are probably on the right path.",

Are there null values in your join keys (this is usually a problem that causes a lot of skew and performance issues)? How much data are you joining per row, as in what is the content of the columns you're joining (if this is big this also causes problems)? Are you increasing the number of rows with these joins? Also, what is actually failing when it does? Try to see what's going on using the Spark UI while it's running to see what's taking so long, or what's going wrong.I think repartitions and partitions will mess up your performance. Repartitions will be pointless because I think Spark will reshuffle with the next join anyway, and persists make it more difficult for Spark to optimize the entire plan and may take up space on memory / disk, which you may already be lacking.If column renaming seems to mess up your execution plan try to do all of the column remaining before the joins (so rename columns for each dataset first) and/or do all the renaming at the end. I don't see how your action plan would result in anything other than a bunch of BroadcastHashJoins with no shuffling in between this way, given all of the joins are joining small tables to a large table on the same unique ID.Also check how much memory each executor is using and how the data is distributed across your workers. If your data doesn't fit in your cluster's memory it will become very slow either way.All that said, if you're doing 27 joins on 820k rows with max 64 cores it might just take a long time either way.

Even if each side is small, Spark’s optimizer might not treat it that way. Tools like AQE exist to reshape joins dynamically, but in practice they are not always enough, especially if Spark does not recognize your joins as equi joins.What changed the game for us was three things combined:* Using explicit broadcast hints instead of letting Spark guess, for example `broadcast(df_small)` Forces a BroadcastHashJoin rather than a nested loop join.* Reducing the logical plan spike by collapsing intermediate transformations. This means fewer repeated `.withColumn()` calls.* Using DataFlint’s plan diff tooling to see where broadcast dropped out. That exposed the real culprit.You can tune memory, partitions, and caching, but none of that matters if the plan never selects an efficient join algorithm.",

It typically requires a breadth of knowledge, so inherently it's harder to get your foot in the door as a junior DE as opposed to a junior SWE, for example.The market has also been rough for a few reasons -- market saturation due to lots of folks trying to pivot to DE, companies leaning more heavily on GenAI and senior engineers to attempt to replace junior engineers, and the overall ebb and flow of the tech field over the past couple years.That said, if you make a concerted effort with your studies and plan of action (whether that's trying to find the relevant internships, or trying to get your foot in the door as either a SWE or DA, etc.) it could be a worthwhile endeavor.",

The problem was OP was changing the vars and that is one of the assumptions for partial parsing.I have thought of making a package that splits out dbt projects into smaller jobs/selectors to improve compile speed to make this easier in more circumstances. A lot of the workarounds requires airflow or similar but that doesn't help us dbt cloud folk.Also, to be clear, parse is likely a misnomer here, dbt doesn't have to touch the db on a parse normally. Compile is what is probably eating OPs compute and time. Even then it's kinda crazy how much time it's taking for them. We have 5000+ models (with thousands of tests too) and it doesn't take that long for a full compile. Like 3-5 minutes. And that's including a lot of introspective adapter calls.I've also seen other folks manipulate the hash that dbt checks so it doesn't think it needs the full parse as an alternative workaround. It does need something like airflow to do it, given I'm on dbt cloud I can't.",

It spends more time shuffling the index tree than actually storing your data.Try using \"rewriteBatchedStatements=true\" in your JDBC Connection String and let us knw if it solves the performance issue.Also, if it is one time thing or full reload, you would be better off dropping the indexes, the non-primary ones at least, before you begin with the load/reload.Hope this helps.",

I don't think this information is really a hard requirement for getting started though.Data engineering is just so incredibly broad. So much of your day to day job is dictated by what size company you end up applying at as well as the industry. For example, Kafka is a foundational piece of tech for a high percentage (forget the actual number) of fortune 500 companies. But it's also totally overkill for many smaller companies who may not need near-real-time analytics or near-real-time data processing.I'd say to become very comfortable with SQL (postgres and one data warehousing dialect such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery), Python, and dbt. While some may classify dbt as an \"Analytics Engineer\" tool, I think it's a great bridge between the worlds of data analyst and data engineering. Plus it's very common at companies of many different sizes.Then become comfortable with some form of orchestration tool such as Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, or some equivalent of those. For Airflow, there is a MWAA local runner docker image that might be useful for running a local version of Amazon's managed Airflow instance. Just search \"github MWAA local runner\" to find the repo which should have instructions. This is way easier and cheaper than running a real airflow instance.Maybe just read up on data ingestion tooling such as Airbyte, Fivetran, or Meltano, just to fill in that gap so you understand how transactional data gets loaded into a data warehouse (ELT is a good term to know/research).At that point, I'd say the knowledge you've acquired is transferrable to most tools that small to mid-sized companies would require (or at least desire) for an entry level data engineer position.Good luck!",

Someone saw this post and sent to me so here I am writing my first Reddit reply lolLance does support most of the catalog on the market, check out this page: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/) I guess I did a bad job marketing these features. I did publish a few blogs, but mostly under the context of integration with compute engines, like [https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/](https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/) and [https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/) . For all the supported catalogs, you can basically use Lance side by side with your Iceberg datasets.But I think you raised a great question - \"anyone actually cataloging their lance datasets? or is everyone just yolo-ing it\". I did these integrations because we do have real customers using them. But I do see a common trend that data engineers in enterprise corporations that have data lake, data warehouse or data lakehouse setups, and trying to integrate Lance for AI features tend to want catalog support. For the frontier labs AI engineers, they tend to just prefer having storage-only solution and yolo-ing it.To bridge that gap, I also did one catalog within Lance, the Directory Namespace: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/) . It is basically a catalog living in a directory, backed by a Lance table, so everything still stays purely in storage. It is also compatible with just a plain directory of Lance tables, which is typically how people start using lance format, when they do pip install lancedb and create a table. In general, most of the users I interact with treat embedding as a part of real data assets. You can definitely store multiple versions of embeddings generated by different models for different use cases or just compare their effectiveness and switch over time. That is actually one key use case for Lance, which is you start with a table with just a single column, maybe images or videos. You continue to do data evolution - add embedding columns, caption columns, feature columns over time, and they accumulate and become a very wide table. That becomes your entire multimodal data asset. Check out some case studies with for example Netflix [https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/](https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/), Runway: [https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/)",

There's a creative tension there that needs some judgement to negotiate, and sometimes, there'll be a shift or some contextual thing that changes that means suddenly it's time to tweak your implementation model again. You need some freedom to be able to do that - but it should be constrained - go too far off-piste and nobody will understand what you're up to.Back to the question, if you've got multiple dev streams working in the same area, it pays to have a canonical representation that they can all agree on (whether they're human or machine) to support data-sharing and integration later on - therefore, there has to be some design-first approach to data - at least at some level.If your approach to that is to all agree on some canonical higher-level model, then you can handle implementation-specific choices by always providing a well documented mapping from your system's model back to the canonical one and get the best of both worlds.",

My career since graduating in 2019 has been built on Spark, and I absolutely love it, but it's going to be a bit complex to learn thoroughly unless you're already comfortable with Scala or Python. Snowflake (SF) would probably be much easier to learn as SF is more of a SQL-first paradigm; I'd recommend learning **Iceberg** in parallel to SF.Maybe look into experimenting with real time streaming solutions as well like (Kafka / SQS) + (Spark Streaming / Flink / Golang) to stream table changes (CDC) from an RDBMS (e.g. Postgres) into an Iceberg table that could be queried via Snowflake.Also be sure to know when to use a row-based file format (e.g. Avro) and when to use column-based format (e.g. Parquet).From there you'll have a solid starting point in the SQL + Snowflake + Iceberg world and can branch out to the Spark + Databricks + Delta world if required or curious.",

Goes back to mainframe batch processing. If your metadata drives what runs and when, this fits.\"Pipeline Metadata Store\" is more modern, emphasizes you're tracking pipeline state rather than just \"jobs.\" Works well if you're in a dbt/Airflow world.\"Orchestration Control Tables\" if you want to be explicit that this layer is decoupled from your actual data models.\"Run Manifest\" is borrowed from dbt. Better if your metadata is more about \"what happened\" (observability) vs \"what should happen\" (control).I'd skip anything with \"connector\" unless it's actually handling source system connections. That term is overloaded now, half the modern data stack thinks connector = Fivetran/Airbyte-style ingestion.Quick side note: if you're manually querying these tables at job start to figure out dependencies and last-run timestamps, might be worth checking if your orchestrator exposes that natively through its metadata DB or API. Saves you from maintaining two sources of truth for job state..and a huge future headache.What orchestrator are you on?",

But it's a way to get you practical experience on something end-to-end without being too high stakes.If you really want to practice before you join, build a DAG in Airflow just to understand how it works. Meta uses Data Swarm as an orchestrator which is most similar to Airflow, but they've abstracted so much as to make it trivial to create a new DAG. With Data Swarm you're not even really building a DAG, you're just building the config and the back end logic is doing most of the work for you. They also have a custom visualization software, so play around with the free version of Looker or Tableau. Most onboarding projects are going to be something like \"take this raw data, build a denormalized / aggregate table, build a dashboard on it\"If you can do those things, write good SQL, and write basic Python, you're already ready for the job.",

There is 0 gain from making it a snapshot and eating the storage and eventually processing speed. I wouldn't worry too much about what others think of how and where the data should work in theory. Theory rarely ever applies in the real world, the data and how you get it dictates what you do and in this field most cases, you have 0 control over the source of the data. Which means almost nothing operates like it should and you just have to get the data as accurate as possible, as efficiently as possible space, and processing wise. To me, Bronze always matches source, or at least as close to it as you can possibly get. If it doesn't, you are going to have a horrible time running down why things don't match up. Snapshotting like option A is really only good for if you need to see how things have changed over time, or doing day to day comparisons at the Bronze level and I'd rarely ever want to do that because that's honestly a waste of space and processing. As for Option C, I would avoid anything that makes data right after the fact and there's a point in time where non-dirty read data is inaccurate. That's asking for someone or something to query it when it isn't fixed yet and you running down nonsense for a day.",

You aren't fixing it \"after the fact\" you're just putting things through a stage or layer on its way through to becoming available.An append-only layer lets you run an SCD1 table out of it now, and then fully rebuild with an SCD2 table later if you need it. If you ever need to change the schema to add anything you missed, or change a column conversion rule, or anything else at all, you can easily rebuild off the append table.Call it staging if you want, and the eventual target with the deduped data can be called \"bronze\" -- the names are just names.",

Also if you're worried about AI take over DE job, all the more reason to get out of it? The concerns are contradictory, if you know what I mean. I'm a DE and I don't think AI can take my job in the next 5 years. Nobody is gonna tell AI what the data looks like for security reason and also it's just spouting things based on probability not actual logic so the procesing logic and domain knowledge still need to be done by human. If anything, it might generate more demands to build data warehouse to train AI models, which are separate use case from the existing analytics and financial report use case. The real concern is the market downturn and if the AI bubble bursts, people might stop hiring altogether because they want to cut cost (which has nothing to do with AI as a technology but AI as a balance sheet problem).

Two quick pushes though: I wouldn’t drop line items entirely (you’ll want them for margin/returns/cohort/LTV and subscription analysis), but you can keep them in a separate table/partition and only join when needed; and I’d strongly consider adding a lightweight transform layer (dbt or even scheduled SQL) so your “business tables” (orders, customers, subscriptions, spend) are stable and not raw connector schemas.For costs/lock-in: biggest surprise costs are usually (1) Looker exploring raw wide tables, (2) GA event data blowing up, and (3) Airbyte sync volume if you pull too much too often. oh yeah also get budgets/alerts in GCP day 1, partition/cluster core tables, and create curated views for Looker so analysts aren’t querying raw. Also, if you ever want less lock-in later, keeping transforms in dbt + storing raw exports (GCS) makes migrating much easier than relying on tool-specific modeling.",

Looker does the trick and again most Ecom / digital teams use this so easy sell internally. In terms of ETL I just go for Fivetran if the customer doesn't have an interanl DE team or a savvy analyst. Can get a bit pricey though. Landing the data into Google storage and then transform from there. I find a little bit of Python goes along way in the DIY DE space as well!",

So, you either will have a vendor lock or mixing different entities in one (like Hive Metastore + Hive SQL).Second option looks nice, for example, an OpenLineage standard can be used, but the existence of lineage in catalog will depend on query engine.If I would build a solution on open source technologies, I would prefer a second option. Something like DataHub that supports OpenLineage ingestion via REST API. But I would avoid heavily tighten \"all-in-one\" solutions and would keep lineage as an option.",

The Platform Approach (Unity Catalog) **-** I’ve used Unity Catalog extensively for this. It essentially forces the catalog and lineage to live together. Because the governance (permissions, access controls) creates the lineage automatically as jobs run, you don't have to \"maintain\" the lineage separately. The catalog is the map of the lineage. If you treat them as separate tools, you end up doing double the work to keep them in sync.2. The Open Source Route (OpenMetadata) **-** If you are looking outside of a specific vendor ecosystem, tools like OpenMetadata are tackling this exact \"all-in-one\" problem. They treat data assets, lineage, and quality checks as a single entity. It proves that the market prefers a unified view. Data engineers don't want to tab switch between a catalog to find a table and a lineage tool to see where it came from.3. The Shift to Orchestrators (Dagster) - The most interesting shift right now is actually happening in the orchestration layer. I’ve been using Dagster, and they handle this through “software-defined Assets.\" Instead of lineage being an afterthought or a documentation task, the lineage is defined by the code itself.* Assets **-** You define the data asset, and the lineage is inherent.* Asset Checks **-** You attach quality checks directly to those assets in the graph.So, to answer your question, Yes, a combined solution is useful. In fact, things are moving even further, merging Catalog + Lineage + Execution (Orchestration) into one view so that \"accountability\" isn't just a log you look at later, but part of the pipeline run itself.Hope this helps.",

When you have 100K+ datasets, this breaks governance completely. **Why integration matters more than people realize:** • **Metadata propagation** \\- tag one source table as PII, lineage cascades it downstream to 50 derived tables automatically. Manual tagging doesn't scale.  • **Impact analysis** \\- \"this pipeline failed, who owns the upstream data?\" If you're jumping between tools, you've already lost.  • **Trust flows backwards** \\- you can't assess data quality without tracing upstream. Separate systems = manual stitching every time. Most of the modern catalogs are moving to a model of \\- out-of-the-box connectors that \"pull\" lineage into the system from external systems \\- support reporting of lineage INTO the system via standard catalog-native API-s/agents/emitters or vendor-neutral protocols like OpenLineage **The caveat the other responses touched on:** some solutions like Dagster's \"software-defined assets\" are elegant but only work for what the orchestrator controls. Your data doesn't start in the warehouse: • Production systems feeding Kafka streams  • Real-time stream processing (Flink, Spark Streaming)  • Cross-cloud data movement that never touches your orchestrator  At my previous company, \\~40% of critical lineage came from **outside** the orchestration layer. You need a catalog that can **aggregate lineage from multiple systems** (streaming, production databases, warehouses), not just generate it from one orchestrator. **The test:** can you trace a BI dashboard → warehouse → dbt → Kafka → production database in one query? That's 5-6 systems owned by different teams. The catalog is your aggregation point. Best of luck with convincing your customers and the world!",

Job market right now is pretty harsh, will not make sense to leave a good paying job. Take full advantage of FAANG stocks, benefits and their free online courses taught by FAANG on coursera. Check with HR to see if transition is possible as an internal employee into tech, what would be the process. Find out data engineers internally on outlook, teams, slack and setup 1-on-1 with them, ask all kinds of questions about the skills needed, about their career path, etc. 5) The most fundamental skill required for any data role is SQL, there's no shortcut to that and one cannot survive without knowing SQL at good level. From here skills will pivot based on the role. Ex: Data Engineers require strong data modeling, distributed systems (ex: Databricks, snowflake) storage and compute skills. Tools don't matter at all, focus on the core, basics, foundations as everything else is build on those.Data Scientist: Strong Applied Math or Applied Stats skills, domain knowledge helps a lot.  Feel free to dm me if you want to talk more.",

        "body": "You want to have a landing area for the data that is your single source of truth. This would be a Datalake if you cloud storage it. DLs have cool uses, like Events. Snowpipes can be triggered when a new file appears. Airflow deposits the file in the DL.Then a staging area (schema) that links to the landing area and allows hashing to eliminate dupes. No transformations here. All columns varchar. A reject schema for data that cannot fit into bronze due to an error. Then Medallion architecture for schemas bronze, silver, gold. Bronze (column transformations to correct types) from the staging. Any data rows that do not conform go to reject schema. Also Bronze is a great place for SCD2 tables. Silver is new & inferred data that is valid but doesn’t exist in bronze. Like splitting customers by geographical zones based on their address. It can make sense for some silver tables to be SCD2, but that’s rare. For geolocation you go get another single source of truth, stage it and bronze it. Then the silver combines two different bronze tables. The silver geolocation could be scd2 for tracking the moves that PK did. And so on. To meet all Gold requirements, for dimensions and facts. Gold is dimensional tables that Kimball and Snowflake are famous for. DIM and FACT. Using Airflow for pushing the data in the Medallion layers is standard practice. To go from BigQuery directly to Snowflake FACT, this is called a Proof Of Concept. Nothing wrong with that. Suggestion, put it in a Dev environment and build a Prod environment. Dev & Prod (maybe UAT eventually) can simply be different database names, same Snowflake account, same Datalake account. You do NOT want the PowerBI people doing their own “fill in the blanks“ that’s how you get data silos. They Will Do This !!!For example (true life example) the PowerBI people will go get their own geolocation data from god knows where and make mistakes, so that Sales Dept will have X$ in one zone and Finance Dept will have Y$ in the same zone for the same time period, as each Dept will have a different PowerBI person. Data must be centralized. For SSoT to work, and in every data row identity the source system for each PK. Maybe as part of your naming convention for the column. Don’t be afraid of typing long column names. Use acronyms when it makes sense. If you haven’t already, take an online course on Medallion and Kimball architecture.",

(“EU data must stay in EU”, “India must stay in India”, etc.). “Each country in its own region” is usually not the real rule, it’s the vibe.If data residency is actually required, then yeah: you can’t do Firebase → Bq → Snowflake US for everyone and call it compliant. The sane pattern is raw + PII stays in-region, and only aggregated/anonymous data can move cross-region (if allowed). Practically that means separate regional stacks (EU BigQuery dataset + EU Snowflake / or whatever) and your Airflow just orchestrates per-region configs. Start with 2 regions (EU + US), keep schemas identical, and create a “global” layer that’s aggregates only. Biggest footgun is mixing PII across borders and hoping to “fix later”, get the rule written down first, then architect.",

If that’s the case, I’m increasingly recommending to materialise results NOT on the warehouse, but on an iceberg table, possibly with a REST catalog that allow for git-like management and branching (e.g. Nessie). This way, you remove versioning issues from the map (just use iceberg and catalog’s versioning features and best practices)For table data access, you can use the iceberg table as external table in your data warehouse (ok if you have infrequent access or if it’s ok to have a bit of latency) or load the latest version of data in bulk (replacing the existing table) on a single work table on the warehouse if you need high availability or low latency for reads through the warehouse That said, there are 100s of variants and approaches :) if you have some specific needs just drop some more info on your need and stack, I think a lot of people may be able to help",

I assume *you* guys care what version is in the wild, same as any need for source control. Depends what you're using, I guess. As u/chronic4you said, if you're using Delta Lake then versioning and metadata is part of it. I can't comment on Iceberg, we don't use it. We do use Delta Lake, and in my case, we wouldn't have differently-named versions knocking around in terms of production. They just get replaced. But we don't run parallel releases and stuff like that. For capturing version metadata in Delta Lake, you could use custom commit messages when altering/replacing tables. This is kind of something I've been thinking about a bit, too. The potential for drift between the DDL code that *is* source controlled and the object in the catalog that the DDL defines concerns me. I don't really have a solution.If you're using simple SQL tables for example, good luck to you. Times past I've had various permutations of \"x\\_dev\", \"x\\_revision\", \"x\\_update\", and even \"x\\_new\" sitting in the database alongside the proper table. Good times.",

There is some overlap but not enough especially in today's competitive environment (you'll be up against some experienced and capable engineers who match the description much closer than a DE can). What I'm trying to say is that even though you'll find a ton of \"software engineer\" job postings, there is no such thing as a company hiring for a \"general SWE\" (it's always one of the subsets and most likely backend).The exception are companies who post for software engineers and make it clear in the job title or description that the focus is data. I've found things like \"Software Engineer - Data Warehousing\" or \"Software Engineer - Data\". I think those are fair game for DE's, but beware, they are significantly more technical than the generic \"Data Engineer\" roles and the interview process is much more difficult.with all that being said, anything is possible.",

So I am not sure how this applies in your country.Make sure that in the interview you stay authentic. The coach said.Remember you sell work time. Your personality is the bonus.And before the job interview say to yourself that you can do it that you want to do this job.Sometimes it is not about you, why you did not get the job. You can only review the interview in your mind and think if you are unsatisfied with some answers.If you think you nailed it in the interview, then I would say you had bad luck.Hth",

        "body": "I think the limit is mostly hardware and cost, so as long as the cluster/warehouse can handle the IO and compute, 100 TB by itself isn’t a blocker.But the more interesting question is why you’d need liquid clustering on a 100 TB table in the first place.At that size, it often looks like a raw or near-raw table, and raw tables usually have predictable access patterns (time-range filters, append-only writes). In those cases, directory-level partitioning on a timestamp is usually sufficient and cheaper, because partition pruning is extremely effective and requires no ongoing reorganization.Liquid clustering starts to make sense at this scale when:* Queries frequently filter on high-cardinality keys (e.g. account\\_id) in addition to time.* The table isn’t strictly append-only (MERGE/UPSERT, late data, corrections).* Access patterns evolve and you don’t want to constantly redesign partitions.* You want to avoid over-partitioning while still getting good file-level pruning.So the question isn’t “can liquid clustering handle 100 TB?”, but rather whether the workload actually needs it. For a truly raw, time-sliced dataset, partitions alone are usually the right tool. Liquid clustering is more justified when the table behaves less like raw ingestion and more like a shared, multi-consumer analytical dataset where time alone isn’t selective enough.",

Are they fine at that point that the roll-up for ID=1 will change to the v6 value?\" -->** We have two sets of these gold fact tables. One set will always be updated, so it will always get the v=6 record when it comes. The fact table I was writing about in the post will remain at v=5. Business reason comes from our Financial Controller. When the data comes in, we expect that after X days after a reporting period, if there are no upstream data changes, we consider it official. There is an audit requirement to keep a permanent record of this official data for that time period because this is the data that was reported. There is a main gold fact table that will always be up to date and that's used for other purposes, but will always be accurate.We are implementing 'write controls' on the gold layer partition to limit this, but it won't be perfect. We're also going to store the snapshot of this data that can never be written to outside of the gold layer.**\"I'd be more concerned that the record can be updated and they don't want you to propogate the data up through the layers.\" -->** Generally, yes. But we have a pretty unique requirement here. We are fully propagating to gold but also maintaining a separate snapshot that will keep that snapshot in time for reporting purposes. (They need to report on what was reported at the time as one requirement even if what was reported used an older version of the same record).,",

Research. Find the tools that can help you fulfill your project goals.3. Set up a dev environment. This can be suprisingly difficult, both because there are many obscure setup challenges that can arise, and because it's kind of boring and frustrating to troubleshoot the part that doesn't give you any immediate results.4. Try basic examples. Use things you research, see if you can reapply them, get an understanding of how new things work.5. Apply them to your problem. In a bigger project, and if you have more experience, you will want to keep in mind maintainability to make changes to this easier. But it's still valuable to just take a crack at it. Maybe it works, maybe you'll run into a dead end and have to start over, this tiem with a better understanding of how to make things work better and be more maintainable.6. Revise until you're done.That's my cycle for my personal projects, at least. Make sure to leave comments and notes on code and dev environment so you can come back to it later.Maybe I'm not a good person to ask though because I rarely finish these projects :PFeels like a race against free time and focus.",

I'm sure they still collected their crippling tuition, though, didn't they? That's not your fault. You're not in charge of the school. I'm an Engineering Manager and a self-taught coder, and it grinds my gears every single time I interview a new CS grad and find they can't code. I don't even know how many times I've seen it. 2. Your idea for learning to understand code completely is misguided. Your goal should be to build and deploy a working project. Something super simple. Do it in the next three days. Then immediately go to work on a slightly more complicated project, which you should also deploy within a few days. Then add a database and deploy that within a few days. Etc. Your big problem isn't that you don't understand everything about code, it's that you can't code on your own. There is a huge difference there. It isn't even the same topic. Keep learning but consider all lessons to be an expense you have to pay to build a project. All projects should be as inexpensive as possible. Learn the bare minimum to get building again. When you've built and deployed at least two non-trivial full-stack projects and you feel comfortable with a programming language, a full-stack framework, a database language, a testing framework, and a deployment strategy, then you can start researching better design patterns. Then build another project. I'm sorry to hear that your school let you down so completely. If there is a bright side, it is that all of us become self-taught eventually. Good luck with your studies.",

        "body": "I'm going to go out on a limb and argue this: It's not programming, it's the way school taught you how you should learn. School education is built on spiral patterns and a tonne of scaffolding. Both of these together make the natural position of learners so that it is clear what they should do to solve a given problem, so if they don't know what to do the assumption is that it is your fault. When in reality, learning is complicated, messy, and difficult. I'll give you an example. In maths, let's say that we are learning how to move variables around an equation. We provide the proof, completed worked examples, worked examples that are partially solved with hints, partially solved worked examples without hints, simple problems that are basically worked examples without hints, and some problems that can be breadcrumbed through multiple worked examples above. The end result is that you probably can go from start to bottom without encountering any trouble. Teachers might make questions that are tricky, compound, or both, but you've probably encountered *everything* before. The problem is that you've never learned how to synthesise something new (to you), and that's what you are trying to do here. I'll give you an example. You might have learned how to make an object. You might have even learned how to assign a variable to an object. But when you have to make your own simple data structure that stores a bunch of data like an array, but can dynamically add and remove stuff without empty spaces or resizing arrays ... well, all of the steps to smash your face into designing or inventing a linked list are really, fuffing, hard.So, what happens is that learners sit there and go: \"Man, I feel that fancy maths is easier than this because I always know what I'm doing,\" because they've hit a problem that could have a dozen or more possible solutions. Instead of simply accepting that they don't know and starting problem-solving, they just feel bad.I'm also going to extend a programmer's olive branch: I've been programming for twenty years. I'm not bad at it. I've built all sorts of complicated systems in multiple languages. Yet, every single day I'll be coding something, and I'll mutter to myself \"holy fuff I'm stupid\" because I couldn't solve some problem. I also couldn't tell you how long I have smashed my face into problems trying to understand how to build it, only to discover that once I learned the underlying systems, it was actually pretty simple (after I did a lot of work to learn new stuff). This is natural. In fact, I often wonder if you don't feel like this regularly, you probably aren't programming. edit: Lastly, I've been learning how to write novels. Not really to do anything with, but just to tell stories. I'm constantly frustrated at how hard it is to express what is in my brain in words. It has been a year, and I've learned heaps, but I'm still not good at it. Sometimes I forget that just because I am good at programming, networking, writing formal documentation, and teaching, it doesn't mean I will, or even should, automatically be good at other things like creative writing. So, be kind to yourself.",

This can be programming it to send automated texts to your parents when it realises that you won't be home by 9pm, it can be a reminder to drink water every 3 hours and so on.As a human you write computer programs to make it help you in random small tasks, eventually you automate and get used to writing all of these programs that you move on to other bigger tasks in your lives. You one day realise 'wait a minute i would like a simple website about my new bakery that im opening up' so you do just that. You make multiple games and you realise that manually writing physics is a pain for each game so you decide one common code that handles this physics for you and call it the 'game engine', the name is all fancy but at the end of the day its just a bunch of code doing physics.You find it difficult at the moment because you're not starting bottom up, you don't start with a basic necessity in your life that needs to be solved and work from there. You start with knowing zero programming as you mention in your second and blindly just copy paste tutorials which are more complex and use stuff that you do not have the prerequisites for. You think you got far because you copy pasted the tutorials but the truth is you have to accept that you know very little about programming and start writing simpler programs until you get the basics right.Codeforces / Leetcode / <insert similar sites) is meant for two kinds of people - Folks who just enjoy puzzle coding and folks who are into competitive programming / want to pass interviews at companies where leetcode is askedI don't think you are at the stage where you enjoy programming so much that you should be getting into the hobby of puzzle coding? The problems there are deliberately difficult on purpose because its meant to be competitive and you need to go in having practiced a huge bunch of algorithmic ideas and topics. Its like you wanting to take a leisurely walk to get fit but accidentally ending up signing up for the local extreme parkour club. Both achieve the same thing but are meant for different kinds of people with different kinds of mindset",

Another thing that might help is Python with its very easy to understand object model.OOP requires a different way of thinking - kind of a rewiring of the brain to look at things differently. In OOP it's more a dialog between the individual objects than the sequential command patterns we are used to in procedural programming. In OOP you more or less \"talk\" to the objects. You ask them to do things for you. You ask them to change their internal state if needed (yes, the \"immutability\" topic will now come up and I might anger a few people with my mutable approach).My breakthrough with OOP was when I got into my current job in Industrial Automation working with our DCS (Distributed Control System) and with our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems. There, everything was object oriented with inheritance and I started to see the advantages and how OOP works. Our SCADA even goes further in the direction of being an Entity-Component system where each Entity can have many components with many different aspects, but that leads too far (it's basically just some very extended form of composition, not inheritance).> it often takes me hours what my developer colleagues can do in minutes.This only boils down to practice, ample practice.You will feel stuck and dumbfounded for quite some time but you will eventually reach the point where things fall into place and you all of a sudden understand.

It's a natural instinct if you spend most of your time close to the machine itself, but it's actually disruptive to learning HLLs.HLLs are designed to be somewhat implementation-agnostic; they have rules, and they trust that some intermediary layer will implement a thing that makes those rules go. Getting bogged down in how that intermediary layer might work (\\*) generally will impede your understanding of the higher-level layer. This is a skill I had to learn when learning SML/NJ: the fine art of no longer worrying about how the language represents a function, trusting \"It just does,\" and learning the language independent of its implementation. The language is just rules and math; you could implement it with pencil and paper if you had the time and patience. Once you have the language under your belt, you can start caring about how it was implemented on a Von Neumann architecture with registers, RAM, and the like.(\\*) C++ might be an exception that proves this rule; there are actually quite a few features of C++ where the reason they work that way is \"It made it a lot easier to write the compiler\" or \"Look, this language is old, and older computers didn't have enough RAM to do things like lookahead compilation or multiple passes, so it is what it is.\"",

        "body": "So, I wrote [a few chapters on OOP in a free book](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/). I tried to think of the ways we incorrectly teach OOP (because that's the way we learned OOP.)I think the summary I can provide is:* A class is like a blank paper form template. You go to the doctor's office and fill out strings for your name, phone number, a list of allergies, etc. This form is a *class*; everyone fills out the same fields (i.e. the member variables) to represent a real-world thing. Each filled-out form is an *object*, a specific concrete thing.* I hate the isolated \"Car\" and \"Shape\" and \"Animal\" classes you always see in tutorials. What a \"Car\" class looks like in real code depends on what software you are making: a used car ecommerce site, a traffic simulator, a racing video game, etc. Meanwhile, the same real world person would be described by different classes: `Customer`, `Patient`, `Employee`, `WeddingGuest`, etc. Ask yourself how a paper form would describe the person in each of these roles and what fields it would need.* A common mistake is to write classes a certain way because we heard that they \"should\" be written that way. If you feel like classes and extensive hierarchies of classes are causing more bureaucracy than organization in your code, go without classes. (If you can; a complete rewrite has its own problems.)* For a second, forget about OOP: imagine you have **a bunch of functions and they all have the same data structure passed to them as an argument**: that's your class. That tells you what the member variables and methods should be. I have an example Python tic-tac-toe program done [with and without OOP in the book.](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/chapter15.html)* Inheritance is overrated.* For a moment, stop thinking of inheritance with genetic or grandparent-passing-away metaphors. Imagine you need a new class that is very similar to an existing one, but you just one to change one or two methods, so you copy-paste the code entirely and just change those methods. This is what inheritance does, but instead of copying-pasting code, you leave that out and make a subclass and then only specify the methods you change.Anyway, in general we explain OOP badly, and it is a bit (but not entirely) overrated. Don't feel bad for finding it confusing.",

The most close synonims for an *object* is: record, structure, set of variables, and now comes the difference: with the *methods* (functions, subroutines, procedures) operating on it.If you ever worked with files on Unix-like systems or Windows, you've already familiar with OOP. You create a File \"object\" by *open()* or *creat()*, which you can refer with the *file handle*, which these function returned. The variables of File is hidden for you, we have some idea how it looks, but we don't care as far we can call *read()*, *write()* methods to do what we want with the file, then we can *drop* or *destruct* it by calling *close()*.In OOP, instead of file handle, you got a pointer (sometimes called reference), and you can \"call\" methods. Now comes the part where you'll understand the whole shit:`read(file_object, &buffer, length)`is same as`file_object.read(&buffer, lenght)`In Python, you can call a method both way, although, highly recommended to use `obj.method()` variant.And again, as elctronics, programming is not *difficult*, but *simple and* *complex*. OOP is just as *difficult* like pull-up resistor: if you know struct, function, memory, OOP is easy-peasy, and if you know current, instable state, DCC and GND, pull-up resistor is straighfoward... but try these two simple things to explain someone who knows nothing about programming and electronics.",

I'll often just pull up someone else's code and reference basic things like syntax, commonly-used libraries, etc. but there is no teacher like trial and error, especially since you get very quick feedback on what you did right or wrong.**Edit**: To give an example, I recently had to learn a new language for work. The first thing I did was get assigned as an extra code reviewer for an MR that was written by a developer experienced in the language. I did my review first, and I had to spend time reading through his code, cross-referencing documentation for the libraries being used, and generally just building my understanding of the code. When the other code reviewers and testers also did their passes, I read their issues to see what I had missed. (Which is a good habit that I do for everything I review, not just this).After that, I did an MR of my own and had it reviewed by the person who had done the previous MR. There was still a ton of referencing documentation but I had a fairly good idea of what I needed to do.It gets substantially easier the more experience you have under your belt. I've coded in more than a dozen languages, so at this point picking up a new one is pretty simple as I already know how to \"think like a programmer\" which is the core skill that we need.",

Tutorials feel productive, but there’s nothing forcing your brain to retrieve or apply anything, so it fades fast.What usually works better is picking a very small goal and letting that goal pull the language in. Something concrete like parsing a file, building a tiny game, automating a task you already do, or reimplementing a simple tool you use. Then you learn just enough syntax to make the next thing work, look things up constantly, and accept that forgetting is part of the process. That cycle is what actually builds memory.Docs and references are great once you’re actively coding, because you approach them with a question instead of passively watching. If boredom is the problem, reduce scope, increase feedback, and write code every day even if it’s messy. Speed comes from doing, not from finding the perfect resource.",

Traditionally this training teaches auto mechanics, HVAC installers, even electronics technicians, but many training centers provide computer programming. My son actually took two years of programming in high school before going to college. As far as continuing education in programming, there are a couple avenues. First you can attend a community college for two years to get an associates degree in computer programming. That's not as expensive as a bachelors degree in Computer Science but it gets you half way there. Most universities will accept an associates degree as the first two years of a computer science curriculum. The advanced math comes into play if you want to get a bachelors in Computer Science. Most degree programs are either in an engineering school or a business school. Some colleges make you choose an area of concentration (mine was physics) Business curriculums do not usually require calculus while science and engineering tracks require calculus, differential equations and linear algebra. A Bachelors in computer science will serve you well and keep you employed, but an associates in computer programming will also help you get work. Don't listen to nay-sayers who predict programmers will be replaced by AI. AI makes programmers more efficient, that's all.",

The only things you really need to know are how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and maybe a little basic algebra. Many programmers go through their entire career with having to do barely any math at all.> Do note, however, that the answer is a bit different if you are interested in getting a degree in Computer Science. Many universities or colleges will have specific prerequisites you need to fulfill before you can either enter the major or graduate (calculus classes, etc). And, since Computer Science is, to a certain degree, applied mathematics, you will almost certainly end up learning about discrete math, writing proofs and other similar topics while earning your degree. You do not need to be inherently good at math in order to learn these topics (or any mathematical topic, really), but having some mathematical maturity certainly wouldn't hurt, and would probably smooth the learning process.",

It’s deeply integrated into engines, has way more learning resources for games specifically, faster iteration, and teaches fundamentals you’ll reuse everywhere. Yes, you’ll shoot yourself in the foot sometimes, but that’s part of understanding how things actually work under the hood.Rust is great, but the borrow checker adds cognitive load that’s not directly helping you learn game logic early on. It shines once you already understand memory and systems programming. For a beginner building terrain gen, gameplay systems, engine-level stuff, C++ will feel more straightforward and less “fighting the language.”Short version: start with C++ for game dev fundamentals, then Rust later if you want safety and modern design. You’re not wrong about either, but C++ is the smoother on-ramp for what you want right now",

It's syntax is newer, and the language itself is much newer, which introduces a plenty of benefits. Firstly, it doesn't have the burden of having as much layers of backwards compatibility - C++ is filled with legacy code, and deprecated methods. Rust, on the other hand, is much fresher in that sense.Okay, I realized I am probably going on a tangent, so here's the list of the stuff I love about Rust over C++:* Beautiful error messages* Immutability by default.* Less verbose syntax (try to read the c++ std library, you'll get what I mean)* **THE ABSOLUTE BEST** tooling - `cargo` is really just a life saver. Don't even get me started on installing dependencies.One notable flaw I can point out is the borrow checker, since it can be confusing and you have to sacrifice some convenience in order to keep the code safe (but at least Rust doesn't allow unsafe behavior unless you explicitly want it)",

I dont want to discourage the idea, but you should be advised that the comparative lack of tooling and ecosystem might overshadow the other benefits of Rustby contrast C++ is native to the unreal engine and already integrates beautifully with its visual scripting language, unreal blueprints. C++ is also probably better for programming things that are very heavy on math and data structures and algorithms. it's basically the gold standard for high performance programming at scale, and has all the tooling and integration you'd want to write game code at any level of abstraction",

Many tutorials make it really easy to work within a certain paradigm, but the paradigm falls apart as soon as you apply it to a real world example with real world requirements.> Is it just based on the number of years you work on building software or simply the environment where you can get feedback from top tier engineers?I've been mostly working on my own, even as a Junior and never had a Senior who would teach me good programming practices. For me it's been mostly about reflecting about my work, about **why** things become difficult and how I could avoid these traps. I started to watch many different talks from software conferences on youtube and while many of those talks are about fixing symptoms of problems instead of identifying problems, there are some that help you understand why you end up having certain problems. So you need both, a number of years of experience to reflect on, and actually reflect on the experience. Also, in any case: do not listen to people saying things like \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\". They likely have no idea what they are talking about and they don't know what that quote actually refers to. Usually these people think that they lose about 5-15% performance when they follow their programming paradigm and think that's an acceptable price, but they actually lose at least factor 30, in many cases even factor 1000 performance (Yes, things taking 2 seconds when they could be done in 0.002 seconds).A good way of structuring your code will also give you good performance as a free benefit.",

You are ultimately still solving the issue with your own brain. I would try to leave AI for when you are stuck. Once you’re pretty good, AI doesn’t even make you much faster. Like 5 to 10%.

Part 1 would be a preparation for the exam done at home with whatever tools they want (ai, colleague,...) and they could take any code they would have done to part 2 (which was the actual part cut from Internet).The first part had exercises centered around getting every child from a node in a tree (and going deeper till getting the last).The first exercice from the second part was going up the tree till the first node was found and then, the exam was basically going down the tree either from top or from a specific node with the eventual join here and there on another table.All that to say : if you understood your code from the first part, second part should have been no problem at all. going up a tree being so close to going down but a lot less complicated to implement - It's a sole loop. And once done with going down and up, every other exercise could be done with some copy past from your own codeWhen the result was in, most of the student had the first part nailed in tight. But some would have no idea at all about what was what (one exercice asked to check the depth of the tree and one of the student thought that just taking the node.parentId was the answer. Not to throw shade at the guy (I'm pretty sure he's one of the smarter) but he clearly didn't understand the first part that was, most likely, generated (or copy pasted from a student. But since I checked every file before allowing them to bring them to part 2, I have some idea.)In essence, ai didn't write bad code. That's not the point.The point is, they used it in a way that didn't make them grow their understanding of what they were doing.That's the part I'm really critical when in comes to ai use in learning... But in general too. No matter if you're a junior or a senior. If you don't learn, you, at best, stay at your level.",

If you're not doing something unique then here's your problem on why AI is so useful to you. AI can literally identify problems in the world. Just look at the school system, it's trash & thats why AI is so useful there, because exams are the dumbest thing in the world. There's so much other useful use cases for AI, but coding is not the one, at least for me. It just struggles when you're an engineer in a very specific project or area, like embedded programming.If you aren't the one solving specific problems & showing and discussing them with your client and sharedholders & reiterating, you're probably doing something that shouldn't be in your role.There's also so much other examples on this, but I don't have time",

These more easily let me test arbitrary sections of code by simply generating the appropriate structure for the test to consume, so my testing functions are just wrapping regular calls with a generated struct and comparing results.Take a few minutes to ask yourself \"how could I verify this works without having to run the whole program or use a test environment?\", it'll likely lead to developing better code.

Methodical, structured, analytical thinking and problem solving skills.

Learning to code is a \\*\\*journey\\*\\*. But thankfully, there are loads of resources out there that can help you choose your path! So, it's okay if you're not totally committed to building a career, my advice would be to measure the amount of resource you devote until you know that.You can teach yourself to code without access to any paid content or courses. It's a long road, it takes a lot of dedication and frustration, and drive to go find the answers yourself. But I'm not sure there's ever been a skill so thoroughly documented online as software development. Software developers largely love to share what they've built, and the very fine details of how it works. Youtube is full of tutorials. There are plenty of websites that will explain different programming languages or tools to you. Github is a massive source of real code that drives real projects which you can read and download and involve yourself in the discussions of. If you're looking into a career, I recommend finding a university within your state with an accredited computer science program. The degree matters a lot when it comes to job prospects unfortunately. I also think it's a medium quick way to actually develop serious development skills. I know for me personally, I was on the self-taught path for many years and just very stuck. It was my degree program with the help of professors and peers that finally unlocked things for me and got me over the tough parts of learning development. You'll find no shortage of universities that offer remote degree programs in computer science as well. This is an expensive path, but its the most reliable path to a career.If you're not sure what you want yet, and you're just out to explore maybe try joining some community projects. Hackathons, game jams, competitions. Even if you don't feel like you're ready, just be honest about your level and express that you're there to learn and you're bound to find loads of people just like you who would be glad to learn along-side you. That's a great way to 'explore' and get a sense of what actual development is like even before you have the skills yourself. Even if it means you're joining a discord call just to watch and hear how more experienced developers are working it'll give you a sense of what its actually like once you're in the middle of things.I won't recommend any particular course or source of information personally. I've found that everyone seems to click with different materials.

My first job was taking design drawings for specific tools and using a touch pad and the drawing overlaying the touch pad to enter coordinates. When complete compile those coordinates into HPGL language and feed that into an HP CNC machine. I wrote that in HP PASCAL in 1981. I had known the manager of the tool department through the church I went to and he had seen my work on the CPM machine that was donated to our church. I was doing work on the CPM machine for free because I wanted to create computer games on it and I had to promise to do something productive on it while I played games. I wrote a rolodex type program for church memberships in basic. Over the years I've worked with almost every programming language known to man. What made learning a different programming language easier was learning a different spoken language to train your brain to think in that spoken language. I speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, German enough to order in a restaurant, and some basic Mandarin. This helps train your brain to easily switch between different programming languages as well. To ease your mind, when I sleep at night, I now dream in C#.",

The course is free, textual, extremely practice oriented with actually checked exercises, and a proper first semester of \"Introduction to Computer Science\").The key to learning programming is to practice as early as possible and as much as possible. Play around with the code, break it, fix it. Learn to read the error messages. Learn to work with the documentation for your language. These are all key points.Stay away from AI for the start. At the very utmost (and even that should be the ultima ratio) use it to give you explanations. Never use it to give you solutions nor code. AI is tempting. Still, it is far superior to pretend it doesn't even exist.Don't be afraid of making mistakes. We all do (even with decades of experience). Mistakes and failures are what teach us, from what we actually *learn*. You need to struggle to learn (and that's why I said to avoid AI - it will take the struggle away).",

Maybe you were nervous and didn’t think about it at the moment, in which case experience and practice make the difference. In Python for example you have people that naturally sugar things up/use decorators and it seems unintuitive (especially coming into an ongoing project) until you’re forced into edge cases/collaboration and start doing it regularly. Senior level code is a YMMV kind of thing imo, as you will work with people that understand everything but document nothing.",

You just start to get a feel for what good patterns are as well as what goes wrong when bad patterns are followed.But as for more concrete tips I'd say you want to keep your API /API layer as agnostic as possible from the implementation details - your API layer should ideally be focused on defining the contract and routing the logic to internal code to fulfill the contract. You don't want to expose internal details, raw primative implementations, or anything not relevant to the contract. This is both so external clients have a clean interface to work with as well as minimizing the blast radius of any changes to the workings of the API itself. Yeah you can implement a key value store with a dictionary but if you abstract it behind a data provider then your API layer doesn't care if you're using a dictionary or a database or a cache, and you can swap between them easily.In addition anything that's exposed to the public internet should have protection against anything that could possibly go wrong, malicious or otherwise. This includes sanitizing inputs, protection against injection attacks, rate limiting, proper status code handling etc...",

There's no fast path.Dunning-Kruger's seminal work principally has to do with how we internalize and comprehend information: known | unknown known | known ----------------- known | unknown unknown | unknownIt's not their original chart but it has all the right quadrants... Mine makes a C.You start in the bottom-right where you don't even know THAT you don't know something. There's shit rocket scientists contemplate I haven't the slightest fucking clue. I'm not a rocket scientist. I can't possibly know. Can't even fathom.Then there's shit you know you don't know. I don't know how to implement a Monte-Carlo simulation. I know I don't know that. I know Monte-Carlo is used to march approximations toward a correct result with sufficient precision. I've just never had to do it.Then there's what you know you know - this is active recall stuff. Rote memory. I know a closure is a poor mans object. I can repeat that all day. It's not very functional memory because I have to actively think about it with intent. I can write a closure, but it's not intuitive to me. I make mistakes. I can't see the forest for the trees.But I have a shitload of unknown knowns - shit I know, but don't actively think about. We're beyond active recall. This isn't rote - this is intuition. You can FORGET you know something, and yet that knowledge passively informs you. When you see me work, I can go straight to code and produce something. Hundreds, THOUSANDS of decisions are being made not because I'm considering all this stuff in the moment, but because I've considered it all over the last 37 years. I'm not making a decision, I've already made it. I'm acting on connections and associations and relationships you haven't made yet, leaving you wondering how the hell I'm getting my work done - it's because the work was done 20 years ago at that one job.This is what you're going to accumulate yourself. When you've fully internalized and integrated your knowledge, you can speak on it as an authority. You won't be quoting a book or resource, you'll be saying it yourself, and you'll hardly think about how you're even doing it.So then how do you learn? It's not just time. You can sit on your ass for years and not learn a god damn thing - especially if you don't have compelling work or don't care. It's not JUST experience - but the quality of the experience. You don't learn from successes, but failures. And if you want some failures, you need to be trying to do shit.> I realized afterward that I hadn't considered concurrent access, didn't validate inputs, returned mixed types from methods, and used raw dictionaries instead of proper data structures. You're already gaining self-awareness, seeing more than trees, but the forest for what it is. To accelerate your experiences - you need to have more of them; finish that project. Validate inputs - that's easy as shit. Use data structures, that makes it easier to validate your inputs. Add concurrency, this will apply pressure upon you to design a more consistent architecture.You didn't do these things in your demo because you don't have the intuition to do them. If you had it, you'd have integrated all this into your solution as a matter of course.Continued...",

You usually need just enough understanding to make progress, then you circle back and deepen fundamentals once you hit friction. Trying to master an entire stack up front often turns into endless prep with very little feedback.Surface level knowledge is fine as long as you are aware it is surface level and you know where the edges are. The risk is not shallow knowledge, it is hidden gaps that you do not realize are there. Projects are good at exposing those gaps naturally.Exploring multiple stacks can help you see which concepts are universal and which are just implementation details. Over time the fundamentals stick because you keep encountering them in different contexts. That usually beats trying to learn everything in isolation before you build anything real.",

You can’t learn “the whole thing” at all. You can only learn the parts you need. There’s many things I’ve used over 20 years and I still don’t know even nearly “the whole thing” because I’ve never needed all the things there is. As long as you know all the things you will need, and have understanding how they fit together then you can go piece by piece and learn those parts. It’s much easier and sticks much better when it’s “ok I need to do X so I’ll look that up and learn it and do it” rather than “oh yeah I looked it up a week ago, but now that I need it I don’t remember it anymore…”Also one tip: write down some things you feel are useful or important to remember from the start. Like “ok when I use this way to connect to database I need to set that up” and whatnot. It’ll be handy later when you jump between things and definitely will forget things.",

I worked in C and C++ professionally until 2013, when I switched to Java with a spring in my step and a song in my heart. So when I say I disagree with Mr Spolsky, it’s not because I’m defensive about not knowing C or pointers.I guess if you want to contribute to the Linux kernel, it’s got to be C and you need to understand pointers like you understand your native language. Ditto drivers. But 99.9% of programmers aren’t getting that deep in the weeds with things. Even in 2005, they weren’t. People can’t come out of undergrad knowing everything. You’ve got to pick what’s important to get started.Also C is hard in a lot of stupid, picky ways that have nothing to do with intelligence. Mostly it’s not portable the way a lot of modern languages are. Programs that compile and run fine in one environment won’t in another because the libraries are in a different directory, or you’re using different compilers, or different versions of the compiler, or different levels of optimization (it shouldn’t matter, but I’ve seen cases where it does.) Or all kinds of stupid crap. This was already a serious obstacle to collaboration and knowledge-sharing in 2005. It’s gotten way worse as more knowledge is shared online. It’s why Java was such a hit—the intermediate bytecode step meant that it works the same everywhere. (I mean, you *can* find incompatibilities between the Oracle JDK and IBM Semaru or whatever, but you have to be doing something really obscure.) And the creator of Stack Overflow should know that better than anyone!",

This time around getting back into programming I have a music library and none of the import tools did all the things I wanted so I started making individual tools to do the things in bash, upped my complexity switched over to python and now I have a full blown application that can match and tag from music brainz, manage rename and movement of meta data files, fix tags intuitively, convert file formats, manage album art and image tags, download lyrics make lyric files or tags test sync then downgrade to plain text on failure, and a ton of other things.

        "body": "Hello — great question, and yes! Data analytics is definitely a skill that’s in demand, and you don’t need a ton of theory or expensive courses to get started.Here’s a roadmap that works for a lot of people breaking into analytics:Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera — audit for freeKhan Academy / YouTube playlists on Excel & basic statsSQLZoo for interactive SQL practiceNext step is to focus on building something that hones your skill. Try analyzing something you care about (budgeting, fitness, etc.) Document your work — even simple visuals or insights go a long way. This will lead to something called “portfolio” like a folder of all your project work Analytics folks use Excel / Google Sheet, SQL, Python with pandas, R, Tableau/PowerBI If you want something practical and project-oriented that walks you through real exercises in data analytics, this book below is designed for beginners and emphasizes hands-on work over pure theory:AI-Powered Data Analysis for Beginnershttps://a.co/d/8v7IwjKThe book offers good ground in programming, math and stats, analytics mindsets and methodologies, using AI, with lots of examples. Many of the prompts that’s discussed are fully optimized to use lowest tokens. Full disclosure: I’m the author of the book I mentioned — sharing it because it’s designed for similar use casesNo pressure — you don’t need to buy it to start. But some folks like having a structured guide as they work through exercises and build confidence.",

It's what they can do with the language, how they can analyze and break down problems and create step-by-step solutions for the individual sub-problems that then can be implemented in a programming language, that makes a good programmer.The people of old didn't have too many choices (I was there - learnt programming in the first half of the 1980s).

        "body": "I grew up back then and frankly unless you where insanely rich, the only thing available where computers running on Z80 or 6502 chips. Great chips but all you easily had for programming was the built in BASIC. By the time I got to college, almost 10 years later the college was teaching with Modula 2 at the introductory level. Note the phrase \"teaching with\", if you are learning to program the language is really a tool to learn concepts. By the time one would finish the full program a student would have been exposed to at least 3 mandatory languages.People often ask why? The answer is pretty simple out in the real world you may end up working with a number of languages. The problem with BASIC is there is very little real world use of BASIC anymore, even gaming has gone to Lua for scripting.Now what do I suggest for beginners, that is easy C or C++ for the equivalent of the first 3-4 semesters of a Computer Science program. Why low level languages? This is again simple, you can be forced to building data structures at a low level. Personally I See languages like Python as damaging to the development of good programmers as it hands user modern concepts and unfortunately most programs designed around Python don't dive into how things work. The other reason is that properly done, by mandating the command line for the first few programs (2 semester equivalents) you also learn how compilers and linkers work, at the user level anyways. The command line is important because there are Python programmers out there that can't even create a directory at the command line. So I'm not a big fan of people learning programming with Python.However I really believe that most programmers need to learn Python at some point but properly educated that will be a piece of cake. The reality is Python has been relative simple for a scripting language. At some point a programmer will also have to learn the languages suitable for the platform at hand. The problem is platform languages are a moving target, you need a good understanding of the basics of computer science to adapt to what is new. Languages like RUST or Swift are literally works in progress, it is a continuous learning challenge to remain effective with these languages.",

You could take the remainder of the deltaPopulation and carry it over to the next step, this ensures that the population still keeps track of the fractional progress. A second approach would be to keep the population as a decimal digit and only use a getter which floors the value upon access by anyone else.",

A population of 4119.4 means that there is only 4119 people currently in the population, but anytime soon a new one will appear. And a population of 4119.7 means the exact same, but RoundToInt will round the previous result to 4119 and this one to 4120.So, use Floor or `FloorToInt` whenever you want to use the population in any other calculation - and also use `ints` for all other population-numbers, like `previousPopulation` and `deltaPopulation`. Basically you'll have \"population used in calculating the population\" as a float, and \"population used for everything else\" as an int, calculated by flooring the previous float!",

You can't do much to speed this up aside from getting a faster computer, or choosing a non-JVM language. The reason it was faster the second time is probably just because the JVM's files were already in your operating system's disk cache and didn't need to be loaded from disk again.When people talk about the JVM \"warming up\", they're usually talking about something slightly different. The JVM starts out in a \"bytecode interpreter\" mode, and only switches to JIT compilation when it detects that a certain piece of code is heavily used. This warmup process actually *improves* startup time, because it can start running code right away instead of waiting for everything to be compiled to machine code.",

If you want programs that instantly execute your options are basically C++ programs, or keep your program running and make it behave as a service that is already loaded.As to why it takes less time for a program to run on a second execution, it is because a lot of the resources loaded off of the disk end up in cached ram by the OS and the OS doesn't need to load it from the disk again if it is accessed again in a short timeframe from previous access.",

Yes, eventually it was ported to a web service which was the goal, but that took literally years longer than it should have to happen. I never tested it specifically, and honestly we almost never rebooted the machines but it always seemed to run perfectly fine.It connected to an oracle database and setup synonyms and privileges for the system users, so the table owner was not the one connecting all the time. This was for two main reasons, increased security because if someone where to break in, or coerce their way in somehow, they wouldn't have ddl access to the schema, at least, and two, to prevent ddl, and row,table locks from being created when the connected user (webserver, reporting system, etc ) can't change the table structure or update the database.You may want to take a look at what services your launching as well within said java program. Connections, importing entire large libraries you may not need, or only need bits of. The less you load/start, the faster it should run.Also try a small test java command line program that just does something reasonably simple and see if that also has the startup lag.",

The reason this evolved is because when you do “new SomeClass()” within Java it’s very difficult to test it the class that contains it.Imagine you created a CreditCard service within your Controller, when you want to unit test the controller you want a FakeCredirCard service, but if you did “new” it’s very hard to swap it out.Spring lets you annotate both the real CreditCard service and the fake one, then you dynamically get the one that fits the scope (ex: test)",

Use Backend-as-a-Service:* **Firebase** \\- Auth, database, storage, hosting. Free tier is generous. Perfect for solo devs.* **Supabase** \\- Open source Firebase alternative, uses PostgreSQLThis lets you focus on the app, not server maintenance.**When you need a real backend later:*** Node.js + Express (JavaScript, easy transition)* Python + FastAPI (clean, simple)* Basic REST API concepts* PostgreSQL or MongoDB**The practical path:**1. Learn Flutter basics (2-3 weeks)2. Build a simple app with local storage (todo app, notes app)3. Add Firebase for auth + database4. **Publish it** \\- even if it's simple5. Learn backend properly for your second or third app**Skills that matter more than people think:*** Git (version control)* App Store / Play Store publishing process (it's annoying, learn it early)* Basic UI/UX senseDon't overthink it.

C++23 IS THE latest standard - C++26 will go to final vote to ratify in March this year.C++11 is old and was incomplete even then. They missed shit like `std::make_unique` - which had to be added in C++14, the `chrono` didn't finish until C++17, which is when we also got `filesystem` and `variant`, and finally type punning was defined. We didn't get library support for type punning until C++20, which is when we also got the `ranges` library - a god damn revolution in implementing algorithms. C++23 gives us `#embeded` to bring us to parity with C, type-safe formatter strings, UTF-8 support, and more container types. Starting with C++11 also leaves almost all of `constexpr` on the table.1) Install the latest compiler package from your vendor of choice.2) Always direct it to use the latest ISO-strict standard it supports. The compiler will default to an earlier and non-standard tolerant mode. When C++26 is ratified, it'll be a following software update that suddenly you'll get the new features.3) Keep learning C++. We all learn variables, functions, loops, conditions, pointers, user defined types... You're still going to slog through all the basics. There's no point in limiting yourself to a specific standard in this journey. You'll arrive to the latest standard when you're ready for it and it's ready for you.4) It takes time for compiler vendors to catch up. Microsoft with MSVC is still scrambling to implement C++23 features. All the vendors are struggling with modules. Don't be surprised when stuff is missing. It's not actually a big deal. But keeping up with software updates means you get to capitalize on their latest additions day-of. C++26 also comes with some changes that are worth being there.5) Most teaching materials are going to teach you the same basics. For the most part, the rules of C++ have never changed since before the C++98 standard... Except when it does. And that's the thing about fixing on a specific standard - there are very standard version specific rules you don't want to get bogged down on. Template deduction, initializers, `auto`, constexpr, move semantics... A lot of that gets nuanced changes over versions, and there's always breaking changes between spec versions. I think it was C++14 that finally said you can't specialize standard library template functions, and fuck, I had a code base predicated on that.Ultimately, the differences between the specs MOSTLY won't really matter until you get through the introductory materials. C++26 does change that a little bit - because it's going to require catching the use of uninitialized variables, which was formerly undefined behavior. That's going to send ripples all the way back to the beginning of learning C++.",

The important thing is to check that the written documentation or learning material is written for at least C++14 or preferably higher. Learning C++ is a long journey where the really advanced stuff takes years to even start with. The later language versions modify and add progressively more advanced features. The language is old and has lots of traps and strange quirks. Every solution has at least 3 different ways to write it and each C++ version makes them easier (usually) to write.

Done right the first few semesters of a CS program should be covering concepts that are applicable to most if not all programming languages. If you are learning on your own your goals should be to obtain the same level of understanding.Here is the thing, you don't know what languages will be in demand by the time you are good enough in any one language to even apply for a job. If you learn well you should be able to adapt to what ever language a project requires.Frankly I don't see C++ as a good language to develop apps in as it has been eclipsed by more modern languages. What it is though is a very good language to teach the principles of programming. So is it a decent place to start, yes with one qualification, the program you follow should have at its goal teaching you from the ground up. At some point while going through a decent program, you should start to invest time in learning another language and hopefully seeing how the technology transfers from one language to another. If you have the goal of a specific platform like MacOS then start to learn Swift. At some point you should also pick up Python, however if you do it right Python will be a no brainer. In fact you will have a better understanding of how Python works if you have followed a CS program and actually did some data structure development, memory management and the like in C++. You spend some time at that level and you instantly can grasp what is happening in almost any language.",

Typically, this requires a higher level of skill than C#, when it comes to the nitty-gritty of programming. However, working on middle-ware also means that you don't get to make any consumer-facing applications, and hence, that could be very dry in comparison. Unless you're in the gaming industry, where C++ is huge.Of course, all this is a very over-simplified generalization. C++ can do most things C# can as well, and the situation really depends on the company you work for.On the other hand, C# is more general-use, just like Java.What's clear is that, in developer surveys over the past 20 years, C# consistently ranks as one of the most satisfying languages to use, while C++ usually has a poor reputation (it even has an unofficial mascot of a diseased rat with its leg blown off). That means C# tends to be more enjoyable to work with day to day.edit: gaming use case for C++",

You haven't written lots of useless comments, and the few you have seem suitable. You have made a good choice (generally, but see my next paragraph) on naming things, which many beginners suck at. My main criticism would be the name of the function `generate_board()` - I don't think that's an accurate description of what it does. The board is already \"generated\" and present in the `board` array. This function just *displays* it, so I think a name such as `display_board()` would be more accurate.There are many areas for improvement once you learn more and gain more experience, though. For example, your `check_winner()` function could be split up to make it shorter and more readable, e.g. create a function `bool is_tie()` which encapsulates the tie determination and returns true or false appropriately, then call that from `check_winner()`.You could try separating the game logic from the input/output. By doing that you make it easier to change how the game looks (such as making a GUI version, where the logic is the same, but the display mechanism is entirely different). For example instead of `check_winner()` printing the result, it could return a value that indicates the state of the game. The main game loop would then use that returned value to decide what to output.",

Here's feedback from beginner stuff to more advanced:The good:\\- Input validation with cin.fail() - many beginners skip this\\- Clean separation of functions\\- Consistent formattingThings to improve:1. Avoid global variablesRight now board, playing, size\\_of\\_board are all global. This works but doesn't scale. Pass them as parameters instead:void check\\_winner(std::string board\\[\\], bool& playing);2. Use char instead of std::string for single charactersstd::string for \"x\" and \"o\" is overkill:const char X = 'x';const char O = 'o';const char SPACE = ' ';char board\\[9\\] = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};More memory efficient and faster comparisons.3. Use std::array instead of C-style array\\#include std::array board = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};Then you get board.size() instead of the sizeof trick.4. Tie detection bugYour tie check breaks early if it finds a SPACE, but that's wrong - game isn't a tie if there are empty spaces. Should be:bool is\\_full = true;for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {if (board\\[i\\] == SPACE) {is\\_full = false;break;}}if (is\\_full) {// it's a tie}5. Use ternary for turn switchingcurrent\\_turn = (current\\_turn == X) ? O : X;6. Consider an enum for playersenum class Player { X, O, None };Prevents invalid states and makes code clearer.7. Magic numbers3 and 9 appear everywhere. Define them:constexpr int BOARD\\_SIZE = 9;constexpr int ROW\\_SIZE = 3;Overall solid for a beginner. The logic is correct (except tie check), code is readable, and you handled input edge cases. Next steps would be wrapping this in a class and adding a simple AI opponent.Keep building!",

What you can do is to have functions that don't touch IO at all, and just take parameters and return values. For example, `generate_board` returns a board object (or sets a global variable for now, if you haven't learnt classes yet). `set_cell(x, y, state)` sets the value in the cell, `check_winner` returns the winner. Then you'll have a method called `render_board` that renders the board on to the screen. Separating your program into various parts helps in testing (later), and also you'll be able to easily change parts of your program without breaking the other. For example, you can use the same tic tac toe logic, but instead use a GUI window.",

When your main function calls Pat\\_Divide with an array of exactly 1 element, you should be able to see that the `if` statement is true and then Pat\\_Divide immediately returns with only that one element.When your main function calls Pat\\_Divide with an array of exactly 3 elements, more imaginary people get involved:* Pat\\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\\_Divide and the other list to Alice\\_Divide.* Bob\\_Divide gets one element, immediately sees that the `if` statement is true, and immediately hands back that one element.* Alice\\_Divide, on the other hand, gets handed a list of 2 elements, and so is unfairly forced to do more work. * Alice\\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists (of 1 element each) and hands those lists off to Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide. * Mildred and Leroy act just like Pad\\_Divide did when Pat\\_Divide was given a list of 1 element, and each immediately hand back that 1 element. * Alice\\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) produces a sorted list of 2 elements. * Alice\\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\\_Divide.* Then Pat\\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)* Finally, Pat\\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.When your main() function calls Pat\\_Divide with a very long array, even more imaginary people get involved, but we don't really need to know all their names:* Pat\\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\\_Divide and the other list to Alice\\_Divide.* Bob\\_Divide returns a sorted list of all the items in the left list (by involving other yet-unnamed family members).* Alice\\_Divide does something similar to what she did before: * Alice\\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists and hands those lists off to Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide. * Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide divide their individual lists into even smaller pieces, and hand them off to other family members, who eventually help them produce sorted versions of those lists. * Alice\\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) combines the 2 sorted lists into a single sorted list. * Alice\\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\\_Divide.* Then Pat\\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)* Finally, Pat\\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.(Optionally, you may later learn multitaking techniques, so that Mildred, Bob's side of the family, and Leroy can each work on different parts of the problem simultaneously. ).Good luck trying to explain recursion to the next person!",

Then split the array in two halves - moving them a bit towards you (down the table)3. Split the two halves in another two halves each, so you have four groups of playing cards, and move them a bit further down.4. Continue until you have a number of individual cards layed out with space between them - it still looks exactly like the original array, and feels a bit silly at this point.5. But now, merge the two cards to the left, in order from lowest to highest, and move them a bit up the table - do the same for all the rest, so you have a collection of groups of two cards, each group sorted.6. Then merge the groups two and two, moving them a bit up the table, so you end up with a collection of groups of four cards, all sorted.7. And continue doing that, until you have only a single list of cards, all sorted ...It is important that you actually do it, and not just try to imagine it in your mind!Every time you move down the table, it is another call to the \"divide\" function, and every time you move up, it is a return from the latest \"divide\" function. Note how you can't return from a divide function, before you returned from the next divide-function that was called! This is what recursion is all about, and it is mindboggling to think about - but it works :)",

Why don’t you stop and go learn about something you feel good about? Do you like programming? Do you like the idea of programming? I’m not judging here — just looking for the other side of your story.2. A lot of programming involves not knowing the answer. Very often, things don’t work the way you think they should and you have to figure out why. You have to be very open to the idea that you might be wrong, because accepting that is often the key to finding the answer you’re looking for. You have to be okay with feeling frustrated for long periods, and you have to be persistent. Being good at programming is less a matter of knowing all the things and more a matter of being good at figuring out what you don’t know on an hourly basis. If those kinds of feelings make you uncomfortable or unhappy, programming may infeed not be a great career choice.3. The thing that hooks a lot of people is making stuff work. Seeing your program work exactly the way you want it to feels like an amazing combination of magic and certainty: it’s inspiring even though you know exactly how and why it works. It’s probably the same feeling someone gets when they fire up an engine for the first time after months of rebuilding work. If you’ve never experienced that, you might want to hang in there until you’ve built a few things to see whether you enjoy that part — it might make the rest worthwhile.",

Now, I'm trying to apply to other companies, but I'm scared of the coding assessments. Back in 2025, whenever I applied elsewhere, I would receive LeetCode-style assessments before even getting an interview. I lost hope immediately and didn’t continue with my applications.Right now, I’m using freeCodeCamp, but I struggled with one of the CSS labs, so I decided to take a break. I also started The Odin Project this new year, and I’m trying to learn it slowly.Since last week, I’ve been studying DSA because it feels like the only way to get hired in this job market. I try to code on my own first, but I get stuck—especially when there are nested loops. My brain just can’t comprehend the logic. I understand bubble sort and selection sort, but I can’t code them without looking at examples. I don’t know what will happen to me in the future; maybe if I keep learning, I’ll get better. The Odin Project says I need to practice a growth mindset, but studying DSA is so hard that it makes me wonder if I chose the wrong degree.I didn't choose my degree, my mother wanted me to take it, and I don't really know what I wanted to take before, so I just went with it.Back in college, I almost failed college algebra and my DSA subject, but I still managed to graduate on time. For algebra, the only reason I struggled was because I didn’t have eyeglasses. By the time I got them, it was already too late to catch up since I couldn’t see what the professor was teaching. For DSA, I didn’t really understand coding and syntax at first. I only started learning properly in my second year.Maybe I just got lucky before, because my first two jobs only required math assessments and quiz-style tests. If they had required coding assessments, I’m sure I would have failed and not gotten the job.I wish you the best OP, please know that you are not struggling alone.",

So that the input can't change logic in the middle of your frame on a when it's not desired, but how that will work depends on how threading / input is handled in your environment.Most game engines will use a singleton here, which is probably a good tell to use one. And in some you will get the whole state first from a singleton and work on that in the frame, and in some actions are taken directly from the singleton.For example:KeyboardState keyState = Keyboard.getState();keyState.KeyW == true---Input.is_key_pressed(KEY_W)And all the state problems are handled under the hood.---And just injecting input state directly as an argument to the frame if you decide to not use any singletons or globals.",

After all, no-one knows at the start of the projects what's the best architecture for it, so it's better to just get started, then refactor the core structure to optimal form once you have most of the important core pieces together. I.e. you \"ask the code base\" what kind of structure it wants to go into and then refactor it into such form. Then you keep adding rest of the stuff on top of that skeletal structure of the architecture. And fairly often you refactor some more to keep the code base clean and nice.In addition to that, read about Design Patterns and software architecture in general.

That's your answer.2. **Ask \"what might change?\"** If yes → avoid Singleton, use the second approach If no → Singleton is simpler, go with it * Will you ever have 2 keyboards? (multiplayer local co-op?) * Will you need to mock input for testing/replays? * Will input devices be added/removed at runtime?3. **Set a time limit** I give myself 30 minutes to decide. After that, I pick one and move on. Bad choice? I'll refactor later. Most \"wrong\" decisions cost way less time than endless deliberation.**My take on your specific case:**Singleton for input is fine for a hobby engine. Big engines avoid it for testability and flexibility, but you're not building Unreal. The simpler mental model of `Keyboard::Get()` is worth it.**The real skill isn't picking the \"best\" design - it's getting comfortable refactoring when requirements change.**Ship something. You'll learn more from hitting real problems than from theorizing.",

This may shock the non devs incthe room, but git doesnt just work for code, nodes you write in a text file can be habdled the same way. New devs hate git, but eventually you'll have used it so much if yiu use it all the time that that feeling would be like an artist wqtching new artists hate using a pencile. Dont take any shortcuts because its annoying, itll become second nature if you use it every single day, touch typing and keeping your fingers on the home row was probably annoying when you learned how to type, now you dont even think about it, and people who type with their pointer fingers look crazy to you simply because you have built the muscle memory needed to use a skill that makes you better at typing without even trying. Git isnt gonna get in your way at all once its second nature, and if you dont use it youre just hurting yourself. But just like how you can learn to type by playing games online, you can passively get better at git by using it when you decide to learn Rust or build a game or write a novel. Dont think of it as some big deal that you need to treat as its own lesson plan and practice over and over again, think of it as salt you add to every meal from now on",

Last night I had an interesting dinner conversation with a friend who I consider a genius in tech and business, and he believes the cost of software dev will approach zero as current advances in AI are continually eclipsed by improved models. Another friend tells me the latest Claude code is unbelievably good. Having AI as your learning partner is going to remove so many friction points. Spend some time learning how to get the most from AI and you’ll be running faster than if you first try to learn one syntax and formal language. Example: my dinner conversation friend likes to make boardgames for himself and friends. He recently made it in his todo list to a really interesting one where people cooperatively roll dice to try to beat a timer, with a difficulty scaling and hero exhaustion mechanic so the longer some heroes play the more tired they get, causing late rounds of the game to be more challenging. He needed to build some simulation software to play thousands of rounds of the game in order to derive the right numbers to use as timer values for easy, intermediate, and hard modes. He started by using AI chatbots to “write by prompt” a python program (he chose python for familiarity) He had written about 30 txt files describing the game,!the dice, the heroes, the colors, the map, the paths of forking decisions to move from point to point on the map, the win conditions and on and on. They were his personal notes, and he hadn’t shown them to any LLMs yet. Then he opened the folder in Cursor. The AI agent read all the files, and a whole list of notes to self and future todo items written in his personal notes. Then it proceeded to upgrade and expand his simulation script into a ful featured and useful tool. He has used it to simulate around 200,000 rounds of the game, and even had AI wrote an evaluative controller which would make adjustments to the difficulty levels until simulated games reach a desired success/fail percentage (ie. hard mode should fail 65% of the time on level 1, scaling to 80% fail rate for level 7)He opened his laptop and we told AI to rewrite the entire thing in Rust, which completed flawlessly in about two minutes. Thousands of lines of python translated to rust trivially. Then we thought of a stumper: build it in Lisp… it succeeded in another minute or two. Get conversational with AI … if you want to learn a formal language in depth, study the very well written code it outputs.",

Java, Javascript, Typescript, etc is probably the most widely used in industry today, however, due to its efficacy for web development so it'll probably have the most job options as a language. There really isn't a reason to not learn either, however. I couldn't say they seem completely foreign or alien to each other aside from handling syntax differently, and Java seeming a bit more annoying to debug at times requiring me to call more manual catches, but a lot of that was likely due to the IDE I was using at the time when I was writing Java.",

Quite commonly, when you do something different, either something with low brain activity, or different exercises, the solution will come by itself and you'll find yourself facepalming afterwards.I (experienced, professional programmer with over 3.5 decades of working in the industry, programming for over 4 decades) took a course for a language I didn't know and got stuck on one single exercise. Couldn't find a way to implement my chosen approach. I tried a couple days, but then left the exercise and kept revisiting it regularly. After some 6 months, I had the solution and then really facepalmed heavily because it was so extremely simple and straightforward (my approach was correct, though).",

Basically, what you should do is weigh the importance of having applications that can:1. Horizontally scale, and2. Tolerate/self-heal from outages ...much more strongly then you normally would for personal projects.Usually, we ignore reliability for personal projects. But if you're trying to practice distributed systems, it makes sense to make it your main focus, even if there isn't really a need for it.> Is this viable in the slightest to learn these technologies? While I understand the theory behind them, distributed systems is not something I'm learning or will learn at my job and it's something I found super super interesting.I think it'll be possible for you to pick up a solid basic understanding of these tools -- enough for you to get an understanding of their strengths/weaknesses, and when to use them.Picking up a truly in-depth understanding may be harder. Usually, that deeper intuition comes only after either dedicated study or after spending an extended amount of time using the tool in production, seeing first-hand the limitations and quirks of that tool.> If this is possible, are there ways for me to simulate many users or requests without breaking the bank in something like AWS?Some suggestions:1. Deliberately give your app very small amounts of cpu/mem, and/or deliberately add in sleep statements and such into your app to forcibly handicap your app so it can handle only 3 QPS or something. This means even modest amounts of traffic will cause a naive app to start becoming overloaded, which in turn gives you multiple opportunities to practice building support for horizontally scaling.2. Look into setting up automatic horizontal autoscaling of some sort, to automate downsizing your application when you're not currently stress-testing it.3. Alternatively, if your app is inherently expensive to run, just completely tear it down every time you're finished for the day. To reduce tedium, look into using terraform or something to automate the setup and teardown.4. Eventually, consider using something like Kubernetes to run everything. This will obviously take a lot more effort -- but doing it does mean you can test locally by setting up Kubernetes on your local machine, using VMs to simulate running on a fleet of machines. Aside from simulating traffic, also be sure to do chaos testing of some sort, where you randomly kill your machines to simulate unexpected hardware failures and/or temporarily network blackhole them to confirm your application as a whole can tolerate it, not lose user data, not enter an inconsistent state, etc.> Lastly, I know that Kafka is a little bit of an overkill for a toy project but I kinda wanna simulate this for learning purposes.Yeah -- I'd say it's overkill in general. In production, state is the enemy: the moment something is stateful, you have to worry about keeping it backed up/replicated in some way so you can tolerate unexpected hardware/network failure, which in turn often places constraints on how you can scale, etc...This is why DDIA spends so much time talking about databases and such -- figuring out how to manage state is by far the hardest part of designing and maintaining a distributed system.So for a prod system, it behooves us to go out of our way to design our architecture to keep as many of our components stateless as possible. (Stateless == they may maintain a local cache, but it'd be perfectly fine and safe to abruptly nuke a replica at any time.)But for a toy project, I think your instinct is correct. Now is the best time to play around with different technologies, even when they're not needed. This may end up causing your overall architecture to be more complex then needed, but I think that's perfectly acceptable if your goal is to become comfortable with different cloud/distributed-systems building blocks.",

Do you have a sort of mental checklist that a project needs to qualify for before doing so, or is it more just a second nature kind of thing?I know you may never need a microservice as it might introduce more complexity than it's worth, for example, but I'm wondering when you are like \"yeah okay, we need a microservice here\".Example from my experience of when to decouple was, and I know this super small fry, I added a lambda to run some puppeteer code to generate PDFs on AWS as we ran into some strange IIS worker processor quirk where the chrome process was executed twice when running this on Node/Nest. Spent about 2 days trying to figure it out until I went the AWS option instead. This came with the benefit of not having a heavy dependency like puppeteer in our bundle, although it does come with the cost of vendor lock-in to a feature, which I'm okay with in this case since there's a daily S3 cleanup and the function is used 10 times a day most, so cost is non existent.Also thanks again, this really has been invaluable feedback/input, I wish I could upvote you more than once!",

As you've discovered, checking pixel-level collisions like this is a bit performance intensive.Most games don't check collisions this way. Instead, like \"You can't move through walls\" or \"If an enemy touches you, you die\" are determined by representing both the character and the object as simple shapes. Boxes and circles are the most popular (often the sides of the box are parallel to the coordinate axes which makes the math super simple). A \"capsule\" shape is also quite easy (it's just the union of a box and two circles). Triangles involve more math to program, but may be helpful if you want arbitrary rotation or more complicated shapes (any shape is approximately a polygon; any polygon can be broken into triangles).Often the hitbox really is, quite literally, a box!",

Most sellers use Shopify/WooCommerce but their payment flows go through Stripe, Shopify Payments, PayPal, etc. When refunds happen or chargebacks occur, the reconciliation is manual Excel nightmare.My approach:1. Python backend that syncs with Stripe API daily2. Automated matching between transactions, refunds, and bank deposits3. Fuzzy matching for edge cases (partial refunds, order splits, etc)4. Alerting when discrepancies hit thresholdsLearning: building reliable payment integrations is WAY harder than docs suggest. Stripe's API is solid but reconciliation logic across different payment methods is chaotic.The data science angle: this is just supervised classification on transaction pairs - pattern matching code does what humans do but without typos. The problem isn't technical - it's that nobody wants to build \"boring\" tools.But this is exactly where first-principles thinking wins. The market doesn't care if your SaaS is sexy - they care if it saves them hours of manual work and prevents chargebacks.",

If you attended a high-quality middle and high school with a focus on mathematics, programming, or physics, you have a solid background that will be very useful in the future.

They had mass layoffs within 2 years where they laid off all the highest earners, which of course meant everyone who knew the most about how all their systems worked. Their FMV hasn't recovered and my stock is almost worth less than when I bought it. It went from a place where we would avoid hiring someone if they're an asshole to asshole behavior being tolerated everywhere under the guise of \"making better software\". ICs were ignored in favor of leaders making decisions who didn't know what the fuck was going on. Then, of course, ICs would be blamed after things went sideways because we \"disagreed and committed\" to the wrong architecture decision.

My most recent layoff was this most recent spring and I started a new, better job 3 months later.The thing I've learned is that worrying doesn't do you any good. Always stay sharp on your skills and build confidence that you can be resilient to whatever life throws at you. You don't have to keep your head in the sand, just learn to build yourself up so you can land somewhere if you need to.I also highly recommend therapy as a way to work through stress and identify ways you can find agency a chaotic career.

I got my second internship by winning a hackathon and talking to the sponsor of the prize I won.I got my first job by posting my app on LinkedIn and getting featured by 9to5Mac.Advice: Unfortunately, you are behind the curve.

The trick with personal projects is to make them using relevent skills e.g. study the job descriptions youre looking to apply to and decide which frameworks/libraries/languages to use based off what theyre looking for, and make sure to put those keywords in the bullet points for those projects. Hot take but it matters less what the project actually is meant to do rather than what you used to build it—as long as its at least a little interesting and not super generic (weather app, todo app, etc) , your idea is fine. This will increase your chances of getting interviews.When it comes to interviewing, its a separate skill, I dont think having internship/work experience necessarily helps with interviewing skills. Technical Interviews are either leetcode style (practice by doing leetcode), conceptual questions (easy to prep for via google/chatgpt or through your school notes), or system design (not usually asked for new grads, but I had one for the offer I landed and I genuinely think my experience working on personal projects are what made me not completely bomb it, and I highly doubt interns are learning system design skills well if at all).For behavioral interviews, when they ask about working on a team you can just talk about group projects you did at school. The literal thing/impact that the project did is irrelevant outside of giving context for a story. Passing behavioral interviews are all about framing yourself as a good teammate that the interviewer would enjoy working with.",

If there is a gap, fill the gap dude.I grew up in the projects of Brooklyn, NY. I fried chicken in gas stations my entire life. Learning how to code changed EVERYTHING for me but I can tell you this right now, no one cares if you win or lose. Stop looking for external validation. Sit down. Think of what the most perfect Junior Developer looks like. What skills do they have? What does their resume look like? What do their projects look like? How are they networking with others? Where is the gap between you and them?

And obviously a huge risk if a job never came to fruition. The neutral, moving here didn't suddenly bring in a bunch more opportunities. It wasn't like I had a bunch of recruiters suddenly knocking on my doors once I put Bay Area in my location. I was still cold applying and everything like that. The biggest upside came once I passed the interview and moved on to team matching. At the time, I was reading a bunch of discussion boards where people were sitting in team matching for upwards of 8 months. Some people even needing to reapply because their time expired before getting a match. I had my first call with a hiring manager 3 days after being told I passed the interview. And the two days in between were the weekend. I had a job offer in hand by the end of that day. I have zero doubts in my mind they pulled my resume first, because I was already in the area and can start working more quickly for them. Truly, I also think being an American citizen helped in that too, because it again meant quicker to writing code for them. They didn't need to do any Visa sponsorship or anything like that.",

If you report this to his next level or HR, he will get fired. So this can mean one of the following: 1. If you are a good performer, and expecting a salary raise, your manager want to give you that raise, but he feels unable to negotiate with upper management, so he is nudging you to get an offer and then use that as a leverage for your own sake. 2. Your manager has insights into upcoming downsizing and he is okay if you go. He is pretending to \"match\" your offer but giving you a chance to secure a good position. 3. Your manager for some dark reason is working against the interest of the company. He is either disgruntled. 4. Perhaps he is really concerned for his future, and sees that you have become relaxed at work place and not growing your skills, so this is his clever way of making you realise that you are still not good enough as an all rounded engineer. 5. Perhaps he is really concerned about your future, and general nature of the industry and the need to be in the habit of interviewing. 6. Your manager is just plain stupid and doesn't know how to do his job properly. I think it is a combination of 1 and 6. However there are better ways to do his job than nudging an employee to get an offer so that he can give you a raise.",

These guys just end up working illegally (and risk being deported, rightfully so) or paying consultancies to get minimum wage jobs to pay off their loans. 25 of the remaining 50 will end up coming back, 10 more will come back as their h1b won’t get picked, and maybe 10-15 people will be able to stay, pay off their loans and make a career there. Maybe 1-2 will get a green card before they’re 50 if they’re exceptional. AI has made these margins just smaller. Fewer jobs, lower pay, especially at the entry level. Once your foot is in the door- you’re a lot better off. Any experience in India does not matter. I had a colleague who graduated from BITS, worked in FAANG for ~2 years, helped me onboard when I joined. Then he went to the US for a masters and ended up joining the same company after 2 years. With a big loan and the same role. I am technically “more senior” now because he’s yet to get promoted. This craze needs to stop.",

        "body": "Resume needs to be redone, read the entirety of my comment I dropped advice as to how to fix it. Anyway - You need to apply to 1k+ jobs if that's what it takes and you need to be willing to relocate. I'd only focus on roles that are in your old tech stack, that are in office, and require 0-3 years of experience.I'd also highly recommend the OMSCS at Georgia tech. It costs 8k and has a great course catalog. It'll give you a hard reset and gives you an opportunity to apply to internships alongside applying to full-time roles. As for your resume, you need to look at Jake's resume, it's a standardized template. Have gemini distill your experience and format it to fit in Jake's resume. I feel like gemini has the best creative and visual model so it'd be the best for this use case. There are other standardized resume templates, I'm not positive Jake's resume is still the most recommended so do your research. I remember his resume template being referenced all the time a few years ago.Use a mock interview platform to find where your weaknesses are (idk what they are, I think pramp is one?). Pay for it and utilize it as much as necessary. Once you fine-tune your ability to conduct interviews, grind leetcode for 3-4 months, 30 to 60 mins a day with one day off a week. Use neetcode.io. No excuses. Stretch it to 6 months if you want to target highly paid roles at tech companies. Take whatever salary you can get, even if it's 60k it doesn't matter. You need to get back into the market, rebuild your marketability. After a year or two you can focus on more desirable roles. Seriously you can do this, I don't care how bad the market is 2.5 years is unacceptable. You're unfocused and undisciplined. No offense. Be hungry and tenacious. Good luck man, I believe in you.",

Started taking classes to fill in gap so it looks like I was doing something while still trying to apply to tech roles and now non-tech roles.About a little over half of the people in my classes were former devs. People drop off as they land other roles, but I guess the rest are doing it because it's tech-related stuff (more hands-on-y, we get to build stuff).",

You really need do everything in your power to stand out nowadays. I’m sure you’re applying to jobs frequently like many others and I’m sorry to take the tough love approach, but you need to try harder.Some advice I can share however is looking for production support(L2 or L3) roles. These roles have a lower barrier of entry and you work adjacent to software engineers to resolve production issues. Not the most exciting job, but can lead to something better over time by having some dialogue with managers about your skillset if openings become available internally.Also as some others have said, your resume could definitely use some refactoring. Best of luck!",

I think Ingot somewhat lucky. I live in a very large city, so in theory there are more companies and jobs- are you currently in a relationship? How important is it to you, and what does this new location look like? Related to day-to-day quality of life. If you’re in a relationship, how would this move impact your partner? Example, I’m not sure I’d move for Walmart, but I see you’re MLE, so having access to that data and resources could be a career changer.

It is doable, especially if it’s a LCOL city, but make sure to budget that travel into your considerations because it could eat up a significant portion of the salary increase if you choose to do it.

Rejection emails were my daily bread and i am not sure if it was my luck after completing studies on November end, I was already on final round interviews for two companies.Do not stop applying and also refine your resume throughout every rejection, I tried new formats, new keywords, placements and everything also I did few certifications too that might help depending on your tech stack. Polish your LinkedIn every now and then I recently only figured out that recruiters do care about these things, make a repo display some of your work high chance recruiter won't check it but displaying shows professional in this sour market.Its not you its the market, alot of L1 jobs are being merged with L2-L3 and its just competitive, you're likely competing with people with several years of experience there are thousands of grads unemployed (both of offers were from full time position and not grad positions or openings) also apply jobs out of your radar be open to relocating for first few years.",

Some people say that having a conversation about the weather or your favorite soda or how Metroid Prime 4 is kind of cheeks is superficial, but what those people don't get is that it's all part of the social dance where you're feeling people out, implicitly saying you're open to friendship, sharing a laugh, etc. Like it or not, you are correct that avoiding this can make somebody come off as a bit cold. *What* is being said is relatively unimportant, assuming you don't say anything offensive (so table politics, religion, social issues, etc).I struggled socially a bit in my late teens, I just worried too much about what other people would think of me if I said something wrong or stupid. But I forced myself to get out there anyway, had no problem teaching/making friends in grad school in my 20s, and I'm practically an obnoxious social butterfly now in my 30s lol. You can do it!",

Startups are about much more, including marketing, sales, networking, and LUCK.Second: The market is currently really bad for any and all software related jobs, in fact it's worse for developers and designers, I feel like. You're not the only one with no replies, even if you are senior level.Third: Isn't engineering what you love? Are you as good and passionate about anything else than this? If your financial situation isn't super tight, you should really pour your heart and soul into your next startup, whether it's something you've tried before or something brand new. It might take months, maybe years, but if this is what you want to do, you have to approach it as something you love and not something you're nervous it will fail. If your financial situation is tight, then you make ends meet with jobs perhaps unrelated to software, but you keep working on a product you have in mind on the side. If coding, programming and software development is what makes you happy, you should do it regardless of income potential.You seem confused about one important thing: you meld successful career/income with engineering. I think you should shift your mindset - if development is truly what you enjoy, do it regardless of success and income. Nowadays, those who succeed as engineers are both talented and lucky. So the most important thing to do is to continue developing software while networking, applying for jobs and/or trying a new startup. I know the latter might not seem very appealing to you, but it's the only way to sustain income while continuing to do what you love.",

We could easily do exactly the same. We don't even have to make them insanely high, follow a protectionist strategy or trade wars. Just a \"small\" reciprocal DST on revenue is all you need. For example, take the France DST, 3%, if your gross ad, digital or e-commerce revenue is 100M, even if you made 0 profit, even if you made a loss, you owe France 3M. They did set a high 25M threshold to avoid hitting small companies but no tech giant with a large French audience can scape it. UK does something similar but 2%. India's one is even higher at 6% of gross revenue but it's limited to ads and their related services.Do that same thing on the gross cost of offshoring and the problem solves itself overnight.

Burnout is a fickle beast. It might help just getting a new day-to-day, or it might make it worse due to pressure to perform in a new role. It ca go both ways.In my case, it helped, but there are no guarantees.> Did you feel more exposed during layoffs? I didn't, no.> How did you make your value visible when outcomes were less tangible?When I'm in a more architectur'y or tech lead'y roles it is more about mentoring and communication, so the more you're seen around the teams, helping out, answering questions and just being someone that enables those around you, then that is mostly enough.Making other teams succeed is also a success for you. Just make sure that you're actually a part of that success and not leeching of it (looking at you middle management).In higher positions you also get to start initiatives you believe brings value, and that value can be measured in some way. But again, don't be the guy that just starts stuff just to boost their resume. Do something that the others will actually like (or at least have good support from the ones that will be affected).",

The biggest factor, to me, was not in the role itself but the people that surrounded me. I made one switch after being burn out due to boredom and ended up in basically the corporate trash pile of non-performers that had managers who found it easier to move them to this new effort than to terminate them. I had an impossible situation of kicking something off with a bunch of people who had poor skills, poor follow through, and poor attitudes. I was heavily involved in terminating over 80% of the team, including my boss. All while trying (and obviously failing) to make forward progress and then playing catchup while onboarding the new team while dealing with an unhappy customer who just wanted results. I was very busy for a period with HR actions, customer engagements to appease an upset customer, serving the role of like 5 different positions, trying to come up with clever ways to meet impossible milestones, convincing company leadership that the project was completely screwed and we needed help, etc. I went from boring to extremely not boring. But one type of burn out to another. Having a mountain of work to get done that grows much faster than you burn it down, constantly pivoting to emergent tasks that had to be resolved immediately and had me up until 3am writing documents and building slides, dealing with nasty people on the regular… it really wears you out.

This alleviates you from your current daily grind and gives you a fresh new grind and a new bought of imposter syndrome. For example, you could be the retail industry expert floater who is brought in to talk about macro industry outcomes and not just technology design. This would mean more high level executive vision discussions and more delegation of execution & architecture details — more soothing for your fried brain, but comes with a learning curve. You know, trade offs. This might set you up for a leadership role in a real industry instead of tech where you can actually own something. Or you could coast in post sales / enablement.

I did all of my interviews remotely except for two. No one asked any leetcode style questions which couldn't be answered using first principles. Some companies asked C++ and low level questions which required knowing the language and how computers work based on extensive practical experience.The market is the worst I've seen it in 30 years, with a much lower hit rate and companies taking up to 6 weeks to respond.I have 32 years YoE doing system software and back end work. I have worked at Amazon (SDEIII), Facebook (E6) and Google (L7). I live in Silicon Valley.Your results may be different.The SF Bay Area is great if you like outdoor activities with its temperate climate and hills/mountains although that's very inconvenient without a car.

I assume that as soon as you knock the rust off in 3-6 months, you will leave for a Senior role with Senior pay. It’s too risky to hire you.​The Better Strategy:Instead of lowering your title, lower the company tier temporarily.​Avoid Big Tech/Startups for now. Their interview loops are brutal on 'rusty' candidates.​Target 'Boring' Industries. Look for Mid/Senior Data Engineer roles at insurance firms, hospitals, regional banks, or manufacturing companies.​The interview bar is often lower (less LeetCode, more practical SQL/Python).​The pace is slower, allowing you to re-learn on the job.​Rust ≠ Junior. You still know how data pipelines work; you just forgot the syntax. That comes back in 2 weeks. Do not reset your career clock because of a temporary confidence dip.",

In any case, you're probably \"cooked\" to some degree.I'm going to tell you the \"hard truth\" right now, and that's that if you don't have an offer in hand by now (otherwise why'd you be asking this, and now?!), you need to mentally prepare for the possibility of graduating without one, becoming an \"adult child\", or working in a \"burger flipping\" job. It's an absolutely awful market, and there are people more skilled than you or farther ahead of you applying for the same roles as you, and forming part of the N hundred other applications for each listing you see. How are you going to prove yourself better than them? How are you going to convince hiring managers to move forward with you, and not them?If a while passes after you graduate and you've still got nothing in hand, I'd seriously consider going to grad school, but for a non-CS field. Some fields others here have mentioned include nursing, teaching, business (MBA), law, medicine, or some form of engineering. Some of these are harder than CS, but offer stronger career outlooks and better job security. The trades could be yet another option, but know that a lot of their hype is even more inflated than that of CS, and they're genuinely not for everyone.Don't wait around hoping for the economy to improve, either, because it genuinely might never. Did the automobile jobs ever come back to Detroit? Did factory workers ever get their jobs back? Exactly. And don't expect AI to \"create new tech jobs\" either, they're not going to be junior jobs.I'm sorry, I know I'm sounding pretty negative right now, but I don't want to give anyone a false sense of hope or security. It really is that bad, and we're all in the same boat. Just prepare for a rough next couple of years.",

My advice would be to dip you toes in backend. Be full stack. If you're getting blocked by backend bs, build some solutions to those problems. If they're good, you become the product owner/go to and then you really can't get replaced. I have a friend who had similar issues working for a large real estate company and left. within a couple months of leaving, he was offered nearly triple his TC to work as a contactor and maintain the systems he built. I'm trying to do something at my current company; large healthcare servicer, so we're probably dealing with a lot of the same issues you are.If that's not your thing, build stuff you're interested in. Doesn't matter what it is or if it's related to your current role at all. Just build something interesting to you so you're motivated to dive deep and and really learn the low level nitty gritty. When that gets boring, try building something else. If it doesn't get boring, maybe you can build something really high quality and useful, and now you run your own company, definitely not replaceable.",

Make a list of your teammates, and rank them from 1-3 on trust, higher is better. 3 means you both banter about your personal life and support each other when management does dramatic things. **Note: If you have none of these people, stop here and start building those relationships.**2. Grab some time to shoot the shit with your high trust buddies one on one. Tactfully ask how the company promotes, evolves people, and grows. Get specific, examples, resumes, etc.3. Use this information to make a case for why you should be paid more. **Note: Typically management cares about outcomes (customer satisfaction, revenue, cost, logos), not inputs (time, energy) or outputs (code, features, etc). If you don't have outcomes, you almost certainly don't \"deserve\" a raise.**4. Apply to other companies in the area and start working with recruiters. This is your reality check. **Note: If you aren't getting in the door, you now know you _can't_ earn more elsewhere. If you aren't getting past the interviews you now know where your weaknesses are.**5. Get decently far into the interviews (interviews are between 3 and 5 rounds long, once you're getting to finals (and not necessarily passing them) you should feel pretty high conviction you can land a new job.6. Tell your manager, in writing, at least 24 hours before your next 1:1, that you'd like some feedback on how to improve here. Mention your most impactful project and your least impactful project. This will signal to your manager that you're highly coachable (asking for feedback).7. At this 1:1, listen, ask non-defensive clarifying questions (e.g. \"Oh, so that wasn't as impactful as I thought. I'd like to do better next time around, how would you prefer I approach that situation when it comes up again?\").8. After the 1:1 take notes, reflect, and integrate all the knowledge you now have (peer's input on how promotions are handled, your performance in interviews, your manager's perception of you, your manager's ability to guide/help you grow)9. 24 hours before the next 1:1, tell your manager, in writing, that you'd like to discuss what growth at the company would look like in their eyes. **Note: This is the start of the negotiation. If there is a formal performance review process your manager will almost certainly shunt you to it. In that case this meeting is about learning the rules of that game and how to play it well. If there isn't a formal review process and your manager is good they will lay out a path, if they're bad, they'll wander around the subject.**10. Take notes, reflect, integrate. Your goal here is to answer this question: Do I leave, play the promo game, or wield power (threaten to leave) to get more money?At this point you should know what you want and need to do.Good luck kiddo!",

You wanted a list, here is a list of stuff I’ve found helpful that I didn’t get a ton of in school:- AWS / Azure OR general cloud (I’m proficient in both, huge open for companies)- Terraform- Docker / Kubernetes (and understanding why you’ll use one over the other)- Networking (Can you explain what a CIDR range is. Can you build a server that allows both ingress and egress, to specific machines? Can you troubleshoot a connection error besides just what it is. Can you tell me why you need 443 over 22? Stuff like that doesn’t seem helpful, but when I’m setting a network in a new AWS or azure account, it really really helps.)- Proficiency in GitHub, Gitlab, whatever they use, they’re a dime a dozen.- Workflows (GitHub actions, whatever Gitlab uses, etc. They are so incredibly helpful for automating but even now half of my co workers don’t understand them.)- Jira, ADO (whatever ticketing system you need to use. Companies need a reason to give your team a budget and good ticketing is unfortunately the start of that)- documentation (underrated it’s incredibly helpful when the person has well documented code, or a well documented process. It looks good on you later on if other teams need to use it)Java, Python, ansible, C++, etc aren’t as important. The foundations are good, but if your only selling point is that you can code, it surprisingly doesn’t get you far unless you’re a genius. Soft skills are arguably more important as well over some of these hard skills. I can train anyone to work on AWS, show them the repository and they can learn the application. But can you email me that you missed a deadline? Can you appropriately set up meetings/emails? Can you own up to a mistake? Can you work with the smartest person on your team? Can you break down problems for the dumbest person on your team? Are you fun at happy hours? Will you be a toxic or positive asset to the team? That stuff matters quite a bit, just learning everything and trying to regurgitate it won’t get you far. Be humble but confident, be moldable, and be willing to do crappy stuff at first to learn.",

There was an SQL take home question that I did not get correct and I still got hired.I worked as a full stack dev for 3 years there and really busted tail. Won a few awards from the company and got promoted twice. I got laid off in October, due to my own fault, but have had some success with this experience.My advice: stay off reddit and socials, put your head down, and you will be fine. Take whatever you can get out of school. Apply to smaller companies. Message employees on LinkedIn.

The way most companies set salaries is using market reference points - the market is roughly geographic and industry tied, though companies can kinda pick and choose who they think is competing for the same workers (software engineer at a FAANG and programmer in the IT department of a paper company are probably not in the same survey).So, junior dev in some industry group and city has a median of $X. A new grad offer might be 80% * $X and the company might say that the salary band for junior is 80%-120% of the market reference. Each year they get a new market reference and also adjust target points - performance based. So if the market reference is at $110k and you're at $91k, they might bump you up 2-5% on the target. If the market reference goes up, you might get a juicier raise. If it goes down, you get less of a raise. You'll have a target point and an effective point - they won't cut pay if you're target is lower than your effective, but your raises will be smaller.If you start getting above 100%, the raises are often lower. At that point they're thinking \"get promoted to get more money\" - part of the reason for the wider bands is to be able to make offers to people being hired away from other jobs.If your friend got 5 years of really good raises, I'd bet on a rapidly climbing reference point (2010-2022 were pretty good years) along with being below the midpoint target, then some pullbacks in reference point and being above target.Managers don't typically know what the reference points will be and also don't really know how you'll perform relative to expectations.",

The best early career advice that I received and often pass on is to be very clear, focused, and intentional about communicating your career growth goals with your manager. At this stage in your career, you should be hoping to level up every 2-3yrs. Sometimes faster depending on the company. A high growth startup is the type of environment I would expect to progress quicker assuming I’m contributing at a high level. If you aren’t promoted in the first 2yrs of being there, seek employment elsewhere unless you really strongly believe your equity is worth sticking around for (it often isn’t but there’s always exceptions)",

That started getting me a lot more responses.Another thing that helped a lot was community — finding people who had non-traditional starts, bad first jobs, consulting firms, or “training-heavy” roles, and getting help on how to position that experience instead of hiding it.Since I’ve worked at an early-stage startup for 2 years and am now in Big Tech, and I’ve seen a lot of resumes from people coming out of places like Wipro, I’ve been thinking about starting a Discord or something to share what helped me, how to reframe early experience, and how to avoid getting filtered out when your past work wasn’t ideal.For what it’s worth, I wouldn’t scrub it entirely and leave a 4-year gap — gaps tend to raise more questions than imperfect experience.

Telling them you really want to do SWE signals that you will be unhappy in the role they are hiring for.​The Role itself (Red Flag): You mentioned 'hardware troubleshooting.' Be very careful here. True SRE is software engineering applied to infrastructure (coding in Python/Go, writing Terraform, managing scale). It is a great foundation for becoming a Backend Engineer or System Architect later.​The Risk: If the role is actually just IT Support/SysAdmin disguised with an SRE title (which the 'hardware' part suggests), it will be hard to pivot back to SWE later because you won't be pushing code.​Strategy: Apply for the SRE role as is. In the interview, ask: 'What percentage of my time will be spent writing code vs. manual troubleshooting?' If the coding is <30%, keep looking.",

You can then meet a real person and ask real questions like what do you like about the work, what do you not like, how's WLB, how was your last vacation, what kind of stuff are we going to be working on, are the colleagues cool, how long have you been here, etc etc.",

Now I do fully agree with your parents; that you should use it because it will be the future. I think with that in mind, you should use it but FULLY understand what it is the AI is giving back to you as a response. Like \"why does this work?\", and \"why would this answer be better?\" should cross your mind. That's the approach I have taken when using AI for my personal projects. It helps too, because if you complete something one way, there will almost certainly be a more faster and elegant way to complete said task.

Doing a neuroscience phd not only allowed me to explore a new field, but I still got to code every single day.So pick a field that you want to apply your coding skills to. What interests you?

Smalltalk is know for being a very productive language (Capers Jones) and the favourite among some industry giants. Don't stare blind on it's unpopularirty.

It's similar to Dev Associate. As I understand, Dev Associate is harder (deeper, vs wider). I couldn't tell you if SAA is impressive on it's own, or if both are worth it. Many people do SAA then do Dev. I felt that just getting Dev, the harder, more important one, done on it's own was enough. SAA is still tough too I imagine (2 vs 3 months basically?). I can only speak to my own experience and say I went from 0 interviews to weekly with the Dev Associate. Did I get more interviews because I had Dev over SAA? I don't know.SAA and Dev Associate are both good. Which, or both, I couldn't tell you 100%, but I went with Dev because I've heard it's more relevant to a web dev/full stack/SWE role.Couldn't speak on IT but I know IT is hard to break into too these days.I had very basic AWS experience before hand, basically deploying a couple websites on EC2 and some user permissions for a company. The stuff these certs go over are solutions for very large scale applications, thing basic simple websites don't usually need. It helped but wasn't huge.I'd say just pass the test to get the cert, you won't fully understand the material yet, but the first step of learning is just get the basic knowledge down.

Like I enjoy developing, in any capacity, solving problems, creating solutions. I prefer .NET, but would do literally any language or even infrastructure. Sounds cliche, but if you're passionate, you'll more easily learn, and that passion 100% shows up in interviews. So. Just apply. And prep for interviews. Once you're employed, then start planning.

While there I wanted to prove I was ambitious and voluntarily started taking on PM assignments since the front end dev work was pretty low. I was scared they’d see I wasn’t really needed lol. After that my next company was at a fortune 500 and I knew someone that got me an interview but it was for QA, but it was a fortune 500 company so I really felt like it was the right move.I have great passion when it comes to personal projects, but I’m not one of those guys that will argue about tech stacks/tools with people like it’s a sports team. I just like getting shit done, but unfortunately this “meh” attitude of not really caring what I use sometimes comes across as not passionate.As for what I enjoy, I really just enjoy being left alone and turning my work in. Whether it’s building a QA test case or building out some new app feature, I equally enjoy both. I settled on cybersecurity because it seems to scratch my itch to solve problems, investigate, and not have to be on endless phone calls (being left alone). And it also seems easier to get into then software dev since I suck at technical interviews apparently.",

Prioritize completing work that is measurable if you can. saves money, record all of that. Learn lots. Find opportunities to lead if you can.You'll need to try and break out of comfort zone. Use that sales experience. \"Fake\" it. Not literally. But just be outspoken, be agreeable, put yourself out there. Once you've built up some good job experience, metrics, more confident. Try and find that F500 chill remote job, where you can be left alone and just coast. If the job sucks, has little growth or opportunity, toxic culture. Then do enough to stay afloat and put energy to applying to another role.Edit: Push to be tactical now. Apply apply apply. Try to get anything that meets your absolute needs (enough pay, remote, etc) while staying interesting enough of a position. Dont be overly strategic yet. Be strategic once you get the job. Plan, get to know your peers, get to know the culture, be strategic. Find your place, make a plan. Evaluate your goals/plan as time goes on. You may not want to leave after a year.

Many of us problem solvers get bogged down on planning out most optimal solutions and paths, because it's fun. But when it comes to executing on that plan, day after day, you really have to stop thinking of yourself like a machine that can deterministically follow whatever oober optimized plan you make.

This doesn't look great on my CV obviously.I would like to further my resume by getting certificate, since companies using AWS are my target, I plan to get AWS certificate(I chose the architect ones).The purpose is only to pass around HR/AI, I'm confident in my ability to deliver business-visible results.The thing is, I am terrible at taking exams. I did 2 practice tests - one for associate and one for professional. Based on the results I will have to invest significant time on passing the professional one.So I'm trying to figure out if the ROI on the professional one is worth it or associate will also fulfil the goal of passing HR.",

        "body": "Hello, Ive been at my current job for about 1.5 years. I havent had much luck in landing interviews, but I also haven't been around as aggressively. Although I did get one phone interview from Capital One, where I talked to the recruiter but she told me that I would get rejected from the position since I didnt meet the baseline requirements of a 1.5 year minimum for the position. She gave me her number and told me to apply again in January since that is when I would meet the requirement. I am going to text her soon now, and apply to the position she tells me to apply to, but I am wondering on whether I should put this startup I had a big part in founding, and getting off the ground. Its only 3 months in and its steadily growing traction. I obviously don't get paid by it yet so need another full time job on top of it. Should i include it on my resume? I think I have done some cool things while working on it and it rounds out my skills well. My only concern is whether this would dissuade recruiters from selecting me for an interview since it may seem like I wouldn't be able to put the time commitment into the paying full time job. For the record, I've done a pretty good job on balancing both and still am able to perform well at my current job. Just concerned on whether this is a plus or a con to a recruiter. I would love some feedback on this and my resume overall. Thanks!resume: [https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu](https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu)",
