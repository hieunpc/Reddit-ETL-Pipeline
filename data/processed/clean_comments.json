I don't have all of the source data I need to make these and use work either so I need to identify those, build views in SQL server for the source systems that the orchestrator can query and add to the extractors. It took Claude Code an hour with almost no interaction on my part aside from approving the plan upfront. It one shotted the whole thing. All models compiled. Then I had it build a tool to cross validate the data from the old system with the new system.By no means was this sexy or even complicated work but it was insanely time-consuming. That would've been a couple days worth of work doing it by hand. Hell, just cross referencing out which source data I was missing would've been annoying and painful. I know because I did pretty much this exact same task by hand about six months ago.I spent effectively 25 to 30 minutes on the whole thing planning upfront.",

If your company has ample confluence docs, uses jira well, uses datadog or some central observability, GitHub, Aws, then just using the relevant mcps + clis with an agent cli can do pretty wild stuff. If you have multi-repo setup, you can run the agent at a parent directory with a minimal md for context about what each repo is, with more robust md in each repo. You can use skills that teach it your particular workflows (eg when you make a pr, watch the ci to pass, if it fails investigate logs on circleci using circleci mcp).",

Ultimately I set up another call to just chat. Told them that I use AI regularly and asked what they used. I asked them about using it to help answer questions. I told them I'd like to talk about some things and just wanted their answer in their own words. It became clear that they knew what they were talking about but there was a confidence issue. I have the same thing in interviews, I often freeze in my thoughts when I should be able to easily answer. I don't know what the right thing to do is, but as of now the use of AI is so ingrained in business life how can I dismiss its use completely.

Second system syndrome is incredibly common at all levels.You can try to document everything, and particularly provide metrics around how things are running to make a case that it’s actually in hand. I would assume there’s a deeper issue with data access that you aren’t fully informed about, so you might not even know what you’re arguing against.Ultimately these decisions are completely out of your hands, a C-level executive that’s recently hired has absolute authority to start changing things entirely by opinion. It’s going to take several quarters for wrong decisions impact to be felt to the point of them being blamed for them.If your new CTO doesn’t buy what you’re selling, and you’re not willing to go along for the ride with an open heart, absolutely look for the quickest exit.I say all this as the C-level executive. It’s also very possible the new CTO is seeing/know something you don’t, and what you’re reacting to is the first step in a long term plan that they themselves can’t clearly articulate because they are new.If you do stay on, you should try to build a new relationship and pull in the same direction for the next year before passing judgement.

Don't assume that a long tenure of good work, or good relationships elsewhere in the company, will save you - if your reporting line is against you, it's over (unless you can move laterally within the org, but you would likely have to substantially change roles to get out from under the CTO.) Your performance reviews are about to get worse as well, due to downward pressure to push you out. They do not have to be fair, and defiance is pointless - if the CTO wants it, a \"case\" will be built for removing you, even if it takes months or years.The safest bet is to update your resume and reach out to contacts you trust. Presumably you have those, from former coworkers happy with what you accomplished. It is far easier to change your environment than to change the nature of a CTO who is not interested in engaging with you on goals, tech, costs, etc. on their merits. I am sorry you are dealing with this, but you should not pass up outside opportunities while holding onto \"hope\" that something gets better there.",

Your manager has likely built his career and secured his position by, as you say it, running the corporate playbook. He is in meetings you are not in and has access and built in authority in a way that you do not. This gives managers a natural political advantage over their ICs - so you need to tread carefully. I would not risk overplaying your hand by going to the CTO to break out from under him unless there is a clear business need you can point to - even then this is even harder without your manager on side. I’ve worked with managers like this before, yes they suck to work with. But judging on your post and responses I think it’s very likely that your manager has marked you as someone to keep an eye on and plan against. You’ve tipped your hand by openly having conflict with them. A coup at this point will fail. This person hasn’t made it to this point just to let an IC who wants to do things their way ruin their career. If you go to your CTO and effectively say “I can’t work with this guy because he doesn’t let me operate the way I want to”, what would your CTO say? You need a better way of framing it. Also you only get one shot to pull the “change things or I’m leaving” card and you better have an offer in hand that you’d be ok taking if things didn’t go your way.",

They don't really care about new customers or cost savings, that's just how they control and direct underlings what to do.

Being dependent on a single engineer is his nightmare. You think you can take this to the cto because he smiled at you and said good work a couple of times. That’s not the case. If you wish to stay at your current place, you should stop the open conflict with your manager. Continue putting out great work, making sure you get the credit and the cto sees it.

I get it, it’s competitive. I think the new reality is that DE interviews require at least two months of study. At least that’s been my experience",

Data engineers have to optimize the query and automate it.It’s the same thing with cloud engineering. If you can’t deploy websites. write SQL queries, generate SSL certs, and write terraform. You’ll need a lot of help or create a lot of technical debt.A decent path that requires job hopping and a bit of luck:Analyst to an analytics engineer to data engineer to data architect to management or cloud architecture.Seems to be easier to do this in a Google Cloud environment.

Even with a great gym AI tool in my experience a client is only going to be able to explain about 80% of the queries they want in layman's terms. There's certain things that the client won't be able to explain without a deep understanding of the table structure because they wouldn't know to ask. It can move us as data analysts and data scientists away from the simple monotonous queries that probably make up 80% of the work, into more interesting queries and working more as a consultant/advisor to our non-technical business partners. What's going to be critical for this is that the data scientist or data analyst needs to have excellent communication skills, specifically being able to take technical subjects and communicate them clearly to non-technical people.",

Prod only where you have customers who rely on prod being up is a war crime either waiting to happen or already in progress.Somewhere I have worked was \"prod only\". No source control or anything, so we introduced it. Before, it was literally \"send to prod and see if it catches fire\". After, it was \"send it to test and see if it catches fire\".Still had that one guy who said \"I'm only making a small change so I'm committing to main directly\". Told them to branch and make PRs. Literally has never had a single PR which hasn't had a merge conflict. Guy with \"two decades of experience\", btw.",

The modern data architecture differs from the older legacy architecture in the way that it only treats the semantic layer G1 as a prod layer, even though the previous layers are in prod and allows for a lightweight downstream EOP product that significantly reduces report load times by normalizing the data upstream and reducing the cannibalisation rate upstream.",

Your current plan (Dagster+dbt on ECS) is the right tool for this scale.The real problem is not technical. A senior analyst from the parent company does not know how to use your stack and wants to replatform because Databricks has a schedule button he understands. That is a political problem not a tooling problem.Before you rip out six months of work, try this. The analyst needs a UI to schedule SQL. You can give him that without Databricks. Set up Airflow with the UI exposed (or use dbt Cloud if you have budget). Show him how to drop his SQL into a dbt model or an Airflow DAG. If he still cannot work with it after that, then the real conversation is whether the parent company is going to force their tooling choices down regardless of fit.Sometimes you lose these battles and the decision gets made above you. But make sure the tradeoff is clear before it happens. Databricks at your scale is expensive and you are not going to use 90 percent of what you are paying for.",

The lack of business understanding and thinking tools are the most important part of the job blows me away. I am very comfortable saying that tools are the least important part of the job.

Just make sure you document your conversations and comment the PR pointing out your concerns. From my experience when shit hits the fan things like this are coming back after some time and then you need a ground proof that you noticed that, and notified the person responsible (manager/supervisor). Especially if you are the one to accept the PRs, it’s a shared responsibility for the code quality. If it’s a smaller software house then I would be more persistent, because his performance has bigger impact on the product. And we are “all sailing on the same ship” :)",

There is more to Software Engineering than backend software development and shipping code, so it really depends on what you mean by software engineering knowledge.

However, the other disciplines are less tool dependent, and because of that, tend to be standardized across the industry.

The goal of software and data engineering has always been the movement of data. Its really just a question of who is your audience? Historically, software engineers would focus on transactional data and data folks would focus on batch or analytical. Once streaming and microservices showed up, the lines really blurred. So you could be a data engineer who does a lot of platform engineering and a lot of backend streaming, or you could be a data engineer who builds star schemas for power bi.

Even on the infra side, if your data is relatively small and simple, you can get a lot of work done just configuring and managing tools and services like Fivetran, dbt, and Airflow.I personally don't think data engineering (or analytics engineering) is software engineering, but there's still a lot of skillset / mindset overlap.

My favourite topic these days :)I don’t think “100% self-healing pipelines” exist in the way vendors describe them.If a SaaS provider completely restructures their API or deprecates an endpoint, no AI magically understands your business intent. If a column disappears, the system doesn’t know whether you want to drop it, replace it, backfill it, or redesign downstream logic. That’s not a syntax problem. That’s a decision problem. (Which can be taken by AI, but most of the time it doesn't have enough context)Automatic retries and exponential backoff are not self-healing. That’s just basic resilience. Even auto schema detection only gets you part of the way.What I *have* seen work in practice is more boring and more controlled:1. Detect the break and narrow down what changed.2. Create a new branch.3. Spin up a sandbox data environment for that branch.4. Let an agent attempt a fix there.5. Run tests and generate an impact summary.6. Ask a human to approve before touching prod.That’s not some magical self-repair system. It’s letting a machine try a fix somewhere safe and asking you before it does anything risky.If a vendor claims it can fully adapt to major SaaS API changes with zero review, I’d be skeptical. Skipping isolation and approval is how you corrupt downstream models quietly.Even though I think Airflow is not the best tool for AI, I also don’t think this is really about Airflow vs X vs Y. It’s more about whether your stack is reproducible and easy to run in isolation. Systems that are CLI-friendly and easy to spin up in a sandbox are much easier to automate safely. Highly stateful setups are just harder for any automation to reason about.So for me the answer is: true self-healing? Naah, we're not there yet. AI-assisted repair with guardrails? Yes, it works. It makes the boring parts of your job much more easier.",

We have BQ and I've used PG/MySQL/Maria/SQL Server/Oracle/... so can probably help.Data types and nullability are concerns you'll need to learn and handle properly with any columnar DB, but there are also DB settings around nulls you should apply so that you don't end up with reports showing 0 where they should be null or logic that has to test for '' rather than null in a string. Data types between any two pieces of software typically require a map, so that shouldn't be a distinct concern. DDLs are a bit different e.g. `LowCardinality(Nullable(String))` but after thirty minutes of learning this should be second nature.Joins - there are many types and you should learn about the different ones e.g. left anti join, any join, global left join. If you build outputs with many (10+) joins or you join on functions you'll find the performance isn't great, but that's more of a design issue - design to (left) join on UInt64 fields. The weirdest thing to get your head around is that join order matters, which is bizarre if you're used to a query execution planner doing this for you. For heavy queries expect to specify the join engine and a few parameters to get things running just right - an LLM can give you a starting point and tuning tests, so not too hard.Table engines - Used properly this can speed things up massively and convey intent - the Set engine, for example is a great way to check if a value is good / bad without an additional join and operates near instantly.Primary Keys - not really a thing here, instead you have order by. There are table engines which should apply the primary key, but it's better if your logic sets this to be the case rather than relying on the engine itself. Expect to footgun yourself at least once here.SCD2s - can be challenge - ASOF LEFT JOIN is great in principle, but if you have a list of preferred suppliers stored as an SCD2 you'll need to order by supplier id and valid from and add a 'future' non-preferred record so that transactions after the end data don't continue to return 'preferred'Syntax: - argMax and various array functions are excellent and Claude is great at writing them - being able to refer to results from the same select can really cut down the CTE chain - if you're running on a cluster or with multi-client and orchestration, the boilerplate can get a bit OTT, but that's true for competitors tooMemory use - All columnar databases love to eat memory, expect to have nodes with 128GB+ if you've got a few tens of millions of rows of wide data.ClickPipes - not used this.",

Those being proper orchestrators (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect to name a few), transformation systems (Spark/Ray, Warehouses, etc), and if you wanted to, 'accessory systems' like Kafka and vector extensions to common DBs since you mentioned Postgres and ML/AI. To be clear, I don't think you ever need all of them. Each shop has, unfortunately in many cases, so many options that you'll be unable to really cover everything. If you did, say, an example of streaming some mock data (or real if you can get it) into Kafka and using the operators in Airflow to do some light filtering and dropping that in like TimescaleDB (a PG extension for time series), you'll have enough to go on to speak about the topics of orchestration, real time workflows, and useful DB system choices if you spend the time!On the other hand you mentioned the transition from Orchestrating ML workflows as a DE to going to creational ML workflows as an MLE. I don't think the transition is impossible, but I will say it's difficult. When I/my company looked for MLEs we specifically waited for very skilled candidates. Many applicants were trying to make the same transition you're mentioning but the reality is the skills are harder to obtain or practice on your own than SWE or DE skills. Hell I positioned myself to at least cross-train for it to fill the gap while we waited, but I was ultimately turned down. That's all anecdotal. MLE is a bit of a hot job right now, so you will definitely have competition up and down the skill spectrum and there are only so many positions to go around. Otherwise yeah soft skills like another commenter said. If you do a personal experimentation project, practice documenting it like it was going to be used by other engineers and was production-ready. Social skills, communication skills, etc. are never bad things to take on!",

But to answer the part that has not been answered here yet, normalization does save space when contrasted with raw data entering the transactional system, e.g. displayed or entered at Point of Sales terminal, as well as with denormalized data in a DWH. That is not the point however, as storage has grown and cheapened even for on prem systems, since normalization was invented. The point is speed and scaling the write operations. When yoyr transactional (e.g. sales) system has to record hundreds and thousands of items scanned, or ordered online every second, it doesn't have time to repeatedly write the customer address, or name in each row of a big table. Rather thatbinfo is saved once in a normalized table and its id is used in each row representing item bought.In analytical (dwh) workloads, in contrast, you want fast bulk reads of whole chunks of a table, and each join is a burden for the analytical system, while storage and write speed are more relaxed",

There are a few reasons for this, one being that most DWH end up using columnstore MPP warehouses and they just like joins less.

Smaller companies care less about the gap and more about whether you can do the job.

It is a niche of DE but an important and interesting one, I think you should lean more into that side of things and find jobs there. Create some dummy projects showing off your skills with Vector and Raster data, intersect that with H3/s2 cells at different aggregations. Connect this with real world data like open street maps. You can explore using duckdb/bigquery geospatial functions. Learn about Apache Sedona and maybe try to set it up and get AI to help guide you along and learn. Use tools like OpenCode or ClaudeCode to start building and then ask a lot of questions and make it explain things to you. Then you can have some projects on your github and start applying for the smaller geospatial jobs.

So you might want to take a look at some of those questions once in a while so you are not blindsided in the interviews.Since you mentioned that you don't have experience apart from internships, you might want to consider a certificate like Databricks or Azure one to pad up your resume.

When you are performing this for building a complex dashboard, it will take quite a lot of iterations which could lead to many browser tabs being open and a lot of context switching.Whereas in Sopho, there is just Canvas which is basically Notebook + Dashboard. Notebook has SQL cells where you can write SQL queries and also Chart cells where you can use those SQL Cells to create a visualization. Later when you have iterated and finalized the charts you want to be displayed, you can go over to the dashboard view of the Canvas and place the chart cells from the notebook in the dashboard. The benefit is that everything is in one place so no need of keeping multiple tabs open and switching contexts for building a dashboard with a lot of charts. The notebook basically acts as the backend for the dashboard. This workflow is inspired by closed source platforms like Hex and Fabi.Sopho uses Rust in the backend as opposed to JVM based Metabase and Python based Superset. Like Metabase, Sopho is a single binary which Superset is not.Canvas is the only differentiating feature that is delivered right now in this version. I am planning to add more AI native features to it because Metabase AI is an enterprise only feature. I also plan to keep Sopho fully open source with no dual licensing and tiering.",

If they don't give consent (about 25% of the whole data) we dont have any identifiers like ip adress, cookie id etc.And then people start complaining that our dashboards shows that our customers are useing the website less...",

Even scala, for good and bad, isnt a focus much in the Spark space where Python is still king. Is it good to look into these languages and understand them? I think so. I have had on countless times needing data from the software engineering team, or need to understand how the function of said data works and its way easier for me to just see the endpoint and understand what it's doing. Sometimes you get crap data and you need to identify why the data is crap. It isnt often, but it has happened a few times where it's useful. Also, if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to build out REST APIs for any reason, while you can certainly use django, and I do like me some django, you might be forced to make them in .NET or Java or Rails or whatever it may be that the company dictates. I have built many personal projects using all sorts of programming languages just on the sheer fact it allows me to understand the inner workings of the data I am getting. That has allowed me to have deeper conversations with the SWE team for when and how they produce data. TLDR, I think its good idea to understand it, and makes you a better DE, but is it necessary? I dont think so at all.",

But if you are running this query only once in a single session, you are simply moving the shuffle one row above so it won't help much.If this is a recurrent query that runs every day, every hour, etc. I would suggest physically bucketing the data on disk before doing any join or filtering. Spark should be able to read the raw data, bucket it once and keep it like that for further runs. But I don't know all the details of your architecture so I'm not sure if this would be viable in your setup. Speaking of joins, do you know if it is guaranteed that one of the two views can fit into a single partition in memory? In that case, you can force a broadcast join to avoid a shuffle join, but this is only in the cases where you know more about your data than the catalyst optimizer, so to speak. Be careful to not make your worker nodes run out of memory by forcing a broadcast join when the catalyst chooses a shuffle join, however.",

When devs can crank out features with AI help they sometimes skip the part where they talk to you about how the data should flow. You get surprised by schema changes or new tables that were not designed with downstream use in mind. Documentation does not keep up either.What helped us was requiring a data impact checklist before any feature launch and making schema changes part of the same PR review process as code.

I've been on both sides of the river: SWE and DE, but haven't come across a scenario like this, not that it's a really complicated one.My tradeoff lies between the complexity of querying to the delta table for the ops team versus duplicating data on SQL server while making it easier for them to read it.",

You'll be surprised how fast it'll go. Have it write the ingestion scripts, then ask it to explain *why* it chose a specific schema and made the decisions. Focus on the architecture, not the syntax. You need to understand the why across all of the decisions; this is very important. This gives you a ton of experience.For a project, just use a public API like NYC Open Data (Citibike)**.**  \"Which stations run out of bikes during Monday rush hour?**\"** . Collect the data, model it, and show some insights to answer that question. Then go a step further, do holidays change the trend? What about YOY growth?This isn't 'extra' work; it’s proving you're a partner who builds systems that actually solve problems. That’s what gets you hired whether you go for DE or analyst.",

Lance's file format is versioned, with the current default version being 2.0. 2.1 is already out there and is going to be the default soon, and 2.2 is also implemented and in the testing phase. The choice of file format used can impact the level of compression and performance you see, as the format is continually being improved.Re: performance, the F3 paper ([https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf)) shows numbers comparing Lance vs. other file formats and this is a good source of information (outside of the LanceDB team) in terms of scan and random access throughput (it shows that Lance is the fastest). The compression ratio shown in the paper is the worst, but the paper benchmarked against an old version of Lance (pre 2.0).From a roadmap perspective, Lance file format 2.2 that will come out soon has significantly more compression algorithms implemented, with some performance improvements as well. So more numbers will be published soon once that's out.Re: your performance observations, a) the version of the file format used matter, and b) the data types may not have the best compression ratios for that file version used. In LanceDB's internal suite, we regularly test against these modalities: long-form text, images and video blobs. For these cases, the write amplification in Parquet due to row groups is significant (which is the reason Lance was created in the first place). That said, even for conventional tabular data types (floats, booleans, etc.), Lance should perform on par with or better than Parquet, no matter the scale of the dataset. If you're getting sufficient performance out of Parquet, then well and good, in the end, what works best in practice is all that's needed!",

The gap between what is documented & what is actually used, is a massive headache, so your head is in the exact right place.u/Johnlee01223 is totally right about the complexity, though, building a custom usage graph means parsing millions of messy SQL queries. It turns into an edge case nightmare real quick, and parsing all those logs at scale can easily nuke your warehouse compute budget.tbh, to save you from reinventing the wheel, DataHub actually has this built in natively. It hooks directly into BigQuery (`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`) or Snowflake (`QUERY_HISTORY`) and automatically translates those raw logs into the usage graph you're prototyping, mapping out column level lineage, real join relationships, and showing exactly who is querying what.To keep the compute overhead low, we use server side query pushdowns to filter out high volume bot or service account traffic before it ever hits the parser.If you're curious how the architecture works or what the output looks like, check this quick breakdown [Dataset Usage & Query History docs](https://docs.datahub.com/docs/features/dataset-usage-and-query-history).btw, which warehouse are you testing your prototype on right now?

And building a usage graph is far from trivial. There are countless ways to write SQL that ultimately accomplish the same thing. On top of that, every tool interprets queries differently, since each has its own parsing logic and assumptions. Unless you have the first-hand control over the execution engine itself, extracting things like:* Column usage and aliasestypically means parsing user-written input (i.e SQL query) which comes with countless edge cases. So the solution you're coming up ideally has to be something that can be plugged into the compute engine itself .i.e. OpenLineage is taking this approach for collecting lineage information by integrating directly with various compute engines rather than relying solely on query parsing.I would say go for it and no one had a good solution for it yet afaik. Ultimately, the value comes down to what kind of usage graph you're building and how it leads to actionable insights. That’s challenging because interpretation itself is dynamic.",

So that depends on how convenient it's going to be to query that. If your database supports JSON properly I think general querying would be easier.JSON will let you have arrays as property values. You may want to somehow forbid that because people will eventually do that, even though your response to my question was basically \"no\".\\> I do not want business logic to depend on null checks for columns.I think that you cannot meaningfully enforce required properties on the database schema level if you choose a JSON or EAV. For EAV it's impossible I think, for JSON you'll have to implement tooling that maintains CHECK constraints (if your database even supports that).I think the only reliable way to have required properties is a classic 3NF schema, but you don't want that; so maybe you would consider relaxing one of those requirements...",

Then run a `DELETE FROM` from query where the join between the target and temp table is not null, then a simple insert query to copy from the temp table to the target. This is handy if your join keys aren't set as the primary key of the table, but if they are the temp table is unnecessary and `UPDATE` should work just fine.

We haven't observed deadlocks so far.The table is clustered on a surrogate `id`, and business uniqueness is enforced by a unique nonclustered index on `(reference_date, key_a, key_b)`, which is also the key used for matching during updates.We also have auxiliary nonclustered indexes on `key_c` and `key_d`.We are not currently using MERGE; we're evaluating whether to use MERGE, INSERT WHERE NOT EXISTS, or separate UPDATE/INSERT logic.Tempdb usage hasn't been a bottleneck so far, but we haven't stress-tested it under full parallel load.",

But it can be fun to dive in, and play Sherlock Holmes.I would start simple, and forget about the 350+ pipelines. Start by diving into the easy places to get a head start and list all the problems you've found to kind of semi-cover your ass and set expectations:* Sporadic errors* Data loss on type conversions, * Lineage tool needs to fed better data or it is useless for this purpose.I would write something up, saying that the first 2 points must be fixed in order to get reliable result and success. How far have you found the first 2 points in your flow? If it is near the end, get some colleague to focus on fixing this, while you audit numbers earlier in the pipeline. Get someone else to fix it anyway, you focus on auditing data at other places.The 3rd point about lineage tool is not relevant yet. If you don't find a few clear errors that fixes stuff down the line, and you must go detailed through almost all flows as your last resort, the lineage tool *must* be improved and to be relied on. That is probably probably not a small task in itself, and there's likely a reason it is superficially setup as is.As for the actual data hunt; you most likely have already done so, but compare the 2 curated tables. If they are identical you know to whether to go forward or backwards in your flows for errors. If you need to go back in your flows, make an audit somewhere in the middle between the source and curated tables of going backwards. Does data match, does transformations makes sense. Then you do the same, figure out if you need to go forward/backward again. Audit somewhere in the middle again so you don't go through all steps. Break down your audit spots, and focus on 2 to 5 KPI's and the data they rely on. Document your code to easily reproduce the check at different spots for that part of the data, so you can show others.And make those others quickly check you're on the right path, and that they agree you compare the proper data, so a misunderstanding does not lead astray.Depending on urgency and resources available, I would show findings and clearly point out, that it doesn't make sense to compare and audit those KPI's if you can't trust the data in the first place. Suggest a plan, split up the tasks. Whether you are solo or can get help from team mates, don't do a bit of data loss fix, and then some audit, and then some check on sporadic errors, back and forth, etc. In all 3 tasks there's a bunch of rabbit holes to dive into, and I at least had trouble keeping a mental overview on the project itself and its progress while jumping from rabbit hole to rabbit hole. Almost fixing almost all problems at once, so the puzzle pieces suddenly match perfect at the same time hasn't happened for me, at least. And it sounded like a simpler setup than yours. Now it became quite long, TL;DR, break stuff down, audit certain data for certain KPI's midway though the flow, and midway from last checkpoint, etc. Focus on specifics tasks, don't do everything at the same time, and then you've got this, as long as you don't let yourself get bullied on timelines. Stand up for yourself, and let management know if you've discovered deeper problems, which requires more time than initially expected.",

Glue does not register partitions in Hive-style because it would be redundant and error prone (given that Iceberg already manages partitions, manifests, and snapshots atomically) - which explains why you're getting nothing when you call GetPartitions.When you said \"create S3 notifications, subscribe to those and then run Glue Crawler on those events, which will create another S3 based Glue table with the correct partition information\" -> are you suggesting to create a hive table off **iceberg data files**?Is running DQ checks on partitions a strict requirement, or more of a practice your team has been following? In Iceberg, the more standard approach is to run DQ checks per snapshot, which can be done periodically by querying the Iceberg snapshots table",

You cant optimize \"after you're done\", there wont be anyone paying your time to do that if it already works.You need to clean it as you go, and your starting state is increasingly better with experience; not a single giant god-file of procedural code.That then takes you to the next trap. Once you've finalized one use-case, you want to refactor it, because now you can do it \"better\". That's a trap, you'll need to learn to accept \"good enough\" somewhere along the way and take your lessons to the next project instead of getting stuck in this loop.With that in mind, I actually think this is bad advice. I prefer devs who think a little before coding. Knowing your context boundaries can already help you structure your implementation greatly; starting with something like hexagonal is not slow anymore, it's fast and you can use scaffolders for it; openapi generators if you're using good structure will also accelerate API exposure AND consumption; so you arent over-engineering it if it took you 1 hour to setup and saved you 50 hours of refactors or bug-hunting as you implement, while simultaneously making it easier to change.You write code once and read it 100 times. Optimize for readability from the get-go, and continuously improve as you go.17YOE here.",

As someone who jumped into tech at 40 with very little formal education in CS, I was so confused when college professors at my local university couldn't explain these concepts well, yet were trying to teach smart pointers. I'm now a 2nd year sysadmin in IT & this series has been great for me. Thanks!",

In many segments you focus on one solutions such as git. However you should make a point to highlight a number of similar systems. The idea is to make students aware that there are many options. Covering the common solution is find after highlighting that students have lots of options. I actually like that GIT and VIM coverage as good introductions.2. I'm still of the opinion that everyone needs to learn VIM, as a command line tool, to some extent. It is the VIM is everywhere base reality. However in the modern world using the command line environment with a GUI editor of choice might lead to more productive students. I'm not even sure students grasp that command line control can be mixed with GUI apps. This may be personal thing but I find GUI based editors far more productive. So in the same regards a paragraph that list out a few alternative command line an and GUI editors to inform students makes sense.3. A port for compiled languages or an additional segment within this package, would be useful for programs that don't use Python. A focus on C++ would be advisable as the use of GCC is similar for many languages. The idea is not to teach the language, but to teach how programs are built with compilers. Like I said only a very brief view of this site, but guys it looks like it covers much of which sidelines students at the start. In fact this sort of stuff should be covered in a high school prep course.",

They correlate, but they're not the same thing.Math gives you vocabulary (sets, functions, proofs) and trains abstract reasoning. But the specific skill of \"I have a complex problem — how do I break it into tractable parts?\" is best built by solving a lot of programming problems with deliberate reflection, not by restarting algebra.Follow the math list others recommended — it's solid. But in parallel: do structured problem sets (Exercism, Advent of Code easy levels) and after each one, write out in plain English how you decomposed the problem before you touched code. That explicit practice of \"problem → sub-problems → approach\" will do more for your logical thinking than math alone, faster.",

Get error reporting setup. - From HTML, learn [templating](https://phptherightway.com/#templating). - Learn proper routing using urls vs direct file links. Introducing HTTP, like 404 Not found. - Learn routing with HTTP methods using forms (`GET /form` & `POST /form`). Starts the thinking in \"MVC\" & \"Restful\" like patterns. - Learn about validating (not sanitizing) data, returning early, sending error messages to the template with HTTP response codes. - Learn about databases (using SQLite, less setup) to populate & read data. - Next would be refactoring to smaller testable functions (Are you receiving the data (input or code to function) you need? Are you getting the output you expect?), - Then OOP and better project structure. - Try this out using the common beginner User Registration/Login projects and learn about password_* functions (vs md5, sha1, etc), etc.A beginner would then be comfortable getting into current concepts found in libraries and frameworks.See how this was more focused to learning based on experience?",

Hiring cares more about: can you build and deploy an API, use a DB, write tests, use git, and explain tradeoffs. I’d finish the Boot.dev track, then build one portfolio project end-to-end (auth, CRUD, pagination, logging, tests, Docker, simple CI), and only then think about switching stacks. Also DSA is still worth it, but you can do 30-45 min/day instead of turning it into your whole life.",

Imagine us telling \"Yeah, learn that Go.\" You'll learn it. Nobody in your area is developing his stuff in Go. Countries differ, job markets differ. What is in use in one place can be not in demand in another place.Now, to your questions:1)Backend is backend. If you are targeting web application development you won't be using any other math than some simple primary school math. And sometimes even not that. There won't be any difference between picking Python or Java or PHP or something else. If you have to add up your end-user's monthly bills you will use a simple primary school math.The only thing you do have to look into is Boolean algebra. AND, OR, NOT and the combinations of these in IF/ELSE blocks. To decide how the process flow will switch based on one or another criteria. But you should have studied it during your degree studies. In Discrete Mathematics course or such.You'll need more math in data science.2)Pick the backend language based on job offers in your area. Sure, you can pick some language that less juniors are using... but you won't be using it at all if there is no demand after it.3)If you are going to work in web application development you'll need SQL and git for sure. Linux can come useful when having to do some devops. But also useful in general. Stuff more often than not just work when working in a Linux or a Mac. In Windows you have to figure out how to get it working in your WSL and stuff.No idea about boot.dev. But as you already have a degree then whichever bootcamp you are picking, should just remind you what you were studying 7 years ago.You do need OOP and DSA but that should also be covered by your degree studies, already. It won't be anything new. Just a refreshment course for you.Now, when it comes to remote jobs then there you should be less optimistic. Better target local office jobs. At least where I live (a country in Europe) they are more often expecting the new junior to show up in the office. For onboarding, for mentoring, etc. It is a bit risky to let a new junior to work remotely on his own. Not saying that there won't be any remote jobs, for you, but expect to find an office job before finding a remote job.And when it comes to a saturation then a web application development in general is a saturated field. Does not matter if you are picking Python, Java, Go, PHP or something else. Because everybody is \"speedrunning\" and trying to get a job fast. And a web application development has its entry barrier lower than in data science and such, where one might need more theoretical knowledge in things.",

Is Python backend math, heavy? Would Java be safer?Backend Python isnt heavy on math at all. Most of the work is around APIs, databases, authentication, and business logic. The intense math in Python comes in AI and data science, which you can totally stay away from. Java isnt having less math than Python; theyre pretty much the same in this aspect.2. Should you pivot to Java to avoid Python saturation?Java is definitely a good choice in enterprises, but changing to it now would stop you from moving forward fast. What is more important is if you can build backend systems and talk about them. After your gaining understanding of backend fundamentals, it will be very easy for you to learn Java.3. Should you stick with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) and learn OOP, DSA, Linux, SQL, and Git?Yup... Those are good to have backend skills. SQL, Git, Linux, and backend architecture are the things used all the time in real jobs and will make you employable no matter the language.The most significant factor is practical experience.

        "body": "I wouldn't worry about math too much, nor choose a language based on that. The business domain will determine that, not the language. And the vast bulk of programming jobs out there don't require much math. It's a misconception that all of us programmers are doing lots of math.The most math you may benefit from is boolean algebra (and simple arithmetic), and that's very easy and fast to learn and has some payoff for working with logic in code. See the first two chapters of \"How to Prove It\", he covers the topic really well and it's a breeze.Another good topic, related to logic, is how numbers are represented in a computer in general with a \"finite number system\", and in various languages more specifically (integer vs. float vs. double, vs. BigInteger/BigFloat [using memory to sidestep the limitations on the primitive data types]), and to understand the pros and cons of the common approaches. You should try to come away with a good working intuition, e.g. when to use an integer vs. a float/double based on the actual numbers you're working with, how floating-point numbers increasingly lose precision in the integers as they get larger, the kinds of problems you can run into when FP values are part of boolean expressions, i.e. exact equality checks, due to floating-point rounding error (and also how errors can creep in based on how you group operations on numbers of various magnitudes).Java is a great language. Personally I would choose a language based on the job market, not based on your perception of Python seeming easier to use. IMO it would actually be beneficial to confront that \"strictness\" sooner than later. That strictness you perceive is generally a good thing, it's an up-front cost that pays off in a bunch of good ways. With the exception of `var`, it generally gives good visibility on expected types (and you can always use the IDE to help inspect `var` variables). Types give you something firm to latch onto when reasoning about code at development time and debugging time. Python (AFAIK) has made improvements here, but I don't know the current state of things, how ergonomic it all is, and how good the tooling is. Maybe it's great, I have no idea. But Java is pretty decent in this regard. Anyway, types relate to logic, particularly when using the primitive data types, as you can abstractly think of the types as the sets of all possible values (restricted by the fact that the computer is finite).With DSA stuff, I have no knowledge of boot.dev, but I'd probably just think of it as a potential problem bank. With DSA, you want to get exposure to various categories of problems, regardless of where you got the problems from. DSA problems are all scoped down majorly, so it generally doesn't matter where you're getting them from (as long as they're not poorly written). A key though is being able to check your solution for correctness. If boot.dev lets you _run_ your solutions to see whether it passes or fails, and on which inputs, then that's great. Otherwise, platforms like LeetCode can do that (or see Neetcode for a narrower list). With these, focus on quality over quantity. There are more problems than you realistically have time to do, and that's fine. If you do one problem from each fundamental category, that's an awesome start. Hopefully boot.dev's problem set gives you a diverse sampling.Other than that, a key for your career in programming is to actually build small projects of your own choosing on your own time, because you need exposure to the \"problem-solving cycle\". Getting real projects done can be an arduous process of cycling over and over through planning, coding, verifying, and repeating until you reach some clearly defined \"done\" state. At times it can be a psychological thriller. Anyway, DSA won't help you much here - DSA may have some payoff for when it comes time to implement code and not make as many silly mistakes, like \"off-by-one\" issues (or when it comes time to vet an LLM's output, if you choose to use them to actually write code [which I don't recommend doing while you're _learning_, because you really want to learn from the ground up so you can adequately vet their output and more confidently/quickly accept or reject or modify/refactor their output]). LLMs can be useful, but whatever you do, you have to protect your own mental clarity and attention span - LLMs can easily exhaust it and cause more trouble than they're worth, depending on your skill level and how and when you use them.In the process of working on projects, ideally you also learn more and more about how to build whole systems, rather than just \"code\". This is why working \"full-stack\" on your own can be a good idea, even if you don't actually work in a role that is itself full-stack - it gives you exposure to a broader set of concerns that are all part of the building the whole system. Your value to a software company will be your ability to implement systems or at least your part of them, and hopefully in a thoughtful way that minimizes friction for your teammates.",

And I mean any help, mental, development, hobby, what ever it takes to not spiral out of control. Also, this is how you grow... by learning new things. That's why I switched teams a year ago. I felt like I had plateaued where I was after 7 years. I was afraid I had stagnated. When an opportunity came up to change to a new area, I leapt... with out thinking it through.

But even if the data would have to be sorted every once in a while - as long as it have to be search many more times than that, it is still more efficient than linear search. But a lot of data is already sorted, like product catalogues, user accounts, addresses and phone-numbers, dictionaries for different languages and they only change rarely compared to how often they are searched.However, there are other algorithms, or rather data structures, that keep a \"list\" sorted at all times, even when data is removed and inserted. Like AVL or red-black trees. They are more advanced data structures, and they build on the understanding of binary search, linked lists, trees and binary trees.But it is a very good observation that no algorithm is perfect, and there's always pros and cons to every single one! That is probably one of the most important lessons of DSA.",

First guess 50, 75, 62, 69 done, how about 79? 50, 75, 87, 81, 78, 80, 79 done.Now convert that algorithm into a tree like data structure, a b-tree. Each node in the tree has a possible left and a possible right. To find the node you want quickly just check left, then right, which also makes this algorithm trivial for a recursive search.You mentioned that it needs sorted data, have a look at the quicksort algorithm and see how that one works at its core of splitting the dataset into two, and repeating itself on the two pieces.",

Before you worry about tools like Burp Suite, the single most valuable thing you can do is build a rock-solid mental model of how software actually executes. I'd seriously recommend working through CMU's Bomb Lab and Attack Lab (both freely available — just search \"CMU bomb lab\" and \"CMU attack lab\" and you'll find the assignments plus tons of writeups from students who've completed them). Bomb Lab teaches you to reverse engineer a binary using GDB and disassembly, figuring out what inputs defuse each \"phase\" of a bomb. Attack Lab goes further and has you actually craft buffer overflow exploits, including code injection and return-oriented programming. These aren't theoretical exercises — they're teaching you the exact thought process security researchers use: read the code or binary, understand the expected behavior, then ask \"what happens if I send something the developer didn't anticipate?\"Once you've internalized that mindset, the web security stuff you're learning (endpoints, parameters, open redirects) starts to click because you realize it's the same pattern at a different layer. A security researcher looking at a web app is doing the same thing you do in Attack Lab — tracing how input flows through the system and finding the spot where untrusted data gets used in a way the developer didn't account for. Tools just automate parts of that process; the skill is in knowing what to look for and why. Build that foundation first and everything else will make a lot more sense.",

Kotlin + Android Studio is the modern path and what Google officially supports.Since you already know some Python and JavaScript, you won’t struggle with Kotlin syntax. The harder part will be understanding Android concepts like activities, lifecycle, navigation, state, and architecture.My suggested path:1. Install Android Studio2. Learn Kotlin basics (a short crash course is enough)3. Follow one full beginner Android course that uses Jetpack Compose4. Build a very small app yourself (notes app, to do app, simple tracker)If your goal is fast MVP and not deep Android knowledge, then React Native could be an option because you know JavaScript. But if your goal is to truly understand Android and avoid shortcuts that bite later, native Kotlin is better.You can realistically build a simple MVP in 4 to 6 weeks if you stay consistent.",

Even small internal tools or scripts that clean up CSVs can turn into very real use cases. A lot of practical software starts as someone scratching an itch inside a non tech environment.Also, it is fine if it stays a hobby for a while. Skills compound quietly. The fact that you are thinking about caching and replicas without external pressure means you actually enjoy the systems side. That intrinsic motivation is rare.

The fact that you've been disciplined enough to go through CS50x and build actual projects with Fast API/PostgreSQL shows real commitment. That's not easy.Two thoughts: First, remote work completely changes the equation for small-town developers. Companies hiring remote backend devs don't care where you live. Sites like WeWorkRemotely or RemoteOK post junior backend positions regularly. Your stack (Python, FastAPI, SQL) is actually in demand.Second, the plant job might be more relevant than you think. Manufacturing environments generate tons of data - production logs, downtime tracking, inventory. Once you're inside, you'll probably spot inefficiencies that could use a small internal tool. Sometimes the best projects come from being in a non-tech environment because you see problems others miss.Keep the skills sharp even if it's just 30 min/day. The market shifts fast, and being ready when an opportunity appears is half the battle.",

Are you working on a CRUD app? A REST API? A frontend?For a backend problem, \"If I fix the bug by condensing the data model, or creating a simple handler function that can be re-used, or condensing business logic to a service layer, or maybe this could be refactored by a making an MVC (model-view-controller) pattern\"For a frontend problem, \"this broken form component could be parameterized and reused, since we have several form components that essentially do the same thing, thus preventing future bugs in the other forms\"It can help to get a better understanding of design patterns, code isolation, code reusability, and generic implementation. Generic code is reusable code. DRY up your code.. Do Not Repeat Yourself.A very simple way to approach this would be \"let's write the code in a way such that making a change here, does not break or affect code over here\".If you break something else while cleaning something up, that might actually be a good thing, because you proactively addressed another potential bug in the future, and made your code more resilient in the process.Writing test cases can also help tremendously toward building repeatable approaches and also to ensure your code does not break again due to some change later on.",

Think of them as experiments. Recreate a simple version of a tool you use. Add one feature it doesn’t have. Break it on purpose and fix it. That’s where the learning actually happens.Your website is already a great start. If you’re comfortable with HTML and CSS, maybe add a small interactive feature with JavaScript, like a habit tracker or a mini dashboard.

It's a learning experience that can't be skipped.Find something which seems like it would be fun to make - something simple.

My first programming projects were \"Guess the number\" type games. \"Your guess is too high, guess again\". That wasn't exactly revolutionary, and the world didn't need my game. That wasn't the point. The point was I *wanted* to make it, because I *enjoyed* it.

It reduces cognitive load.2. **Practice under fake pressure** — screen record yourself solving problems, or code while someone silently watches (even on Discord). Your brain needs exposure, not more prep.3. **Normalize partial correctness** — interviews reward recovery.

For c# / visual studio I use windows for python / nvim I use Linux.To your questions:- windows is easier to learn on (compared to linux it is an os designed for less technical people). That said if you are serious about programming 90% chance you will have to learn Linux in some capacity anyways. - windows is easier for tool setup at the beginning, at a certain point it flips. The less consumery the tool the more the ease of use starts to favor Linux. In my experience windows has nicer GUI tools and Linux has (significantly) nicer CLI/TUI tools- windows + wsl. I write a lot of c# and play video games, so pure Linux is a nonstarter. Dual booting adds way too much friction. WSL is the best of both worlds - Linux cli + windows gui. - yes. A lot if not most server-based software runs on Linux via vms and containers. A lot of automation and build tools also run on Linux. Familiarity with the system is a huge boon. - it's good enough for me. I use it both at home and at work. Some tools I use, fwiw: git, tmux, c#, ts, python, rust, nvim, vs, vscode, docker, K8s, k9s, ansible, terraform. I use all of those in wsl except visual studio. Modern wsl networking is pretty seamless. I can run a postgres db in docker desktop, a .NET backend in visual studio and a next.js frontend in wsl and have everything talk to eachother just using localhost urls.",

I'd say that the software developers (professional or not) who do it (perhaps also) as a hobby, are the best developers. This is because the people who are the most interested in the field, are likely to be better at it than those who are not. And if you're interested in it, it is probably a hobby of yours, even if you do it professionally also.I sometimes hear the question \"Can a software developer be self-taught?\", and I'm usually like... who the f--- *isn't* self-taught in this industry? I mean, if you're interested in software development, did you seriously *wait* to start doing it until college? I started with BASIC on the Commodore 64 when I was 12 years old. Switched to C at around 17 years old. In college, I had to show our *teacher* how to implement linked lists (not because I was good, but because he was inexperienced with C). Sure, there were things I learned in college which I probably wouldn't have learned otherwise - or at least not as soon - for example, SQL, and other things which I found boring. But all the advanced stuff I learned on my own, because I wasn't going to sit around waiting for college to finally get around to teaching the stuff I was interested in.So, yes! You can definitely learn software development as a hobby only. I know things are more complex now than when I was in school, but on the other hand there are so much more resources available for free now. Back in the 90's when I got started, while the net was around, there wasn't as much content as there is now. For most things I wanted to learn, I'd order an O'Reilly book. You don't have to do that anymore.Here's what I would do if I were you. Do some tutorials, but don't *only* do tutorials. Find something simple to build - something you *want* to build. And I do mean simple - really simple at first. I started with text games like \"Guess my number\" - \"Your guess is too high, try again\", and so on. You don't need graphics. Just find something that interests you.And when you get stuck - google it, ask an AI - not to do it for you, but to *teach* you how to do it - or come here, and ask us. Since you're not trying to do this professionally, only because it's fun, you don't have to stress about it. Just have fun with it.Good luck!",

Once basics feel comfortable python for data Analysis by Wes McKinney is the practical reference for pandas and numpy which is where most of the actual data work happens.For R, R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham is genuinely the best starting point for research and visualization work also free online and builds everything around real use cases rather than theory first. The biggest thing that helped me early on was not trying to read these linearly but picking a small dataset I actually cared about and using the book to solve real questions about it.Errors stop feeling frustrating when they are blocking something you genuinely want to figure out. Since you learn better with explanation the r/learnpython community is surprisingly patient with beginner questions and you will likely get clear answers faster than waiting for a single mentor. You have a solid plan just start small and stay consistent.",

        "body": "Yeah this can get confusing, java the language is a specification, i.e. it is description of the language NOT code, not something you can run on a computer. The spec just lays out the properties of the language and what a certain command should do, etc. It is mainly maintained by Oracle, and their implementation of java is the reference jdk. Essentially oracle JDK is the canon jdk.Now anyone can actually take that reference specification and create their own version of Java and that is exactly what those distributions are. Azul, microsoft, amazon... all of those JDK were actually versions of java developed by those companies themselves. So basically the Java specification is the document that tells companies \"Hey if you want to create your own java and have it work with any java code for some version these are the stuff you need to support\" Hence there is widely varying support as well, like Azul still supports Java 8.This can get pretty complicated, there is a community process where people can vote/have a say about what features are getting added to a new version of java, and they do it by creating a JSR (java specification requests) and JEP (Java enhancement proposal).If you are just starting there is no meaningful difference you will have when using any jdk (for the same version).It will start to matter later, one of the major being in GraalVM where there are some pretty neat changes to make java more cloud native and reduce startup time and memory usage",

If you have never had that moment yet it does not mean programming is not for you it might just mean you have not yet worked on something that genuinely matters to you.

It also feels really good to be grinding away a particular problem/\"boss\" and then finally \"kill\" it. This is not to say it is like those things nor that if you like those things you ought to like programming, only that I've noticed very similar patterns of behavior in myself when engaging with the above things as I do with programming: I ignore my sleep and health, I lose track of time very quickly, and I just find myself generally neglecting everything.Which is not exactly healthy, and I could really stand to dramatically improve my work life balance, but...I think it's just that I enjoy solving puzzles mostly.

You unit test a function and you assert that when you tell it to do a series of operations and then save, it should write A, B, and then C to the storage layer.Now you change the code around and it outputs C, B, and then A to the storage layer. Your test fails because the mock was expecting calls in a specific order. Or maybe it's more complex, like now it write A and B in one transaction and then C in another transaction.It can be really hard to express in a mocking framework the idea that A, B, and C need to be saved, but the order and number of calls doesn't matter.So instead, write a \"fake\". A fake is a tiny, trivial implementation of the storage layer's interfaec, maybe it just keeps track of the objects that were saved in a HashMap or a sorted list.Instead of asserting that certain methods were called in a certain order, have your method write to the fake storage layer, then fetch the list of things written to the fake storage layer and assert that A, B, and C are in them.Now your code asserts that the end result is correct without being nearly as tightly coupled to the implementation details.

Input: it expects specific parameters of certain types and/or a specific starting state. Output: it returns a specific type and/or changes states. When choosing what to test, you want to test only public methods, whose contracts are not expected to change frequently. Do not test private methods directly unless they contain something particularly complicated. In that case, try to refactor the complicated bits into separate pure functions to reduce churn during later refactoring.You also want to design and edit your code in a way that avoids changing contracts unnecessarily. For example, add new parameters to the end of the list and make them optional, preserving the previous behavior in which they did not exist.If you find your contracts changing all the time, this is a problem with your code design. Not only does it make unit tests fragile, it makes coordination with other people and new features far more difficult than it needs to be. Read up on clean code strategies and code architectural patterns. **How to test**The most common issue I see in fragile tests is allowing state changes to fall through from test to test. You must start and stop every test at a neutral baseline state, not allowing tests to affect each other. Every test should be able to run by itself or in any random order compared to other tests. In fact, there are many test frameworks that provide a randomized run feature to help you find and prevent this form of fragility.To do unit testing correctly with non-pure functions, you must make sure to create fixtures, which are state controls. Before each test, your fixtures set up the correct state. After each test, you tear down those fixtures back to a neutral baseline. Do this using the test framework's built-in services. In class format, these are often methods named like setUp and tearDown. In spec format, they are named like beforeEach and afterEach.Each test has the following pattern:1. Set up fixtures, mocks, fakes2. If state may change, assert beginning state3. Call the function under test4. Assert returns if applicable 5. Assert state change if applicable6. Assert mocks/fakes were called as expected, including the expected parameters passed in7. Tear down fixtures, mocks, fakes",

So, one can only check that once the function has been called, the data has indeed been stored. \"This function saves the data from the given data array in atomic write operations for each element of the array from first element to last element\" as interface contract describes a different behavior to check for - here the order and amount of calls to storage indeed matters.

It doesn't mean that everything should be inside the same function from a programming language perspective, but that the user of that module shouldn't be concerned about the underlying functionality. Think of private methods, or unexported functions - you can still have lots of these.**Grokking** takes a more \"inside-out\" look at code, where Philosophy assumes that you are designing something for other programmers to use, Grokking assumes that you are in the midst of building something complicated, and have to make sure that you yourself understands it. And of course you should build it with as small functions as possible - ensuring that each function only operates at a single level of abstraction.I'm not to sure about the parameter passing - it's been a bit long since I read either, so I'm not sure what exactly they are saying. But generally, receiving parameters or objects simply to send them on to other functions is considered somewhat bad design - but of course, if you want a deep module you'd have some \"facade\"-functions that receive everything, but doesn't really do anything about it.My personal take on this is to consider whether a function is a \"worker\" or a \"delegator\" (my own nomenclature) and divide functions into those who do stuff, and those who just sends work on to a number of other functions. But if any function only calls a single other function - that might be a sign of bad design. Anyways - as always, these kind of suggestions are always suggestions, not hard and fast rules. In some cases you might actually benefit from doing the opposite ...

Analysis without numbers is only an opinion.Unless you are optimizing for a measurable metric all software \"engineering\" is basically vibes based and only opinion.The same is true for those books, they are basically opinions but that doesn't mean they are not valuable. Whether you agree with one or the other book depends on your coding style your mental model of how the code works.I haven't read the books so i don't want to talk all that much about the exact points where they contradict but i am sure that if both authors talked to each other they would agree in many areas. From the limited summary you provided i get this impression from the authors. Both authors want to structure their code in such a way that allows them to understand their code better.Ousterhout does this by creating strong modules in such a way that you only have to use the module and dont have to understand its internals. This essentially lets you ignore large part of the codebase because you just use the module.Normand does this by making very clear where change happens and what change happens. This allows you trace through the code better because you can disregard those places that don't interest you right now.Both sound like good advice to me. You don't have to exclusively pick one and stick with it. Try one out and see how you feel about it and make up your own mind. Personally, after writing a lot of Rust the Normand approach sounds much more appealing to mean than large modules, but sometimes a large module is the way to go.One think i would like to point out where i strongly disagree with Ousterhout. If you have a function with a lot of parameters, i agree that turning those parameters into objects doesnt help. All it does is that it wraps up the parameters into a slight easier to work with package. Functionally the function still has the same amount of parameters. Here is the part where i disagree; Placing those parameters into a global context doesn't help for exactly the same reason. How you have a function with a bunch of effectively global variables and all the downsides that brings. If you want to reduce the amount of parameters you have to actually reduce the amount of parameters. One way to do that is to do what Normand tells you to do.PS: Great question",

The idea there being, you don’t actually have to remember all the details of all the functions, you’ll simply know what they all do from a quick glance at the code. — The thing about these conflicting or seemingly conflicting advice is that they all come from a context which includes the authors entire personal background and the situations they’ve contended with, it’s possible you’ll never contend with the same kind of situation, and it’s possible that you’ll contend with “mutually incompatible” situations inside the same code base. In my experience that means you’re working in many layers of abstraction, and the way to solve that is to start delineating between which layer of abstraction a set of functions lives inside of, so you can apply the appropriate techniques there, and a different set of techniques in a different layer.",

        "body": "The common theme in both of these is to reduce coupling so components can be understood in isolation.Normand's philosophy in Grokking Simplicity is primarily based on his experience with Clojure (and to a lesser degree, perhaps Haskell), even though he wrote the examples in JavaScript to reach a wider audience. A similar book I can recommend is [Data-Oriented Programming](https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming), which is also about how Clojure does things, but with examples in other languages. Clojure was desinged very deliberately by Rich Hickey as a reaction to the problems of C++/Java OOP. Hickey's various talks go into more detail about his philosophy for Clojure.In Clojure, we just use (immutable) maps for most things. Keys in Clojure's maps are considered more fundamental than the mere aggregation of them, and can have a namespace independent of the map they happen to be contained in.Many Clojure functions accept and return a map. They may update a subset of the keys they care about and pass on the rest. You can test and understand these functions with just the subset, but easily compose them with functions that use a different subset. Clojure also uses \"global\" (albeit namespaced) objects for program state, but typically only a small number of them. It's often just a single atom for the whole program containing a large map, like an in-memory transactional database.",

I've been using it for years when I need a GUI toolkit and I'm not on Java / Kotlin, and it really is easy to use and fantastic. I can't recommend it highly enough.",

        "body": "This is gonna sound even more demotivating at first so sorry.... what you're struggling with right now and what AI is obviously pretty good at... is literally the easiest part of a programmers job. \"Coding\" is truly not in any way the majority of the process of coding, or a programmers job at all. If i was told tomorrow that AI is eliminating any coding my job requires writing by hand because they added magic and it now can perfectly output code, than I wouldnt worry at all. Even if in the future all we do is read code given to us by AI and fix bugs, then my ability to code makes me uniquely suited for doing exactly that over someone who only has ever used AI. And they will never invent an AI that can take in a client's requests and create their dream program, because clients are literally the dumbest people on earth and cant even describe what they want to human beings yet, and research on inventing the perfect client who doesnt change their mind after a feature is built or prioritize the complete wrong thing is lacking. As far as code is concerned, you need to practice and apply the concepts you learn, forget leet code and homework, you need to build a million small programs and do that a few hundred times, its just practice. I dont think \"ok i need to make a variable to hold a number, what was the keyword for that? Oh yeah, int, but the number is going to be a value of currency so I should use a float. Ok, now I now I want to multiply that 5 times. Whats the keyword that starts a loop? Oh yeah, for. So i need to take that variable, and type the word for. Then I need parenthesis, and inside the parenthesis need to define the starting point and I was taught to set that to 0 so Ill type that. Then I need to define where to stop looping so Ill take that first statement and set it less than 5, whoops I mean 4 because I started at 0. What was the last part of a for loop again? Oh yeah, thats how much the counter will increase so ill increase it by 1 each time. Now I cant forget to use the curly braces for my logic.......\"Thats how you first start out, and likely will think for every new keyword and bit of syntax you learn when starting out. Many \"intermediates\" still code at a snails pace that way and are convinced that an AI being able to do that instantly is doom for the entire field. Advanced developers arent smarter than you, we've just written thousands of for loops and defined a billion variables through sheer repetition and practice. I think \"it need to hold the value of money here\" and my fingers define a float variable. I want performance some action on that variable 5 times and I dont even think about the syntax, I type it. Ive done it a million times, its dont have to remember the keyword \"for\" or where the curly brackets go. Not at all because Ive planned out in my head to do that, Im not nearly smart enough to think 5 whole seconds in the future. Im dumb as shit. But because Ive used the keywords, seen the patterns, and practiced over my career everyday, it just comes out without ever thinking of the syntax.Beginners think coding is just syntax m. Syntax is the easy part, and literally anyone can memorize the syntax of a language. If you can read this comment written in English, you're proof of that, but you have 2 decades of practicing English. If you understand the CONCEPT of something like a loop or defining a variable, you've done the hard part. The part that seems hard, and the part that AI is great at is the syntax, which requires practice and repetition. As far as your concerns over the field transforming by the time you graduate... I gotta laugh, cause this field always has been seeing constant drastic shifts. Many of us here could tell of a time before Zuckerberg and his demons released the plague that is React into the web dev world, and suddenly if you didnt know React than you weren't hireable as a front end developer (according to some)... that was 10 years ago. Think about that, a whole new language and technology became almost a requirement for many jobs a decade ago, that doesn't happen in most professions.Take it even further, Javascript didnt exist like 20 years ago, if you want to work in web and you dont know Javascript you're boned. Doctors dont learn new bones every 10 years, and lawyers may learn new laws, but your countries entire consimtitution likely doesnt see drastic changes very often during the course of a lawyers entire career. There are programmers alive today that use to write code on paper. The fact that something new comes along and you get to learn it is a feature of development, not something to freak out about. At the same time, during covid, developers who were masters of a language developed by cavemen as they fought off dinosaurs were paid extraordinary amounts of money to come out of retirement and update welfare systems in the US because their skills using COBOL was desperately needed and the number of people with that skill set is very small. The last Java job a few years ago I was brought in for was working on a major upgrade of a codebase all the way up to the new and fancy Java version 8. We are currently, today, are on something like Java 24... There are so many jobs out there that will not budget major upgrades, or their systems are too critical to allow risking downtime or potential user issues, and chugging forward without the latest and greatest stuff is what the people signing the paychecks have determined is the best route forward. Corporate jobs are not startups that require microsecond code optimizations and the newest database architecture at the risk of user downtime. Hell, there's programming jobs where intellectual property or government security clearances are required and your VPN or workplace may not even allow for internet access, let alone an AI assistant reading every line of code and doing who knows what with, and your resources are the language documentation and whatever else the previous devs left for you. And in a world where even those jobs all somehow disappear and AI takes over... ok...? Use the AI tools? You want to be a programmer and build stuff, thats why im a programmer. If a client was going to pay me a ton of money to program an app, and that \"app\" was a sandwich, i wouldnt use Java, id use bread and turkey, and maybe a knife. Code is just a tool you use as a developer, if the project pays well and requires Java, ill use Java. If it pays well and uses French, I'll use French. What does it matter? If the paycheck gets signed and you get to make things, who cares what tool you use.",

At the beginning it was like a miracle, it knew everything. As the project got bigger with more files and more interdependencies, so more complex, AI started chocking. It was suggesting or doing things that made no sense, it was constantly contradicting itself etc. After also reading some news about how so many companies that went all in on AI and fired developers started losing money, because it did not bring so much value and was rather breaking code than fixing it, I got more confident. You don't have to worry about anything. They have already started hiring back developers to fix the AI mess. It's only going to get better from here. F them all and their AI, Adobe, Amazon, Google. Just focus on yourself, create your own projects for fun and the learning you achieve will just be a side effect for the future. Cheers :clinking_glasses:",

Pick one small project that feels slightly above your current level and stick with it for a few weeks. You learn more from finishing one messy project than from watching ten tutorials. The overwhelm usually comes from trying to optimize the perfect path instead of just building something imperfect.About AI, it is changing things, but it mostly shifts the leverage, not the need for people who understand systems and problem solving. Tools get better, but someone still has to define the problem, validate the output, and design how pieces fit together.

It’s frustrating because I really want to build projects, create things, and deploy them… but I feel stuck when it’s time to actually begin. Is this normal in the beginning? How did you get past that stage?TLDR: Write it down. This is normal in any creative process. It's called writer's block. What I do to get past it is to write a one paragraph \"scope\" statement. This is a general description of the problem that I am trying to solve. It's important to write it because even if you think you understand things completely, you will often find there are details about the scope that you haven't clarified yet. Writing it down makes you confront the details.Once you have the scope clearly articulated and you better understand the problem, start writing your psuedocode; just a list of steps to get there. Each step will have sub-steps, but don't focus on them yet because you will overwhelm yourself. It always helps to define things generally before jumping into the details ( I think it has to do with the way the brain structures information, but that's a different topic). If you do get lost in the details, you can just back up to your scope statement and you will find that there is something that perhaps you didn't define as well as you originally thought. An important note about AI: Yes, it's scary to see things changing so quickly. But, remember this: Things are changing for all of us. You are not alone. Stay vigilant and you will survive.",

That way you’re actually using what you learned in meaningful ways.

I got it because it was a team I worked with on my internship. Luckily my boss liked me enough to keep me. It was also immensely competitive to get the internship. Now Claude does most of my work. AI has changed everything. I feel checked out some days just because I prompt Claude instead of coding myself. My company is very AI focused and we have workshops and expectations to configure better tools and skills for Claude usage. The comment about knitting hit home for me. People aren’t gonna be programming much longer. I already have Claude pull down my card, make a plan, and even submit PR’s. It will be more management focused as we will be telling an agent to do it for us and verify results and intent. I also did the cs50 course way back, so fun :-) but that’s not what you’d be doing as a software engineer anymore. It might be hard to break into tech if you don’t have a degree just because it’s so competitive now. Maybe a boot camp would be a good option for networking and skill building if you really wanted to make this work. Maybe the coding traineeship is similar. Also, learning AI tools to help accelerate workflows.I do think that furthering your skills is a great idea and you seem to be taking it seriously. Having just been on the job hunt I know it’s a scary place to be. I relied heavily on my network and when I was interested in a role I did a lot of cold emails and messages just to chat about the company to have better resources for an interview. CS is a saturated field and I don’t regret getting into it, but I am starting to think about something like product management instead as I’m not sure how long my junior or mid level engineering roles will last.",

I come from a marketing and copywriting background. My angle is to combine copy, code, and security into one package and market to small businesses. You could do something similar. Your background is actually a great asset and a place where you should look to market yourself. An admin who can build internal tools for an office? That's valuable. An IT guy who can also build a company's website? That's a business. A good copywriter must have broad knowledge. You have three markets you understand. I'd tap into them first. I say continue to learn to code. I'm currently going through freeCodeCamp and then I'm going to go back to school to get an associate's in cybersecurity. My unique selling proposition is that I will code the website, write the copy on it that converts visitors into leads or sales, and secure the website for them. Instead of a small business needing to hire a developer, a copywriter, and eventually someone to handle security, they will have me. One person, one invoice. I've already built a website for my friend who runs a music lesson studio. As you get skills, try to apply them for other people.You may not want to do web development, but the principle can be applied to other areas. Stack skills until you can build something unique that people want. I'd highly recommend learning how to write copy. If you want me to recommend the best books on the subject, or if you want to chat more, feel free to DM me.",

I was speaking to a project manager at work today, has never written a line of code in his life, and has 20 repos on GH with some quite good apps in them. Sometimes I feel like people don't want me to say this, because then maybe it wont be true, but this is happening anyway. I honestly think programming will always be fun, but, and I could almost summon tears as I say this, nobody is really a professional knitter these days. It's something people do, because they enjoy it. If you want to build software, professionally, it's just going to be different now. Learn how to do that if the goal is employment.

Makes for a lot fewer headaches when trying to determine if we can trust the result.A lesser known detail about two's compliment is that it inverts the CY OUT flag as well. For example: 77h - 76h = ? 77h + 1 + 89h = ? (apply twos compliment) 77h + 1 + 89h = 101hThe 101h at the end ends up overflowing the adder and setting the CY OUT flag - which ends up conflicting with our definition of the overflow flag I assumed above.That explains the XOR on the CY OUT but not the CY IN. Fortinately this is just to make it so that we can use our 8 bit adder over multiple instructions to compute a sum/difference for larger numbers. It undoes the mucking about we did to make the CY OUT flag serve double duty as an overflow flag.",

        "body": "I think its important to remember that programming is a journey, not a destination! On this journey, you will constantly be learning, and honestly you're probably always going to feel like \"something is missing\". I've been programming for like 7 years now and I still always feel like a dummy.Unfortunately, there isn't really a checklist of things to know, and once you complete that checklist, you're considered a \"good programmer\".The reality is, if you want to be a good programmer, you have to actually build stuff. By doing that, you'll start to to understand what works and what doesn't. And when I say build stuff, I mean doing it on your own as much as you can. Avoid following tutorials and using AI to help you - take the time to actually break down and solve problems on your own. It will be uncomfortable, but stick with it! It gets better over time. And that's what makes good programmers - those that can break down and solve problems, not those with encyclopedic knowledge of different design patterns or frameworks.Now having said that, I think it can be useful to supplement your journey with theory. There are plenty of resources out there for learning the most common design patterns, data structures, and algorithms. I think its important to familiarize yourself with them, know what they are and when to use them, but don't dwell on that stuff too much. You will learn far more actually building stuff.So if I were you, I would try to think of something interesting to you and try to build that - maybe a game, website, or an app. It doesn't have to be something unique either; trying to recreate apps or games you enjoy is a fantastic exercise. Or maybe there is some problem you are encountering in your life - can you build something to help solve that problem?Good luck!",

It is very common to feel like something is missing because libraries and frameworks only teach you how to use a tool but they do not teach you how to think about the structure of your software. When I first started working on larger systems I realized that knowing variables and loops is just the beginning and the real skill lies in making code that other people can actually read and maintain without getting a headache.​To bridge this gap you should focus on learning SOLID principles and common design patterns which act as a blueprint for solving recurring problems in a clean way. You should also look into unit testing and the concept of decoupling because these are the things that make your software scalable and prevent it from breaking every time you add a new feature. A very helpful way to learn this is to take one of your old projects and try to rewrite parts of it using these principles so you can see the difference for yourself. Moving from just making things work to making them maintainable is what truly marks the transition to becoming a high level developer.",

        "body": "if you're interested in games you might wanna try game modding, way less of a commitment than making an entire game (if thats not what you're into, its a lot), and its a very fun way to learn coding too since you're a hobbyist, just make sure to pick an easy game for modding, unity games are easy thanks to tools like dnspy and unityexplorer, games that uses IL2CPP are harder because they require much more effort to mod since you can't revert the files back into code like you can with mono games (games that have a file called assembly-Csharp.dll, this allows you to have access to the game's guts, IL2CPP games dont have this file because the game C# code was converted into an intermediary language, and that was used to generate C++ code that is then compiled into native binaries that are harder to reverse engineer).some games have internal API's made with modding in mind, if you download a game like rainworld or haste, and you do the shabang of taking references of the game binaries into your IDE, you can then call most of the game's internal functions and have access to it's events so you can hook your custom logic more easily, those are very modder friendly gamesor you have something like silksong, the code is messier and you only have access to the few things the devs left exposed, in these cases you gotta patch the game with a lib like harmony, harmony is a godsend because it allows you to add stuff to the game's internal classes and functions by patching them just before you boot up the gameand they're not mutually exclusive you can use the modding API and harmony to achieve any behaviour you want, for example, in rainworld the AI is quite complicated but there are spots that allow for some basic swap of values with minimal effort, managed to make an npc type that is made to hate my character in any situation, friendly, by simply swapping stuff around, then i tried to shoot higher with a mod for downloading music and kind of making it interact with the game's systems, it kind of works, i just didnt like the way i coded it in the beginning but the fact that i hate the code i wrote back then tells me i can do better so maybe i'll rewrite it someday...but thats the magic, you have instant feedback to whatever you do, in haste i simply made so the character had infinite energy to spend while on the lobby and that worked flawlessly first try thanks to how much the modding API helps simply having context for logicBUTif you're interested in robotics too, there is a game called plasma, that goes pretty deep into making stuff with logic blocks, math and some conveniences, i managed to make a car with a bunch of stuff, i've seen a guy on youtube make a guided missile using some insane maths, and the game allows lua scripts so if the blocks feel restrictive you can try using scripts",

You start seeing systems, inputs and outputs, constraints, edge cases. That mindset transfers to mechanical design, controls, simulation, data analysis, almost anything technical.On the AI point, it is similar to calculators in math. The people who benefit most from AI tools are the ones who understand what is happening under the hood. If you can reason about logic, data structures, and basic algorithms, you will use those tools better rather than being replaced by them.Also, you do not need to decide your life direction right now. Treat coding like a low cost experiment. Spend a few months building small things. Automate something in your daily life. Analyze some data. If you find yourself losing track of time while doing it, that is signal.The bigger win here might not be the skill itself. It is the habit of choosing deliberate practice over passive scrolling. That compounds in any field.",

And this problem arise when we try to find what do we love,what do we enjoy, and what we are interested in .There are may reason why this thought hit one.But truth is that you don't have to be interested or else other in order to do it,am I right?Just like we listen song when feel bored and there is nothing like interesting thing in here,Just live every moment, don't ask how because there is not same answer for everyone just find your ownAnd most importantly you were saying that you are learning coding as side hobby so keep it that way You don't have to push yourself because when we try something forcefully then it becomes worse and also try this method while studying or learn coding Take 1 conceptAnd study it like kid! Stay curious Because you don't know computer science fully so you have. Many mystery stuff to uncover And if feel something easy then make it relatable to thing you already know or like Eg. String data type Eww :nauseated_face:,what the hell is string?HuhSo it's basically sentance that we write in coding?Nah man!! They call this thing an string,lol :face_with_tears_of_joy: I know it since childhood ..,...........My personal advice:If you are learning it as hobby then keep it in that way .You don't need to follow any course or strict roadmap to learn itWhen curiosity hit just drive in randomly and if stuck then solve it and do it again And by doing this you don't have to stay consistent because it will come automatically and you will become addicted to it. Your response is much matter because I have gone through same phase,and I am just giving my personal advice, I can help you further if needed and also note that if this don't workout for you then it's good because you have other ways to try. :saluting_face:",

Turns out that very few companies actually need to hire random bachelors degree holders or lower that learned a bit of Python and SQL that have no specific industry expertise i.e. the overwhelming majority of people looking into the field.  The few people who do this work are highly specialized and highly educated and would never be caught dead taking a udemy course.The technical barrier was perceived to be a lot lower than it is for swe so it got absolutely flooded in the last five years even more than SWE has. Add universities everywhere opening data science bachelors degrees, bootcamps, certs, self learners to the mix and the uncertainty of AI on top of the movement away from hiring generic \"data scientists\" and the field is a total mess.  All this hype for an industry that doesn't even exist in its former state anymore.Many grifters that shilled DS have moved onto AI.",

I took a look at what they do and how they do it and never got asked about those in the interview so I though: \"They probably dont use it too much...\" WRONG! they actually used it but it was not my job to do everything from scratch, most of things were already done and only required small changes depending on the situation. And what do I do when I have to touch something I dont know about? I look for help, I ask people close to me if they have done something similar, get an hour of their time and learn from the experience.

Break down that work into pieces you can work with junior guys on and execute\" is usually what I'm working on now.One caveat I'll add is that in the consulting space I'm doing a lot more customer/client facing work.

Look at it as a menu: sandwiches, soup, rice porridge, mac'n'cheese, cutlets, pasta, etc. Will you be eating all of these every day? Nope. Should you be able to make these? Better be (otherwise your food choices will be quite poor). Perhaps some days you are just picking a sandwich, some tea, and that's it. Your day is busy and you have no time to eat. Another day you have whole day for yourself. You can cook whatever you want in the kitchen. The menu changes. Daily tools you are using as a software engineer, also change, depending on the task, depending on the service, etc.What do I do?1)I write new features to the service we are developing and maintaining. For example in addition to being able to buy a ticket via an app one can buy also via an SMS (for some elderly who do not use smartphones, or whatnot).2)I debug why the stuff does not work or why it behaves weird. Today I had to figure out why a system that is expected to check the uptime of our service is sending empty notifications. Where is the text?3)I review the code that my team mates wrote. Code review. To catch some nonsense. To turn attention to some missing business cases. To suggest some improvements. etc.4)I do technical analysis and help our business analyst. He does not write the code. Reading code is difficult for him. So, he comes with his less-IT-questions to me and I provide answers to him. For new tasks for us to work on.5)I improve our infrastructure. Like this uptime checking service I mentioned in 2). Today I set it up because otherwise it would be more difficult for us to know when something just does not work at all.6)Attend meetings. May it be discussing new tasks, discussing some big problem in production environment, discussing team events, or something else.7)Write documentation. Not comments in the code but documentation for the business people for them to know how the stuff works and what it does.8)Do technical analysis for new projects. The stuff that software architects do. Come up with a structure for the project, suggest different solutions (with pros and cons), come up with the main idea what and how the project should do, discuss with the business side, etc.9)Onboard new members. A new guy like you comes. He has 1000 questions. I try to create and improve our onboarding manual so the new guy can follow it and hopefully in the end he has a working local environment and can start working on his first task.10)Update libraries and frameworks. Fix vulnerabilities.11)Drink tea and scroll in the Internet while the system does whatever it does with my code changes and I have to wait meanwhile. (e.g. wait behind the running pipeline)12)Do some manual testing of the code I wrote. Before I pass it to the QA. Sure, there are unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests and such, but not everything can be tested and sometimes environment differences come into a play. So, I will check that the business use cases of my task are covered. A sanity check.13)Write these tests that I mentioned in 12)14)Think, think, think. A whole lot of my time goes into thinking. We do not type nonstop like some haxormen.",

You write it to make it work, once it works you re write it to make it less messy, then rewrite to make it easier to read, and so on. How many rewrites? How many does it take for you to look at it and go ”now that’s I’m satisfied about” :) As you get more experience, you will get a feel for it…. And start writing less messy code naturally. Refactoring though (rewriting to makenit more clear) never fully goes away… and that’s a good thing.Later on you might go back to some of those old projects and rewrite them to update them and keepnthe running for example…",

Some will say any code chunk that needs to be re-usable. Some will say any distinct \"unit\" of intent. Some will say any time your code becomes unreadable or inconvenient to work with. Others will say whenever the moon is red and mercury is in retrograde. My typical approach is \"whatever makes the code self-documenting\"; if I am reading code and the intent of the function becomes unclear or disagrees with its function name, the function is likely either too long, doing too many things, difficult to test, unreadable, or unmaintainable. Not necessarily all 5, but still. If I start thinking \"oh, I should add a code comment here\" I first ask if it should be a function, allowing the function name to describe intent instead of a comment. If I start copy-pasting code in many places, I start asking if it should be a function so that the code within that function can be understood once rather than in each location. If my function is 400 lines, I might (not always) think making it a 40 line function that makes descriptive calls to other functions is more readable (sometimes it won't). If I go to test my function and part of it is a pain to cover, moving that difficult-to-cover chunk to its own unit makes testing both functions easier.With practice, you'll get a better feel for when something should be its own thing. And people will still disagree with whatever you choose lol",

Then whoever reads your code reads the function names and doesn't have to read code to understand what you are doing The general idea is to have 3 layers inside your file. The API layer where the public functions are and are calling other functions, the private middleware that has mostly calls to other functions in it, and the private low level where it is functions with mostly code.

This is called the \"DRY\" principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). This centralizes logic that improves both maintainability and testability.**2. Concept extraction:**Extract code that represents a single step you could describe with a short comment. Example: # Huge block or multiple blocks of code to register a user ... ...As this code performs and clearly definable task, we can improve the structure and readability by bringing it together in a function: def register_user(user): ...But then we look at what that function does, we see that it does multiple things: # big block of validation logic # big block of password hashing # big block of database insert # big block of email sendingHere we have 4 blocks of code, each of which could be written as functions, which makes the logic more readable than one huge block of code. def register_user(user) validate_user(user) hash_password(user) db_insert(user) notify_admin()---**Category B - Treating Functions as Values:**This is conceptually different from the other two, and mostly applies to more advanced code, so I'll only mention it briefly for completeness.Sometimes we need to treat functions as first class values, where the value represents a behaviour. A common example is when binding behaviours to button presses we may pass a function object as an argument.Here's a Tkinter example: button = tk.Button(root, text=\"Click Me\", command=function_to_run)In this example, the function isn't extracted for readability, it's because the API requires a callable.Other examples include closures, decorators, async tasks and more.---A final note about \"not overdoing it\".Functions are mostly about reducing complexity - they are a means rather than a goal. Avoid extracting trivial one-line wrappers that add no clarity or reuse, (unless required, for example by an API).Bad Example: def print_result(result): print(result)This adds an extra layer of indirection without improving readability, reducing duplication, or creating a meaningful abstraction.However there can be cases where wrapping a one-liner is justified. for example:Suppose you have this one-liner scattered in your code: if user.age >= 18 and user.email_verified: ...then we can wrap the condition into a function: def is_eligible(user): return user.age >= 18 and user.email_verifiedthen use it in each place that it is needed: if is_eligible(user): ...This is a good application of \"DRY\".",

Learn fundamentals first to the point where you can read and understand any code the AI spits out, then start adding it to your workflow. You'll use AI much more effectively when you actually know what to ask for.",

And no matter how hard you study or what you accomplish, one person can’t know every language or navigate legacy code (in a single day) you have to maintain. AI gets a lot of hate, but…just being honest, you either stay on top of it or lose your job. You WILL learn the fundamentals and more because it’s the smart way to go. AI isn’t something you need to become a slave to. It’s something you use so you don’t get stuck. I’m still very much a beginner. I’m pretty solid with Python, but I’m not good with flask or SQLite, which is something I need at the moment. So I need a lot of help in that area along with building a web UI. My main problem with using AI is that AI isn’t really good for niche, edge-case applications. So I spend more time prototyping so I can capture the logic of what I want to do at every step along the way before writing the prompt. The flask route seems really straightforward to me, but I have to connect overything over HTML, JS, and CSS. For me, AI has really democratized programming and allowed me to do things I couldn’t do before. I can get stuff done and still learn as I go. AI hasn’t been all that helpful in troubleshooting. My personal rule is AI has three chances to get something right. If I can’t get what I need after three prompts, it’s tome to break down the logic and code in smaller steps.",

Where AI can be useful is bouncing ideas or questions off it. If you don't understand something, then you can use an LLM to help you gain that knowledge. Maybe you wrote a thing and it all kind of fell apart and you're not sure why - an LLM can give you some guidance.Don't become dependant on the models. If you find yourself asking the same questions over and over, that's a sign you're not retaining the knowledge. Treat the models like an interactive version of Stack Overflow that won't be snarky and lock your questions.As long as you are internalising the knowledge through actual practice writing code, then LLMs are just another tool you can use. Don't ever ask them to implement features for you. Use them as tools to get instant feedback on the code you write and your understanding of concepts. Also remember they can be stupid and wrong! That's also an important step in learning - when you realise you understand something better than an LLM, or some bozo on the internet :grinning_cat:",

There are many tools that need to be expanded or maintained or even new tools to be created that attach to the current ecosystem of a certain company.

Enterprise companies need .NET devs constantly, and the barrier to entry is more predictable: learn C#, build CRUD apps, get hired. AI/ML has a higher ceiling but also a higher floor you need solid math, Python, and often a portfolio of projects just to get noticed. honest take for 2026: learn the fundamentals well in whatever excites you more (motivation matters a LOT when you're grinding through the hard parts), but make sure you understand how AI tools work regardless of which path you pick. Every .NET dev is going to need to integrate AI features soon, and every ML engineer needs to ship production code. The best position is someone who can do both, even if you specialize in one.",

If you want one topic from that class - [de Morgan’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws)As far as syntax, it’s something that you just need to get used to. If you’re running into the same syntax errors, don’t fix the problem right away, try to understand why you need indentation, colons.Syntax changes from one language to the next but the fundamentals generally apply. If you need help debugging, honest to god, you can do it on paper or a white board. I graduated from Uni not that long ago and my first 2 programming classes required us to take exams with pen and paper, so we had to learn how to walk through the code without fancy debugging software. It’s something that really worked well for me.Track your variables, update the variables as you walk through each line of code, keep track of what variables are in scope, etc. This should make using a debugger a bit more intuitive. Also, some of the debugging functions were confusing to me when I started:* Put a breakpoint where you want to stop the function* step over means move to the next line of code* step into means step into the current line of code; ex. if this is a function call, now you’ll be walking through each line in that called function",

But I also know plenty of developers who prefer getElementById, because they don't have to remember to add the '#' symbol every time. And then they only switch to querySelector for more complicated things.*Btw: I love all the arguments about one being \"faster\" than the other - and I'm willing to bet that if selecting elements is the bottleneck that hampers performance in an app, then you probably have bigger problems than that! Also, I'd like to see an example - a real world example, not a fake made up example of selecting 4 quadrillion elements - of one being slower or faster than the other :)*",

We have our own governanced AI so we can use it as well for making manual tasks quicker. I've noticed when it comes to stuff like data science AI is much more utlised compared to cybersecurity. I can't comment on full stack but I do know people who do full stack and learnt how to use AI APis and creating chat bots which has made them more relevant and not left behind. So id say it's up to you but imo AI is least likely to replace cyber compared to full stack due to cyber always being about protecting people's data and no matter how governed AI is people are still skeptical to let AI do the job.",

That's not a question of \"too many\" that's a question of whether you are choosing the right abstractions. Don't repeat yourself. If you find you're making several effectively identical or similar classes, then consider whether some other approach might not be better.Do you need a separate class for each ability? Maybe!

In C code ai often writes something like: buffer[received_bytes] = '\\0'; It's making sure that there's always null terminating character at the end of received message string. It would seem correct at first but the received bytes variable could have a value of the size of buffer (e.g 1024) So we need one more byte in the buffer to accommodate the final null termination.

If you put a static variable in a class, then only that class can access that symbol.What doesn't have linkage are REFERENCES. And that's what you're talking about.

If the spec calls something ill formed or undefined, there is no overriding that. Undefined means the compiler cannot prove the code is correct - and there are lots of scenarios that's true. The language therefore relies on YOU to be personally responsible and write correct code.And here's the thing about UB - the compiler is free to make assumptions. For example: int i = j + 1; if(i < j) { // Check for overflow?The compiler is free to deduce that this is impossible - because overflow is undefined. So the conditional code block can be completely removed.Though your hardware may support signed integer overflow, that cannot usurp the language spec. The compiler is going to generate machine code that operates under that assumption; the rest of your program can be incorrect.",

        "body": "For me it helped to have recursion explained from different angles and at different levels.I learned about different aspects of recursion in different courses.For example in computer technology I learned how memory may be allocated on the stack for a function call (very low level, ie allocating memory/setup a \"blue print\" of the variables and the pointer to the next instruction in the function), in math I learned how to use induction to prove recursive algorithms and in a programming course I learned how different tree-algorithms may be implemented by changing the order of visiting the legs and the tree-node.I think the key to understand recursion is to understand how a function may call itself (because how variables and instructions pointers can be separated from the actual set of instructions under the hood) and that by visiting and combining the different parts of a tree in different order you get different behaviours (on a higher level).",

Take on scope, take more ownership, get results, make impact. Fuckin hamsters on treadmills is all we are. On the other hand, thankful to have a job that puts food on the table and more, I guess. Also maybe not unique to CS so I think the game is to really find meaning and acceptance outside work whenever possible.",

Meanwhile in tech, the top 10% can roughly or nearly achieve that (big tech senior position).Even if not big tech, the middle division is still pretty good pay compared to most other industries and jobs available for white collar professionals.",

I think beyond being a \"bad\" engineer, just being insufferable to work with has a much higher cost today than 5 years ago.On the flip side, one of our best engineers turned down a 75% pay raise that was thrown at him because he didn't want to lose his work life balance and go into an office 5 days a week.

        "body": "My honest opinion is that there are 3 categories of senior engineers:The good ones are fine, if not better off.The ones in the middle, your average engineer is no longer OK.The poor ones are absolutely screwed.The good engineers who spend time being curious about their work, keeping their resume up to date, understanding what a good resume looks like, knows how to properly prep and understands the interview process will get a job easily. They know how to market themselves and how to fit in well in a new job. Getting a job is a simple process to them.The weaker engineers who want to get a job, cruise, hope for an easy paycheck, can't contribute to technical discussions well, and feel entitled to a job because they have 8 years on the job? They will not survive without reflection and adjustments.But now the average senior engineers are in a new market. During the COVID mass hirings they were golden, they were in the \"good\" half by default. You could get the job done and that was great. Unfortunately, the bar has been raised where that's no longer the case. You *need* to be a good engineer or by default you are a poor one.At my work, I have seen the engineers I loved working with get a new, higher paying role just because it fell on their plate in a LinkedIn message and they decided to go through the process, nail it in 3 weeks, and put in their 2 weeks notice shortly after. Similarly, I have seen the engineers I detest working with, constantly argue and are not fun to be around, make the same mistakes constantly, etc. complain about how the market is dead and they can't find a new position anywhere.Who you are and where you fall in these categories is really up to you. I think if you are a senior engineer, you have the resources all available to be a good hire. It just requires a lot of effort - if you don't understand it, it won't work out.",

There's a lot of good junior or mid level engineers that need some guidance to deliver but do a great job and will grow into a strong senior or staff level engineer. Being able to deliver not just code is very important though. Being familiar with the system architecture is also very important- Being able to lead a team and mentor/motivate teammates that work under them. When the scope of a project increases, there will be a point where one person isn't enough to deliver. Since coding is the easiest part there is a point where work is figuring things out and delegating and making sure things are getting done. In the end it's all about solving problems with code that is scalable. When projects get larger it's necessary to work with other teams and more teammates to deliver.",

Everyone who doesn't drop what they're doing and switch to AI coding will be completely unemployable and out of the industry in 3-6 months.2. AI assisted coding isn't ready for primetime yet. It leads to maximum technical debt, with repeated code and subtle errors. After awhile, the AIs start adding 2 new bugs for every bug or feature it adds. AI only works for the simplest of tasks.I don't see why \"YOU MUST URGENTLY LEARN AI CODING!\" is a thing. If it really does work and is effective, why should it matter if I switch now or I switch in 2-5 years, when the AIs will be a lot better and using them will be a completely different workflow?I also wonder how much of (1) is coming from people pushing AI hype or who work at AI firms, and how much of (2) is coming from people who actually worked on complex projects that AIs can't handle.",

See Gmail as a reference. The issue is: 85% of your engineers are going to do nothing and that creativity leash is basically just free hang out time.

I would say it varies a lot by company and even team.Some companies hire more “worker bee” type developers who are focused on implementation then lean on PMs or other business functions to decide the details of what to build. Others expect developers to make more choices about what to build and do the building. Those companies also tend to pay more because they expect more from developers. It does seem to be loosely correlated with how structured their processes are because if different people are making decisions than doing the implementation, process will generally be necessary to facilitate the coordination. The most obvious marker of this in my experience is the number of PMs or BAs or whatever they call them. If you’re evaluating a job offer and trying to understand how much autonomy you’ll have, look at how many of these people there are in comparison to engineers. The more there are, the more of that kind of work they will have to handle.",

Try to weather the storm, maybe AI turns out to be less apocalyptic than we all thought and everything ends up okay.2. Try to pivot into something sort of tech adjacent. Someone will need to test the AI slop apps of the future or review the code they generate or whatever sad new jobs come about in the AI era. No guarantee these jobs are great, or that I could get one, or that they'll even exist. 3. Start over. I've spent the last 20 years building tech products that have by any measure made the world a worse place. Maybe this time pick a 2 career that actually does some good. 25 years is still a long time so while it feels too late to make a change, maybe it's not.",

Im a senior security engineer/GRC. I don't work from home, but i start at 08:30 and finish at 16:00 except for friday that i finish at 15:30 instead. So work-life balance is actually pretty good. I mostly don't carry work with me at home and i have full afternoon/night with my two toddlers. Really quality time i would say.Here enter a big-4 company. They offered me a job at a Senior Associate 3 level (whatever that is) for 2600 per month x14 tho, with ticket restaurant benefit and iPhone + unlimited data/calls etc and a hybrid working model 1 office 9 home (so 1 every two weeks). It was really tempting offer and it was a career upgrade for sure but big-4 companies have these flexible 9-to-9 work schedules haha, working weekends and they told me they encourage the employees to close the laptop at 18:30 if possible. I rejected the offer. Mental health and time with family are way more valuable than grinding for managers. That is my take. I might be a loser but it is what it is",

People know it has value, but they don't yet know how much value.The improvements that companies keep making, makes it seem like the potential value is much, much higher than it actually is. Right now, everyone knows it is not as valuable as it is valued at, which is leading to the intense speculative bubble we're seeing. It is the belief in what it will do later that keeps the bubble so strong; if several PhD level papers come out showing we're not even close... that will probably kill the bubble.And of course, that probably won't happen for a while. The folks who would do such research are also largely funded by the people who need the bubble to continue.This is normal for an immature technology. What is NOT normal, is thinking the technology is going to replace everyone, without actually proving it can, and everyone hedging their bets on this happening anyways.Companies like Apple are probably going to be the big winners at the end of this. They're not firing their teams and replacing them with unproven AI. And at this point in time, it is looking more and more like AI usage just shifts the bottleneck further down the line rather than eliminates it (as far as automated programming goes).Since the changes it makes can be breaking and it has no accountability, a lot of devs are being forced into code review for thousands upon thousands of changes. It is likely to lead to unstable software, with limited ability to diagnose and maintain, even if companies increase headcount. You just cannot fit the context of the changes into your head fast enough to tell when the AI is doing something dumb.As such, the workflow we're accustomed to is not very accommodating to AI autonomous changes... until it can actually take over dev jobs, which is still a long time away.Site Reliability Engineers and Cybersecurity developers are going to feast.",

Keep in mind that a lot of recruiters are not very literate in terms of tech (as weird as that may be), and so to them it looks like a lot of jargon. I'd really suggest formatting your bullet points like this: (1) what you did, (2) in layman's terms what impact it had (business metrics here a plus), and (3) optionally mention the tech used. Second, unless those non-work projects you did are very meaningful or impactful, then I'd suggest getting rid of them and use the space to add more bullet points to your work experience. Anyone off the street can create a school-level project with AI. Business impact is key. Last, keep applying and practicing. Take whatever you can get. Don't be picky. Target smaller companies.",

As for people talking about parallel agents and 50 thousand MCP servers and gas town and ralph loops, etc, etc. I think that’s mostly just grift. There is definitely an AI-maximalist side of the internet that rewards content showing ridiculous overusage of AI. When I’m working on something it often feels like I’m at my cognitive limit trying to stay on top of what is getting built, validating it, debugging, and planning next steps, it’s hard to know what I’d do with all that extra stuff, but maybe that’s a skill issue, idk.",

We aren't all some super special genius talents that are irreplaceable. Anyone who has been in the industry long enough knows how much low skill busy work there is and has watched it slowly be replaced. First it moved to junior devs, then offshoring, and now AI.It doesn't seem like much initially, but when 4 devs can do the work of 5 that's potentially 20% of all of us that are out of a job...and it's only getting more efficient.There's also the related issue of junior dev positions evaporating at a rapid pace, which will fuck the industry super hard unless AI really pans out in the next decade or so. Junior devs were always a net negative for at least a year and after that still mostly only handled busy work. Now that AI can rip through that it simply doesn't make economic sense for most companies to have junior devs on payroll, especially with retention rates so low.We live in a society that is capable of rapid technological advancement, but setup so that advancement almost exclusively benefits the wealthy.

Strong would be pushing into staff level responsibilities, e.g. multiple simultaneous senior-level projects under your purview, or collaborations w/ multiple teams well outside your team's scope, org-wide or cross-org strategy/vision, etc.",

I didn’t keep perfect track but I probably sent about 100 applications got 3 phone screens and 1 interview loop which I got the role. It’s a salary that some of the more entitled members here would laugh at but I am in a lcol area in Canada and have enjoyed the job so far. I did minor tailoring of my resume for each post but when I got an interview I studied harder than I have in my life. Also I made sure to get my behaviourals down, I was actually told after being hired that my technical answers were lacking but they felt that the mindset I presented at the interview was what they were looking for. I also did not lie or cheat at any point during the cycle, I see that recommended to people who are early career and it baffles me how they think they can trick their senior engs that will be interviewing them",

Was about to give up but I happened to be in the right city at the right time and applied for a Senior role with only 1.5 YoE. Bombed the System Design interview as well. The only right thing that I think I did, was clearly explain my thought process thorough out the coding interview, and communicated that I respected other people’s time and would keep the good of the collective team above my own interests.Long story short, currently working at Palo Alto Networks. Pay is amazing, team is amazing. I am the junior most in a team of like 10 engineers, each with 9-10 years of experience. I learn a lot just by talking to them. My manager is also pretty supportive. The best part is that I don’t have to starve or ration food anymore. I can eat whatever, whenever I want :)",

Reach out to alums from your schools and ask for a coffee chat and try to build rapport and then ask for a referral. At big companies they are usually happy to do it because they get a bonus if you're hired. Then for actually passing the interview, I would rely on the advice of others who have commented. I got offers at Microsoft and Amazon but I used AI to clear them. Before I started using AI, I was getting zero offers because I feel like a third of candidates are secretly using AI and they are the only ones getting hired.",

I think it's bad for companies to do things like that, but it unfortunately happens. On the flip side, I had the same thing happen to me at my company as yourself. In my case, I suspect that they were waiting for another person to turn the offer down before sending me my offer in writing, but it's all speculation.

It may take a LONG time to pay off (jobs are especially hard to get right now) but eventually it will succeed. Hopefully you'll find a position that is better than this one.In the meantime, there might be ways for you to work around the problem within your current organization. This advice will be appropriate for some companies and not for others so consider your situation before applying it.Sounds like you've effectively been \"demoted\" by being assigned less valuable work. Also sounds like you aren't being given enough work to actually challenge you (\"haven’t touched a line of code in 2.5 months\" \"just got assigned the most absurdly simple defect\"). Maybe you should go ahead and \"promote\" yourself without asking for permission.Figure out who at the company WANTS the system rebuild that you thought was a good idea (\"rebuilding the existing native application with my language of expertise that I’ve worked with & loved my entire career\"). Maybe this is a product manager outside of the tech world, maybe it's a VP who doesn't have the clout to get things moving. (If there isn't anyone who wants this done... maybe it shouldn't be!) Talk with this person. Say that you aren't being challenged in your current position and you have some free time. Offer to build what they are looking for as a \"Proof of concept\". Invest some time and just BUILD the darn thing (it's amazing how much faster a \"skunkworks\" project can go. If you succeed, maybe you end up as the tech lead for the project (which would consist of releasing the \"POC\" that you built).As I said, it's not the right solution for all companies, but it CAN be effective in some places. And it doesn't sound like you are especially worried about annoying your current manager.Sometimes, the way to stop being a mid-level SWE is to stop behaving like a mid-level SWE and start behaving like a senior SWE.",

I didn’t do much here because they would fight tooth and nail against anything changing for any reason4. (2021) Catering company. Was great, but might have just been the time (2020-2021 range)5. (2023) big big big company. Hated every second here and felt like I couldn’t do a single thing right. Lasted 1.5 years. Not uncommon6. (2025) small company.

Promotions from Associate to mid and mid to Senior require only a \"budget confirmation\" in business justification, there is a maximum amount we can spend on promotions each year. In my experience, we've never exceeded that budget so these promotions always pass their business justification.Starting with senior to staff, then staff to principal and principal to senior principal the business justification becomes stricter. Staff is defined as a role that works \"across teams\", usually within an org. Principal is inter-org work and sr. principal is company level work. We must justify why we need individuals operating in those roles. For Staff it's not too bad, we produce a list of they type of work and project work that requires tech/engineering focus aligning teams (usually building something global/working directly with internal customer teams etc etc).Principal and Sr. Principal things get much harder. There's really not that much work at that level. My org of 100 has one principal, who focuses on cross-org database work, and one principal who is working torwards sr. Principal by focusing on aligning our entire orgs tech with other org tech leads. I really have no need for more than that.I have about 10 Staff engineers however, some recently promoted into that role from Senior. (We do a lot of inter-team work/support). They are all told if they want to make principal, it is /unlikely/ they will get the role within our current org (we'd either have to double in size, not likely, or one of the two principals would have to leave and require a backfill).For those staff engineers that want to \"grow\" by title change I encourage my managers to do several things. First, keep a constant eye on opening roles in the company, anything principal they should consider having their staff report apply to it and be considered. Likewise there are some other career paths, such as engineering manager (if they want to stop focusing on being an Individual contributor) or even other leadership roles (technical program manager etc). And lastly, yes, it is not a crime if my managers support their staff engineers in their next career step outside the company (referrals, helping be a career mentor, assessing other jobs etc). All of this is to say, yes, at some point, a \"promotion\" must consider business need, and that business need should get harder the more senior the role is. Managers should focus on the realities and be aware that sometimes growing people means having them leave the team or company, but it should happen at more senior levels.If your company doesn't have good definitions of what various levels of engineers should be doing for the company, I'd start there.",

Now, early career, you can generally show \"yes, we need person at L+1, we expect our L to grow into that role\", but major career transitions (Senior, or Staff) generally require a business need.In many companies, this is actually hidden by the modern practice of retrospective promotion, where you promote people after they demonstrate a sustained performance of L+1. Since there was L+1 work for them to do to demonstrate that, it is a lot easier to demonstrate a need. But it is also normal for people to be in a position where there are no career growth opportunities for them on their current team, or even at their current company. After all, if the company has a CTO, and you are ready to take on a CTO role, you are probably going to have to leave. A good manager helps employees realize that and make that transition.Think about it this way, if you tried to open up a new headcount for a Senior or Staff level role, would you be able to justify it with the work your team has to do? If you could, you can make the case for a promotion. If you can't, then people looking to go to Senior or Staff need to leave your team anyway, because even if you did promote them, their reviews would inherently be awful because they would have no ability to demonstrate performance at level.",

Is there a need for someone to increase the scope of work they’re during and provide further technical value to a line of business? If so, make that argument and push for a promotion. If not, that’s just an honest assessment of the business’ needs. The way I see it, if a team’s responsibilities evolve then the needs of the team change and it’s up to the manager to facilitate that change.Think of it this way:You have a business and all you sell are apples and the market only has a demand for 100 apples a year. Would you care if your employee was skilled enough to sell 100 vs 1000 apples? Probably not, right?

        "body": "Every company only promotes based on need. It's just that some grow fast enough or have enough turnover to justify the high amounts of need such that engineers of a certain level can be promoted based primarily on merit. The farther you go up the ladder, every company will eventually hit a level where the need simply does not exist at all times for everyone.If that level is at very low junior levels, I'd be more worried you're in a company that is very focused on cost savings compared to growth. That's just not the kind of place to be if you or your reports are primarily focused on professional growth.What you describe is the norm for most jobs outside of growth tech companies. You climb the ladder by applying for a different job that you must compete with others for, not by growing in place like is common in tech.If you want to be an ethical manager, you should be upfront with your reports about this. If you can make it happen, helping your reports find those roles elsewhere in the company where they can be successful is amazing, but that is often thankless work in situations like this. It can pay off for you down the road though, because those same reports may open doors for you on other teams or at other companies in the future.A lot of managers in this situation make the short sighted choice to say what they need to their reports so that they won't leave, even if it's detrimental to them. I get where they are coming from, but it rarely ends well long term.",

        "body": "Spent 6.75 years in my first job out of college in a defense contractor, and now am making my leave out of the defense life next month. It really depends on how much friction you want your next job search to be. It's easy to remain in the defense ecosystem, especially if you have a clearance, because getting interviews/callbacks from other defense contractors is much easier after having a proven track record in defense. It's also a very comfortable job outside of the work aspect; a 9/80 work schedule is game changing if you are in company that does that and the slow work pace can be relaxing. I honestly don't think I'll ever attain that same level of WLB anywhere else outside of defense after this. I will definitely consider defense again when I am older and ready to just coast to retirement. I think these factors are huge reason people get stuck in defense; it's what I've seen from my older, high tenured colleagues do and people that have left my company to go to other defense companies.I will say that defense is varied and even teams within the same company can have wildly different directives and experiences. I was fortunate to be in a team that got to do really cool stuff that also had a more relaxed pace, and I still got to learn a lot about SWE at the same time. Some of my colleagues that got placed into the big money maker team in my company were working left and right on different projects every month from what it seemed like. My recommendation is that you give this a fair shot for 1-2 years and make an adjustment if needed.You may actually enjoy the work you do and discover that your team isn't as slow or not productive for learning as you may initially thought, or you completely hit the mark on your initial assessment. As a general life advice, use this opportunity to really isolate what you want from a job, and align your next actions to directly support that goal and don't compromise it just because it's easy. If you want out, commit to finding a job that fits your desired career track or work towards joining a top company that can give you that clout you need to work at your end goal role. Going for what is easy to get is how you really get stuck in a niche.",

I also moved to a LCOL area which helps a lot. Work expectations are minimal compared to private sector jobs. If you are even an average developer, you'll be above average in defense. Shit is the definition of easy mode.I do not need to worry about offshoring, at least for now.

The private sector is fucked to say it plainly.I'm nearly 40 now and too sick and tired of walking the layoffs minefield. I was only laid off once, but even when you survive, there is always someone you know who doesn't and that eats away at your morale.

There are plenty of resources online to learn at your own pace, but if you don't want to teach yourself then that's not a good option.\"Obviously I'm not a vibe coding monkey since I have the theoretical and programmer brain from my CS degree\" Gunna be honest, this is sounds super hypocritical to say right before you talk about how your old major project was completely vibe coded. Maybe you would learn something if you had to build the same project without Claude. It's super easy to understand code especially code that Claude writes. It's a whole lot harder to think of that logic and write code from the ground up. Think about how easy it is to read a book and how much more difficult it would be to write a book.From the sounds of it, it looks like you don't like CS but kept going with the degree and now don't want the last 4 years to be a waste. If I were you, I would really consider what you want your job to look like. I only have 2 YOE and I spend my days sitting in a cubical doing full stack development. In this time, I have learned that real world coding is very different from the fun projects I had during college, so now I'm getting a master's to pivot into a data analytics field. I had a couple data driven projects during this time and realized it was way more enjoyable. However, I also know that I don't have the discipline to self-study without the fear of an exam or project deadline so that's why I am getting the masters.Ill end with this, you're not alone at all. Over half of my friends that graduated with a CS degree went into a different field that involved no coding. One is in audio/visual, one is training to be a pilot, another a scada engineer. While yes, it's a bit demoralizing to pivot a career right after graduation, it's much better than being stuck in a role you hate.",

I'd do both in parallel — projects carry more weight in interviews.Your SWE background is actually an advantage for data analytics that most people underestimate. You already understand data structures, can read/write code, and know how systems produce the data that analysts work with. That context is genuinely rare. For the pivot, SQL is the most critical immediate skill — probably 80% of day-to-day data analyst work is SQL. The good news: with a CS degree you'll pick it up fast. Focus on window functions, CTEs, and aggregations with GROUP BY/HAVING since those show up constantly in analytics work. A couple of practical suggestions:\\- Practice on real datasets (Kaggle, Mode Analytics public datasets, or the Google BigQuery public datasets)\\- Build a portfolio of 2-3 analysis projects that tell a story with data, not just queries\\- Learn the basics of one BI tool (Tableau, Power BI, or Looker — depends on what's common in your target companies) For getting comfortable with SQL query patterns quickly, [ai2sql.io](http://ai2sql.io)",

It seems like everyone recognizes that quality is declining across the board, and yet the trend of trying to push it off on individuals who have little to no passion for it continues. All the focus is on speed, and testing goes out the window. On the flip side, deploying changes only gets cheaper and cheaper, so production issues are viewed as less of a liability -- until you have a $10,000,000 issue.My hope is the eroding quality issues and disruption risk of the modern landscape will make quality somewhat a competitive advantage moving forward. Any team who has had effective quality advocates guiding processes and shifting quality concerns left/bringing the quasi-adversarial perspective knows the value they bring to a team/org.

Early returns:- from an intellectual POV, I enjoyed it, even if it was a little too simple for my liking (instead of courses like compilers and computation theory, it was marketable stuff like AI and data mining)- as a senior, it’s doing nothing to improve my position in-firm. No one cares, nor should they. If anything, they should just be happy that I’m done because I won’t have a second priority. - IMO, the benefit is going to be almost all invisible. Companies that set their filter to “masters degree mandatory”, now you’ll be surfaced for those roles. This might mean you’ll get more bites at the apple, but it absolutely will not be a fix if you’re a poor interviewer.If you’re going to do a masters degree, it should be some sort of specialization. A general CS masters is basically what you learned in your bachelors, and definitely not very additive. I think programs in AI or Cybersecurity could be additive, or a masters program in CS that specializes in one of those (since those can be argued as additive)",

Historically I went for startups with business plans I couldn't drive a truck through and generally early enough to get a significant fraction of the company with a transition to SaaS in 2010. Since 2017 I've been more worried about accumulating assets for retirement and worked for public companies with liquid stock.So I don't bookmark specific companies.I hadn't heard of half the public companies I've joined since 2017 and one of those two was the best I've worked for in over thirty years.2. I don't know how often timing was an issue in my Q4 2025 job search because I don't have visibility into whether I failed a resume screen or they chose someone else, although I got offers from companies where the job posting had been up for months and where they took up to two months to get back to me.3. In my Q4 2025 job search I made a spread sheet because I applied to many (62 versus at most a handful) more companies than I did historically and that was the most convenient way to keep track.4. I'd apply if the job was a good fit even with a 99% ghost rate. I'm an individual not the average candidate who is under qualified as Joel Spolsky discussed 20 years ago in [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/06/finding-great-developers-2/](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/06/finding-great-developers-2/) where \"almost every hiring manager in Palo Alto right now with 1000 resumes on their desk has the same exact set of 970 resumes from the same minority of 970 incompetent people that are applying for every job in Palo Alto, and probably will be for life.\" Google hired me in spite of a reported 0.2 - 0.7% acceptance rate, although to be fair that position came through an inbound recruiter contact.5. Along similar lines I don't think stats would be useful.6. Tools facilitating automated application are the biggest BS in tech hiring presumably causing long backlogs to talk to a person and some good candidates being lost in the noise.",

The screening process feels so disconnected from actual job performance, especially when you're more direct or don't play the corporate small talk game well. I've noticed this pattern too where founders tend to hire differently than HR departments do.To answer your questions: I do bookmark companies but honestly it's pretty manual and messy. I use a basic spreadsheet to track applications because most job platforms are terrible for this. Timing is huge though, I've definitely gotten rejections that felt like they already had someone in mind before posting. The ghosting stats would actually be super valuable, like if I knew a company had a 70% ghost rate I'd probably still apply but adjust my expectations and not put as much energy into customizing everything.The biggest BS right now is probably the AI resume screening stuff. You're getting filtered out by algorithms before any human even sees your application, and nobody tells you why. It's this black box where you could be perfect for the role but get rejected because you didn't use the right keywords or format. Companies are posting jobs they're not even seriously trying to fill, just collecting resumes or satisfying some internal requirement.Super cool bc I'm also building something in this space too (called Sprout) because the whole system feels broken. We're trying to give people more visibility into company response patterns and help optimize applications for these screening systems. But honestly the real problem is that hiring has become this weird theater where everyone's pretending the process makes sense when it clearly doesn't.What specific automation stuff have you seen people build? I'm curious about the more elaborate setups you mentioned.",

I think the bigger issue isn't just *how* you search, it's that you're fighting a volume game where everyone else is spending 2 hours per application while you're doing the same, which mathematically means you can only reach like 10-15 companies a month max before burnout hits. The unconventional approach that's actually working for people now is automating the repetitive parts without losing quality.Not talking about spammy mass-blast stuff, but actually letting software handle the grunt work of finding roles that match your criteria, customizing your materials for each ATS, and submitting at scale so you can focus energy on the companies that actually respond. I've heard really good things about SimpleApply for this exact use case since it handles the end-to-end application process and lets you reach way more opportunities without spending 40 hours a week on form filling. To answer your actual questions though: I track in a spreadsheet (Notion got too heavy), I absolutely would skip companies with 70% ghost rates if I knew that data, and the biggest BS right now is take-home assignments that are clearly just free consulting work.The fact that we're all pretending 8-hour unpaid projects are normal interview steps is insane. good luck with your product btw, sounds like you're tackling real pain",

I think learning kotlin and building apps is a great way to boost your resume and show you know how to build real systems. The industry wants to move towards Kotlin Multiplatform to share business logic between iOS/android. I would recommend building your apps in KMP and not neglecting iOS if you're building on your own and not for a company.That said, at least when I graduated tech companies preferred to hire a leetcode grinder with no android experience rather than an experienced android developer who couldn't leetcode. My intro to android development was applying to amazon, passing the leetcode rounds, and getting thrown on an android team with no prior android experience. Unless Android is truly your passion, I wouldn't commit to only applying to android roles. This career is a lot about luck and taking opportunities where they come. From my experience leetcode, networking, and career fairs with the goal of an internship are likely going to be a better use of time than diving deep into mobile dev. Use mobile dev as project experience to get those internships, but don't force your career in one direction.",

A percentage was applied afterwards based on company performanceThe above is rare though. Most places I've been (financial services), it's entirely discretionary. The prior year bonus forms the basis for the current year. The bonus pool is then distributed across the teams according to baseline and then further adjusted by the compensation manager(s). This process ends up with a bunch of robbing Peter to pay Paul. That number you get when you join usually applies the first year and becomes your baseline. Be prepared that it might be pro-rated based on your service time.",

On one of my worst projects in terms of hours, I lost weight because I was very mindful of my diet and how I dealt with stress. We’re all human, though. I’m not sure where the cutoff is between discipline and caving. Probably flexible and impacted by a lot of different factors. For me, personally, there have been times a switch went off for whatever reason. Perhaps a visual representation of the behavior spurs action more quickly.I think burnout is a different beast from smaller actions related to cognitive load. Interesting to see Monday your biggest food ordering day.

You could also load up a crock pot in the morning and come home to a nice hot stew and an amazing smelling house.If you can get into the habit of making larger portions and storing them in the fridge or freezer, it really simplifies meals in a way that's consistently higher quality and less expensive than delivery. You can also do some simple little side dishes like roast carrots, cooked spinach with garlic or even kimchi, so that you get some variety with the main thing you're eating.I'm much less inclined to order anything, since a meal for one for one night will usually cost about the same as a meal for one for a week. Even just driving over there and getting an order personally will at least cut that cost in half.",

Well that's easy but the hard part is always the refinement and the details. That's what they want you to figure out. When automating tasks, how do you get the best and most consistent results? Which models are the best? How to best set it up? Which tasks are best candidates to automate? How much money/effort can be saved this way? How can you still include a human element or some kind of safety mechanism or backstop so that the new process does not bite you if something goes wrong?

I would maybe make side projects where you can make stuff quickly and see what AI is capable of.Most important: BECOME WELL ROUNDED. Software engineering is so much more than technical prowess. It’s being able to lead, ask questions, be critical, find edge cases, get ahead of bugs, understand domains, be able to collaborate, be able to communicate, be responsible and own your features. This is what managers are going to look for WAY MORE than technical knowledge going forward. At least that’s my prediction and what my manager has been saying but I’m not a fortune teller.

And AI will also.It's here to stay and you have to integrate it into your workflow, see how AI make you more efficient. What AI can't do for you yet is judgment. It can write code or essay really well. It can't tell you whether you should be writing it in the first place or what you have written is good enough. What you bring to the table is that of a professional opinion. You know what good code looks like. You decide what needs to be implemented. What should be prioritised. A lot of decisions and judgment calls here. You only get it through experience.",

If you hate where you live, your life is going to be miserable, no matter how good your job is. Do you *want* to live in that Midwest city, or Duluth? Where I live is probably the single most important factor of job searching for me.That said, there's 2 major things I would be worried about with Job 2. Manager dependent hybrid is the first. Have you not had a chance to speak to your actual hiring manager? As in, you've gotta accept an offer basically blind and pray you end up on a good team, with a good manager, doing stuff you're interested in?If that's the case, that's a red flag for me. If you're a new grad it's different, but you have the experienced flair, so if I were you I'd want to spend time reverse-interviewing my actual hiring team to understand what the culture/WLB will be like. Joining a company without speaking to your HM there's a good chance you're walking into a shit environment. Tying that back to hybrid being manager dependent... you might end up with 5 day RTO. That'd be an instant no-go for me, so it'd be rolling the dice. But if you get 1 or 2 day RTO, that's a good gig.Same goes for unlimited PTO. That's not *inherently* bad, I've had unlimited PTO at 2 different companies where it was truly unlimited and encouraged to take. Most people were taking 4-7 weeks. Unless you were asking to take off more than 2 weeks consecutively there wasn't even an approval process. It was great.But on the other side of that coin, if the team culture of Job 2 is bad, unlimited PTO can be awful. That's why if you haven't spoken with your actual hiring manager, you're basically rolling the dice. Which is probably something I wouldn't be comfortable with doing for RTO/unlimited PTO.",
