Often I would concede to a different design, and after some time the team would arrive at what dimensional modelling advises. E.g they wanted to mix detailed data with aggregated snapshots in one table. I did not wantnto argue. I said \"well Kimball advises against this because its trouble\" and let them build it. After some time they split the fact tables into transaction and aggregate.It is not Kimball's ideas in the book, but experience of a wide industry practicioners over years of working with data. Now we have the cloud and storage is less limited. Our mental capacity still is limited, so it is easier to reason about facts and dimensions in separation, rather than a 100-column big table....and what about many to many?",

Since people are going to suspect LLMs anyway, I used one to try to reorganize it.I would probably add some testing too.---# Data Engineering Pipeline Checklist## 1. Requirements First- **SLA**: How fresh? (minutes/hours/daily) Daily reporting → no streaming needed- **Impact**: Cost of being late/wrong?- **Consumer**: Dashboards, ML, reporting?## 2. Architecture**Single source of truth**: One storage layer (warehouse/lakehouse/object storage). Everything reads from it.**Batch over streaming**: Streaming adds complexity (ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills). Default to batch unless real-time is essential.**Design for backfills**: Parameterized date ranges, versioned transforms, separate raw/modeled layers.## 3. Reliability**Idempotency**: Jobs must be safely rerunnable via partitioned outputs, overwrite-by-partition/merge strategies, deterministic keys.**Orchestration**: Use Airflow/Dagster/Prefect for retries, dependencies, visibility, parameterized runs. Avoid \"cron spaghetti.\"## 4. Observability**Minimum to prevent silent failures**:- Row counts/volume checks- Freshness checks- Schema drift alerts- Job duration tracking## 5. Performance**Optimize last**. Most slowness comes from bad joins, file layout, or moving too much data—not lack of Spark.**Fix basics first**: Partitioning, columnar formats, filter pushdown, avoid cartesian joins.## 6. Simplicity Rule**If your SLA is met with**: scheduler + Python/SQL + storage + basic checks**Then distributed systems add unnecessary complexity.****Use distributed systems when**:- Volume exceeds single-machine capacity (hundreds GB–TBs)- True real-time requirements (sub-minute)- Complex streaming aggregations- Multiple concurrent consumers need isolation",

Something lighter like Liftbridge (Kafka semantics, single Go binary, no JVM/ZooKeeper) or just NATS JetStream covers 90% of cases.On the storage side - totally agree on \"one source of truth, columnar, object storage.\" We're building Arc with exactly this mindset: DuckDB for compute, Parquet for storage, S3-compatible backend. No distributed cluster to babysit, SQL interface, handles GB-to-TB scale without the Spark tax.The line I use: if I can run the query on a single node in acceptable time, I don't need a distributed system.

Business folks need someone to make sense of the data chaos, and it’s pretty satisfying to be the one who stitches it together into something useful.I’ve been director-level for about 15 years and managed to stay pretty hands-on until recently. Even now, I try to keep up so I can actually lead effectively, and I’ll jump at any excuse to write some code just to stay sharp (and maybe flex a bit for the team!).If you’re losing passion, I’d seriously look at changing projects or orgs before bailing on the field. A good team and leadership that encourage experimentation and improvement make a huge difference. It’s still a solid career, and one underrated perk is that data folks tend to be closer to business goals and strategy than pure app devs. That context keeps things interesting, at least for me and if you can find a good company to work for.",

I wish I was the one developing these distributed database systems we all use, or working on computer vision in Robots, or computer graphics, or similarly challenging highly-specialized programming domains. I appreciate the contact with programming I get through DE but want to keep progressing towards roles that are less \"spit out an airflow script to coordinate SQL routines\".I recently accepted a new data platform job where I'll be a dedicated python developer working on internal libraries and tooling. So it's a move in the right direction towards more of a core SWE role.I don't honestly know that much about advanced SQL or data modeling and data governance. I've learned enough and find it interesting enough, but it's not my main interest.How are your soft skills and interest in dealing with people?

Two main choke points for AI deployments are 1) information retrieval, and 2) context management across complex tasks. Back in January 2025 was when I was first hearing about ontologies and context engineering at conferences, and now in December 2025 I'm seeing a lot more articles and thought pieces on this. What typically follows are enterprise POCs where vendors will get first signal of adoption before you start seeing case studies that drive further adoption (if it shows success).So I argue 2026 we are going to see a huge emphasis on data modeling for AI, specifically for unstructured JSON data and vector databases.",

Over time you will probably prune your Feedly down to the authors that match the kind of work you actually do day to day.",

What ends up happening is that all the system developers refuse to migrate to a new workflow and keeps on with their own little DB silos without sending data to the lakehosue, and the same people that used to work on the datawarehouse now have to become virtual members in the product teams to shuffle the data to the lakehouse in much the same way that they used to before. Only now they have to adhere to the product owners whims as to how they do things in the product, and how the product owner wants them to do ingestion etc. Of course this all happens in IT, and the business users who hold all of the business knowledge (how the data is used) are still outside of IT, and the datawarehouse people who could previously work with them directly are now no longer allowed to do so and have to prepare data that is WAY worse to work with for the analysts than what they had in the datawarehouse.",

A lot of the teams organically adopted systems and contractors and do own their own data. But they aren't generally technical users and there was no governance or standards. And all the data became siloed. The central DE team is working to unsilo the data. Our goal is to eventually create data standards and enforce them so the data is actually a good quality. This is a slow process, but I'm optimistic. The central BI team does seem to have a problem with scale. At my company, most of the functional users don't have BI experts and can't use PBI - at least nowhere near the quality that the BI team does. However, the BI team moves quite slowly to produce the reporting. The result is that functional teams build their own custom, low governance, reporting off the centralized data out of necessity. By the time BI develops the right tools, the business doesn't need it anymore and doesn't want to switch. My untested idea is to give the business access to easy to use cloud based dashboarding tools (like Sigma for example). Then BI provides support, underlying data models, and connectivity to non enterprise grade sources like SharePoint. In short, decentralizing everything without governance cannot work. Centralizing everything without a plan to scale cannot work. A data mesh is the tightrope that attempts to balance this. It is probably the right answer, but the degree of decentralization depends on the company.",

As usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. An architecture is only as good as its adoption. There are plenty of tools, processing patterns, architectures, etc that are excellent if you have the ability, resources, and will to implement them. In reality, the vast majority of companies do not. The key is to not throw out the baby with the bath water. For every “failed” implementation of Mesh, Agile, Hadoop, etc we’ve had through the years there has been incremental progress, evidenced by the plethora of options we have today to build data engineering stacks and teams to fit the different needs of companies. For me, data mesh was indicative of a paradigm shift from the old school prescriptive warehouse to a modern democratization enabled and fueled by the cycle of real-world problem solving. Data warehouse, data mart, self serve bi, data lake, data mesh, lakehouse. It’s just an evolution of trying to solve the same(ish) problem. In conclusion, use what serves you, throw away what doesn’t, take the labels and buzzwords with a grain of salt, and remember that ultimately you are always solving business problems, not data problems.",

So we had a ton of technical debt that accrued during our mvp/pilot because these teams where building toward a centralized architecture with NO data domains and not engaging with any of the missions.We used AWS native services and data bricks because a few of the missions already had architectures.We are 18 months in and the benefits are close but far at the same time.

We didn’t say we were implementing Data Mesh because few outside IT knew about it or understood it. Instead, our aim was to modernize the data platform, speed up delivery of technical solutions, and empower the business with self-service capabilities and less reliance on the IT organization.We were successful in many areas while other elements remained a challenge. For example, we migrated the two largest data platforms from on-premises, self-hosted and managed servers, to native services in the public cloud. Later, we built “lakehouse” capabilities on top of the public cloud platform. These included data governance features, automated data security, and data domains built for key areas of the business such as human resources, marketing, supply chain, etc. The benefits were quite profound. Within the first 2 years we had empowered 50+ business teams. Between year 1 and year 2 we saw 500% growth in teams able to use their data and the platform to create things that matter. Business teams recognized improved decision-making across the enterprise, increased efficiency and cost savings, accelerated speed-to-value for data product creation, and secure data sharing between teams.While we experienced success, the challenges were many. Some teams thought the changes were just another fad IT came up with. Given their prior experiences they were honestly justified in thinking that. Other teams were interested but couldn’t get their leadership to buy in or they didn’t have enough technical chops to harness their domain data on their own. They continued to rely on central IT. Other business teams were so focused on their own projects and demands they simply couldn’t make the initial shift. They asked us to come back later. A thru line that helped in most situations was having clear executive leadership support (CIO, CEO, CDO, and others). They would knock down roadblocks where needed and help provide resources when we got stuck.After 3 years in the journey one thing was abundantly clear. Technology was not the largest challenge. People and culture were. It took tremendous energy to cast the vision and bring people and teams along with us. This required persistent communication with all business teams and clear demonstration of the value of public cloud through demos, pilots, and “soft releases” of products, apps, and services. The technical teams (platforms, cloud, data, security) all became storytellers if they weren’t already. To this day I don’t call the transformation a “data mesh implementation.” But we certainly knew of and studied Data Mesh and sought to implement core principles it espoused: self-service, decentralized data domains/ownership, data governance, and a focus on data product creation within business teams.",

Scala is less common than python but knowing both is valuable. Being solo DE is kinda scary though, youll be the bottleneck for everything and oncall will probably suckOffer 2: azure fabric is newer but dbt is everywhere. migration projects can be a resume builder but also a pain. again solo DE which means youre gonna be stretched thin. dbt is super hot rn thoughOffer 3: this ones interesting because you actually have a team. 2 seniors to learn from is huge for growth, and aws + python is the most common stack youll see. Protobufs are solid for data contracts. platform work is also really good experienceimo id lean toward offer 3. having a team means you can actually learn and grow instead of just firefighting all day. aws + python is the most transferable stack and platform engineering is a good direction. the solo DE thing in offers 1 and 2 sounds like a burnout speedrun tbhDatabricks is cool but not worth being the only DE on a team at 2.5 YOE. Youll learn way more with seniors around. Whats the comp difference between them?",

I think the use case was making it easier for engineers to get to grips with new databases or for analytics users (me) to get what they need more quickly.I have also seen some people experimenting with GenBI tools (I think looker conversational analytics).In both instances, the solutions miss the actual problem. You need very clean, very well tagged, very well modelled data. The example I always give is that if you go to the table marked “sales” and count the number of sales…. That is not even remotely correct. Years of schema evolution, changes to products, and poor engineering mean the actual number is much harder to derive. For conversational analytics, the prompts must be very carefully tuned and the AI will straight up invent things if you aren’t careful. I would not trust it in the least.For the CoSQL model, I haven’t tried to use it, but I notice that solution architects are suggesting I use it rather than curating dbt so I can use that to control our transformation logic. In that regard, it’s a complete distraction and a massive net-negative.“We don’t have working data products” is the same problem we have had for years and it’s the same problem that will make AI tools harder to implement even if they are viable, but it’s far too unsexy an issue to attract attention.I am hoping that if I can make clear the dependency that AI has on working data products it might get me the resources and tooling I have needed all along.",

Since a lot of human knowledge is embedded in text, this gives us quite a good basis to create large langauge models that can mirror quite a bit of that knowledge. However, large language models are not very good at doing abstract reasoning on anything other than text, which includes a lot of the work you do as an analyst by traslating some fuzzy business logics to maths, at least for anything nontrivial beyond textbook problems. You may attempt to alleviate this somewhat by providing good metadata for context, but my experience is that this doesn't really solve the problem and i very much doubt this will improve untill we get a different class of models all together as the \"more data+larger models\" approach yields diminishing returns due to sublinear scaling of LLMs wrt. data and size.Note: you should take everything i say with a grain of salt, as i am a practitioner using LLMs and my formal training is in physics, not NLP.",

The hard part isn't the LLM at all; it's the systems and guardrails around it.If someone wants to roll their own, the pieces that actually matter are:**1) Explicit semantic layer**You can't let the agent figure out business logic because it's incapable. Metrics, joins, definitions, and edge cases have to be defined in dbt models, semantic views, or a metadata layerIf you don't, you run the inevitable risk of fluent nonsense from the LLM. (Variance will get you eventually)**2) A constrained query surface** (Especially important if you're giving the agent to end users)Don't let the model generate raw SQL and hope for the best. Restrict it to: A verified query library / A constrained DSL / Parameterised patterns. This removes a huge amount of hallucination and makes failures actually diagnosable.**3) Feedback loop/flywheel****This is** ***critical.***You need traces of every input, generated query, and failure mode so you can see:* Where the semantic layer is missing context* Which inputs result in varied rather than consistent outputs (not reliable + potentially incorrect)* Where the agent is making the same wrong assumptions repeatedlyWithout that loop, you cannot really improve the agent, but with it, you can patch gaps, clarify metrics, and improve the agent's ability over time.That’s the main stuff people underestimate when they say “just add an agent”.For full disclosure, I've ended up building this approach into a full product called Inconvo that helps teams develop their semantic layer and includes built-in query guardrails and feedback loop tracing.Also, for those data engineering teams being asked to build this for customer-facing use cases (pretty common these days and a huge ask!) Inconvo has an API and integrations so data engineers can focus on data correctness instead of auth, UI, and other historically full-stack work.**Main take:**None of this works without good old data engineering and well-modelled data; the agent just amplifies whatever assumptions you bake in.Interested to hear where others have hit the limits of this approach.",

I've used pyexasol (https://github.com/exasol/pyexasol) to enable the agents to write data to my database. I tested out an agentic workflow where I have agents search for local events and predicted attendance and store that in my database as input for some business analytics/decisions. There's a lot of potential - even just starting with an MCP server can get you a long way. Also - for analytics in particular, it helps the LLMs to have 'semantic' context to help them write more accurate queries and understand what you are asking (in natural language)",

We would not accept anything into our pipeline that failed the tests.The vendor knew of any issues immediately without one of our team members having to be online to qa.To implement, we basically kept track of what we expected the schema and checked the file against those expectations. If that passed, we loaded the data into Duckdb, ran our dbt source layer testing, then parsed the dbt results into something they could work with.

The biz units **DemandeD ThatT We Do PartiaL LoaD**, not to reject the entire file, if there are any bad lines. Like a carriage return + linefeed inside a column, text columns not wrapped in double quotes when they should be, a comma instead of a period for Decimal columns (French format), dates that are not YYYY-MM-DD, again, Europe/Quebec versus English North America. I get DD-MM-YYYY in these files, UTF-8, and French accents. It all works.So if you load in a \"binary\" way you maintain whatever UTF-8 or Iso6500 the file was sent as, and parsing is easy with sub-selects on every column. I run the biz rule analyzer first, and only for IsValidData=1 do we import. Then we use DB\\_SendMail function to the appropriate biz unit of the invalid data.Honestly, the code quality of SaaS and input forms have taken a serious nose dive since 2020's.

That, plus getting them comfortable with the idea of merging down from main into their feature before attempting to push back up into main will all go a long way towards not only getting rid of conflicts but also driving consistency and quality of code in general.

My team can get a change implemented, tested, reviewed and pushed to prod in 30m or less if we wanted to. The key is to give the peers a heads up that you have a change that needs to be fast tracked before you start development so everybody in the chain of responsibilities are aware and ready to engage when development is complete.The challenge you describe with merge conflicts should only happen if multiple people are working on the exact same file. If this is a common occurrence, you should understand why multiple people need to change the same file. Your code structure may need to be improved to separate a monolithic file into smaller individual files and rebuilt in runtime.Additionally, having good branch hygiene is important. Don't keep reusing the same branch for all changes. Open a new branch for each change and prune orphaned branches. Every new change should be based on the current state of Prod so the resulting PR should only be the specific change you are trying to make. Once the PR is merged, you should delete the branch. If a new change is needed, create a new branch. This also lets you more easily abandon a bad change during dev (delete the branch) and start over if necessary.",

Fine tuned the document ai product with the respective solution from 1.4. Created own classifier models pretrained on majority of invoices and tuned on a much smaller labeled set.5. Created rule engine override for oddities, new classes, etc.6. Adaptive thresholding to require manual review or not for particular documents based on a cost matrix specified by business.Did this in about two months while working on the requests of the days that occurred. We also had a document type classification and splitting process. Our biggest concern was invoices though. Sometimes we'd get really large batches of scanned documents in one pdf.

You may even be able (depending on situation) not even have to travel to work most days.Pay may not be great in your country, but I'm willing to bet you can get away with not having to ruthlessly budget ... and you should slowly but steadily be building up a big enough pension to see you through decades of retirement.To be clear: this is perhaps the cushiest situation to have existed for someone subsisting on their own labour (rather than pre-existing capital) in human history.Not trying to be harsh here - I want to give you this perspective because I think it will ultimately help you.Get-rich-quick schemes are a pipe-dream: startups can be done, but you'll have to work far, far harder than you are right now, with less than 50% odds of success even under ideal circumstances ... and often for far longer than you may expect (I've worked in two successful startups that remained unprofitable for _a decade_, running off fresh rounds of investment until scale made the economics work).",

How is it not for so many people? What the hell do your employers demand of you? If I do \"overtime\" (lol fool me, I'm on a salary, but I can swing it as take a few hours off another day) it's because I have some weird compulsion to do so: something playing on my mind, something I want to progress or finish off; or some training/learning/research. Sometimes I'll feel a bit behind, or making up time for going in a bit \"leisurely\" in the morning.I enjoy the work I do - most the time - the tech is cool to use, I'm loyal to my employer to an extent (they've been fair, decent, and flexible) but I'm not particularly interested in the actual business or industry. Or the goal. Basically help the owners/shareholders/whatevers make more money? Cool, man... very fulfilling.OP, are you more entrepreneurial , do you want to work for yourself more than some company? I don't have first-hand context of that, but I can't imagine it would be easy, or even highly compensating - at first, at least. It's not me, but if that's you, more power to you!Is it the DE angle you've lost interest in specifically? And because the lag in landing a job, your interest simply waned? What is it you actually enjoy? Creating, problem solving, fixing or improving something? If you don't go out to work for yourself right away, is it realistic to keep looking for something else that fits better?Edit: Unless there's some radical shift in society and economy, we work because we need the money. Since I spend 40 hours of life a week doing it, I may as enjoy it enough. Find something you'll enjoy doing.",

I wanna practice and i have a good base that i can build on, I think working on projects would be a good start for me. I wanna begin with something simple like extracting data from an api and transform then load them into a db ,dw or snowflake for example, and automating them using airbyte/airtable for example, so the thing is i dont know where to start or where to find the ideas of projects, or should i just find/think of them on my own ?anyways i read the comments and i kind of agree with some who say that might just need to bear the boring and repetitive tasks that you dont like, and try to find the little things that you like or enjoy doing, till you find something else better.",

Note that through the majority of the history of data warehouses the principal platforms were general purpose databases like db2, oracle and sql server. In fact there's very few features in say snowflake that you can't find in the general purpose databases.A few considerations: * It all depends on your total data volume, the data volume your queries will be scanning, the number of queries, etc, etc, etc. * But a 10-20 TB data warehouse using Postgres can work absolutely fine. * Partitioning is critical * Summary/aggregate tables may be critical if you want really fast queries for dashboards, etc. I like to monitor my use of these like one would monitor buffer space / caches for transactional databases - and try to get 95+% of my queries to hit them. * Certain queries will benefit from the use of indexes. This can provide a significant edge to performance. * Configuring your database to support query parallelism is also critical at volume. * Database constraints are just as important in OLAP as they are in OLTP - and postgres can provide a ton of value here! You may need to turn them off on massive fact tables, but you can also use them at least with summary & dimension tables. * AWS RDS has pretty slow IO, but other hosting options can provide blisteringly-fast servers. But you may need to have postgres dba skills. * All the above assumes vanilla postgres. Adding extensions for duckdb, columnar storage (hydra), etc can provide faster performance in many cases.FYI: I migrated part of my snowflake reporting to postgres on RDS a few years ago in order to save a bunch of money. IIRC it was about $20k/month saved AND my queries were much faster.

The main point of the duckdb extension is to attach to external tables in a lakehouse. Like read/write iceberg tables in s3. This allows you to query data across your lakehouse and Postgres db. BUT if your Postgres tables are getting bigger duckdb extension will not improve the query performance as the Postgres DB will be the bottleneck. If your data volumes are low 1000s of rows vs millions or billions of rows you can get away with Postgres.If you plan on high data volumes you can use duckdb to aggregate Postgres data with a datalake in s3 and then use ducklake or duckdb to query it.So no pg_duckdb doesn’t turn your Postgres DB into a data warehouse.",

As this will change the comments, based on your constraints.DuckDB for olap processing, easy install on a Linux-VM, only heard great things about it. Microsoft has the free SQL Server Express for OLTP - perfect for staging area - 10 gig limit per database - so have a DB per source and ingest, you'll have 2 cpu peformance and decent ram usage (16g I think, check Microsoft's web page).So what's nice with SQL Server Express is it plays nice with your AD and talks easily to other MSSQL systems, so you can avoid flat files when flat files don't make sense.If you want history of all changes, without the hassle of CDC, flat files on a massive file share dedicated for this, you basically emulate a datalake. If this file share system is Linux, there's probably Datalake compatible open-source you can use so you can do SELECT directly on the CSV/Json/XML flat files, just like a real cloud datalake. But I haven't done it - I'm sure someone here has.In any case, Google Big Query and even Azure Datalake are not expensive. Probably on-par with dedicated hardware costs internally adding a 4TB mirrored fileshare system, when costed and budgeted over 36 months.It depends on CAPEX versus OPEX, your boss should know this. Internal hardware adds inventory, and small companies can rent-to-buy-back over 36 months, even DELL offers this for hardware.",

Make do with tools that can do a lot, even if they're not perfect for every single case.If you want Postgres, look at extensions for Postgres like pg_duckdb so you can do your transformations inside Postgres quicker and skip Polaris (and/or use duckdb in-process instead, so it's the same engine). Use pgvector to do vector inside Postgres.Or use ClickHouse instead which also fills those roles. Fast enough you can just do the transforms in the database, supports vectors, has an in-process engine called chDB if you need it which also doubles as a data science data frame lib.People always default to wanting a big bag of tools, but it just makes it more expensive. Most of the time, a database works just fine until you actually need to go wider.",

I've used SQL Server agents in the past and they are great for SQL only tasks, but even then they lack many nicer things that modern job orchestrators offer. All my warehousing was always done in normal relational databases, I see nothing wrong with using PostgreSQL or SQL Server or the likes. If you're great with SQL, you can do anything with them.By the way, if your team happens to use C#, I'm releasing a C# job orchestrator next month called [Didact](https://www.didact.dev).

Surprises happen, things out of your control change. Lay those out in a matter of fact and non apologetic manner that you can. Notice how on the business side of things change all the time, and the conversation is always about its a dynamic environment and not the lack of foresight on the part of management/leadership.

That gap is exhausting and usually leads to burnout exactly like you described. Asking someone to “go faster” without fixing deployment order issues, data gaps, or validation rules is not actionable feedback. It is just pressure.If anything, the fact that you are documenting discrepancies, rebuilding inherited messes, and validating edge cases suggests you are doing the job correctly, not slowly. The risk is that you are absorbing systemic chaos personally instead of it being acknowledged as a team or org issue. That is not sustainable long term, and it is reasonable to say that out loud.",

The job is to solve problems and achieve real-world objectives. Sometimes to do that we have to consider other constraints on the problem space, such as:- \"this technology is inferior, but it's battle tested and has loads of technical support staff backing it; we can't afford the risk of a new system going down and having no way to fix it\"- \"this technology is old, and therefore I can easily hire people who already know it, and there is a lot of documentation; the new one is great on paper but we need experienced staff to maintain it, and they are hard to find\"- \"this new technology is better than what we currently have in terms of technical performance, but we've rigged up enough custom ameliorations around the existing core tech that we will realise hardly any real world gains from switching\"- \"we would benefit from switching technologies in a measurable way, saving £50,000 per year, but it would take this entire team six months of work to move all our legacy code onto it. They have other, more pressing priorities and the benefit doesn't outweigh the cost of hiring a team of contractors to do it.\"But let's say you think there's a big pool of potential adopters for whom SQLMesh II would make business sense. It's not so easy to take a slightly superior technology and turn that into a going concern. dbt has mass adoption.Are you personally planning to fork SQLMesh and spend a substantial chunk of your time maintaining it, if Fivetran strip the original for parts? Perhaps you will fund this via a hosted version - will you be picking up the phone to pitch it to companies yourself, or will you use your own money to pay someone to do that?What will you do if Fivetran freak out as soon as you get traction and throw a bunch of engineers at making dbt good enough to kill your competitive advantage? Unlike SQLMesh-original-flavour, you don't have proprietary code; Fivetran have access to the same stuff plus a lot more resources.Remember, you _only_ get acquired if it makes business sense to them to spend the money on buying you out ... instead of on using their own engineering team to outcompete you. If that happens it's very good news for analytics engineering, but _terrible_ news for you as a founder. Typical outcome: nothing happens. The incumbent has no motivation to improve, and would-be founders have no ability to realise the gains for themselves, so do nothing to change this.",

The article explains these well. Key concept here is loading only what you need to, making it useful in situations where the amount of data is very large and/or compute is a concern.A key thing to understand would be is\\_icremental(), which is a function which will return True if the model it is being applied in *already exists* in the warehouse (and is also an incremental model which is not running in full-refresh)That means anything wrapped within is\\_incremental() won’t be applied the first time you run a model, or when you fully refresh it.This is what you use to compare existing records in your target with your source so you only load the new and/or updated records, depending on your strategy.You can also flip that and use NOT is\\_incremental(), meaning that what you wrap it around will only run the first time the model is built (or on full refreshes). That could for example be if you have some old stale data that you need to union with on the first run, but then never need to look at again, except for the case of a full refresh.EDIT: For some clarity, heres an example of an incremental model from dbt docs.If this model has never been run before, or needs to be fully refreshed (reloaded) then `{% if is_incremental() %}` will evaluate to false, meaning that the SQL it wraps wont be sent to the warehouse. That makes sense, since `{{ this }}` will be rendered as the incremental models name. Hard to do a select from something that doesnt exist yet right? We need to compare event\\_time in source with what we have loaded before, which we cant do if we've never loaded it.Once we've loaded data for the first time, the if statement will evaluate to true, meaning the WHERE clause gets put into effect. Then the models SQL will return results using that filtering, and that's what ends up getting inserted into the target table in your DWH. {{ config( materialized='incremental' ) }} select *, my_slow_function(my_column) from {{ ref('app_data_events') }} {% if is_incremental() %} -- this filter will only be applied on an incremental run -- (uses >= to include records whose timestamp occurred since the last run of this model) -- (If event_time is NULL or the table is truncated, the condition will always be true and load all records) where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} ) {% endif %}",

For high water mark incremental processing you want to drive off of the timestamp representing the moment the record was written in your data warehouse/lakehouse/dbt. You do not want to rely on the application timestamp or the timestamp generated by your source system for incremental processing. For the purposes of this conversation, let’s assume `table_a` and `table_b` both represent this in a column named `dbt_updated_ts`.Another concern is persisting these timestamps in your target model. You will need to decide on `table_a.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_a_dbt_updated_ts` and `table_b.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_b_dbt_updated_ts` or doing something like `least(table_a.dbt_updated_ts, table_b.dbt_updated_ts) as source_dbt_updated_ts`. Regardless of the decision, you should *also* re-state a `dbt_updated_ts` for downstream consumers of your model. They should *not* look at your various source timestamps for incremental processing, only your new `dbt_updated_ts`And this is where the rub comes in. Now you have 2 sources with 2 different timestamps and you need to process them incrementally. A comprehensive way of doing this would be to take all the keys above the high water mark in source a and union with the keys above the high water mark in source b, union the keys together, then use that to scan both tables again to make sure you catch all the changes. Generally this is computationally expensive, although it should give the correct answer.If you are doing this to create something like a SCD type-2 dimension it gets more complicated on top of this, as you will now need to deal with the temporal aspects of your source system as well.I would warn you of this: if someone says add a lookback window, that is usually to cover some architectural sin. This should be questioned.It’s complicated and often computationally expensive to process multiple upstreams in an incremental fashion. Do not forget the maintenance cost: next month you will have an engineer who thinks they are clever and will mess with this logic and it may be ok for most cases but not certain edge cases. KISS. If you can, just materialize any model with multiple upstreams as `table` and save yourself the headache. Again, single-model HWM incremental is perfectly fine, it’s when you attempt to incremental more than one model at once where you will find pain.",

        "body": "Depends on what you mean.If you're joining/unioning/selecting from other up stream incremental models, you don't really need to think about how they are materialized. At least I can't think of a scenario where you would need to consider that. I could also be completely wrong here, not something I've really given any thought.If you mean in the context of joins/unions within the same model, you still only really have to think about where and when you apply the is\\_incremental() macro. To use the above example again (but expanded a bit), say we have some old stale data that we need to load, e.g. from some old source system, and then we're adding data from the new system on top. We still keep the same fields and everything.In this example, the first time we run the model, the first incremental macro will return false, because the model deosnt exist in our target dwh yet. The second macro will return true, since the target table doesnt exist yet. So then we will run the main query, and then union in the old data.On every subsequent run, the first macro will return true, and the second one false. So on all future runs, we will be filtering data from the new system, and disregarding the old one entirely, since no new data is being generated there.So we wrap SQL we want to compile and send to the warehouse depending on the context in which the model is running. In practice I've only used this to wrap a WHERE (most common), CTE's or UNIONs. You can also include multiple wrapped statements as below, for example we might apply an incremental macro inside our CTE's in order to make the model more performant. I find it hard to imagine a scenario where you would wrap it around a join. {{     config(         materialized='incremental'     ) }} select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from {{ ref('app_data_events_from_new_system') }} {% if is_incremental() %}     where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} ) {% endif %} {% if not is_incremental() %}     union     select         customer_id,         period,         total_sales     from  {{ ref('app_data_events_from_old_system') }} {% endif %}This means that the compiled SQL will look like one of these 2 (excluding all of the DML that dbt builds in order to actually insert the data into the target table): -- FIRST RUN RESULTS IN select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system     union     select         customer_id,         period,         total_sales     from  old_db.old_schema.app_data_events_from_old_system -- SUBSEQUENT RUNS RESULT IN select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from target_db.target_schema.target_table_with_app_data_from_both_source_systems)",

This means all of the incrementals they've built involving multiple tables are impossible to reproduce from scratch because those incremental tables are not being updated correctly. Had an entire database in a previous company where they would have to regularly refresh all of the datasets because of this and it would sometimes crash in the process. Absolute mess.For me, because I have the skillsets to do so, I pretty much prefer to stay away from any sort of incremental involving multiple tables and use table materializations like you mention unless I 1) really need it and 2) can implement it in a more generic way rather than a custom incremental model. More generic being something like a custom materialization or macro. For example, we have an incremental materialization that checks counts of the source query vs the incremental table by the incremental timestamp to load deltas. This makes the actual SQL in the DBT model involve no incremental logic and makes the DBT model robust to source data that sometimes updates some historical data instead of only inserting new data. If this scenario had been implemented as a basic DBT append-only incremental model (which it was before it got refactored), then the data would not match reporting from the source system.The example I gave speaks to another problem that goes beyond what you bring up (engineer that thinks they're being smart). There's also the problem that often times engineers will develop something with some assumption for how it's going to work in their mind. \"Oh, well we should only get new data for this process every day.\" This is only sometimes true. I've worked at multiple companies and every company has had at least a couple of processes you might expect to work that way but don't for business or engineering reasons. For example, if you have a DBT model that involves updates from multiple tables, what happens if table A is updated later than table B? Then on the next run, you may have to update your incremental on late-arriving data from table A + historical data from table B, which leads to historical updates in your table. Of course, there's other ways to implement these things, but by no means trivial in my experience.",

You’re dealing with compliance requirements, mandatory transparency towards regulators and central banks, legacy core systems, and very high expectations around data quality and consistency. That combination puts banks in a different category.If an ML model elsewhere mispredicts churn, you lose some money and move on. If a banking reporting pipeline lacks proper governance, ownership, change control, clear accountability, or end-to-end traceability, you’re not BCBS-compliant which can have serious regulatory consequences, up to and including license risk.",

It has an editor to create and edit models, AI support to write models, visualization of lineage, Ui to compile and test an individual model (btw you can compile and run a single model via DBT core as well), it is connected to github (this usually done via your on-prem IDE), you can schedule the execution of projects via DBT cloud, which saves you an orchestrator and DBT cloud provides a semantic layer and catalog product. Even though they are some differences and additional features the price tag is not low. I think $100 / user / month. If you want to leverage all the additional feature like job scheduling, catalog, semantic layer etc it might be worth it as you don’t have to setup infrastructure for those. But as you said above you decided on dagster then you maybe better off with DBT core and a good IDE.",

If you have bespoke code, maybe look at a load framework like DLT. Is the framework any better, or do you like having more control over the process?Save your raw data to a more modern file format with proper data types (e.g. Parquet, AVRO) - do you need to do any transformation on the source data to make it fit? Are there any unexpected issues with the data that you have to handle?Load your data into a local database, either directly from source or from your raw files. Then you can start running proper SQL queries against your data and get some practice with querying databases in general. DuckDB comes to mind, it's powerful and lightweight with good support across many languages.Do some transformations on the data - consider cleansing data quality issues, perhaps normalising the structure, or transforming it into a better shape for Data Science modelling. You could do this with some bespoke code, or look into transformation tools like dbt or SQLMesh.Build some visualisations of the data to build more of a story around the data than just raw values.In each case, try out multiple tools. If you're using Pandas, consider trying Polars or Ibis, or leveraging DuckDB's APIs. What do you like about each one? What do you dislike? Even if you're achieving the same goals with each, its good to get a feel for the differences in each tool and form your own opinion.",

There's actually a lot to your question.When it comes to designing a mart, I keep the \"analyst\" persona in mind as much as possible. This is my north star, even if I don't have analysts. Querying a star should be simple, not something full of odd case logic, analytic queries, coalesces, and the deep SQL knowledge. Save that for your transformations leading up to the star if needed.Regarding keys specifically, there are several goals I have when designing a mart. From the perspective of the \"analyst\" persona querynig the star:1. Joins (dims to facts) should be done with `INNER JOIN` not `OUTER JOIN` - this is for performance and for usability2. No records should be dropped via join - this is a quality issue, you should not be dropping revenue on the floor because your users dimension is incomplete or late for example3. Join conditions should be singular (e.g. no `AND` in join clause) in nature - this is again for performance and usabilityThe ideal query would look something like this: SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name FROM fct_sales AS f INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d ON f.customer_sk = d.customer_sk GROUP BY d.customer_nameThese goals need to be addressed in concert. To do so, you really need a lookup process instead of a hashing strategy.In order to address 1 and 2, you really need to have placeholder records in your dimension for \"unknown\", \"missing\" or \"not applicable\" customers, and your fact table creation needs to use these values as appropriate. You cannot hash your way out of this problem; you need to process your dimension (or at least your dimension lookup) first, and then process your facts. Generally this is done with a lookup table. For item 3 in isolation of 1 and 2, if your dimension is SCD type-1 from a single system then using the source system natural key seems reasonable. Once you have multiple source systems (say, customers from 2 systems) then the natural progression is to either add a `source_system` column and make sure everyone remembers to join on that as well (hint: they won't) or to concatenate your source system with the natural key. This concatenation leaves you with a string key instead of an integer key which now negatively impacts query performance.If your dimension is SCD type-2, it's worse. You are left with something looking like this, which is not obvious to analysts, performs poorly, and is error prone: SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name FROM fct_sales AS f INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d ON f.customer_nk = d.customer_nk AND f.transaction_ts BETWEEN d.begin_effective_ts AND d.end_effective_ts GROUP BY d.customer_name Usability note: Is it `BETWEEN` or did you do the right thing and make your `end_effective_ts` the same moment as the next `begin_effective_ts`? I can almost guarantee your analysts will either use `BETWEEN` or worse they won't consider the effective dates at all and `DISTINCT` the result set to get what they want. Honestly, it's doubtful that future engineers will remember which way you went with effective dates either. All the more reason to address this in your transformation while building the mart instead of leaving it to the mart consumers to remember.To achieve goal 3 with SCD type-2, you want to put a SK on the fact that represents the state of the dimension at a point in time (probably the moment of transaction). To do this you will also need a lookup, as you cannot hash your way out of this either.At this point it should be clear that lookups are the way to go. So the real question is why would you want a hash instead of an integer? To me, the answer is now obvious: integers take next to zero compute to calculate, will join more efficiently, have half a chance at clustering in a meaningful way, and are immune to collision.TL;DR integer lookups",

By default it will run Podman but you can switch to Docker with \\`astro config set container.binary docker -g\\`. I'd recommend using the Astro CLI to start so you have a functioning environment to learn Airflow but the other commenter is correct, you will eventually need to know how to interact directly with Docker in your data engineering career.One thing I'd recommend to practice Docker is, after learning the basics of Airflow, adding one more Docker container to your environment by using a \\`docker-compose.override.yml\\` file and starting to interact with it. That is how I got started with understanding how to work with Docker. :) There is an example here that adds a minio + postgres container (and the Airflow connections to those are in the .env\\_example file): [https://github.com/astronomer/ebook-etl-elt/blob/main/docker-compose.override.yml](https://github.com/astronomer/ebook-etl-elt/blob/main/docker-compose.override.yml) The Astro CLI will spin up these extra containers too when you run \\`astro dev restart\\`.

I've met maybe three people in 25 years who have mastered SQLand I'm not one of them. The reason I am being pedantic is it comes across as the person who takes a course then says they've mastered it. It almost feels like lying. People will be less likely to help you. Your toolset is very good for a DE. If you're trying to get your first DE job, I'd learn dbt and Airflow since they are so common. Do some real work with them. But your next most important step is to stand out. Create a great LinkedIn profile and write a few high-quality articles that show your expertise. That's how you will find more company recruiters (not headhunters) reaching out to you.",

This is mostly done with dag selection methods too and not actually looking at the graph as unpronounceable mentioned.When responding, it makes it so much easier to handle comms and prioritization when you know what teams or services will be impacted, but definitely depends on how expensive outages are for your team. Second big thing that comes to mind is with respect to performance and cost. Mostly just looking for single dags with a ton of downstream dependencies (limits parallelization), and tables that are joined over and over again instead of materializing out the join. dbt project evaluator has great docs on this and is worth a read regardless if you implement it.",

        "body": "the SDKs/Tools do not yet have a forward/backwards compatibility check to make sure that changes to the schema yield output that is also compatible with prior schemas, but it's something I plan to add. You can do this today by validating instances against v1 and v2 schemas at the same time. If ypou work with Python, there are two simple command line tools for validation that are part of the \"json-structure\" package: # Validate a schema file json-structure-check schema.json # Validate an instance against a schema json-structure-validate instance.json schema.jsonFrom a lifecycle perspective, you use schemas either where you produce data to ensure that it conforms to a set of rules AND/OR at the consumer end to ensure that it conforms to a set of rules. In code and databases, that structure manifests in column declarations or typed fields, and having a neutral data definition language that comes with \"polyglot\" tooling and know many languages and database table schema dialects is therefore helpful for data structures and data to not get lost in translation.I have very successfully used the specs as instruction files with LLMs (e.g. Copilot) so when you want to infer a schema from existing data structures with the spec in the context, you often get very good results, and from there you are on a type safe path. I wrote teh spec such that teh LLMs would be doing good with it, for instance, by having examples for all constructs.",

Instead use one of the many mature python orchestrators, and dimension your deployment correctly for your use case. Once you are confident on your instrumentation, you step down a level and review the stores procedures. If your seniors want to move to cloud, they need to plan for it accordingly and let you adjust to that. Just deploying an orchestrator in a cloud when your sources and destinations are onprem is a dodgy decision. Chances are they would also want to move to a cloud warehouse, which can dramatically change the architecture for example from ETL to ELT. This decision is not yours, but it's a very good learning opportunity. Best of luck!",

IMO it’s an extremely hard problem to solve if you want to get beyond basic questions like how much did client x spend in q4 or whatever.I think the approach you are describing is probably as isolated and secure as you could possibly need to get, and may not be flexible enough to provide real business value. But it depends on what sort of questions you want the agent to answer. If you want agents to do things actual human analysts are currently doing, I think allowing the ai to explore the schema and basically do multi turn “deep research” with access to a large portion of the warehouse plus a semantic layer explaining tables and data relationships is probably going to be needed. My current opinion is that if I was going to something as isolated and controlled as what you are describing I might as well just build a dashboard with those curated views available.",

We’re not trying to recreate a human analyst doing open-ended exploration (yet). We’re aiming for safe, repeatable workflows first.. the stuff that’s painful today because it’s frequent + operational (support, RevOps, CSM, finance ops), not really deep research or exploration. 2. Dashboards are great when questions are known and stable. Agents get interesting when the question is variable but still bounded, e.g. “why did churn risk spike for these 20 accounts?”, “summarize anomalies by segment”, “draft an escalation note with the relevant context,” etc. The way we're thinking is that these sandboxed, curated views/tools are guardrails - the agent still does the synthesis + narrative + next-step suggestions.3. We’re also treating schema exploration as a separate (higher risk) capability. I agree that to do real analyst work, you probably need: semantic layer + table relationships + multi-turn exploration. But letting an LLM roam your warehouse is also where we foresee getting: cost blowups, accidental joins into sensitive tables, hallucination and more. One more reason we’re starting constrained: **repeatability.** For some of the agent tasks we're aiming for, it’s almost mandatory for teams to yield the same answer for the same/similar questions (or at least the same underlying definition/query) every time. So our plan for now is: **start constrained → earn trust → expand surface area (curated views + sandboxing allows us to do that)** ideally with a semantic layer + policy checks as the expansion path. If you tried doing this in prod: how are you handling this tradeoff? Do you allow wide read access and rely on RLS/RBAC + logging, or do you gate it behind a semantic model / query planner / allowlists?",

Those are the level of questions i was thinking of when I mentioned needing schema exploration and multi turn deep research.The only approach I'm using in 'prod' is stuff that heavily depends on a human in the loop. What I've experimented more with is snowflake's 'cortex' ecosystem which allows you to do RBAC on curated views with semantic layers. It's still in the data warehouse environment but the agents can only access those curated views. What I found with this though was that I couldn't answer questions on the level of what you are describing very well, which is why I think if it's ever gonna work a much more flexible approach is needed.",

Testing is also very important part of pipelines, which are unfortunately neglected by most of the DE teams. It will make sure that your commit editing “pipeline A”, won’t alter the logic of “pipeline B”. End-to-end Testing is the best thing you can do for your Data Architecture. Create a small sample input dataset, dozen of rows usually is enough. Create expected output dataset. Run pipeline on using sample input as source and compare your actual output with expected output. Do it on every merge to main branch. Very simple, straightforward but gives you a lot of confidence in you data pipelines. It requires some simple CI/CD pipeline and probably separate env to run the tests but data quality always comes with a price, like all good things in this life :)",

Native data replication capabilities where a live copy of data is synced to the customer's data warehouses/lakes is a \"best in class\" product experience, though this is increasingly becoming an expectation just like an API (\\*especially\\* for companies that want to serve mid-market/enterprise, as you called out).What we've found is many SaaS eng/product teams usually start down this road by using the native sharing capabilities within whatever platform/region they use internally (e.g, Snowflake sharing, Databricks delta sharing), but quickly hit a wall when the need arises to support scalable, low-latency pipelines across tenants on more than 1 platform/region permutation. Maintaining data integrity and reliability at scale across platforms can be a very tough challenge, especially with any reasonable volume. All that to say: you're right that it's a real and difficult problem to solve.I'm biased (I'm one of the founders of Prequel, where we do something similar to what you're talking about), but hopefully I can also be pretty helpful on the topic -- let me know if there are any questions I can help with.Also, the Pontoon team put together a helpful feature comparison matrix among the players in the market (though they recently discontinued work on the project): [https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon?tab=readme-ov-file#pontoon-vs-other-etl--reverse-etl-platforms](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon?tab=readme-ov-file#pontoon-vs-other-etl--reverse-etl-platforms)",

Assuming an appropriate First Time Setup was done to do PGP style security with private/public token.Most companies roll out highly inefficient APIs and refuse direct query-to-DB access because their SaaS model is multi-tenant and they don't want us doing Select \\* on a table without a Where clause or at least a LIMIT 10000.However, you're proposing to be a middleman?

Now that all Snowpipe/Snowpipe streaming is a fixed price (0.0037 Credits per GB), it should be easier to see what your costs will be regardless of the number of files. Generally Snowpipe will be cheaper, but your time is worth something too. As you mention, Snowpipe can support schema evolution with ENABLE\\_SCHEMA\\_EVOLUTION = TRUE. But if you need more granular control, I could see scenarios where you might want to do it your way. Bottom line, get an understanding of GB/hour for data coming in so you'll be able to answer the cost differential between the two approaches. If it is a lot of data, the difference might be fairly small. Good luck!",

Then build additional steps that extract the data from BigQuery and do more complex transformations on it.If you don't care about access to the raw data, just do all your transformation steps between the json ingestion and Bigquery.Also, if you just want to cache your json, you don't necessarily have to convert it into a BQ table. You can just store the json in an unstructured data format in something like an AWS S3 Bucket or GCS before you begin processing the JSON into a dataframe for BQ.Also, if you're already working with pandas, I would recommend looking into polars. It's like pandas, but newer and faster (built on rust) and it comes with some features that make validation and type casting a bit more intuitive.Last thing, depending on your usecase, casting everything to a string has pros and cons. You might end up losing data as a result. For example, if you have a datetime column that you cast into a string and back, you lose any non-represented data like timezone that you can't get back anymore. I personally like maintaining the typing as close to the data source as possible.",

For pipelines like this that have been stable for decades, the biggest risk is changing logic that no one fully remembers the edge cases for.What I’ve seen work better in similar situations is a phased approach. Keep the Pro C transformations intact initially by containerizing or running them in a controlled environment, then focus on validating inputs and outputs aggressively. Once you have parity and confidence in the data, you can start peeling off pieces of the transformation logic incrementally instead of all at once.Modernizing is valuable, but preserving correctness first usually buys you time and reduces risk, especially when the business depends on this pipeline behaving exactly the same way it has for years.",

        "body": "All excellent questions.1. Cost and speed - I’m in the process of running benchmarks against progressively larger databases. So far, I’m seeing a maximum 10% overhead in storage for the VCS on the database. Cost is dependent on your architecture, but if we’re going with Aurora RDS, it’s dependent on IOPS. This solution uses Copy-on-Write, so there is an increase in IOPS over just running against production, but less than simply copying all the data. Since it’s also delta-based, the IOPS are only upserts, but those are ran twice (once on the branch, once on the merge into main).2. Difference with Git - generally, you don’t store data in Git outside of small test sets. This is a branch that essentially allows you to run your code in production without ever actually touching production. You connect to the same database, so you don’t need to modify your connection (beyond minor branch variables with can be set via environment). Subsetting your data can result in edge case failures since a subset by definition doesn’t include every case. 3. Blame - you can track blame for every record, every column and row, every constraint just by querying rather than digging into the CDC or building a proper SCD pipeline. 4. Silver bullet solution - that right there is the reason behind this post. I want genuine feedback from the community. I have worked at several jobs where this would be incredibly useful, but that’s only my limited experience. I know there are other, more targeted solutions for the various problems. I wanted to get a sense of others’ experiences to see if this addresses a genuine broad need, or if it’s overkill for the majority of problems. One issue I’ve faced constantly is the introduction of bad data into the production database via improperly structured code which might look fine in git but fails in weird ways when applied to the entire database. This allows you to not just review a PR of the code, but also a PR of the data changes at the same time.",

        "body": "Interesting, I do a lot of work with dev teams around logging, what I’ve found works for us is being clear on the exact code change, logic and format of it. We even help write test cases for them in some cases. We also have dev data flow into our data lake so we can validate and iterate dev data before production so it doesn’t break or mess anything up.This has taken a while to get into strong place for a lot of teams such as buy in from stakeholders, value output and context around what the code does so we can advise on the change, especially around the logger and implementation.For the case of having it tied to git sounds interesting, but we are large org, hundreds of repos and already well defined process for releasing code changes (not necessarily tied to data) so to add have the data change linked to PR would be difficult I think for us to introduce as the there’s a lot of teams, infrastructure and processing for us to validate. Ways we have gone to improve the feedback loop is to get the data show back to people as possible. So getting dev data back, tools to view logs as interactions happen and pushing to be advisors/partners on the logging side. Also running QA checks and validation on dev data to catch drift early has been a massive help to catch things. This is generally through strict types like struct types in spark or pydantic etcThis generally means data engineers try to partner with teams for a log change and setting guidelines and docs on best practices to follow for teams to be self serve. Once a change is implemented, DEs integrate and transform data for other downstream teams and analysts to consume.Definitely not a perfect solution, but has worked well for us. Starting over tomorrow, would I consider a data vcs? Maybe as a trial to experiment but probably not. Data is generally later phase concern when building a product/service unless the data is your product, but usually not the case.Having had to built a service for users and already a key stakeholder of the logging implementation, time spent on data logging was tough to prioritize as needed something built and out the door and made more sense to do after release as a follow up.Having typed structure really has been the biggest help. Working with developers, have a well defined data type not only helps data products but also helps developers to work with. This means everyone is all largely speaking the same “language” and centralizes the source of truth like what a data vcs brings",

It often depends on the source system, the amount of changes, and the way they structure data. Sometimes an incremental load is not even possible. If we want to talk about \"in practice\" my suggestion is to be aware of the alternatives, so that you already have a plan in case you need to change the way you load data.I would start with cloud functions, but having already in mind what are the changes needed to redeploy the ingestion code with cloud jobs.

Async mechanisms in languages like Python and JavaScript use single-threaded, event-driven, queue-based mechanisms. They help to simplify the design of asynchronous systems where you send a lot of time waiting on network traffic, disk reads, or user input. Async does not run anything in parallel, and you will not see any performance improvements from in; in fact, overuse of async methods in tight loops can significantly harm performance due to the added overhead of the event queue.Part of why async design is popular in Python and JavaScript is because threads really suck in those languages. The existence of the global interpreter lock in Python <3.14 severely limits how well threads can perform, and worker threads are a huge pain to manage in JavaScript. There's much less incentive to use async in languages where threads are efficient and the language has good thread management mechanisms.",

Request came in, and as we processed the page, we'd make database requests, wait for the response, build more page, do more requests, etc. Not great. If you had a long loading page, it might takes 20 seconds or more to load.So we got async. Async was cool because now when a request comes in, I serve you a template and give you some URLs in my API to query. Each makes its own specific action and on completion does something else. Page loads in 0.5s, most of your data is there in <1s, and that one long 15-second query stalling out the old page eventually loads in when ready. Great!However, we ended up with edge cases. Your page loads a complex tab that needs data from 5 dynamic drop-downs that it also has to load data for. That's 5 requests that all get triggering in serial using async or .thens (aka callback hell), or you could hope for the best and occasionally end up with a race condition and a failed load.So we got promises. Honestly, for >90% of use cases, it just improved handling with then, catch, finally, etc. But it also enabled us to use Promise.all where we could cleanly write code, where we could call some nonsense like: function foo() { Promise.all([ getUserDropdownData(), getCityDropdownData(), getStateDropdownData(), getDepartmentDropdownData(), getSomeOtherData() ]) .then(values => { //doesn't execute until all of the above data is loaded const [userData, cityData, statedata, deptData, otherData] = values; buildUserDataDropdown(userData); buildCityDataDropdown(cityData); buildStateDataDropdown(stateData); buildDeptDataDropdown(deptData); buildOtherDataDropdown(otherData); }) .then(() => { //doesn't execute until we're done building all the dropdowns refreshTableData(); //...might have to add a 1ms timeout to grab default values accurately }) } /* disclaimer, I half tested this real quick with timeouts, may or may not work, example only */You would literally be tearing your eyes out to do that without promises; I'm talking 3-4x that many lines of code to sync all of it up. Also, with overhead, you might be waiting \\~200ms for each request, so your drop-downs load in \\~220ms instead of \\~1000ms. Now we can cleanly make those requests in parallel without fear of race conditions, and request our table data even faster.We also got web workers; because Javascript is single-threaded it just executes whatever is at the top of the stack. If I have to do something that counts to...1 billion, that'll block the top of the stack while it counts, locking the rest of the page. If I assign it to a worker, the worker gets a separate thread from my main JS thread to do its task.And that's all I'm gonna say because I took way too long typing this.",

Multithreading can.> Are async/event-driven models actually better for most scalable backends?Async is just a way to have a suspendable function. For backend, the theory is that we spend a lot of time waiting for slow IO. OS-provided threads tend to be heavyweight (e.g. every thread reserves memory for its call stack, and that tends to be O(MB) for each thread). So using them just to wait for slow IO is wasteful. If we instead move all that into userspace, we can avoid a lot of that overhead.> Or is this more about developer experience than performance?It's both, although async/await also has some downsides (mainly [the function coloring problem](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)). Some languages / runtimes (like Erlang, Go, and Java) manage to avoid the function coloring problem.> A lot of blogs and talks make it sound like classic multithreading (threads, locks, shared state) is something people are actively trying to avoidI maintain that async is susceptible to many of the same issues that multithreaded code is susceptible to, but at a more coarse-grained level. If you have shared data that is being operated on by two in-flight `async` calls, then they will interleave with each other in unpredictable ways. You still want tools to e.g. block one async function from resuming while a different async function is busy updating some shared data.Because async/await has well-defined preemption points, you're not going to have a single memory location that is being read from and written to at the same time. But you _could_ be in the middle of updating a complex structure. Perhaps it's in an inconsistent state, but you need to call an async function before you can put it back in a consistent state. That's basically the same problem that exists in classical threading, with the same solution - you want something like a mutex.There's a reason that Go and Java (with virtual threads) both have mutex types, despite both supporting colorless async.

Both utilise concepts of synchronous and asynchronous operations in their own ways, and in HPC applications I work on we use them for different purposes.In practice it can also depend on how well a specific library implements a concept (for instance, we are working with an I/O library that in principle supports async reading, however it doesn't do much for performance because of how it's written).My advice would be to learn how to profile your code and measure its performance to see what actually works. Everything else is a guessing game :slightly_smiling_face:P.S. Forgot to say, it's worth trying to assess the flow of data in your application. In my experience, people tend to spend a lot of time on optimising compute performance, only to be tanked by issues arising from data movements and volume.",

        "body": "SQL injection happens when you are able to identify that the receiving application does not sanitize the user input or limit permissions levels before passing it to the database (application is what authenticates to the database, not the end user). Take the following as an example loophole. The common SQL injection came from login pages, meaning the application would accept a username and password from the end user, then will check the database for matching records.An example of a poor and vulnerable way to handle the input / login process would be something like`Select TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = '{input.username}' AND Password = '{input.password}';`then accepting the record returned as the 'authenticated' user. Now, lets look at how the resulting query would work for a normal input as well as a malicious input. Lets say I put in \"John@Doe.com\" as the username and \"RubberDucky\" as the password. The application would pass the following to the database`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'John@Doe.com' AND Password = 'RubberDucky'`fair enough, now what happens if i put in a username of \"Admin';--\"? The application would pass the following `SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'Admin';-- ' AND Password = 'RubberDucky';`The database will return the first user that has the username of \"Admin\" and consider it to be authenticated because ' will finish my string input, \";\" would terminate the SQL command, and \"--\" comments out the rest to prevent any kind of syntax errors. that is just a very basic example. Another example i found in production (i work for this company and had permission) was they created an API that would allow you to pass in a SQL query to generate custom reports and such (HORRIBLE IDEA btw). To make it \"secure\" they used pattern matching and prevented commands like \"UPDATE\", \"DELETE\", \"\\*\", etc. So as a proof of concept, i encoded my query in b64 and passed in a query that would decode and execute it to create tables, dump SQL user names, dump stored CC info, etc. I have also seen people do it in HEX Once you start spotting potential holes like this, the possibilities are endless as to what you can do.

The front end then sends the name to the back end to retrieve the stats.Let's say the backend does an SQL query on the database like \"SELECT \\* FROM Students WHERE Name = '$name'\".Normally this works great. But what if I type the following:Robert'; DROP TABLE Students;Now the SQL query on the backend looks like this:SELECT \\* FROM Students WHERE Name = 'Robert'; DROP TABLE Students;When that is executed, it will search for Robert in the database, and then it will wipe all the data out.Of course you can do more advanced things other than deleting stuff in the database. You can add other queries to try to extract more information than the website would otherwise allow. You can probe the database for other tables, like maybe asking if there is a list of credit card numbers. You can get really fancy like querying to see if any columns start with the letter \"A\" or \"B\" or \"C\" and so on, and if you do enough of those queries you can reconstruct the schema for the database and discover all sorts of interesting things.I wrote a simple website one that had a shell injection vulnerability. It was a great way to learn, and I felt really dumb when someone pointed it out to me, but I'm super glad they did! Using a similar attack against my website, someone could have executed arbitrary shell script code on the backend as the www user. I learned the value of always aggressively sanitizing my inputs.",

And that's where the application has access to the database. It uses a pool of connections that will just execute any command you give it.

They just \"hack\" until it works. > this is purely educational because I honestly don't understand it?There are many books about this. You really have to see how 90ies PHP websites were made to understand how insecure it all was. Note that it's only possible in very old libraries that let you just create strings containing sql queries that you then execute. Wo now use templates and make sure that user input is checked and always passed as a certain type (string, number, date etc). You can't just pass \"1' AND 1; --\" and have it be inserted into \"select \\* from users where username = '%s' password = '%s'\". And we salt and has the passwords, if there even are any.

From everything I’ve seen about the game, I truly believe you have achieved the best educational game I have ever seen. Most educational games have some clunky mechanics around the “learning” part and just aren’t fun and I feel like they justify themselves as “it’s boring but it’s educational”. Your game seems to be really fun and the mechanics around “programming a robot farm” is genius in my opinion. I wish I was starting my programming journey to enjoy your game with fresh eyes. Overall, really nice job!!!",

There isn't much reason to worry about learning particularly languages at this point, but rather make sure you are learning the common fundamental concepts shared by all of them.There are jobs out there for pretty much any programming language, but being able to pick up new ones quickly is important. The requirements of the project usually dictate what language(s) might be best for the project. The knowledge already in a team also plays a big part. But people able to switch and learn new languages is a really common task.For an example, I applied for a job that used Ruby. I had no Ruby experience, but it took me less than a week (of non-intensive) practice to be able to get a job offer from them. I was even up-front that I had no professional Ruby experience. It really doesn't matter, because 95%+ of languages all share similar concepts, so switching between them is easy.For now, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Work with whatever languages are interesting to you. C# is a solid choice with a lot of businesses using it.",

For example \"ZOO-123: Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" This ties that commit with Jira ticket ZOO-123 that either is about changes to RabbitMQ messaging or about fixing an issue with said messaging.Also, some companies use conventional commits. It is just a way of formatting your commit message so that automated tools can process commits in an easier way. Read about it from [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) An example would be \"fix(ZOO-123): Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" There the fix() keyword shows that the commit was for fixing something. A feat() keyword can be for adding a new feature or for working with some new functionality. For example \"feat(SCHOOL-23): Add Japanese language.\"The commit message itself is often in imperative present tense. For example \"Fix to\" instead of \"Fixed\". The commit should give a summary of the change. What was done. Keep it concise and clear. Do not add a whole essay. But also do not just write \"Added more changes.\" Which changes? Why? Read about it from [https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3](https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3) Avoid frustration and all kind of nonsense in the commits. Yes, when the stuff does not work and your earlier commit did not fix it then writing \"Get working already!!!!!\" or \"wgo8g7tfwo82w37fdto238gd\" is not a rational way how to deal with the issue. It is unprofessional. In the previous company I worked at, we had one guy who raged in his commit messages.Avoid adding too many details. Instead of writing \"Fix to UserNotificationIntegrationTest, BillingIntegrationTest, BaseIntegrationTest, RabbitMQPublisherIntegrationTest\" better pick \"Fix to integration tests\". Which tests, that can be seen from the git commit itself. Neither go with \"Added an email support to UserNotificationService by introducing emailSender() method that uses angus-mail library\" just write \"Add support to send user notifications via email\" Some good and bad examples are in [https://chris.beams.io/git-commit](https://chris.beams.io/git-commit) Also, it does not really help when you finish your whole project and then add it via a single commit that has a commit message of \"Initial commit\".",

That means knowing when to write code and when to use fancy auto-complete with an LLM, and even then it's not necessary. Sure someone might say \"you'll get left behind if you don't adopt the latest tech\" but that doesn't mean you have to vibe code everything. Also...its not hard to learn how to tell a computer to do something. I have GitHub Copilot. I sometimes use it to write a comment about a thing I want to do with a query or whatever, and it does it, then I check it and move on.Coding is really just 90% maintaining code, and 10% writing it. Making that 10% faster does not matter nearly as much as your inherent ability to do the rest...and you'll be better at that if you don't rely on LLMs as a crutch.",

You can try the beta of [File Pilot](https://filepilot.tech/) to see the difference to Microsoft's File Explorer and how much of a deal this difference makes when it comes to user experience.Any future product that puts an emphasis on performance will easily beat any market leader that has worse performance. People will just switch to the faster product.This change is supported by the recent development of new languages designed to make performant software easier to write. So you'll see more products written in C, Go, zig, Odin, and Jai. This also means that OOP will become less important and you will see paradigms shift towards Data Oriented Design (DOD) and architectures like Entity Component Systems (ECS) or even \"fat structs\".",

A lot of experienced programmers actually bounce off game-like tutorials once they are past the basics. What tends to work well is a small project with constraints, like recreating a simple game, automating something he already cares about, or modding an existing system he uses. That gives him feedback loops, problem solving, and room to explore a language deeply. If you want to support it as a gift, hardware, books with real projects, or even just time and encouragement to build something slightly ambitious often go further than any dedicated learning game.",

A Rasberry Pi!If he is into hardware programming, [https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/), maybe he would want a Rasberry Pi. It's a small micro-computer he can use for personal projects. May take a bit to deliver.. It could cost a 'bit' depending on which micro-computer you get.3. Games & SoftwareRealistically, there aren't many that could serve as a Christmas gift... Most of those types of resources are already available for free online! If there is a Coursera or Udemy course that's paid, or if he would like a subscription to a learning platform like [https://www.boot.dev/dashboard](https://www.boot.dev/dashboard), that could fit your question, but maybe that wouldn't work as a Christmas gift. These types of softwares are often subscription-based, so it might run up your bill...You could get him one of these softwares if he asks, but maybe that's something for another time!\\---Me, personally, I would get him a nice book. You could use one of my suggestions, or something else. A raspberry pi is also a nice option. Make a nice gift basket, get him some nice books, put in some plushies if you want. Place in some gift cards to his favorite mobile / console games. Maybe some new clothes. Books + fun stuff, it would make a perfect gift. :) Merry Christmas, thanks for helping your son's learning.",

We make them behave the way we want them to behave (to solve a specific problem that demands said behaviour). A queue behaves in a circular way because that’s what we need to do, on the machine level there is no circular behaviour, like i sais, data is just stacked like books on a table.To understand how do we create such behaviours out of memory slots and most importantly why, you need a low enough language to see what’s going under the hood, otherwise it will look like magic. So i recommend trying to implement them in C going from integers to graphs and trees. Moving to a high level language like python will be a piece of cake and you will be better than most who started there. I recommend the book Algorithmes in C, it is quite extensive, so don’t read in bulk and if you really need to know how the machine works, start with Introduction to computing systems, it is written by the creator of the LC-3, for educational purposes.

It can be done in Python, but typically, Python offers \"too much\" and makes it too easy, not really giving a solid view of what goes into DSA, in my opinion.)If I were you, I'd audit a course on DSA if you feel that it would strengthen your knowledge of the subject instead of enrolling in it. Auditing is a great way to review or to learn new concepts without the pressure of assignments and exams with deadlines.I'm surprised you took a course on web programming: it's a landscape that changes so fast that by the time you've started the course, what you're learning is probably already obsolete. the others sound pretty standard for a CS curriculum, but not learning advanced algorithms or the theory of computability (unless you covered that in discrete math, which seems unlikely) seems like glaring omissions.Another option would be to pick up a book on DSA and work through it at your own pace... that undirected learning style doesn't work for everyone, though, so pick what works best for you, but yes, a solid foundation in DSA is very important to have: knowing what data structures and algorithms to pick and why is something that I would consider essential.",

Remember that most programming languages do only one thing at a time, and even fairly simple tasks like asking the user to enter a number, and printing it back, requires a lot of individual steps.The program you have written performs these steps:1. Print a message to the user, asking to \"Input a number: \"2. Reads a number entered by the user3. Prints a new message to the user, saying \"Your number: \" followed by the number the user enteredThen there's a lot of additional \"invisible\" steps, like storing the number in a variable - creating a \"Scanner\" that is apparently some tool to get input from the user, and also a lot about importing that and creating a class and some magic incantation \"public static void main\" that probably doesn't make any sense.But keep the main focus on the steps you want the program to execute, and gradually understand how to write them, and what extra \"invisible steps\" you need to add!And when in doubt about something particular - ask about that particular thing.",

It takes more time to write *and* to read while adding no useful information.* It introduces a maintenance burden, as changes to functionality must be mirrored in comments.* It tends to introduce confusion and even bugs, because sooner or later someone *will* update code without remembering to mirror the changes in comments, and then someone *will* wrongly assume that the comment is correct.Therefore, you should never say anything in a comment if it is adequately clear from a symbol’s *name* (e.g. function or variable name), or from its type. (Of course, when generating documentation or tool hints, it may make sense to include a brief summary even if it’s strictly redundant, e.g. the description of the `dirname` parameter above is fine; but I’d remove the bit about being a `char**`). If you can rename a variable and thereby make a comment redundant, you should rename the variable and delete the comment—self-documenting code is best!What’s most important to include in comments is whatever is *least* obvious from reading the code. If you’re doing something counterintuitive because arcane conditions make it an important performance consideration, then mention that. If a calculation is just really complex and confusing, explain the reasoning. But don’t needlessly *restate* what the code already says: it is at best a waste of time, and at worst actively harmful.",

I was signed up to NuCamp's newsletter and got an email that my city was offering a retraining scholarship, which meant I'd only have to pay $600 for 7 months of classes. Hard to pass that up.I did NuCamp from September 2024 to March 2025. It's designed to be a part-time program that you can do while you have a full-time job, but I'm not sure how realistic that is. I quit my job and went all in when we started React. Before the BootCamp, I was in tutorial hell, having done Free Code Camp, Harvard CS50, Odin Project, YouTube, and Udemy classes. I'll say that even with all that prep, the BootCamp was a firehose of information, and by the end of it, I was exhausted. I liked the classes. Most of the teachers I had were good. The Jobs class they offered was total trash IMO, but that could have been because of the teacher, who felt more like a social media influencer. That class did force me to finish my portfolio website, so it wasn't all bad. Their Discord is actively shouting out jobs. I ended up taking a few more months after class to wrap my head around React and get better at JavaScript by building projects and doing CodeWars. Over a year after starting, I'm now studying Front End Dev questions I pulled from GreatFrontEnd and dabbling with LeetCode, which has been incredibly frustrating. At best, I've probably got another six months of practice and projects before I'd be hireable, but realistically, I'm thinking I've got another year. I'm an artist, so this stuff comes slowly to me. Since you're already doing analytics, I'm guessing it will be faster for you.If you do the BootCamp, my advice is to do personal projects with people in your cohort. That was probably the MOST beneficial part of the BootCamp. Looking at my group's code and trying to make everything work together really forced me to understand it and broke me out of tutorial hell.Another tip I'd give is to grab a BootCamp class off of Udemy when it's discounted and work your way through it to see how you do. Just make sure you're doing your own personal project after every tutorial project.Hope this is helpful. Good luck!",

I have heard similar stories about other online bootcamps here in the UK but someone else might have a more positive experience with them. In hindsight I should’ve paid for the more expensive courses that included in person classes/exams as I think there would be more structure. Either that or should’ve gone with something more well known (Lewagon for example). IMO the most valuable thing I gained from the experience was due to the project based assessment, it gave me a git history, portfolio and talking points in interviews.",

Some people have learned the \"single return\" style and stick with that.Others prefer the \"return early to handle error conditions\" style, which has its advantages.Most people seem to miss that the two styles are not mutually exclusive. It's certainly possible to handle errors early without an early return. Though, it usually means that we need to do one of two \"not nice\" things stylistically: (a) we need to increase indentation for the non-error case, or (b) we need to use a goto at the error point (or throw an exception), which many people find not nice, but rarely say the explicit reason for their aversion to it.In your particular example that you cited, the early return is not really an \"error case\", though, so in this particular example, placing both the returns at the same indentation level (i.e. one within in the \"if\" branch and the other within the \"else\" branch) would make the \\*intent\\* slightly clearer.Now, suppose you wanted to amend the function and include some kind of \"error condition\" like for the value 0 (which is mathematically neither even nor odd). In such a case like that, then in my opinion it would be clearer to use an early return for that, since doing so \"idiomatically\" expresses the idea that this kind of situation is an unexpected or unusual case. I.e., maybe the caller made some kind of mistake by asking whether 0 is even or odd, because logically that may make no sense, so maybe it's a mistake that it was asked.Once the \"error returns\" are taken care of, the rest of the code can basically assume (correctly) that the value in question is \"correct\" in terms of logicality. I.e. for this function it means the rest of the code can assume we are dealing with non-zero quantities, which almost always helps analyzing the correctness of the algorithm.",

What happens if an email address doesn't match the \"`isValidEmailAddress`\" check?It's a bit easier to read, both in terms of lowering mental strain and indenting depth, if you take simple cases and pull them out like this: // Try to guess the user's first name, return a generic name if it can't be inferred String guessFirstNameFromEmail(String emailAddress) { if (!isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress)) { return \"Alex\"; } if (username == \"\") { return \"Sam\"; } if (username.contains(\".\")) { return username.split(\".\")[0]; } if (hasUpperAndLowerLetterMix(username)) { return username.splitBy(SplitMethod.CapitalLetters)[0]; } return username; }In the lower case, it's more of a series of deductions - you're considering your assumptions first, and it reads more like getting \"weird\" cases out of the way first (bad input, empty string, etc...).",

For that reason, we'll have one return at the end of the function, and use a temporary variable to store the return value. You don't need to have a crazy nested if-else structure for this. Just set the temporary return variable to some value (like null) when you create it. As soon as you hit a return situation, set the variable to some non-null value.

My bicycle has particular values for those attributes and methods. It has a lower seat height than my neighbour’s bike. It is a different colour from hers.Those are the basic concepts. Now you just need to learn syntax and practice using it. 1) How do I make a class with a certain name in my favourite programming language? 2) How do I give it attributes and methods? 3) How do I make an instance of that class (an object)? 4) How do I make a subclass of that class?",

        "body": "The basic idea is: every program consists of objects that have properties and do things. Sometimes they interact with each other. Sometimes they even make more objects.Then there are four \"pillars\": encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.1. Encapsulation is when an object's properties are hidden to the public, and optionally only exposed through some kind of filter. These are most commonly seen as `get` and `set` methods.2. Inheritance is when one type of object is a \"subclass\" of another (\"superclass\"), so every property and method of the latter also belongs to the former. 3. Abstraction is when you hide the internals of how something works, and just expose the inputs and outputs. This is far from exclusive to OOP; chances are you're already used to this. 4. Polymorphism is when you refer to the same object using different types to get different information from it. In the same \"subclass\" relationship used for inheritance, every object of type subclass is also of type superclass.That's it, that's OOP! Now practice those ideas with C++ since you know the basics of it already. It's very conducive to object-oriented programming - in fact, in college, my advanced OOP class was all C++. If you want examples, just ask, I can help.",

Think about a struct having pointers to functions as fields instead of functions receiving pointers to structs as parameters. It's a bit more complicated because the pointers to functions are stored in a separate v-table, but it should help you understand the idea of objects.OOP has a lot of downsides, starting with inheritance not working out at all as it was thought it would. I would recommend watching [The Big OOPs - Anatomy of a 35-Year Mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo84LFzx5nI) before learning OOP, so you approach learning about OOP knowing that it's not a good idea.",

Honestly, I felt lost at first because I didn’t have projects or clients for these skills. What seriously helped turn things around was using this detailed portfolio guide at https://kcrouch8.gumroad.com/l/Port. It walked me through building project ideas from scratch and even gave templates so I could show off skills I was learning.

Java has a strongly implied folder structure. Holy shit the directories: com.foo.bar.domain.entities.baz…Look at other projects and try things out. Use a nice IDE (IntelliJ) that makes it easy to refactor and move things around when you realize you don’t like how you organized it (I have been doing this the past few days).As for when to break up functions: as much as you can. Some early advice I got from an AWS engineer was: “if you want something to scale and be maintainable, it has to be made of small pieces.”Good codebases grow. Good codebases eventually become mazes. As a programmer, I try to imagine another programmer (likely myself later on) landing at this function as if being dropped in a maze: how long will it take them to understand where they are.I can’t really give them a good, complete map. But I can try my best to make it so that at each intersection (at each function), it is obvious which way to go. I can make it so that they do not need to spend time looking around, exploring, reasoning, guessing, and backtracking. A good function is understandable immediately, either:- accomplishing something simple in relatively few lines of code- or listing a series of other functions (each doing a simple thing in relatively few lines of code) like a recipe in relatively few lines of code.There are no points for being clever or obscuring what your code is doing. Boring, obvious code is good code.There are certainly times where it makes sense/is easier to just have a big long method.But I have found no predictor for how many bugs a function will produce more accurate than its length. I have gotten paid many dollars to debug big long methods and break them into manageable, readable, *unit-testable* pieces.",

You just answered a real question: \"this file should not be publicly accessible\"From there, the same thing keeps happening:* group by technical role: MVC-style architectures* group by feature/resource: modular architecturesHexagonal, clean architecture, MVC, etc. are not things you start with. They’re names we gave later to patterns that emerge when you keep asking:* Who is allowed to call this?* What changes together?* What should not depend on what?If you end up with a 500-line file, that’s not failure: it’s usually the signal that the next split is becoming visible somehow.",

A ton of them are just web apps. I shit thee not, you turn a key, that kiosk opens up to reveal a regular ass touchscreen computer with a keyboard underneath. No specialized hardware. Web pages can be set to fullscreen & remove search functionality without the use of a keyboard. Works perfectly. If the 'kiosk' has more graphically intensive features (like maybe it's an interactive map of a museum with 3D models of attractions) you might even see a game engine like unreal. But typically that's overkill.",

Anyways, it is impossible to google, because all the results are just people reacting to something in a MacDonalds :)I'd recommend playing around with React, and try to build your own version of a kiosk-interface - even if it isn't exactly the same, it is a perfectly find learning-project. And once you get the hang of the frontend, the kiosk itself, you can get started on the backend, which could be anything, but is probably some REST API running on either Java or C# - but that is purely guesswork!",

All of these routes are valid options and many self taught programmers were made from them.I found Udemy better fit for me because it explains the theory in videos with examples and then puts you into test with an exercise or a project (at least in the courses I had).Like others said, In programming you are going to need to read in order learn something on the go more often than not. Not from the comfort of your room, but in the office while you work for example. You won't pull headphones to watch any videos there. For now it looks like cs50 or a Udemy course would be a better fit for you. But in the end it doesn't matter much. After the tutorials is where the hard part begins and there are no videos there.

        "body": "Just a bit of advice and perspective:First, you can access the videos from Free Code Camp's Concepts [here](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecampconcepts/videos) They have said they may be removed at any point in time, so look into a YT Downloader or some such. Their main YT channel also has several long video tutorials and crash-courses to my knowledge.There is also lots of videos all over YouTube about most programming topics / concepts, computer science, as well as specific tutorials on projects.Second, unfortunately, reading is just a part of programming as I am sure you're aware. You're going to have to read requirements of projects and their documentation, as well as write it. You're going to have to read code and genuinely try to understand it, both the functions and the larger whole. You're going to have to read documentation of the programming languages, tools, and APIs you're using.I'm not saying that to shame you, God knows, I barely read books. But reading is very much a part of programming, from the learning to the actual process of doing.Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp are both what I have experience with. They're both solid platforms, and I'd probably complete FCC first, and then circle back to Odin Project and see about the gaps and more advanced knowledge it covers. One of the big advantages is that it is fairly unguided and gives you a set of objectives to complete. This forces you to think about what you're doing, how and why, as well as forcing you to acquire knowledge and documentation just like you would on any real project.At that point, I'd probably just try making projects. Maybe dabble in a game engine like Godot because of its lightweight nature, GDScript which is very easy to read and write, and ability to do web exports for Itch.IO. Hell you can even use it to make applications / tools, not games, but I digress.I'm just not sure what to suggest that can fulfill that video requirement, besides trying a hybrid approach. Try to at least read the highlights and general idea of a topic, and then look for some videos about it, maybe practical examples. Don't force yourself to deathmarch paragraph after paragraph, but I don't know if you can truly avoid reading either.I'm sure others know more, I mostly learned by messing around modding games, reading books, nibbling on these tutorial sites and such. Best of luck.",

Otherwise I'm using it for boilerplate code which rarely needs comments, or just having it spit out a few examples of something I haven't used before, which I rarely use in production without significant modification, if at all, so again, no comments, just a good prompt. With AI, I find it much easier to look at 10-50 lines at a time and make sure it doing ok rather than having to stare at a ton of lines all at once and try to redirect it after it's gotten way ahead of itself.If you're using an in-ide agent I can see where the comments could help it continue on to fill out the function/file, but I just personally prefer to keep my AI on a short leash.Plus, I tend to work with a lot of aging code that needs to be refactored and it gets touchy.

Each programming language has its own purpose (more or less general one) As you came from a c or c++ background, probably c# could work perfectly to stay on the c “world”. Yes, i know i know… C# is very different language, but it allows scripting (old .csx and modern file-based apps in net10), pointers, memory management… all powered with oop and all that modern stuff. So… if you know the programming basics it should be “easy” to learn any “modern” language. In my humble opinion, Javascript is a very different paradigm language even it shares the basics such as conditionals, loops, etc… the underground concepts (prototypes, dom management…) are completely different in other languages, is like comparing apples with oranges even though those are fruits, are very different. You mention python, and this makes me go to the first question, depends on what your looking for. If you just want to learn some programming language, you can roll the dice and choose one randomly, else, you should choose your goal and see what options works best for that.",

Something like \"as an admin I would like to be able to see a list of orders so that I can quickly see the status of current orders\". In any case, user stories are also not acceptance criteria, which are more specific things which must be present in order for a ticket to be done. Sometimes things are vague and you have to fill in details based on your understanding of the purpose of the ticket; however, if things are too vague you need to have a discussion to make more detailed ACs. ACs should cover: inputs (clicks, path parameters, query parameters, etc), authentication/authorization (which types of users can do this, what happens if it is not authorized), outputs (status codes, formats such as JSON/XML, schema), how to handle error states (bad inputs, server errors, etc.), validation, navigation (what happens after a user clicks a thing). They won't necessarily cover everything, but everything that they don't cover should be \"dealer's choice\", i.e. they shouldn't matter to the end user, if they do, then it should be in the AC.For your example:AC1: Make a GET endpoint /orders that returns a JSON response matching the schema ... AC2: It should take the following query parameters AC3: It should only be accessible from Orkes in the web service, authenticated by ... AC4: If query param is invalid it should return a 400 status with an error message matching ... AC5: If not authenticated, it should return a 403 status with an error message matching ... ...",

This is bad because it means the story can't be worked if Geoff is on vacation, but it can be good in a way because if Geoff writes too much detail, he might cross over into dictating design and implementation details and you don't want that, either.My middle ground is this: the lead (or a designate) takes such a story while it's still on the backlog and attaches all the subtasks that dev can recognize, including the design step that includes getting details from the people who have them. The lead can do this accurately; a junior dev probably can't, but repeating this process is part of the way they learn about the system and the organization.By the time the story gets to the top of the backlog, if there isn't enough information to actually start the work, there should at least be enough breadcrumbs in it that a junior knows what to do to get that information.",

Set your pointer to + 0x100 and start converting.Here is some help to start...Now this isn't the complete 8086 instruction set to C as several 8086 instructions have different instructions based on different registers. The \"#\" is the separator for the number of different instructions that one 8086 instruction could have. You will need to write your own C functions for Push(), Pop() values on to and off from a stack that you create as well as a heap. But this is a start for you. When you complete a de-compile of a program, you will be an expert C programmer. I hope this helps.",

I treat notes like an index, not a textbook. When I learn something I save one small example that actually runs, plus a short explanation in my own words, tagged by problem type, like “async patterns” or “validation”. Months later I almost never remember the details, but I remember that I have a snippet or note for it and can reload it in a minute.The other thing that sticks is using the concept in a tiny real project once or twice instead of only in course exercises. If a tool or language never shows up in my real work after that, I accept that it is fine for it to live in cold storage in my notes.",

It does not have to be the next Oxford University or such. Just try to pick a local state college known for its CS program. Often colleges and universities that have \"Technical\" or \"Tech\" in its name are more likely to have also a better CS program. But that is just my subjective observation. Or pick a university that is contributing to scientific research and projects.No point to tough it out and then get a degree that is pretty much void in its quality. If a course in the study program is just a FreeCodeCamp then that is a red flag in my eyes. Seek quality over cheapness/remote lessons/??? At best you are getting very basic knowledge and skills. At worst you get a joke college/university on your CV that is known for its low quality. Where I am from, we had one private college like this. Cheap, accepted all the foreign students. But its quality was really bad. In the end it was closed down. I jokingly called it a place where one could get his Bachelor degree in being a janitor.",

With respect to googling, IMHO, trying to code without an internet connection is madness. I myself often google the basics when I haven't used them in a while or to confirm I am remembering things correctly. If you switch languages a lot, you might start using the wrong syntax and I have to check that from time to time.When watching tutorials, hopefully you're coding along with them and then trying to do something a bit different which isn't in the tutorial and adapting what you learned to your problem. One little project that I would do using different web technologies was a little contact manager. That's not a typical tutorial example, but it's not much more complicated than a lot of them. Perhaps you could go into a little more detail about what you're trying to do. Going into specifics might help you learn something or at least how to find the answer.",

The best books are often out of date in some ways, and although they are a great resource for \"How\" and \"Why\", you will also need an up-to-date source of information. I have been using w3schools, and although they may or may not be the best that can be found, my hope is that it will bridge the gap between the great books on the subject and the recent changes to the language. I know and use HTML and CSS pretty well, and I am to the point where I can look up the raw features of it to figure out how to do what I want (when it is something I have not done often or at all); I am sure there will come a point where I can get to where I do not need the book (or lessons) to figure out how to do something with the language. So...short answer, it is just part of learning. Do not feel fake or inferior. And, definitely, you learn by doing. Watching videos can be interesting, but they do not help me really learn. Whatever the language you are learning, get a compiler/IDE. Type the code you are learning and experiment with IT. In other words, make the code you think you are learning work in an environment separate from the one that is teaching you. And don't copy and paste. Type it out. I use Code::Blocks and highly recommend it (it is free). Slight\\_Scarcity321 gives some good advice a little ways down this page.",

        "body": "The core idea of OOP is to associate data with behaviour. E.g. instead of having a `sort()` function that sorts a list of data based on an algorithm, your data has it's own `sort()` method, so it kind of sorts itself instead of getting sorted.On first glance this sounds very powerful, because a list of strings may be sorted differently than a list of numbers or a list of pointers. What OOP allows you is to have a list of any type, just call `.sort()` on it and the correct sorting method will be used automagically.This idea was then further applied to other things like a Date. Instead of using a library of functions and a collection of structs that the functions work on, you now get an object and have all functions directly associated with that object, so instead of writing `dateutils.to_string(date: Date, ...)` you now have `Date.to_string(...)`. In the early days of OOP this was used for code reuse through inheritance. Inheritance just means, that you define a new class and tell the computer that this class should have all the features of that parent class plus the new stuff you define and except the stuff you redefine in the new class.However, it turned out that Inheritance doesn't work well for code reuse, so nobody sane recommends it any more for that. It also turned out that it's more common to have different behaviour than different kind of data, so people started using \"Composition\" instead. Composition just means that your objects has other objects that are used to perform different kind of behaviour. For Example, you may have a class `Animal` and the animal is supposed to have different behaviour like walk, run, speak, eat. Instead of using Inheritance to create new subclasses of `Animal` and implement different behaviour, you define small interfaces `IRunner`, `IWalker`, `ISpeaker`, `IEater` (or similar) and write small classes for each interface. There might be a `Bark` and a `Meow` class implementing \"ISpeaker` and there may be \"BipedRunner\" and \"QuadrupedRunner\" implementing \"IRunner\" and so on. You then create different animals using the Animal-Constructor:```pycat = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Meow(), CarnivoreEater())dog = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Bark(), CarnivoreEater())horse = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Whinny(), HerbivoreEater())cat.speak() # \"meow!\"dog.speak() # \"wruff!\"horse.speak() # \"neigh!\"```This is what \"Composition over Inheritance\" refers to. So we're almost back to having functions applied to data, but instead we call a method of an object that then looks up another object and calls one of that object's methods (for each individual method call).A big downside of OOP is that contrary to its promise it makes code harder to maintain, because you create a compile time hierarchy that matches your domain model and with that you create boundaries around things (objects) instead of creating boundaries around properties (e.g. positions, prices, ... ). Maybe that helps a bit.",

Although, i rarely use the laptop, and only on LAN, e.g. when i'm tired, and want to lay in the bed but still do some coding.If you want to sync across e.g. home PC, and use laptop in school, i guess it's time to commit to remote repo, and pull from there.Edit: ofc, when you want to show your project in school you have to sync local copy on laptop anyway, but, at least you don't have to sync during development, when you switch machines often.",

For me, i got in right before the big transition to AI went into full effect, so I got in just in time. I worked as a student tutor during my bootcamp and then scored an internship after my bootcamp.

I've heard good things about WGU.The main thing I'd be cautious about is stopping work for 6 months. That's not nearly enough time to be job-ready, and quitting work will just put immense pressure on you, which is the opposite of what you want.Learning a completely new skill takes time. Trying to rush it and squeeze more learning into less time rarely works in practice. You need time to rest and get comfortable with new ideas.I think cutting back on hours or finding work that's less stressful, but that keeps you employed, would be ideal.Take courses, learn to code, but most importantly build stuff. Make real, useful stuff and launch it - that's the best way to prove you're job-ready. In this field, \"entry-level\" doesn't mean you're still learning to build stuff, it means you've already built real projects on your own, you're only new to doing it in a corporate environment.",

Languages like Python are 'higher level', meaning more of the low level detail is 'abstracted away' from the programmer. This comes with tradeoffs, for example: Not having to directly manage memory when using python means the programmer is *not able* to directly manage memory even if they wanted to. This makes Python more suitable to use cases like Data Analytics, where readability and development speed matter more than minute performance optimisations, whereas a language like C is more suited to applications which require a level of control over hardware resources, like Operating System or Embedded Systems applications where you need to use resources as efficiently as possible.",

That being said. If you’re transitioning to backend Dev without a comp sci/comp eng/etc background it will be a lot harder in today’s climate to get a backend role than it’s ever been due to competition.

I know it's important to research on your own, and not rely on \"spoonfeeding\", but it gets to a point where it's absurd. My best learning experiences where when the lectures had streamlined content where all course assignments and exams were heavily or even completey based on those lectures. I always felt like I came away with something positive and felt a lot more skilled. Also, it depends on the professor but some will outright disregard any questions. And when so much rides on the assignments and with so little support and resources, you tend to focus on the lectures less and are scrambling for the assignments to the point where there's hardly any retention of what you were supposed to learn in the first place.

Just go by the curriculum, for now.Learn to learn. Right now you are doing your college/university studies. It is not any more high school where teachers would remind you to do your assignments and such. Now you have to learn how to live an independent life and make your own decisions. When I was doing my Bachelor studies then some of my course mates dropped out within the first two semesters. Some partied too much. Some had no self-discipline. Some found out that they picked a wrong field. etc. About skills more, then become proactive. Do not rely just on your courses. Participate in hackathons. Join a programming/robotics club. Work on hobby projects. Because by the time you graduate you'll have to compete with everybody else. And then you have to stand out somehow, to be hired.And, do not rely on an AI. Can happen that your client prohibits any and all AI usage where the data goes through third party cloud services. What will you do then? Oh, and do not try to hack your university's/college's systems. Some of my course mates got into problems when trying out stuff.In terms of tech stacks then learn these things that are actually in demand in your area. Sure, the curriculum should already support that but if it does not do that then it is up to you to check different job offers and see what is required from developers, there. And that applies to any path you are picking. May it be an AI, a mobile app development, an IoT development, a web application development, a data science, or something else.",

From my experience and talking to professionals degrees like cybersecurity, information systems, and data science (do a stats major instead) are not as good.As for knowing what you want to specialize in I don't think there are any shortcuts besides trying stuff and seeing if you like it. Either take a class or build a project and see if it's cool. You can also research online about the different cs disciplines. If you decide on embedded systems I think computer or elctrical engineering is a better major, but it prob depends on the school.Regarding how economically cooked the different cs subdisciplines are, they honestly aren't that cooked. What's (or rather who) is cooked is the person who graduates, has no extracurricular experience, and is only interested in the doing bare minimum to get money.The truth is that cs isn't an easy path to 6 figures. You either need to genuinely like it or be very disciplined because the degree is only like 30-40% of the puzzle. Join tech clubs, do competitive programming/leetcode, build stuff, and give it your all! It's such a cool subject that touches all the sciences, math, and unifies it under this neat idea of very clearly describing a process.PS: Maybe it's just personal bias but it seems that web dev is the most vulnerable to AI. There's hella ai tools like replit and loveable that can already handle most basic-intermediate apps. Also if you want to be immune to ai get a job writing like cobol for a bank or visual basic for some unc company.Now specifically regarding some stuff you asked: You should stay general until you know what you like, at least until like you finish your first year or two of uni. You'll have enough time to skill up specifically for your interest. Focus on fundamentals and you'll be flexible enough to pivot. Also, even if you end up going into like embedded, building a website will still make you a better and more well rounded programmer.",

AI is the latest hot thing today, but who knows what will be the next thing a year or two from now? Maybe the AI bubble will have already popped by then, and if you specialize in AI early on, based on current trends, you'll be left on ice.So be a generalist in your studies and only specialize once you enter the workforce. That way you will have the skills to quickly and efficiently learn any niche you want, and have the knowledge of which niche is in demand at the time you'll be looking for work.",

He can have a degree even from Oxford University or something but that degree is totally void when he is unable to put his knowledge into a practical use.Yeah, you are working in a tech company. But even then, without a knowledge and skills you won't be hired to better tech roles. A university graduate can apply to that company and they will hire him over you.Better go for a CS degree. If necessary then lower your work load while doing your studies. It won't be easy. I did my studies while working part time. And I had no free time of my own. Just learning multiple coding languages will not merit you. Software development is not a Pokemon catching. No point to learn a new language when you can't make anything meaningful with it. Also, no point to learn a new language when that language is not in demand where you are living (forget remote jobs as a beginner).Go for a degree, concentrate on gaining knowledge and putting it into a practical use. And on your own learn these languages that are actually in demand in your area. And then not just learning a new language for the sake of learning it, but learning it to solve some real world problem with it, by building an actually useful project (no calculator apps. Nobody will use these).",

If you were working on something you needed performance for, it should probably be in C, C++, or another systems language like Rust these days. You should expect to need to jump between languages. It's not really shallow, but it's also not learning for the sake of learning either.",

Planning it, packaging it, deploying it so others can use it, are just as important.Simple games are a good choice, because they're inherently useful: people play them for fun. Sure, you can learn another language. But, if you do a couple of projects first, you'll get more out of your effort to learn that new language.Also, it has to be said, in your programming career you will probably need to learn new languages or othe major tech at least a dozen times. And that's a big effort. So, now, early on, your task is to learn the WHY and HOW of the effort of learning a new language. Doing projects helps with the WHY.Welcome to our great trade.",

Look up the parts you don't understand in the Python documentation (which is very well written, typically, and very useful) and then play around with them until you understand them.

In practice mode, you stop at error, go back to mistakes you make, and drill them to perfection. In performance mode, you ignore all the mistakes you make since, well, you are performing and stopping at every mistake is just going to make everyone notice them and get them really annoyed.Applied to programming, you use as little help as possible during practice mode.

So put that site out of your mind completely. You shouldn't even be considering library's like numpy until you have a good grasp of computer science and programming.If you want to learn Computer Science and really understand programming you need to engage in the equivalent of a 4 year CS program. If you are going to DIY this find a program online that starts out with C/C++ and learn how software actually works. You need to stay with one of those C languages until you have successfully built and UNDERSTAND, at least a couple of data structures. A good program at this point exposes you to other languages.For now stay away from AI and Python. They will both become extremely important in your future but first you have a lot to learn.",

I learn new things like anybody else, go on reddit or [awwwards.com](http://awwwards.com), find something cool or unique and hit up the good ole stack overflow or documentation to recreate. Of course, you can also go on job posting and look at their required stack and learn those too.Don't worry about forgetting stuff happens to me all the time, I google CSS all the time like whats + vs > vs \\~ selectors. As long as you know a decent amount or a vague idea you can always google it. JS wise, its pretty similar to any other programing lang. just in different synax and how the underlying feature works. But, overall its all about practicing without the tutorials (you can still google to help, like I google all the time and I worked at federal agency for frontend stuff).",

It's not like a full scale backend infrastructure, but for smaller web apps this is often enough, because most times all they need is a way to hide some stuff, like API keys, from the client, make a hand full of database queries and calculate a few things here and there. It's called a 'Backend for Frontend', because all it does is usually all you need as a Frontend Dev. If you plan to only learn Javascript as a proper programming language, Node.js is a popular choice for backend development, if it gets more complicated than that. That's totally doable. For many things, expecially small to medium scale solo dev projects, you can totally get away with just JS, yes.At some point this no longer scales very well, but you can always cross that bridge when you get there and notice JS is limiting you. You can't build a 'Facebook' scale Project on just JS.. But Facebook started with just PHP, because that's what they knew how to write.Bottom line is - yes you can build useful stuff with just JS. Sure.VSCode the IDE you are statistically likely using - is entirely written in JS.",

Once you are comfortable with that, move on to a heavy database server such as PostgresSQL.

Do a short “warm up season” instead. Spend a week or two skimming your old notes and redoing one or two small projects you finished before. Do not aim to understand every lecture again, just get your fingers used to typing code and shipping something that runs.Then go back to where you fell off in TOP, but lower the bar. It is fine if you do not feel smart with data structures on the first pass. Write tiny examples, look up the same concept from two or three sources, and move on once you can explain it out loud in simple language.The real unlock is consistency. An hour a day for a month will do more for you than trying to binge a whole course in one sprint.",

Depending on your specific needs and tools it might be very different what you need to know, but \"local-first\" is the main keyword. For the second problem, maybe something like **\"react native\"** could suit you - it is a custom form of react applications, than can be compiled to both iOS and Android, and I presume also on the web, where react is used all the time.I'm by no means an expert, but I think those two terms could help you in the right direction.",

Dont let \"web based\" fool you, you can run everything locally too, but it'll do wonders for compatibility and simplicity You can use JS and a browser for the entire gui, and JS again in the back end using NODE. You can use something like Electron for cross platform compatibility, and you can save your offline data as cookies or in the cache. Once you get back to data service, the data can sync, and then it'll be available on a server for all your devices. For the quiz you can use something like socket.io for bidirectional communication between the server and the deviceYou have a lot of requirements here, and it would be prudent to be able to code everything in the same language (JS) I would start by learning basic browser JS since you have a foundation in html and css, then move on to your first server using express and node, and then learn how to utilize external packages like socket.io, then finally how to package them into standalone apps using electron. You may find that you need other things along the way like a database, but thats just another external package and another set of docs. You can do all of this in python too it'll just be 50% more difficult than js, but python has better support for complex data and more and different external packages. I dont see any reason to recommend it for someone starting out, and you can always learn another language later You're much better off getting good at a single thing than trying to code a bunch of things in different languages",

You would find it on your 4th iteration and return true.Let's say you wanted to do binary search instead So first step, you cut the array in half. N / 2 = 2.5, so we just pick index 2.There's a 3 there, which isn't what we want. So we compare if it's higher or lower than 4.Since 3 is lower than 4, and we know the array is sorted, then we know that 4 is in the right half of the array[4 5]. Now, N = 2So you cut the array in half again. N/2 = 1, and at index 1, there's the number 5. It's higher than 4, so we have to cut in half again[4]Now there's only one element, and it's the number we want, so we return true.You will see that we had to cut the array in half only 3 times before we found it.Binary search has complexity O(log N) because the number of times we need to iterate with respect to the magnitude of the input (in this case, the number of elements in the array) is log (base 2) of N The things that are important when it comes to big O runtime complexity is to1. Identify how you're measuring the input2. Draw out each step of the algorithm3. Determine the amount of steps you would have in the worst case.For linear search, the worst case is having to check every element. So given N elements, you perform N iterations.In the case of binary search, since you're cutting the number of elements to search in half every iteration, you only need search log(base 2) N times, plus the one if there are odd number of elements.",

Move to coding then start with basic CRUD apps, then try it with a real database, then move to authentication and authorization. Learn about documenting your backend architecture and api's. Then you can move to advance topics like caching and database optimization. While doing all this make basic apps and try to get familiarized with Docker and Git.I may be missing some steps in between, but this is the gist of it.

For completeness you should also test that any global variables were, or were not, changed as expected. It really doesn't matter how the function accomplishes the changes, whether it calls `f()` internally or not.And BTW, the word \"unit\" in \"unit test\" refers to the test itself, not what it's testing.

I'm glad my feedback could be useful.Hopefully you found this new code to be easier to read and to possibly extend in the future, at least from my perspective I would feel that way lol. If/Else statements are very powerful, but once you start chaining tons of them, it is always a good place to stop and ask if you can do it in a better way, whether that be with a match / switch case (some languages call them switch), or using a design pattern like a state machine.Good example of that would be a video game character with multiple states like crouching or jumping. Someone could string a dozen if/else statements, and check nested if/else statements inside those blocks... Or they could use a state machine.On that note, I hope this [website](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) all about design patterns can be of use to you.Happy I could help, all the best and happy holidays!",

Run it on GitHub Pages so now it is on the Internet too. Good stuff to learn to get that far. Then add the next small thing by adding a backend server and modify your TODO application to POST tasks there instead. POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE are REST verbs you can learn about. Just print the tasks to the console for now. Once you have that working add a database and save a POSTed task to the database using SQL. INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE are SQL statements that map directly to the REST verbs and they are often referred to as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Fill in the GET (SELECT) request to retrieve your tasks, the UPDATE, then DELETE. Now your application is full stack.Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn, when you need to learn it. MDN is a great resource for the frontend and there are many great resources for whatever backend and database you choose.As you build this, you are doing all of this locally, frontend, backend, database, and committing changes to git and pushing those changes to your GitHub repo as you go. To get your GitHub Pages frontend to talk to your backend running on your local machine you can learn about CORS (allows your frontend to talk to your backend) to add that to your backend then use \\`ngrok\\` to temporarily expose your server and port to the internet (only works while \\`ngrok\\` and your computer are running).Now that you have a full stack application running on the Internet, time to learn about authentication to make it so only registered users can access your server. You will add login/logout to your frontend and backend as well as user management. More REST and CRUD stuff to add for that too.Cloud stuff is next to get all of it running on the internet. That is a later topic.Whatever projects you pick, build projects as completely as you can. Make them full stack if that is your thing. Take TODO and add subscriptions/payments, member management, calendar schedules, email/sms reminders, single-sign on, SaaS deployment (cloud), whatever else you can think of. If you just do frontend, touch every angle of it in your projects.This is a possible roadmap for you that will keep you busy and hopefully motivated for a while. Once you can do this, you can pretty much build anything.Start small and keep adding small things to it.I hope this helps.",

        "body": "Picture yourself in the early 1980s. There is no internet. There barely are any knowledgeable people in your area. Formal programming education is basically non existent before University.All you have is the *documentation manual* for the programming language.How do you learn?Through experimentation. You have no resources, so the only thing you can do is play around, try things. Fail. Try more. Fail again. Try more and eventually succeed.You won't learn by copying tutorial or stackoverflow, etc. code. You will only learn by creating your own code, even if that means that your solutions are maybe complicated, convoluted, and sub-optimal. Yet, they are *your* solutions. They stem from *your thought process*. This way, you *learn*.Once you have a working solution, there is no harm in looking up how others have solved the problems. This way, you can learn better, more optimized approaches. Yet, first *you* need to figure out a solution.The notion of directly looking for solutions via the internet is detrimental to learning, even more so in the current age of permanent availability of the internet, and worse, with the advent of AI. It makes us lazy. It makes us stopping to think analytically. It makes us stop investing effort, because \"why should we when everything is readily available?\". In return, it makes us stop actually *learning*. Learning means struggling. Learning means failing. Learning means debugging. Learning does not mean getting a solution from effectively a third party (no matter if Google, Stackoverflow, AI, etc.)Discipline yourself to not looking for direct solutions and even less *in code*, but to look for *approaches* to solutions. Maybe, download the documentation for your programming language and then cut yourself off the internet. Seems like a radical step, but can be extremely helpful for learning.The thought process from problem to solution is what really counts in programming, not the *implementation* in a programming language (that's the more trivial part and just a necessary evil).Once you understand how to \"think like a programmer\" things change considerably. Programming languages become less important and you learn to work on a more abstract, conceptional level.Maybe, try some programming competitions, like [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (with the accompanying subreddit /r/adventofcode) - current year is over, but the challenges are all accessible back to the very first season in 2015. Another recommendable site is [Exercism](https://exercism.org). Here, you get challenges and have \"hints\" and guidance.As usual with such posts (of which there are more than plenty), some Literature (aka *books*):+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles PetzoldTo address your \"all coders do is just copy-paste\" statement: yes, we do copy paste, but not because we *could not do the job*, it's because of time constraints, trusted and tested solutions. Contrary to a beginner/learner, we can assess what a solution copied from the internet does, how it fits into our codebase, what side effects it has, etc. We could come up with our own solutions, but that would be less efficient in a professional setting than to resort to tested and trusted solutions.",

Here you mostly care about the oldest and newest object, and whenever an object dies, you have a mutation. Any new object simply gets added to the end.But even here, just a few necessary searches will kill any performance advantage you got, so you'd need to be very sure that your performance optimization holds, and will hold for a long time. And if you ever need to change something, you'll quickly have to swap out the linked list with a more powerful data structure anyway.So even if you ever find a place where a linked list fits, you most likely will instead choose a tree, skip list or the like instead.",

So to truly understand the underlying theory, building your own is a good idea.But, noone is going to buy your homebuilt project, or hire you to build another - then want you to be able to use the tools they have already paid good money for, and they want you do do it well and do it fast!So don't go building your own as an excuse not to learn the tricks of the tools - but also, don't just be a tool-user, but make sure you understand enough to be able to learn any tool.My recommendation *(as someone who doesn't know anything about the business)* is to go on with building your own, but remember that it is a hobby-project, something you only do for the learning experience. And then as your \"professional project\" build something with the modern tools, to show off how well you know them!",

Building an engine with C++/OpenGL will force you to explore lots of aspects of C++ and programming in itself. IT will push you to undersatnd DSA well, coz you will have to implement really effective and less time consuming algos. Get rid off this notion of \"insecure about my math/physics background compared to students from elite schools\"That is the beauty, you cant know everything ahead, you will discover new things. I see that you want to use OpenGL! But I gonna challenge even for even farther step - build your own simple CPU graphics engine. Learn how 3D cooordinates get converted onto the 2D screen! IT is physics :) You already have a tech background, all is your hands. I suggest for that [https://www.scratchapixel.com/](https://www.scratchapixel.com/) , a free and amazing learnign source. Listen to your innver voice - professors might be wrong...even if you wont succeed 100%, you will acquire lots of useful info and materials and habits....have fun!",

These tend to be a bit more practical in focus compared to CS degrees (at least where I went).Comp Sys Eng, sometimes just called Computer Engineering, can be fairly broad and allows for following a number of interests (I did a bunch of electrical, electronics, sensor tech, semiconductor eng, wireless and digital comms, distributed computing, microcontrollers, digital design projects, as well as your more traditional CS courses: DS&A, SWEng, OSs, UI, databases, maths, soo much maths, etc). We covered _a lot_ of cyber security before it was called that. They can be honours courses too at some places. I enjoyed it and think it set me up well, YMMV.",

There are also cases where you would have both inheritance and composition. Those compositions could also have their own inheritance tree.For your arguments1. one of the fundamental aspects of OOP is that child classes can have more methods than the parent provides. There is nothing wrong with checking what kind of object you're working with. The purpose of having the BaseAccount class is to distinguish it from every other Object in existence, and providing a baseline set of methods that all accounts are guaranteed to have.You wouldn't be able to call earnInterest on a generic BaseAccount, but if you were to determine that it's a SavingsAccount or a FixedSavingsAccount, then you could then call earnInterest.This could be done by implementing an InterestEarnable interface, or by creating another class called InterestEarnableAccount that extends BaseAccount, which then branches off into specific types of accounts that can earn interest.2 and 3. If the only difference is the condition for whether the method can be executed or not, then just move the condition into a separate canWithdraw method and now the duplicate code is gone.4.

We can see that the current account doesn’t use this method as it just simply returns so isn’t this a design flaw?2/3. Okay I was probably overthinking with this. The method is still being used by all subclasses just sometimes it fails. But I agree that it is perfectly fine to have these fail points",

You don't get paid to produce slop, you get paid to solve problems and make things better. LLMs are like tik tok for developers. It completely removes critical thinking in favor of quick answers that may or may not be wrong. I keep seeing all these \"10x\" improvement people and how they work so much faster only to realize they never cared about the code they wrote or the quality to begin with they just want results and output which is fine until those outputs result in security vulnerabilities, logic errors, tech debt etc. People seem to forget humans wrote all the code that LLMs are trained on, code that has miles and miles of error prone code and bugs. I get it, if you write JS you probably don't care if your code is slop but thats not how it works in most places.",

Then they don't even know how to remotely start validating because they don't even understand what they're asking for. It's often some metric some.c level heard at a conference, passed to a director in a hallway chat and then sent to the developer/engineer to make it work. Absurdity.

Are people adjusting yearly, are they doing it later with stock inflation (we are in an insane bull market for tech)? Do people just straight up make up salaries on there? People I know are getting worse offers than 2020-2022 era, especially adjusted for inflation. The people I know making bank got an offer then, stayed through it and their company is like up 2x so they are making historic money. They will cliff in 2025-2026 and go back to normal salaries for their role (still FANG).  So you could have someone claiming 350k for an E5 or 600k, when new offers are more like 325k. I think the industry is obviously down.

These are the enrollment statistics for universities in Ontario, which is the province where I'm from: [Statistics | Ontario Universities' Application Centre](https://www.ouac.on.ca/statistics/). If you look at the statistics by program group tab and you filter for 2024 in one box and 2025 in the other, you can see that there has been a noticeable drop off equal to approximately a 25% reduction not just in applications, but also in acceptances/confirmations for CS programs. Although these are only statistics for Ontario, I have no reason to believe that the same would not be happening elsewhere; I doubt there's anything special about these statistics compared to any others. And clearly, this shows that the cat is out of the bag regarding how CS is a more competitive field than it used to be, so there's no reason to suggest that enrollment won't keep decreasing for the foreseeable future.",

I now interpret other developers talking about how helpful ai is for them to be a sort of self-report. The thing ai is best at is implementing things like functions with very strict input and output, and creating tests... which has literally never been the engineering bottleneck in my experience. The real work of an engineer is turning customer feedback or PO requests into a cohesive system that will solve a need. Even before ai, most of my coworkers didn't struggle with function implementation, some were even better than me at it... the thing they mostly struggle with is architecture and ownership, and ai appears to be *hurting* this more than it's helping.So yeah, I feel pretty gaslit as well.",

The hype messages are intended for specific audiences like c suite people, investors, people who don't know how to code but want to feel like they can, etc. I also don't feel like I'm being gaslit because I do find Claude Code to be extremely useful. I would never in a million years think to use Copilot of ChatGPT for a task. I wouldn't even really consider those products to be coding tools compared to how useful Claude Code is. But even a tool like Claude Code is only as good as the person directing it. It's not a replacement for a junior, but it is a replacement for a few hours a day I might've wasted context switching between code bases. If somebody is speaking broadly about AI, I kind of tune it out. There's a big difference between what each tool is good at regardless of what the benchmark scores say. I'd much rather use the things and figure out for myself if they work. If something sucks, don't use it and try something else if you want.",

Good engineers can almost smell where a problem is coming from. And that's not about using the debugger tools well, it's about training your instincts. Good engineers can debug systems without seeing any of the code much less running it in a debugger.There's lots of tools to help with diagnostics, but it's the process and the experience that really make the difference. Bad engineers have the same access to logs, metrics, tools, etc that good engineers have...and yet bad engineers often can *NEVER* find a problem that a good engineer will pinpoint in minutes.And \"debugging\" doesn't just stop at software: Once you develop the mindset and practices you end up applying it everywhere. After all, building software is really about *debugging people's problems* and patching them with software. Bad engineers write bad software because fundamentally they can't diagnose the problems users are having that they are hired to fix as a software developer.How do you get there? Have a talent for it helps a lot. After that it's lots and lots and lots of debugging of everything, everywhere, all the time.",

Even as a jr, document everything you do. Just finished a big project? Most jobs use a documentation system where you can just look up how to do things. Even a simple \"how to run this test\" can go a long way and is proof of what you did. \\- When you finsih something, give yourself credit and post it somewehre or mention it in standup. This is somethign many of us struggle with, giving ourselves credit. To get promoted you want the higher ups to know what you did and how you participated in that. \\- Take 10 minutes after standup to present anything or even show a doc. Again, you want to be recognizable. You want your boss to say \"OP had a good presentation post-standup that was really interesting\". \\- It's better to do 5 tasks and shwo your work than it is to do 10 tasks and keep quiet. This was my biggest issue. Id do tasks but never really wanted the praise or to present it so i kept quiet. My coworkers thought i wasnt doing much and in review seasons i didnt have much coworkers to sing my praises. \\- Dont be a passive engineer. A lot of engineers are good but are very passive. In stand up they dont really say they are stuck, they only say \"i continued working on X and investgiaging a small issue\". Nothing else. Nobody is going to help if you dont say \"im stuck\" and trust me engineers get more mad if you spend a week stuck on the same issue then if on day 1 you say \"im stuck\". Time is money. Reach out to coworkers and talk to them about issues. That conversation could lead you to getting close with a higher up engineer. If you as a junior can get a principal engineer to back you up, that goes a far way.",

Others are good at solving problems, but their code is poorly structured and doesn't scale. Having 10 yoe doesn't necessarily make you a good engineer either. Having skills does.

I’ve been at my current position (my first one since outside of college) for about a year and 10 months give or take. From working there so far, I have worked with two really good engineers. Both of them have had two totally different experiences, but surprisingly, both have ended up in the same place doing the exact same thing. One of them was a self taught developer who tinkered with programming at a young age and learned many languages. Unfortunately, he didn’t pursue a CS degree because he grew up very poor but is in the works of getting one right now. This dude had many personal projects under his belt and worked extensively outside of work getting tasks at work completed. He had around 15 years of experience working with software and loved programming. He knew embedded programming really well too including how PLCs work and loved learning new things about programming. The other had a CE degree from Michigan Tech and has around 15 years of experience. He worked with embedded programming for the bulk of his career at GE Aviation. He really enjoys learning about new technologies and currently is helping us bring into the modern era an older application. This dude is my current mentor and has taught me so much in terms of how to program and ultimately, how to go about architecting and designing programs. He is a monster, he designed a completely new product from an older application at my company and reverse engineered the way it works so that it translated properly to a new language and environment. My coworkers had told him that the old project was a mess since it was written with a very old version of C++ (to most of us it was a mess lol). But he straight up in the interview said “nothing scared him”. My bosses laughed at him but he proved US ALL wrong. The thing about both of them that made them really good engineers was that both of them explicitly stated to me that all they did was “breathe and live” code. They programmed on all their free time and worked many hours outside of the usual 40 hour work week perfecting their craft. They read books, watched videos, they absorbed so much information on their free time that it clearly showed when they came into work ready to start their day. Like I feel helpless sometimes just seeing that they can take on so many tasks (especially tough ones) and my tasks I complete are mediocre at best. But the thing is, I am absorbing the knowledge they give to me. I’ve learned so much from starting my position that I don’t think I would be anywhere near where I am in knowledge and experience without either of them.",

It may take less time to develop than technical skills, it depends on where you're at with things like handling stress, communication etc. It feels longer because people tend to, unwittingly, neglect it until they've bombed several interviews.The key thing is that self-study conditions are radically different from real interviews. There's no one breathing down your neck while you problem-solve. The time pressure, high stakes, and interviewers disrupting your thought process aren't simulated. This is often why people brain freeze in interviews.Do mock interviews alongside your self-study to identify your weaknesses, and ideally start them early so you have more time to fix issues. Here are two relevant resources: one on [getting truly interview ready](https://www.coditioning.com/blog/11/complete-tech-interview-prep-roadmap), another on [key interviewing skills](https://youtu.be/V2czxOT_hwU). You'd probably never feel 100% ready, but at least tick all the necessary boxes before stepping foot in interviews for jobs that you care about",

Always had backlogs of recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn, even though I never posted/updated/said I was looking for work. I think there’s a few factors at play that make the job market seem extra shitty right now.1. Layoffs/hiring freezes across big tech, and government jobs. Basically a large pool of people who would have been considered ‘Top Talent’ a few years ago are now all looking for work at once. The longer they are unemployed, the lower the standards get, so even if you are just applying for ‘Regular’ jobs, a few of the 100+ resumes in that inbox probably has ‘Google’ or ‘Meta’ or whatever on it. 2. With AI, it’s become trivial to spam out resumes, and tailor/frame your work experience to the exact job requirements. If you just earnestly apply to jobs, you are unlikely to get an interview even if you are a relatively good fit. You said ‘SQL’ on your resume. Someone else mentioned the exact distribution they use at the company. You said ‘AWS’ they said the exact AWS features and tech stack being used. Often times your resume won’t even make it past the screening stage.3. Just general hiring trends. Hiring tends to be forward looking, so I think a lot of senior leadership is really leaning into the idea that they should be able to accomplish more with the same amount of people. Instead of increasing headcount by 10% for some new project, they’ll try to push AI tools and re-org the ‘freed up’ employees to whatever new project they are working on.It’s definitely pretty rough. Even with 8+ years of backend dev and Data Science experience, I’ve applied to ~100+ jobs. One final round of interviews, no job offers, and I only got there because I had a referral. I’ve started just not bothering with jobs that list even one specific technology I don’t have experience with.I’m not saying I’m a super talented top dev. I’ve always worked at middle of the road non tech F500 companies. But I’ve never been fired or even had a bad performance review. I’d be so excited to just get the feedback ‘Yo, you didn’t do a good job solving this LC problem. Or your architecture skills and thought process isn’t what we are looking for’. But it’s just like… no one even gives you a chance to interview if you don’t BS your resume with AI. Then those are the pool of people you can hire, and the quality of the hiring goes down.",

Location is a major factor.In markets like New York or Silicon Valley, you have people who have sacrificed years of their lives to prep for demanding positions, so every role that gets posted has a ton of competition. When candidates get dumped onto the market from layoffs, companies have to ratchet up the difficulty in interviews just to have a manageable pipeline.I've been involved in the recruiting for a team that is not in a tech hub. In-person work is a hard requirement, for about \\~150k base salary, no stocks, no bonus. It's probably average for that area, but not particularly attractive for someone to move just for the job. We even offer relocation assistance for that role.We get maybe 20 candidates per job posting, half of which are not qualified because they need sponsorship. If we interview 10 people, about 1/2 can actually write a basic loop. We hire whoever has the best systems design interview since most people can not clear even a LeetCode easy. (clear rate for a fully passing solution is probably about 5% of all candidates that reach that stage).I really think unemployed engineers who are having trouble securing an offer for months have the wrong strategy. They should be taking up these 'easy' low paying jobs, moving temporarily, and then continuing to interview for their hotshot Big Tech and Silicon Valley roles. A six figure salary in a medium cost of living area is better than sitting around all day waiting for the next OA.",

Then you had boot camps generating devs that could do one thing okay quickly. Many devs don’t have cs degrees and a lot of those guys are actually pretty solid. The tech has gotten increasingly complex. The output expectations have increased. The quality of peers has declined. Interview intensity has gone way up. There is the expectation now that ai just makes it all happen magically and that we will be eliminated soon anyways. Dollar is worth less. There was a time you could be good at one part of the stack and be paid well. Now the expectation is your good at fe, be, observability, continuous integration, testing, deployment, wireframes, reqs & documentation, etc. It used to be if the codebase was a mess or you weren’t familiar with some framework they would cut you slack of train you but less so now. It used to be a few devs in a room working through stuff. Now everyone’s remote on different continents crammed into tiny noisy apartments. You’re still supposed to manage to mentor them.  Usually most of the team has already been outsourced so they really don’t have the same skin in the game and your heads on the chopping block. The interview used to focus on your degree, likability, location, and experience.  It went from white boarding to take home test and live coding exams to leet code with ai graders kidding your voice and eye movements. Not to mention how everything’s flooded now so getting noticed / not getting duped leading up to the interview view is harder. The expectation of 2x ai productivity doesn’t account for the quality of the ai, existing code, or clarity of instructions. Then there is pay. It’s held strong in a way and even grown faster than other industries but the dollar is worth under 1/3 as much as ten years ago in terms of shelter, transportation, healthcare, and food. Then there’s the increase in domestic cs degrees coming online and the over hiring in the covid market rally which went to layoffs then to ai hiring. I’ve had 6 jobs in ten years and everyone has laid us off or been bought out. Some were productive, some kept the companies software alive, others had no idea what they wanted. Can definitely make you tired. But that’s why it’s a job, right? Made some money. Am I a fool for thinking I would still be hustling 25 years from now or not gambling my cash into the stonks? Probably… Out of work and just been studying for a few months. Sometimes it feels slow and fruitless. Just comes with the territory I suppose. Some stuff on my inbox so we’ll see.",

These hire more quietly and care less about algorithm drills.Keep one small, low-pressure coding habit alive so the door stays open, but don’t force passion when you’re burned out.

I can't say a banger cover letter has ever had a significant impact on any hiring decision I've made in the past 7 years. Conversations with candidates at job fairs / meetups has.Hiring does not happen on an infinite timescale. A req was opened to address some need the business has. The business would like to address that need on the timescale defined in the needs assessment. Maybe that's \"right now, ASAP\", maybe it's \"sometime before Q4\". The manager ultimately responsible for hiring the person described in the needs assessment does not have infinite time. That manager has other responsibilities that take them away from spending 8 hours per day on hiring. Also, [reqs vanish randomly, often without notice, without reason, and at the least convenient time.](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/wanted/) Even if I as the hiring manager had infinite time to hire this very special req, my budget owner/stakeholders very likely do not have infinite time to wait on the problem being solved.Most of the time, we try very ***very*** hard to hire an existing intern. They're already a vetted culture fit 9 times out of 10 and that's one less thing you as the manager need to sniff out. Half of the time they've already done the exact work you need done, and if they're an engineer you can just look over their commit history.",

E.g. maybe the job description says 6+ YOE but candidate has 4 YOE and has a Senior SWE title already, or it says looking for embedded C but candidate has several years of embedded Rust experience and has C listed at least somewhere.- If they wrote a cover letter, do they actually understand the kind of role they're applying to? If it's generic or looks like AI slop that's an anti-signal.- Does the resume indicate a clear understanding of WHY the info they list is important or worth mentioning? I do not want a laundry list of every task a candidate has ever done, I want the highlights that indicate skillsets and ability.- Have they articulated previously done work that's similar to what we're looking for, or are they just regurgitating a tech stack? For strong candidates I don't care if they have exact tech stack matches, but sometimes more junior or otherwise weaker-signal candidates will get to a screen for having rare tech stack matches.- Do I recognize their university, prior companies, or anything else on their resume (e.g. notable open source contributions, math or programming competitions, publications at relevant venues)?And frankly at the end of the day I am wildly overloaded and am one person making a quick judgement. I also put significantly more weight on candidates that have been referred to me somehow or who have a shared connection.

At my last job I was involved in hiring, and we would always get at least 1,000 applications in the first 24 hours after posting, usually we'd end up with 3-5k. We started with a code screen, basically a couple LC easy questions, that usually got us down to a few hundred. Then we'd divvy up the resumes and mark them as reject or pass. It was a quick glance maybe 5 seconds each resume to see if they had the basic qualifications, the vast majority of those failed. Then we'd be down to \\~20-50 people and we'd have our HR do a phone screen, basically ask about their basic qualifications, make sure they're interested in the job at the salary range we're offering and the tech stack they'd be working on. We rarely rejected anyone in this round but many took themselves out of the running so typically we'd be down to 10-20 at that point. Then we'd have the hiring manager have a phone screen with them. If they made it to this point they had something on their resume we liked, so we'd typically ask them about it and really drill down and ask for excruciating detail to make sure they actually did it. Spoiler alert, most people are exaggerating and/or lying about their specific contribution to a project on their resume, and it's super easy to weed out. That got us down to \\~5 which we would invite to interview.Once we selected to interview them, I would then read a cover letter if they sent one, although I think a lot of other folks didn't even read them then. This is also the point I would look at their github if they had one on their resume or anything else they included as side projects. I think I was one of the few people involved in hiring who did any of that most would just look at the resume 10 minutes before the interview. Then the interview was with a few folks, we had one do a tech screen where we give them a sample problem and watch them code, change requirements and see how they adapt. One does a culture fit interview where they ask questions related to soft skills, how do you handle conflict, those types of questions. One is a business round where our product person asks them some questions related to our business and some basic logic questions to see if they can reason through product requirement type things. Then everyone meets and ranks the candidates, we come up with a consensus order, and send the offer out to the first one, if they decline send the offer to the second one, etc. It's also possible at that point that some people just get a fail so even if they're the highest rated candidate we'd rather restart the process than hire them, although that's rare most people who've made it to this stage are at least getting hired if they're the best candidate interviewing for that role who accept because as you can see it's a long and painful process and we'd rather not start over.",

In what world, and from which perspective, is that even remotely close to ideal?Skills and execution.

Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.If you're submitting an application, you are selling yourself. No salesperson in the history of ever has tried to get their counterpart to just read the product description. They want face time, to tell the story of their product, to make an emotional appeal.Do you think they send out empty e-mails, with just the technical specs attached and the words \"for your kind consideration\"? Or do you think they will use every sentence, every square inch of screen real-estate that they can get to make the other side interested in a conversation?Why on earth would anyone believe that the proven process would work differently when the opportunity you want them to grasp is yourself?For what it's worth, I currently going through my first hiring process on the employer side - I am sitting past an HR filter, so I don't even know if there were any cover letters; I wasn't giving any. But I can tell you this: The majority (of a very, very small pool) of CVs I have seen would not get a pass from me; there's too many slightly reddish flags, and as desperate as I am to work with a larger team, I simply don't have the time to allow someone to correct the misconceptions that their CV has created in the first place.But I would have read a cover letter; I would have read a slightly more detailed CV, and some of the things that tripped me up could have potentially been explained away. Who we invite is not entirely my choice, but I do get a say.And your problem is: I don't aim to be fair, I don't give a damn about giving you a chance. I care about filling a vacancy with someone who primarily has the right skills, enough experience and who I can stand having to talk to a few times a week.And if I know one thing it is this: Once we do hire someone, I lose my voice. I can't get them fired if I think they're a dud, or hard to get along with, so - for my own sake - I have to be very careful and weigh working in a team that's too small vs. working with someone I don't want to work with.And then, neither a CV or a cover letter take eons to write, or to customize for a specific position. Make your documents modular; have blocks that you can shift around if needed, and templates that you can remove or include.Believe me, I write cover letters when I apply for jobs. I have zero proof and no data to show that they work - but I really don't see a world where it's not worth the bit of extra effort.",

Well, it's partly luck. Be very aware of little problems you have or others have and constantly ask, is there a digital solution for this problem?Constantly being aware and asking that question is part of it. The other part is throwing crap against the wall and seeing what sticks. You can be surprised what winds up working versus what you thought would work and was a great idea. What you are trying to do is find the outlier event in a large distribution - and that requires many, many trials until you hit it.You'll never know if you don't test many innumerable ideas out in reality. The trick is to run these tests (as many as possible) without bankrupting your self and keeping the overhead low. One good principle to hold to is: \"what I think will work is irrelevant, what works is the only relevant thing\" - in other words, be REACTIVE and not PRO-ACTIVE. See if something might work - test it like a scientist with a hypothesis and then act based on objective observation. Good luck (you and the rest of us are going to need it...).And just accept that if you want a shot at success - you will have to endure many, many, endless trials that result in failure - until you hit the one that does not (hopefully).",

Harden your alerts, metrics, and your tests and you will *reduce* the chances of an outage. In my experience I've categorized outages as unforced errors and just being unlucky.Was the system down because of an unforced error? Lead a technical review on it. Why did it get to that point? How? How can you prevent it from happening again and how can you apply this to OTHER cases in the future? Reduce unforced errors to 0.Unfortunately. there will be times that you will need to put out fires. That's part of the job. For example, [Log4Shell - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) was a week ruiner for many. AWS, Azure, etc. outages have caused fires at work.Also fwiw if you're not really needed in these meetings, you can really just go to the concert and attend chats through your phone if you want.",

As a junior engineer, you can't decide this, but you can get the conversation going. \"Hey, what happens if...?\"Second, if there is no such procedure in place, then - all things being equal - I'm probably going to the concert. If it's one I could stand to miss, then maybe I'm making an offer: Cover the cost of my tickets plus something for the trouble. Something like that. But me helping you above and beyond the normal agreement is a favor, and sometimes I'm not in a position to grant you that favor. Boundaries are important.However, I'm also going to try to be accommodating within reason. In a situation like that, I'd offer to check in when I get back from the concert. If the issue's still ongoing, then perhaps some responsibility could be handed off to me so that others can get a break. This is probably really helpful as a junior, because while you might not be the best help for the initial incident, there can often be follow-up work that is less intensive. Like someone needs to run a database query every five minutes and make sure A stays less than B, until we can get the alert automation in place. And if I'm on the primary crew and I've been at it for six hours and a junior comes in at midnight and says, \"How can I help?\" you bet I'll hand that over and get some sleep.Finally, there's also the issue of Emergency Theatre. Do we really need all hands on deck? Or do we need the appearance that we're busting our butts to get it working again? There's not much you can do about this in the moment except recognize it and deal with it later. Figure out why this is the case. There's usually some failure in the management chain - some mid-level director with more power than sense, who has to be appeased. Or maybe a high-profile customer. Recognizing this and knowing it is very important as you navigate office politics in the future.",

It probably feels scammy because companies are keeping it under the radar to avoid pissing off software engineers, but that's just my theory. It's a degrading idea to utilize technical workers as independent contractors, especially for SWE that are accustomed to being valued and in-demand as full-time workers.I don't think it's you aging out, it's more about the field itself abandoning you or at least devaluing you.

So this would benefit you.Ideally you would have F-you money, so that you could take the mental/emotional route without the stress of wondering if you have enough to meet financial obligations. My personal opinion: if this job is really affecting your mental health to the point where you don't care about getting fired, then you should feel empowered to let it go.

Helpful for people who forget to track their work throughout the year.  3. Manager-side summarization - Some companies are experimenting with AI to help managers synthesize feedback from multiple sources.The biggest shift I've noticed isn't AI doing the reviews—it's AI making it harder to hide behind vague statements.

        "body": "If another developer’s actions create obstacles that make your work more difficult, it is reasonable to raise those obstacles with your manager or whoever can address them. The focus should stay on the obstacle that is blocking you, not on the developer as a person.This framing positions you as someone trying to improve results for the company by identifying obstacles, rather than as someone “reporting” on a coworker. It avoids unnecessary interpersonal conflict and reduces the risk of backlash if your manager interprets it as a personal complaint.If the other developer’s behavior does not produce obstacles that actually impede your work, it is usually best to ignore it. Spending time and energy evaluating another person’s work habits is a distraction from producing strong results yourself.**Responding to your edit:** you’re saying that when your coworkers don’t do their work, you end up working overtime and feeling pressure to meet deadlines. That overtime and deadline pressure is the real obstacle being created by their lack of follow-through.That’s understandably frustrating. The right response is to communicate clearly with your manager about project status and work allocation. When work is assigned but not completed, you should state that the project is off track, explain that tasks are being reallocated, and explicitly note either that you are working overtime to meet deadlines or that deadlines will slip as a result of the reallocation.This gives your manager the opportunity to recognize and credit your extra effort, or to see that deadlines are being missed because work isn’t getting done and needs to be reassigned. Ideally, this leads them to independently notice that a particular coworker is consistently not completing their work.If your manager does not acknowledge your overtime and instead simply pressures you to work harder, then the issue is poor management. That’s unfortunate, but it is a separate problem from how you should handle the situation with your coworker.",

You said that C++ position was a long shot. Was it just a waste of time and energy? Did it just make you feel down?- maybe it’s time to learn some stuff. If you know the Spring Framework, learning Spring Boot should be pretty easy. It’s supposed to make things easier. - more daunting, but if you learn React, you will hit more position requirements.

DevOps and CI/CD tooling are becoming titles, so if you're interested in maintaining software ecosystems you can take some courses on them. Likewise, React and VueJS have largely replaced vanilla jQuery. If you like web dev, pick either one up. Keep your jQuery sharp, it's still relevant while working with those frameworks.But it looks like you're primarily specializing in C++, going by your projects? It might be worth doubling down on that angle and perhaps picking up Rust as well.Either way, you should tailor your resumes to the platform(s) you're applying to work on. A resume that says \"I do everything\" isn't going to catch eyes the way that \"I'm your C++ expert\" can. Resumes are brochures of what you can do in the posting you apply for. Using a one-size-fits-all resume is not the right strategy if a company is one of your dream employers.

It produced a ton of products used in homes, and even had a massive research wing. Getting a job there was seen as being set for life. You had a job for life and a nice pension for retirement.In 1981 a new CEO came in. He cut any non profit part of the company. Every department was expect to fire the bottom 15%, no matter how they did compared to others. I think he removed the pensions, but not sure on this one. GE’s stock price soared.Jack Welsh’s tenure at GE was the catalyst that set corporations to become what they are today. Also a CEO’s job is to increase share price. They can be removed and fine (woe is them /s).If you want stability and to be appreciated for the work, and you’re in the US, go govie. Maybe not right this second, because the current admin is anti-government worker. However, you won’t make big tech money, but you can still get over 100k a year pretty easily. More if you go contractor, but you get more replaceable (being good at your job or having a clearance will still play a big role).",

It helps to understand the difference between hard and soft interrupts, how registers work and why for example \"boolean\" data won't likely save any actual memory vs an int...or if it does why it's now slower than an int.It's *always* beneficial to understand what is going on under the hood of the higher level constructs you're using. Maybe not frequently down to the assembly level, but the deeper your knowledge and understanding the better decisions and code you write no matter what level you're working at.My recommendation is to learn a little assembly, but do so on small, easy processors. I learned back on 65c02 and Z80. Today AVR and run it on a classic Arduino is probably a good route to cover the concepts enough to be useful without making your brain explode the way x86 will. ;)",

At my last job my manager actually had a whole meeting with me about gold lining and 80/20 rule. What i really gained from that convo is that in business its super hard to value \"mental work\". You cant really put that into a metric and more specifically if you have story points to your tickets, that'd be the only real way to show mental work in the stuff you do. You have to be your own advocate in that regard. But even still at the end of the day the deliverable is the only thing others can do something with so as you stated thats kinda what you should do if you want to excel in the business sense.",

Our embedded devices monitored data centers and we rarely ever had issues.My mentors were the writings of Scott Meyers, John Carmack and so on and a ton of cheat sheets (mostly effective C++ checklists) on the desk.Years later I got into a big company for the first time through Startup acquisition and we still regularly run into troubles for not following procedures.But honestly we usually can't wait for 2 months to deploy some crap if a customer wants to test it in 2 weeks.And our startup stuff isn't being touched anymore and has been running happily for years now.At the same time anytime anything is done \"the right way\", the whole web of k8s and whatnot breaks every single time right before a customer demo and nobody knows how to solve it because the people knowing the infra and k8s and the people knowing the app and the people knowing the customers and so on are completely different.At the same time our own apps that we just run pretty naively on AWS just... Run. We have one app that's used all the time set up by a former team member that I never touched. He left almost a year ago and it's still there happily doing its work.Frankly I'm pretty tired of where we ended up with all this cloud and web world glued together by hundreds of yaml files configuring hundreds of containers.And frankly, if I look back, the whole thing doesn't do much more than what we did back then in that 3 person setup only that it doesn't even have its own hardware ;). Pulling data, storing it, running analysis, showing it to the user.Yeah I know, I'm downplaying some of the modern challenges etc.That's really more an emotional Casey Muratori style rant of how something that's not too dissimilar from what we did decades ago with two people now takes teams and hundreds of services and dependencies and is just slow and bloated",

It sounds like a couple smaller businesses and proprietorships I've seen around here. But you're saying it's a *median software* company. The only ones I'm aware of that meet that kind of description (near me) would be Revature and other WITCH companies. They keep devs benched on small projects, and try to get you placed with a client so they earn a cut of your salary and you get experience. Sometimes they'll exaggerate your skills to get a bigger salary cut.Are you working on a greenfield project that the company doesn't really need, but feels is a worthwhile gamble? Are you an intern or in training right now? Those are the contexts where I could understand assigning a solo dev at a company.

Either tech is a secondary focus, or you're isolated from the tech center of your company. I worked at a tech consulting company/digital agency, and they had someone on staff who helped the accounting team. After that person resigned, the company would ask random people for help on things. He didn't use version control.This isn't normal, but I don't think it's completely unique, as you hear stories about people who have this experience. In the old days, teams were responsible for their own IT and work, and you'd have teams spring up like this all across departments, until they brought in someone to organize everything. I should probably say \"if\" rather than \"until.\" Large organizations also go through something like this, so don't feel too self-conscious. Is there are larger tech community/team in your company? A part of me wants to say you should ask about joining them, but the new manager might be a pain. You should consider looking for other opportunities, as you're probably not learning good software practices. To counter that, perhaps you can allocate time for process improvement. You can sell it as ways to allow others to do your work. So, things like version control (I hope you're already using this, right?), CI/CD, some type of wiki for documentation, a ticketing/tracking system are some good starts. Maybe some next things to consider is how do you monitor things in Production? Just look at log files? I also want to clarify something. Just because a company has this stuff in place doesn't mean they do a good job with it. During the interview process, it's on you to try to figure out if places do a good job or not. Good luck, as some places will flat out lie to you. My last job is an example. The tech leads did everything, and the people on the management side didn't do much work outside of call names during daily standups. They certainly didn't understand any of the work from a business perspective. There are all levels of bad companies out there.",

It’s nice being able to learn a lot of new things about the full SLDC. Learned a lot about cloud, AWS, security, testing, privacy (it’s in healthcare), etc. But I feel the same way as you where it’s stressful not having anyone for help, and that everything falls on me. It’s been great experience but I want to work on a team and learn from more experienced devs. Because I know there’s a lot of things I don’t know. I’ve been trying to be better about accepting that I’m doing my best, if things break or if there’s bugs it’s ok. I think take the job for what it is, you’re obviously working hard but try and disconnect from work when not working and accept that you’ll inevitably miss things and things might not be 100%.

First thought, the directors that are still there in the program are generally really good as far as being kind/good humans go. Second though, its a great program for starting your career. You'll grow a really large network of other early stage engineers really quickly and when everyone inevitably scatters within 3-5 years you'll have that network at a lot of other tech companies as a result.I will say, the work is a mixed bag. For one of my rotations I was a data analyst and it was the most boring thing on earth (old school SAP WEBI work). For the other I was building ML models in Azure which was a lot better (I stuck with that rotation post tdp). I think the biggest downside is that the pay stagnates super hard post TDP if you dont end up in a good title. Some of my friends came out as senior software engineers around 140k, others (like me) came out with much less glamorous titles doing roughly the same work at 110k. Pay disparity was just a function of what business unit you ended up in and what titles that business unit would allow. I left after 4 years for a sizeable pay increase, but ATT TDP definitely allowed me to grow some good leadership skills while I was there and the friends I made in that program are still in my social circles today",

        "body": "Sort of, but not really. I have created the architecture for a few of our service, and I did a POC and looked at some performance metrics, if we thought it was likely to matter. For example, looking at latency of virus scanning for images. However, the cutoff is much more \"is this too slow at the scale we expect to matter\" instead of \"is this the absolute best option\". Also, we don't have free reign to choose whatever stack we want. There are languages that our developers are familiar with, ones for which we have tooling (e.g. Terraform modules), and for which we can easily collect metrics. I got in a bit of trouble for using Python for a cloud function script because it wasn't an \"approved language\". IMO, you can absolutely build something that would scale to 100m daily users in Python or Ruby (not that I would want to), as the language matters much less than the architecture and actual implementation. I think there is this idea that you need to use C or Rust to get the \"absolute best performance\", and that is probably true on a micro scale, but on a macro scale, you can just use a native extension and get the same performance boost without actually writing low-level code.",

I was able to make up for the shitty starting salary (btw this was over a decade ago so you're much more severely underpaid) with one good career move down the line, but the lack of mentorship during that early stage of my career stagnated my growth in a way that it is much harder to make up for. I learned more in my first year working on a proper dev team than I did at that entire job. For that reason primarily, I would recommend you get out of this job ASAP.

I worked at MSFT for a bit, but i worked in Azure where i felt like i had no work life balance and it stressde me out. But i've heard most other proejcts in MSFT you can actually have a life.

But I encourage you to apply for a relevant diploma or degree if you'd like better job security. Many government employers, companies with long-term contracts, and tech companies can afford to be selective. A related degree gives you more options, more offers, and helps keep you off the chopping block when a company needs easy staff to lay off. Since you've got a degree and some CS courses, you can potentially ladder that into a major and/or get transfer credits.All that said, what's your non-STEM degree? A handful of them can be leveraged for specific positions in the industry, and any bachelors' does allow you to apply for more international working visas.",

The _quality_ of your network trumps the _quantity_ of people in it.It's possible, even likely, that these people aren't actually looking at your profile and saying \"oh, I should connect with them, I have a good opportunity for them.\" How do I know this? Because, by your own admission, they haven't actually reached out to speak to you. They may be using automated tools to just spam out connection requests to keyword hits.These are low-quality connections for both you and the recruiters/HR people. The odds of these turning into mutually beneficial relationships are somewhere between zilch and nada.Put more thought into who you accept connections from, be more selective. I don't click Accept unless I've had a conversation with the person or they're connected with someone I know who can vouch for them. I also have my LinkedIn profile set such that no one can send me a connection request without first following me - adding that tiny barrier helps a lot. If I could require that a personalized message be included with the request, I'd flip that switch too.",

The thinking goes: if I can’t get a job as a SWE, I’ll just *drop down* a rung or two and get one of those jobs. While there is very significant skill overlap between various positions in software engineering and IT, it’s not really a hierarchy. There are people just like you who have trained and educated themselves for those jobs, and they’re struggling just as hard as you are because hiring in all tech jobs sucks equally right now. If you “drop down” to one of those jobs, you’re just another applicant, but you don’t necessarily even have the same qualifications as those other applicants. (I hear your question about getting some of those qualifications). Long story short, in my opinion, there’s no reason to believe that switching focus to IT jobs will lead to more job opportunities than in the field you have been preparing for in college.",

While it was honestly exhausting at times, within two months, I saw my portfolio go from just ideas to five fully functional projects. This hands, on experience not only helped me gain confidence but also increased my visibility; I went from getting maybe one reply out of fifty applications to finding opportunities through networking in relevant communities.

The market for new grads has just been brutal, especially if you didn’t get a return offer lined up before graduating.Going into IT is a totally reasonable move if you treat it as a bridge, not a dead end. GeekSquad + Network+ + cloud certs can absolutely move you toward DevOps or SRE if you keep one foot in software. Plenty of people have gone IT → sysadmin → DevOps once they could show scripting, automation, and cloud work.The key is to not stop building or talking like an engineer. Keep shipping small projects, automate stuff at work if you can, write scripts, mess with CI/CD, cloud deployments, monitoring. That’s what makes the transition believable later. If you fully pivot away from coding for a few years, it’s harder to come back.Also, you’re doing a lot right already. Hackathons, freelance, startup, networking, referrals, interviews. The lack of offers isn’t because you’re weak, it’s just timing and competition. IT can give you income, experience, and momentum while the market recovers.One thing I’ve learned is that interviews reward people who can clearly explain what they’ve built and why. During interviews I’ve used StealthCoder to keep my thoughts structured on screen so I don’t undersell myself or blank, especially when my path isn’t “traditional.” That helps when you’re coming from IT or mixed backgrounds.Short answer: yes, IT can be a smart move if you’re intentional about it. Just don’t mentally give up on engineering if that’s what you actually want.",

A good portion of the team took this as him being argumentative again. I tried to argue their case, but honestly, the team was full of assholes. The director from HR had a huge ego and wanted to say anyone who had been laid off was laid off for a reason, and one of the interviewers wanted to lowball candidates, especially if they had been laid off. You can't really predict how people will act. Just be honest if they reach out and ask for clarification. If they ask, and they should if they discover an inconsistencies, you can say things changed and you were never asked. FWIW, I offered up that I had been laid off during my interview process. I was originally employed when contacted, but I got laid off along the way. An interviewer asked something where I could have glossed it over, but I decided to be honest about it. I'm not saying honesty is always the best policy. I certainly wish I had kept it to myself during salary negotiation, but they did give me more than I had originally asked for.",

When I was in a similar situation, I started looking into courses related to data analytics and product management to fill the gaps on my resume. Initially, I spent about four months juggling job applications with online learning, but the response rate was still low, maybe one reply for every 50 applications. It honestly felt like shouting into the void at times. However, after refining my approach and networking more effectively during that process, I saw improvement within about six weeks. My confidence grew as my skills advanced, from having zero industry contacts to connecting with several professionals who offered valuable insights, it made a significant difference.

Don't be like me in high school. I had ideas that I didn't turn into actual things because I thought it \"was a waste of time\" and that it wouldn't impress recuriters and blah blah blah. Prob my biggest regret is not making the Minecraft mod I've thought of or that funny website.The fact you already have some internship in high school will put you ahead of 99% of CS majors, let alone programming since u were a kid. I barely touched code outside of Scratch until I was 15 for god sake. You'll be fine. My recommendation is to reach out to people in different sectors of CS and ask them for a coffee chat, or go on something like Discord and talk with fellow people in the industry. Not only will you maybe learn more about different fields, but you'll be building your network, and I'ma be honest, the people you know will be the reason why you get the job most the time. It's how I got my internship and potentially my first full time position as an app dev.",

The trick is to find platform teams that are hiring SWEs where you can build tools that take the pain of infrastructure off of the product teams.There are a lot of DevOps/SRE roles that intersect this space and are 90% config-writing (infrastructure as code), but if you can get into writing custom Terraform modules and Kubernetes controllers you'll be highly sought after. I had a recruiter recently tell me that they pay their platform SWEs more than their backend or frontend SWEs because they're more specialized and harder to find. It's not for everyone, but give it a solid try, you won't be boxing yourself in (at least this early in your career). I have specialized in this role for 10 years so I show up in searches for senior positions. Recruiters that find me for product teams will usually end up having the hiring manager reject my resume because I haven't worked on product for a decade. But I'm not pursuing those types of roles at this point anymore. I think you've got a ways before you're in that position.

Fake check scam: https://old.reddit.com/r/Scams/wiki/index/automoderator#wiki_fake_check> The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.> > Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.> > When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html> > If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.",

        "body": "C, C++, Rust, and Python are pretty common languages in robotics, but you'll also need some familiarity with FPGA and microcontroller programming.There's a lot of topics in robotics that depend specifically on the project(s) you work on. It's a field where some MechEng will be super helpful, and you may also find computer vision and university-level mathematics (perhaps a minor) very useful. Math topics like linear algebra, statistics, and especially machine learning are highly relevant.Basically, robotics is a field where a relevant masters' or PhD are beneficial because it needs such a good foundation of math, programming, and engineering. You can enter the discipline without a masters' or PhD (probably a science or engineering program), but it will be a lot harder and you'll need to develop your skills without those structured courses.",
