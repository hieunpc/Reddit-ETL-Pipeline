Since people are going to suspect LLMs anyway, I used one to try to reorganize it.I would probably add some testing too.---# Data Engineering Pipeline Checklist## 1. Requirements First- **SLA**: How fresh? (minutes/hours/daily) Daily reporting → no streaming needed- **Impact**: Cost of being late/wrong?- **Consumer**: Dashboards, ML, reporting?## 2. Architecture**Single source of truth**: One storage layer (warehouse/lakehouse/object storage). Everything reads from it.**Batch over streaming**: Streaming adds complexity (ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills). Default to batch unless real-time is essential.**Design for backfills**: Parameterized date ranges, versioned transforms, separate raw/modeled layers.## 3. Reliability**Idempotency**: Jobs must be safely rerunnable via partitioned outputs, overwrite-by-partition/merge strategies, deterministic keys.**Orchestration**: Use Airflow/Dagster/Prefect for retries, dependencies, visibility, parameterized runs. Avoid \"cron spaghetti.\"## 4. Observability**Minimum to prevent silent failures**:- Row counts/volume checks- Freshness checks- Schema drift alerts- Job duration tracking## 5. Performance**Optimize last**. Most slowness comes from bad joins, file layout, or moving too much data—not lack of Spark.**Fix basics first**: Partitioning, columnar formats, filter pushdown, avoid cartesian joins.## 6. Simplicity Rule**If your SLA is met with**: scheduler + Python/SQL + storage + basic checks**Then distributed systems add unnecessary complexity.****Use distributed systems when**:- Volume exceeds single-machine capacity (hundreds GB–TBs)- True real-time requirements (sub-minute)- Complex streaming aggregations- Multiple concurrent consumers need isolation",

Something lighter like Liftbridge (Kafka semantics, single Go binary, no JVM/ZooKeeper) or just NATS JetStream covers 90% of cases.On the storage side - totally agree on \"one source of truth, columnar, object storage.\" We're building Arc with exactly this mindset: DuckDB for compute, Parquet for storage, S3-compatible backend. No distributed cluster to babysit, SQL interface, handles GB-to-TB scale without the Spark tax.The line I use: if I can run the query on a single node in acceptable time, I don't need a distributed system.

For the first three months or so, while building the team, everything was smooth. But after that, I started feeling more or less the same way you described. When you’re the decision-maker, from system design to the nitty-gritty details, you’re also the one who gets blamed when things don’t work out. At one point, I even felt that juniors were contributing more than me because I was stuck in a loop of wrong decisions. But that’s okay. We are engineers, and we are supposed to try, fail, and learn until something works out. It can feel overwhelming to be your own north star at the beginning. I hope you start figuring things out soon. During my own period of doubt, my CTO once told me, “I’m happy that you’re demotivated. It shows you’re serious about your work, and when things don’t work out, you feel disappointed. That’s a great engineer trait.” So you do have a great engineer trait.

Use draw.io or something like that to draw your architecture, and share that with your team before building it and review it to see if it is foolproof. Then go build your application to that architecture. Things will fall into place, and you’ll have a documented trail of why you made decisions. And for streaming itself, just use Spark structured streaming. And if you need to do a backfill have a classic Spark job set up for it.

Some teams make that visible with domo dashboards. Others track it through snowflake usage or monte carlo alerts. Same idea. Prevention not firefighting.",

For data errors we either fixed in source or, as a last resort, included the fixes as custom transforms in our data pipeline.",

Unfortunately, nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution, and things often languish in MVP stage far longer than you’ll ever expect. Often the MVP is the P, and you’ll have to live with whatever architecture was originally built. Spreadsheet for a POC? Maybe… but MVP? Often a bad idea. For a website just displaying some data… probably a fine solution I grant you. But for anything more complex, no. How are you handling pushing the data? Do you have a Dev/PPE/Prod spreadsheet? Do you run tests to validate the data before it gets pushed live? How are you managing the schema of the spreadsheet against your application layer? What if you need to roll back? If your client can’t handle using git or some other workflow to update the data, I’d want some substantial guard rails in place if I am letting them edit production data. At least some type of defined deployment flow with validation and integration testing. A cloud hosted DB has pretty minimal costs. Databases have tons of advantages, but the one of the most important is they are robust and conform to a design standard with means that the next guy who comes along wont be stuck unpicking a bespoke spreadsheet solution.Also, DBs are not the only solution. I often favour config files in a git repo for dynamic data that I need to let clients manage. That way they can be CI/CD integrated, with any necessary deployment, version management, and testing built in.",

Kill the spreadsheet idea and build an input mechanism that handles all your validation concerns. The spreadsheet will change, regardless of whatever promises the business says.

If I do \"overtime\" (lol fool me, I'm on a salary, but I can swing it as take a few hours off another day) it's because I have some weird compulsion to do so: something playing on my mind, something I want to progress or finish off; or some training/learning/research.

Or the goal. Basically help the owners/shareholders/whatevers make more money? Cool, man... very fulfilling.OP, are you more entrepreneurial , do you want to work for yourself more than some company?

I'm also a humanities graduate who did the same pivot about 6 years ago.The major problem really is having zero reliability on upstream data which makes all analytics really difficult to do well. And cultural transformation is as important as technical in that scenario so you need to ask yourself if that's something you're willing to engage in - personally I feel the payoff is too uncertain versus the effort. On the generalist vs specialist question: you could stay a generalist if you want to go down one of 2 paths: 1) moving into management as quickly as possible or 2) carving out a niche as the 'first data hire'. In the second case, companies with no data team want a full stack data engineer / analyst / scientist who can do a bit of everything without investing in a whole team.If neither of those appeal, I would figure out what you enjoy most and focus on that. At least that's what I'm doing at my current place:1) building pipelines to move data around - focus on data engineering2) transforming data into usable, analytics ready data sets - analytics engineering3) speaking to stakeholders, answering business questions and building end user visualisation and analysis - data analyst4) building statistical / predictive models - data scientist6) strategy, leadership, management - project management, productI'm figuring out what I like most about the job, focusing efforts for the next 6 months on building stuff for that role specifically. Then I'm job hunting. This can be quite difficult given the demands of your firm might not align with what you want to do - e.g. if you want to be a data engineer and learn how to set up airflow on AWS but you've already got a vaguely usable set up using different tech, saying 'I want to learn this' might not cut it as a business case. You might have to figure out a way to be creative with the truth to get your way in that scenario, but honestly that's where your humanities background kicks in lol.So my personal take with these kinds of roles is that they rarely make sense long term. Use it to get the experience you want and feel you need and then move on to something else.You mentioned you like the architecture and design piece of the job - that's a good starting point and probably puts you more in the data engineering camp of the 6 roles above. Unfortunately 'architect' roles tend to be quite senior and you need to have some grunt work under your belt before unlocking those, but I imagine data engineering is the right place for that.Your tech stack is already a great starting point and tbh a good team will see python and SQL experience as enough - anything else is just learning tooling and reading the docs. I also think hiring someone who has stood up a serviceable stack on a shoestring budget with some creativity should be a more interesting profile than someone who just sets up Fivetran and Snowflake and calls it a day. But it might be worth just thinking through a simple pipeline and making sure you can talk credibly about all components of it - e.g. an orchestrator like airflow, a warehouse like BQ or Snowflake, etc. I think a good resource could be something like the Zoomcamp data engineering course - you could take a look at their materials and see if you can implement some of it at work.",

I'd say that's true of pretty much any role that's not the 'prototypical' FAANG data engineering role. It sounds to me like you're doing quite a good job given the situation. > Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?This is just my opinion, and there are many opinions on this topic. I personally have always leaned a bit more toward being a generalist, and it has served me well. I also pivoted from a humanities background (linguistics), and whether this is true or not, I've internalized that I'm never going to be the whiz kid of hard coding skills and deep mathematical and algorithmic knowledge. I do think a humanities background tends to help with communication, asking questions, and defining a problem, especially compared to many of the pure CS grads I've worked with. On some level the tools don't *really* matter too much, you're solving a similar set of problems and you'll have to use whatever tools the company you work for has available. I lean on my ability to learn when I've had to pick up new tools, workflows, and programming languages - so far so good.Obviously it's good to have a few areas where you build deep expertise, but I think this happens as a matter of course for most people anyway. I think there's probably some trade off where deeply specializing early on can net you higher pay sooner, with a somewhat higher risk of getting really good at something that doesn't exist in a few years. All of that being said, we're really talking about two extreme ends of a spectrum. Most people are going to end up de facto specialists in little sub niches over the course of a career, even if they are relative generalists in data tech.",

I don’t think you’re any of a data engineer, an analyst, a data architect, a data manager … because all those specific roles have filled out these days and are more defined.However i think you are probably in a good place, as imo AI is going to pull these functions back together over the next few years. Probably as other have said around a title similar to analytics engineer.My guess is we end up with 3 core engineer roles - AI, Platform & Analytics. With the other key areas being governance/data management.Id just suggest starting to specialise in a function rather than focussing on an individual tools, after all, Excel will probably be flavour of the month again in a year or two :face_with_tears_of_joy:",

You’re doing the heavy lifting—cleaning up the Excel Wild West and acting as a Data Janitor to make sure the business doesn't collapse under its own messy data.My advice? Don't worry about choosing a lane just yet. Being a generalist in a zero data culture environment is a superpower. However, stop the band-aid fixes as soon as you can. If you want to scale, look into dbt first. It’ll help you turn those fragmented Python scripts into a SSOT. You're building the foundation of a skyscraper; make sure the cement is solid.",

Edit: This is maybe a useless or incorrect comment; I honestly don't know what a recruiter or hiring manager would stop and look at more when faced with a stack of CVs/resumes...I've been in a similar space for the 7 years I've been in a data-focused role - my team has been a team of 2 ICs the entire time. We have a business-oriented manager now. For a little while we had a data architect. But, in a lot of ways it has been me wearing hats for platform admin/architect/engineer/modeller/analyst/visualiser. For a bit over a year I've been titled Lead Data Engineer.It's absolutely tough being at the end of the chain as some sort of generalist mid-to-senior. Apart from the year or so I worked with the architect who'd been around a while, I've had to learn a lot on my own, and from the internet, and from paid-for consultants.Whether you want to generalise or specialise depends on your goals, I think. I like the variety of experience and work that can come from being a generalist. I think I am just that way inclined, though, jack-of-all-trades kind of thing. But, in my career, I don't think I've been a proper specialist, so :man_shrugging: Another way to look at it is breadth rather than depth of expertise. On this point, I like what u/Psychological-Suit-5 said. One more edit for silliness. Could you set your own title as Data Gandalf?",

Data infra is so easy with lots of tooling.So the real job is ingesting data, building the data model & observing business people's questions and AI answers, and fixing the data model & enriching documentation to get the right answer from AI.At least for smaller companies, that's how it works right now around me. Data people are being Data&AI Engineers or full-stack data people.I also see, most of the companies are removing lots of their dashboards, keeping only the very fundamental ones. For the rest, you should build your data model & semantic layer. AI is doing the rest.Edit: Also, I forgot to say, maybe you should hire a data consultant for 1 day a week to check your data models & give you recommendations on architecture. By this way, you'll get better at these things as well.",

The job is to solve problems and achieve real-world objectives. Sometimes to do that we have to consider other constraints on the problem space, such as:- \"this technology is inferior, but it's battle tested and has loads of technical support staff backing it; we can't afford the risk of a new system going down and having no way to fix it\"- \"this technology is old, and therefore I can easily hire people who already know it, and there is a lot of documentation; the new one is great on paper but we need experienced staff to maintain it, and they are hard to find\"- \"this new technology is better than what we currently have in terms of technical performance, but we've rigged up enough custom ameliorations around the existing core tech that we will realise hardly any real world gains from switching\"- \"we would benefit from switching technologies in a measurable way, saving £50,000 per year, but it would take this entire team six months of work to move all our legacy code onto it. They have other, more pressing priorities and the benefit doesn't outweigh the cost of hiring a team of contractors to do it.\"But let's say you think there's a big pool of potential adopters for whom SQLMesh II would make business sense. It's not so easy to take a slightly superior technology and turn that into a going concern. dbt has mass adoption.Are you personally planning to fork SQLMesh and spend a substantial chunk of your time maintaining it, if Fivetran strip the original for parts? Perhaps you will fund this via a hosted version - will you be picking up the phone to pitch it to companies yourself, or will you use your own money to pay someone to do that?What will you do if Fivetran freak out as soon as you get traction and throw a bunch of engineers at making dbt good enough to kill your competitive advantage? Unlike SQLMesh-original-flavour, you don't have proprietary code; Fivetran have access to the same stuff plus a lot more resources.Remember, you _only_ get acquired if it makes business sense to them to spend the money on buying you out ... instead of on using their own engineering team to outcompete you. If that happens it's very good news for analytics engineering, but _terrible_ news for you as a founder. Typical outcome: nothing happens. The incumbent has no motivation to improve, and would-be founders have no ability to realise the gains for themselves, so do nothing to change this.",

Things like staff or principal level roles tend to be more about setting direction, reviewing designs, and translating business needs into technical plans.If you want business exposure, try to move closer to stakeholders first before jumping into something like an MBA. Leading projects, owning roadmaps, or being the person who explains tradeoffs to non technical folks can change how you’re perceived pretty quickly. Consulting can be a fit if you enjoy ambiguity and communication, but it’s a different lifestyle. I’d test the strategic side inside your current world before making a big reset.",

I’m assuming by mid-level you mean a title like senior data engineer in my response.This is the arguably the hardest point in your career to progress. As many point out you can go IC or PL route. PL route tends to make a higher bonus but you can still make very good money as IC so both are viable paths. I know many engineers who have stayed at the level you are at their entire career. Only a few percent move up from here. This is because a new set of skills are required. You are no longer just coding 8 hours per day. This looks different depending on the company size but these roles are responsible for architecting solutions and leading others in the solution implementation. I do both in my role on a smaller team but often these are split into a Principal Architect and a Manager role.So to move into these roles you need to demonstrate you can architect solutions and lead others via your work experience. Unfortunately almost no one will tell you that simply doing great work in your role doesn’t make you eligible for a promotion to the next one. Unless you demonstrate the skills required for the next level you will not even be viewed as a viable candidate by others. In practice this usually looks like partnering with business stakeholders to define a problem or need, designing a solution that addresses that problem or need, and organizing a team of engineers to deliver this solution. As a manager I could complete all the work which I delegate myself but instead I focus on turning business requirements into tasks, delegating those tasks to our engineers, and filling knowledge gaps so the engineers can complete the work.I could keep going here but I think I’ve made the main point. You must proactively make the choice to stop spending 100% of your time implementing and spend some of it addressing these other requirements. Then you will get noticed for promotions or for external job openings.",

If something goes wrong in prod we usually get a response from Fivetran's internal support team within few hours. (fivetrans support was not that good 2 years back, but now its great!!, same goes with HVR UI. it was horrendous in HVR5. HVR6 is just smooth af).Also HVR provides soo many real time metrics of replication it's just crazy. Below is one of the recent incidents which helped us troubleshoot one prod issue.1. source team some how messed up one of their backend process and it was generating almost 200Million updates per day on a single table. right after this we saw our replication latency in HVR spiked upto 3 hours. If it was any other tool we would be scratching our heads and thinking there is something wrong with our pipeline itself.But with HVR's realtime metrics we were able to see which table was causing this issue and know the exact volume of that table. We quickly informed the source team and they stopped their process.",

Notice how on the business side of things change all the time, and the conversation is always about its a dynamic environment and not the lack of foresight on the part of management/leadership.

That gap is exhausting and usually leads to burnout exactly like you described. Asking someone to “go faster” without fixing deployment order issues, data gaps, or validation rules is not actionable feedback. It is just pressure.If anything, the fact that you are documenting discrepancies, rebuilding inherited messes, and validating edge cases suggests you are doing the job correctly, not slowly. The risk is that you are absorbing systemic chaos personally instead of it being acknowledged as a team or org issue. That is not sustainable long term, and it is reasonable to say that out loud.",

        "body": "> in this AI age, code production is a very cheap commodityCode production is actually easy on AI age. Good code paired with good engineers that understand the code and know how to locate issues, fix them, support customers and add features on what they have without disturbing what they did before is not.I've seen lots of junior engineers using AI tools as fit for all tools which result in many of them being clueless of what's going on. That's a tremendous risk for a company. When something goes wrong things goes wrong in a big way. Tools have no accountability or responsibility but engineers do. Tip for engineers out there: AI tools are a game changer but NEVER deploy code you don't understand.> Unit tests and component-specific tests are worthlessMaybe if you miss what's the purpose of unit tests. I see lots of engineers using unit tests to give them coverage or just as a way to look responsible but mostly the tests are so tied to the components that are not testing anything specific. If there are edge cases on potencial user inputs that should be tested to guarantee that no one removes the actual piece of code that does the validation or fallback on the inputs. So I would say: bad tests are detrimental, good tests are amazing guard rails.> Dependencies has to be explicitSounds like a no-brainer but it's actually hard to enforce that because many teams/engineers lack the discipline to do so and only value that once the s* hits the fan (somehow similar to skipping the tests)> nowadays you can build something in 1 hour and wait 2-3 days for reviewBad engineering culture drives that. Mostly people are valued by the litres of code they add or the features they add (even if unbaked). Code reviews are good for aligning, learning and guaranteeing some standards. Running pipelines costs time and money so it's not the case they are free. So maybe code reviews investment might be something people should lean on.> REALLY GOOD data engineer (that can communicate well with business, solid data modeling skills, deep technical expertise to design efficient storage/compute, etc) rather than hiring 5 “okay” data engineersNot that linear. You need good leadership that knows what's implemented, running and what your customers want. You need to make sure that everyone understand what's going on and why the things are the way they are, that's essential part of leadership. When it comes to ambiguity and a decision needs to be made you need someone that is a good leader and has a strong sponsor (CTO, VP, Director...).If there is no leadership, sense of direction and accountability/responsibility is something exoteric even the best engineer will not be able to do the change and in that case maybe the 5 cheaper engineers might ship out more (despite risking shipping the wrong things at the wrong time with arguable quality).So, in other words, your 5 cheap engineers are not an alternative to the \"good\" engineer but rather a combination of both.",

        "body": "Yep, so this is a pattern dbt uses regularly. I am fairly new as well (been reading/learning for what seems like years, but work doesn’t want to go down this route).Basically, the idea is you bring each referenced source table in to the model you’re working on as their own cte. By doing this pattern you have a clear reference to every parent model you are using at the top of your model.You then perform the transformation steps, including the joining of those referenced tables as the next cte (or several ctes depending on complexity).Then you read directly out of your last cte - preferably with little transformation in the final step.All of this is to make things as readable and organised as possible.If you were to start transforming each source in the initial cte, you wouldnt be reading a simple, single line bringing it in to the current model, but reading more complex transformations that you would need to spend more time figuring out what that piece was doing and where it began and ended.Edit to add: this way you can tell at a glance at the top of your model all the referenced sources. Each of them as a single line cte with no complexity thrown in. After you have brought in each source as its own cte, then you start a new one with a name indicating the source and transformation step, etc.By bringing in your sources, transforming each, joining, performing joined transformations, aggregating, etc, each in a little code block cte, you are mimicking how programmers would use methods in code to logically break code into chunks.If you also read up about layering data models (medallion architecture), you’ll see how dbt likes to break it down further into separate models. This allows you to perform the simple single-model transformations, such as renaming, casting, etc at a ”silver” stage, and more complex transformations such as joining or calculating the values in two tables, aggregating, etc in a later, “gold” model. This takes the organising and simplifying of models from within a single model/step, to a process.——- /* Model header and configuration */ // bring in referenced models and sources WITH orders AS ( SELECT * FROM source_orders ), customers AS ( SELECT * FROM source_customers ) // transform table transform_orders AS ( SELECT col1 AS col1_rename, col2 AS cast(col2 AS string), .....

It’s a hassle at first, but if it means less business logic is owned by your team and is shared by analysts or other stakeholders it’s worth it. I’d get this written down though (been there done that and still end up owning business logic) or else it’s kinda just busy work, although still a great modernization project.Because at the end of the day if your team is still responsible for those transforms, why do any re tooling?

Specifically what helped me the most was knowing1. Some basic statistics like: * Mean, median, mode * Variance and standard deviation * Probability distributions * Confidence interval2. Some linear algebra like: * Vectors and matrices * Matrix multiplication * Eigenvalues and eigenvectors * Dot product and cross product3. Some basic calculus * Derivatives and gradients * Integrals * Chain rule4. Some discrete math like: * Sets and set operations * Logic and Boolean algebra * Functions and relations * Trees and traversalsNow these are the things that I need to perform my job at my organization but the most important skill is SQL. Our organization uses Google Cloud so infrastructure building with Terraform was also a skill I had to pick up while working.Hope this helps :)",

Even though they are some differences and additional features the price tag is not low. I think $100 / user / month. If you want to leverage all the additional feature like job scheduling, catalog, semantic layer etc it might be worth it as you don’t have to setup infrastructure for those.

It is a no code solution for data manipulation more than anything. It doesnt really provide more utility than excel or just raw python scripting will. It will leave your stakeholders dependent on an expensive per seat solution. And it is really not hardened for production etl.All I am here to say is it is not worth committing to the sales pitch let alone actual adoption of the product.One simple thing to do is excel, power query, and python in excel. You can do (limited) python in excel cells now. So if you can get data to a point that power query can consume it into a workbook, you can process it in excel and generate your output as a new sheet. It is something I have done as the endpoint when a stakeholder absolutely had to have data refresh ready in excel. I find this the best approach to produce. Power query can easily attach to most common data sources, I created a rest api to serve flattened pre processed data specifically for consumption by one of these as an example, but you can do local csv,website/api, SharePoint, s3, various dbs, Salesforce as examples. Once that data is loaded you can reference the sheet in your python cell, do transformations, and output a df as a table to fill your consumption layer sheet. On data refresh it will rerun your python.",

Your ability to be a good junior engineer isn’t pinned on a specific technology, so I wouldn’t worry too much about that. A company focused on Snowflake today could switch to Fabric or Databricks tomorrow. Now as you get more senior, you’re going to want to specialize in something which does narrow your focus but it’s way too early to worry about that now.

There are plenty of rich learning opportunities with Fabric. Yes, it has paper cuts. Yes, sometimes picking the right tool feels like deciding whether to eat your meal with a grapefruit spoon, a butter knife, or a plastic spork. But I am learning and growing, no regrets at all in that regard. I'm writing PySpark every week (with lots of help from ChatGPT Plus :grinning_face_with_sweat:) and learning more about delta tables than I ever wanted to.And if I wasn't a massive, massive Microsoft shill, I'm confident that after this project is done I could hard pivot my career to Databricks if I wanted to. Snowflake slightly less so. So, I can't give you a neutral opinion, but I'm happy to answer any questions.",

Fabric is as popular as a fart in a spacesuit in this sub, but it is data engineering. The technologies you mention, Python, SQL, pipelines etc are all transferable to other \"real\" platforms. There are a lot of opportunities just now with people migrating from Power BI and Synapse to Fabric, so it could also be a good career move financially.And with AI, the ability to write pipelines and code in Databricks or Fabric (or anything else) isn't going to matter so much. I'd concentrate on really getting to understand your data and building relationships with your user base, translating requirements into actual deliverables.

That’s what I’m usually looking for in candidates anyway.That said, many recruiters and even managers are just locking in on the tool they use/want to use….Just realized that I don’t really have good advice for you here :smiling_face_with_tear: I guess finding the right manager looking past the number in resumes is one thing.

The exact DQ checks you need to implement depends on your use case, but the ones that you’re listed - will be already a huge step forward if you have none now. For the love of God don’t event try to build your own DQ framework, so many teams make this mistake. Instead use some of the already available open-source solutions, some of them are very very good. Testing is also very important part of pipelines, which are unfortunately neglected by most of the DE teams. It will make sure that your commit editing “pipeline A”, won’t alter the logic of “pipeline B”. End-to-end Testing is the best thing you can do for your Data Architecture. Create a small sample input dataset, dozen of rows usually is enough. Create expected output dataset. Run pipeline on using sample input as source and compare your actual output with expected output. Do it on every merge to main branch. Very simple, straightforward but gives you a lot of confidence in you data pipelines. It requires some simple CI/CD pipeline and probably separate env to run the tests but data quality always comes with a price, like all good things in this life :)",

Record X isn’t in staging (CST is Jan 3), so it gets lost.As I’m typing this though, I’m thinking a buffer day might solve this? E.g., rather than extracting just 4th and 5th, extract 3rd as well.

Now that all Snowpipe/Snowpipe streaming is a fixed price (0.0037 Credits per GB), it should be easier to see what your costs will be regardless of the number of files. Generally Snowpipe will be cheaper, but your time is worth something too. As you mention, Snowpipe can support schema evolution with ENABLE\\_SCHEMA\\_EVOLUTION = TRUE. But if you need more granular control, I could see scenarios where you might want to do it your way. Bottom line, get an understanding of GB/hour for data coming in so you'll be able to answer the cost differential between the two approaches. If it is a lot of data, the difference might be fairly small. Good luck!",

The pipeline cannot resolve this issue and will most likely fail if the missing column is used in transformations. You can detect schema changes with DBT-tests with dbt-expectations package or you can use great expectations package or dlt (data load tool) when using Python. Those tools also allow for detecting other type of problems, e.g. for categorical fields additional values that are not expected. You can also define simple tests or expectations that a column shouldn’t have NULL values, or fields need to be of a specific types and and and …Anything you can envision will happen eventually. And most often it requires human intervention to be fixed because most likely you need to talk to other people to either fix it at the source or you need to adjust the data pipeline to handle the new case. Your time is best spend in investing in detection and observability so you can spot the reason for the failure quickly.One way to minimize your disruption (and this is used in more mature organisations) is to create data contracts with your source system owners.

Usually upstream, first point of contact for data in. the biggest break is generally some bogus formatting, client didn’t sent proper line terminators, invalid data types for particular fields/elements/properties, custom lookup values that were never accounted for, layout changes we were never informed about, etc… we run in to structural and quality issues often and our systems are required to continue running and successfully consume what they accurately can, report and track errors for what they can’t, and store all raw data for reprocessing purposes. Downstream of all of this, of course, when processing the load of cleansed data to production systems, the many pitfalls you might run in to there and need to report alongside the original raw picture of data to clients and internally. My favorite is a client we have who has a massive hierarchy for their enterprise that is sent to us via web services so that we can marry it up to our hierarchy for them in our system, all sent as this massive multi megabyte json beast. Most of the issues with them are mapping them to the right corresponding place within the hierarchy, and it’s a lot of reporting what isn’t set up by our enterprise so we can successfully consume the data at a later date. After corrections, we automatically reprocess raw data for these clients for just the failures.I often run in to structural or data quality issues that I need to gracefully handle.",

Partition by Day should be good. It would be roughly \\~25mb or so per hour. Iceberg can use hidden partitions so you can literally pass the timestamps or hourly based timestamps in your query. In short users don't have to know the partition column well in advance and you can modify it. Maybe have another column which has timestamp it is getting written to silver ( the timestamp of the micro batch. Say 200 files per 60mins is roughly 15-20 files every 2-3 minutes) Handle you duplicates, idempotency , business logic etc in this silver pipeline. If anything fails always read the bronze and retrigger the pipeline. 3. Once you write to your silver you ask your client what is the latest timestamp it has and see if you silver has anything new and if yes send >= that timestamp from client ( rough idea). Keep in mind about backfills. If your mini jobs fail multiple times you should be effectively able to delete those partitions and run the pipeline again and retrigger data to your other service.

The salary I'm on at the moment is good, I get that but I'm mid 30s, I probably have 30 years left in work, it makes sense to consider what my future look like. When I think about progression there's a lot of stress and long hours that come for positions of more seniority as a DBA. Depending on the company, as a Head of/ Manager you can almost always be on call if that makes sense and I'm not sure the value is really there for me.I should clarify there are no plans to immediately transition, I'm on a good salary, it's remote and there's low demand, but when I think of 30+ years of working, I need to consider my options. I realise if I looked to move tomorrow I'd need to take a pay cut. I was thinking I'd be looking somewhere between £50-£65k though I think with my role changing I should be able to do a bit more of a hybrid role for a couple of years.",

As a DBA a call might look like an emergency call at 3 am that a critical server / db was down. In a worst case situation you might work 24 hours straight to bring systems back online and still would need to be back in the office on time the next day. As a DE, depending on industry itnis much more common to get a pipeline failure alert and deal with itnfirst thing in the morning. Fixing a production pipeline is alsonalmost always easier than something like an emergency server migration / DR rebuild. The actual easiest way to make the switch is find a hybrid role as a DBA. Find a role whwre you have to do both jobs. Half 6our day is spent doing the normal DBA tasks. Other half is sepnt writing pipelines, architecting solutions, database design, ci/cd, etc. Then look for a role that is almost exclusively DE work. That said you will still be used and leveraged as a DBA in a pinch because very few pure DE's have enough SQL / server knowledge to help out at the same level you can.",

In my current role I still wear both hats fairly regurlarly. In fact I was hired more for my DBA skills than my DE skills.That said I found all the following skills very helpful in making the switch. 1. Expert level Powershell knowledge. This comes in handy both on prem and in thr cloud if you regurlarly work with Microsoft stacks. If not Bash would be more useful. 2. Intermediate Python skills. I learned python after powershell and the knowledge transfers easily between them. Somethings when you know both get hard just from do pythonism or powershellism in the other language. In Python focus on learning the common DE packages like pandas, polars, SqlAlchemy, pyodbc, requests these will get used constantly when writing pipelines for rest api endpoints. Dont worry too much about getting into the weeds with oop as most pipelines are not written that way. 3. If you want to go one step further learn Pyspark which is hugely useful in cloud pipelines and datalakes. Azure data factory, Databricks, etc is just spark underneath the sheets. 4. As a DBA for 10 years before making the switch. I was very familiar with On Prem / runnung SQL on VMs. A big switch for me was learning PaaS offerings like snowflake, databricks, Azure SQL, Azure data factory. So spending time learning the basics on these helped. I got lucky and was dealing with vendors / clients using these services so got paid to learn on thr job as it were. 5. Many older DBAs still have yet to embrace source control. If you are in this boat learn source control, ci/cd, and managing databases as code. If you get these under you belt it will make life better as a DBA and a DE. 6. Communication skills. I have to communicate with non technical and business staff more frequently as a DE than as a pure DBA. As a DBA we are kept locked up and kept away from business / non technical / dats analyst types. We are a bit like wizards who only send ravens when you have really fucked up. Being a DE is more meetings and requirement gathering.",

CS fundamentals before starting?You don’t need to be a \"computer science expert\", but you do need core skills:* SQL (non-negotiable)* Basic Python* Understanding of data pipelines, ETL/ELT* Cloud fundamentals (Azure is perfectly fine)You can build these gradually. No one expects you to know everything on day one.2. Is DP-700 a good certification to start with?DP-700 is a solid certification, but it’s slightly more valuable if you already understand the basics of:* Data modeling* Spark* Azure Data Factory* Synapse* Delta LakeFor a complete beginner, it can feel heavy. It helps, but it won’t magically land a job unless you pair it with hands-on practice.3. What should you actually start with?Here’s the order I recommend (I use this path for mentees transitioning from non-tech backgrounds):1. SQL basics → intermediate → analytical SQL2. Python for data tasks (Pandas, scripting, file handling)3. Cloud fundamentals (Azure AZ-900 is a good starter)4. Data engineering concepts (batch vs streaming, data lakes, warehousing)5. Spark (Databricks or Azure Synapse)6. Then consider DP-700.By the time you reach DP-700, you will understand why you are learning each topic instead of memorizing answers.4. Other certifications worth considering* AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals): great starting point* DP-900 (Azure Data Fundamentals): perfect for beginners* Later: DP-203 : this is the most recognized DE certification on AzureYour background isn’t a limitation. Your willingness to learn is your biggest advantage.If you take it step by step instead of trying to \"jump to the end\", the transition becomes not just possible, but achievable.You have already taken the most important step: asking the right questions!",

        "body": "tl;dr: I wouldnt necessarily advice to use Snowflake as operational database. As an analytical database, it might help you if the analysts are experiencing timeouts and/or slow queries Depends on how much data you have. Are analysts experiencing problems when they run queries on MySQL? And if they are, are you sure this is a problem related to the amount of data or could it be due to a bad-indexed db or small ec2 instance used to query?By design, Snowflake is not made to be an operational database. There is a new table format called Interactive Table, which according to the documentation is basically the way you would use Snowflake for transactional data (low-latency + high concurrency). It is, however, also written that you get best performance by querying that table with a Interactive Warehouse, which - and here's the catch - is by default ON all the time (which will sky-rocket your costs)If the analysts are experiencing slow queries, then replicating databases in Snowflake will definitely (most likely) help. In this case, I would leave the MySQL database as your operational database and replicate them in Snowflake, where analysts would only query from there (given that they are ok with some delay in the data compared to the data in MySQL). You'll spend a bit less with the AWS instances used to query data, but I'm pretty sure your Snowflake bill will more than compensate that decrease.Btw, I move data from MySQL to Snowflake doing exactly that: lambda -> s3 -> Snowflake (using Tasks) + PowerBI. Very quick to get it up and running (with a first load done with DMS), but given that lambda is not really made for this kind of task (there's a 15min hard timeout in the lambda), I'm on the process of moving that into fargate.",

Some companies do but applications go silent. **Are you commenting more about the usage of Tools vs Impact ?** I have started keeping it as DE to sound more relevant to Linkdin job descriptions. From my research there are various levels/areas of Data Engineering associated ? The other team I mentioned just lands the data in GCS buckets and get it to Big Query they don't care how the data looks like, what to do with data, how to join several different tables etc.Okay you have 50+ salesforces table here you go, here is your 10+ billing/subscriptions tables etc.The way I work with a Customer Success Manager ( non tech just wants the metric and data ) : ->okay how does user\\_id in salesforce table map to some other table in billing with a different user\\_id to finally answer a question how much is this user paying/generating revenue and how many complaints has he raised and how is the customer associate XYZ helping them out, SLA response etc ( tracked via Salesforce ticketing system).As i said the team is small.. we do a lot of things. Sometimes we would build of certain dashboard ( e.g show Average SLA times, Longest ticket open, and design metrics to track and sometimes we don't and BA takes over once we curate the dataset for BI consumption.That does not change the fact my role both in offer letter and in company system shows as Data analyst.",

Back then, it would just be 1 or 2 people who would wrangle the data, build the data model, analyze the trends to make insight, and then go and build the dashboard too. And then as the team grows, 1 person starts getting dedicated to wrangling, another starts getting dedicated to dashboards, etc. So don't feel bad, what you're doing is not uncommon. And its a pretty good starting point because you get to not only see a bit of everything but also speak to it on your resume and interviews.",

The source I'm reading from - combined_source - reads its data from two sources: source_A and source_B, respectively. Sometimes, in combined_source, data from source_A will be ahead of data from source_B, and sometimes the opposite. Other times they will be perfectly in sync. I don't have access directly to source_A and source_B, so I need to read from combined_source and use the respective lists of item_ids - list_A and list_B, which I possess - to distinguish between them.",

I wanted something related to sustainability but that decreases options significantly and most don't have vacancies for people with a degree in computer science. I found a research center related to marine conservation that uses bioinformatics and that seemed like a good option as I like biology as well but I was afraid of the precariousness... Eventually I found this amazing company that is non-profit by the way where, even tho apps are mostly CRUD (but they also use kafka for some) the environment in there and the mission is enough to make me happy and stay. Also, I think if I got to research, being it bioinformatics or math, I wouldn't have time for anything else, I couldn't just study other things I am interested (at least that's what I think)I hope you liked my story :)",

Most educational games have some clunky mechanics around the “learning” part and just aren’t fun and I feel like they justify themselves as “it’s boring but it’s educational”. Your game seems to be really fun and the mechanics around “programming a robot farm” is genius in my opinion. I wish I was starting my programming journey to enjoy your game with fresh eyes.

We look at internships by far the most, followed by cs degree and gpa (less than a 3.0 is out usually). There are wayyyyyyyy too many cs majors to bother looking at resumes that don't have a technical degree. The irony here is that once I am interviewing someone, I often do take a look at them if they make it past a tech screen. But this doesn't mean the projects themselves are the differentiator.  I have never seen a project unique enough to make up for anything significant in thousands of resumes.  With AI I think this muddies the waters even more. Anything interesting has an even bigger asterisk.  People are just not trustworthy when their livelihood is at stake. This is an industry that is fiercely devoted to the idea that seemingly very few devs can code at all and has loved to crow about how their applicants can't pass fizzbuzz for decades now.

In C, you have to do a lot of things explicitly that are handled implicitly by Python's stdlib classes.* A lot of resource handling (files, sockets, etc) can be done with context managers.* Loops can usually be handled as iterator algebra problems rather than by fiddling with indices. Nested loops can often be turned into non-nested loops with `itertools`.* More broadly, unless you have a really good reason not to do it, stateful manipulation can often be replaced with list comprehensions and some basic functional programming concepts.On the other extreme, just because you can code-golf some problem into a deranged one-liner list comprehension expression does not mean that you should.

Creating storage which a pointer points to (by using new for example) means the object is able to live past your function call.",

        "body": "1. In C/C++, arguments passed into functions **get copied** into the function. They get copied because we may not want to modify the original argument, so it saves us a line of copying, separates areas of concern, and it's a bit faster.2. We **can** pass large values (complex structs, arrays, etc...) as function arguments. But they will be copied. That can be a lot of copying, especially if we can't anticipate the size of arguments `my_func(int arg[12])` vs `my_func(int arg[9999])`. 3. Since function arguments get copied, and large copies are expensive, it's cheaper and faster to pass the address (pointer) of the data as a function argument.1. Very low level programming can involve jumping forward and backward to memory addresses. We can do math on the pointer itself to get to different addresses. You may never do this yourself, but pointers gives us access to this capability.Why are you experiencing this in C++ when C++ is supposed to be modern? Because C++ was designed to be compatible with C and the preexisting C libraries. C was designed like this because it was one of the first successful abstractions above assembly and written in an era when compute, storage, and memory was very expensive (cost and compute cycles).Edit: I mostly mentioned functions + pointers and not pointers in general, but my goal is to justify the utility of pointers and mentioning their benefits with functions is good enough.",

If you need to load a picture into memory, you don't know where in memory that picture is going to end up, so it isn't given an address until it is made. The pointer stores where that memory is after it is allocated.The next question as to why this is a thing where it isn't in other languages is because C++ is code that is running much closer to the processor than in other languages. Other languages abstract away this issue for you, but in environments where C++ is commonly used, such as 3D engines, operating system kernels, or embedded devices like arduino, we can't trust any other tooling to handle this efficiently enough for us, we need direct control. And using pointers to manage memory allocation and passing around information is how it all works under the hood.Beyond that, pointers are also the mechanism that your program uses to point to functions in other programs such as system API's, etc.",

Even during 2020 -2021, it wasn't uncommon to get jobs just knowing basic syntax of programming languages. AI makes it exceptionally easy to produce code that works, so the jr positions have changed drastically. Jrs previously would cut their teeth writing boilerplate and simple code while they built their experience. That is nowhere near the case in 2025 going into 2026. Effectively, the bar has been raised to be a mid-level developer to get in.",

For example \"ZOO-123: Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" This ties that commit with Jira ticket ZOO-123 that either is about changes to RabbitMQ messaging or about fixing an issue with said messaging.Also, some companies use conventional commits. It is just a way of formatting your commit message so that automated tools can process commits in an easier way. Read about it from [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) An example would be \"fix(ZOO-123): Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" There the fix() keyword shows that the commit was for fixing something. A feat() keyword can be for adding a new feature or for working with some new functionality. For example \"feat(SCHOOL-23): Add Japanese language.\"The commit message itself is often in imperative present tense. For example \"Fix to\" instead of \"Fixed\". The commit should give a summary of the change. What was done. Keep it concise and clear. Do not add a whole essay. But also do not just write \"Added more changes.\" Which changes? Why? Read about it from [https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3](https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3) Avoid frustration and all kind of nonsense in the commits. Yes, when the stuff does not work and your earlier commit did not fix it then writing \"Get working already!!!!!\" or \"wgo8g7tfwo82w37fdto238gd\" is not a rational way how to deal with the issue. It is unprofessional. In the previous company I worked at, we had one guy who raged in his commit messages.Avoid adding too many details. Instead of writing \"Fix to UserNotificationIntegrationTest, BillingIntegrationTest, BaseIntegrationTest, RabbitMQPublisherIntegrationTest\" better pick \"Fix to integration tests\". Which tests, that can be seen from the git commit itself. Neither go with \"Added an email support to UserNotificationService by introducing emailSender() method that uses angus-mail library\" just write \"Add support to send user notifications via email\" Some good and bad examples are in [https://chris.beams.io/git-commit](https://chris.beams.io/git-commit) Also, it does not really help when you finish your whole project and then add it via a single commit that has a commit message of \"Initial commit\".",

One of the best pieces of advice I got from my first manager was something along the lines of “I don’t care about dev. We have it for a reason and no one depends on that data. Go break it. That’s how you find out how it’s working and how you find issues. We can always redeploy dev “. And that changed my learning perspective. Instead of feeling like I need to understand the docs cover to cover, I now feel empowered to take a look at the architecture and app dependencies and then just go fuck with it. For example, the past 3 years I’ve worked almost exclusively with serverless architecture in AWS using python. But I just joined a new team and we are shifting the application to EKS using a Java library. No fucking clue but I spend the last 2 days reviewing architecture, in the console, and googling/gpt every step of the way when I run into something I don’t know. Now I have a tool belt of knowledge to aid the team in solving some of their problems. I still have a ton to learn, but after 2 days, I know what questions I need to ask.",

Mindlessly asking AI to generate code for you teaches you nothing. But using AI to explain documentation, recommend improvements, provide examples, and break down code can be immensely valuable. There's nothing wrong with asking AI to clarify and teach. That's exactly what a professor does; to accommodate curriculum reading.What I'll do when trying to pick a new project I'd like to do and ask it something like this: \"I'd like to make an app or program that does xyz. What stack would you recommend and why?\" It'll spit back a bunch of recommendations. Then I'll pull up Google and read a bit about them and pick one. Then I'll pop open the documentation and ask the AI: \"Let's start from the beginning. How do I render zyx? Or how do I get a basic function abc working?\" Then I might ask it to explain the code and reference the documentation. I'll sometimes ask it for a list of the most common functions from the API and what they do, etc... but once AI helps me get the ball rolling I gradually transition to doing things myself. Once I understand the code the AI generated I'll apply it myself. This approach can take awhile but has gotten pretty functional at learning new skills. While I'm doing all this I'm also checking documentation and taking notes. AI is like a tool box but you shouldn't drop the toolbox off at the job site and trust it to build everything itself. Learn to use the tools and apply them properly.",

So focus on finishing freecodecamp because two approaches are apllied there, the projects and theory. And when you finish the freecodecamp build mini projects on your own. There are mini projects on github how to build with JS and its frameworks. And then build a good CV or update if you have one. Also linkedin. And when you finish or land a job upskill all the time.

Try to build it and use it as a blueprint. Solving how to mimic what you see and use will help you learn how to build something you are familiar with. From there you can do that again with something else. Soon you will be able to come up with your own ideas and you will know where to start. You just keep doing the same thing and all of that stuff will come. Design patterns, algorithms, OOP, and the other stuff you will use to solve problems and you may or may not recognize that you are using them. When I was learning without tutorials, videos, or even the internet I later found that I was using many of the design patterns without knowing it.I hope this helps.",

Look, there's no way to just leap from tutorials to building complex software in one bound. So, start small. First, choose a project with a tight scope, like a Todo app with user accounts. Then, get a Trello account and start writing out individual tasks. You want to make these tasks super simple at first. One might be \"create a webpage with Ultimate Todo List as the title.\" Your next task might be \"Create a CSS Page and make sure it's linked to the webpage.\" Then do the same with JavaScript.If you run into something you don't know how to do, make a card for learning how to do it. You do not need or want to fully master new technologies at this stage. You want to learn the bare minimum to incorporate it into your project.If you get stuck, try to look up the specific thing you want to do. For example, if you're trying to make a checkbox the user can click, look up that specific thing. If you're unsure how to store your list of items, look that up, but not until you're working on that task.And then you just keep going. Try to complete one or two cards per day. This is almost exactly how professional software is built, btw. Only we break the cards into batches we can complete in two weeks and call it a sprint. Remember, the cards aren't complete features, they are small tasks. If you know Git (and you should) make a repo for your project and get in the habit of making a branch for each card. Once you complete a card, merge your branch into main and start the process again. Your Main branch should always be a working app with whatever features you've added so far. Start small, complete one or two small tasks every day, rinse, repeat.It's not just a way, it's the only way. Software is built one small step at a time.",

You just keep building things, and you learn as you build. You learn even more by making mistakes, then fixing them. And that learning process never stops, no matter how long you've been doing it for. Programming is much more about learning to systematically decompose big problems into small problems, then solve those small problems in isolation, one at a time, to get to a desired end-point, and that's what separates good programmers from bad programmers. I've known people who have been programming for a few years who are great at approaching problems systematically, and they're great programmers even if they don't know every language feature or design pattern and sometimes do goofy stuff that's not exactly the cleanest or most efficient way to solve that particular problem. Then there are people who never learned to approach problems systematically, and no matter how many years of experience they have, they're still just flailing around and frequently solving the wrong problem in the wrong way, even if they know every esoteric language feature and their code is clean and efficient.",

Once you know one good enough to write and debug some 1,000 lines of code, it is not so hard to do the same with another one.If your goal was different , like developing your own application my recommendation would be different.I have used many different different languages, even developed my own, written compilers, schedulers , garbage processors and more Do not hesitate to ask me more questions if you want , l will be happy to help.And, finally, if anyone tells you this xx language is the best, run away from him!",

I think it could become a pretty standard language for webdev in the future but it might not.What matters most is if you pick up the basic concepts of what programming does, and can apply that knowledge to other ones, so that the question goes from \"what is a pass-by-reference\" to \"how does this language handle passing values to and from functions?\" or \"how does this language handle error propagation and exception handling?\"Go does cool stuff with structs that get really close to Object Oriented Programming concepts, so if you stick to learning programming, you might decide to start thinking about what happens with other actual OOP languages like Java (a standard language despite what a lot of people want to believe)or you might start thinking about how lower level languages like C handle memory stuff differently.After a few months of programming you are probably still in the \"finding out what programming is all about\" stage and haven't gotten to more complicated stuff like the concepts behind things yet.If you are super unsure about continuing with Go and want to look into another language to maybe hammer down the essentials with, I recommend either learning C or python if you can. Python because it sort of does a lot of the heavy lifting for you, and C because it makes you do most of the heavy lifting yourself.",

There were staffing issues that postponed the course but the communication throughout was terrible and we were often times left in the dark. I have heard similar stories about other online bootcamps here in the UK but someone else might have a more positive experience with them. In hindsight I should’ve paid for the more expensive courses that included in person classes/exams as I think there would be more structure. Either that or should’ve gone with something more well known (Lewagon for example). IMO the most valuable thing I gained from the experience was due to the project based assessment, it gave me a git history, portfolio and talking points in interviews.",

I was signed up to NuCamp's newsletter and got an email that my city was offering a retraining scholarship, which meant I'd only have to pay $600 for 7 months of classes. Hard to pass that up.I did NuCamp from September 2024 to March 2025. It's designed to be a part-time program that you can do while you have a full-time job, but I'm not sure how realistic that is. I quit my job and went all in when we started React. Before the BootCamp, I was in tutorial hell, having done Free Code Camp, Harvard CS50, Odin Project, YouTube, and Udemy classes. I'll say that even with all that prep, the BootCamp was a firehose of information, and by the end of it, I was exhausted. I liked the classes. Most of the teachers I had were good. The Jobs class they offered was total trash IMO, but that could have been because of the teacher, who felt more like a social media influencer. That class did force me to finish my portfolio website, so it wasn't all bad. Their Discord is actively shouting out jobs. I ended up taking a few more months after class to wrap my head around React and get better at JavaScript by building projects and doing CodeWars. Over a year after starting, I'm now studying Front End Dev questions I pulled from GreatFrontEnd and dabbling with LeetCode, which has been incredibly frustrating. At best, I've probably got another six months of practice and projects before I'd be hireable, but realistically, I'm thinking I've got another year. I'm an artist, so this stuff comes slowly to me. Since you're already doing analytics, I'm guessing it will be faster for you.If you do the BootCamp, my advice is to do personal projects with people in your cohort. That was probably the MOST beneficial part of the BootCamp. Looking at my group's code and trying to make everything work together really forced me to understand it and broke me out of tutorial hell.Another tip I'd give is to grab a BootCamp class off of Udemy when it's discounted and work your way through it to see how you do. Just make sure you're doing your own personal project after every tutorial project.Hope this is helpful. Good luck!",

Use a nice IDE (IntelliJ) that makes it easy to refactor and move things around when you realize you don’t like how you organized it (I have been doing this the past few days).As for when to break up functions: as much as you can. Some early advice I got from an AWS engineer was: “if you want something to scale and be maintainable, it has to be made of small pieces.”Good codebases grow. Good codebases eventually become mazes. As a programmer, I try to imagine another programmer (likely myself later on) landing at this function as if being dropped in a maze: how long will it take them to understand where they are.I can’t really give them a good, complete map. But I can try my best to make it so that at each intersection (at each function), it is obvious which way to go. I can make it so that they do not need to spend time looking around, exploring, reasoning, guessing, and backtracking. A good function is understandable immediately, either:- accomplishing something simple in relatively few lines of code- or listing a series of other functions (each doing a simple thing in relatively few lines of code) like a recipe in relatively few lines of code.There are no points for being clever or obscuring what your code is doing. Boring, obvious code is good code.There are certainly times where it makes sense/is easier to just have a big long method.But I have found no predictor for how many bugs a function will produce more accurate than its length.

        "body": "What helped me (and what I teach) is realizing that architecture emerges from concrete problems, not from rules you invent upfront.Tiny example. Start with two static pages. It works, but you notice duplication (HTML boilerplate). So you refactor and extract a shared layout. Now you accidentally have two kinds of files:* files that should be publicly served (pages)* files that are internal building blocks (layout)That alone justifies a first structure: public/ // endpoints src/ // internal codeYou didn’t \"design an architecture\". You just answered a real question: \"this file should not be publicly accessible\"From there, the same thing keeps happening:* group by technical role: MVC-style architectures* group by feature/resource: modular architecturesHexagonal, clean architecture, MVC, etc. are not things you start with. They’re names we gave later to patterns that emerge when you keep asking:* Who is allowed to call this?* What changes together?* What should not depend on what?If you end up with a 500-line file, that’s not failure: it’s usually the signal that the next split is becoming visible somehow.",

If you're building a calendar or scheduling app where the primary goal of the app was to schedule things, then rolling your own might be worth it to deliver an amazing experience and have full control over it. If it's just one tiny feature, it probably makes more sense to use a good existing library.Second, what are the costs of using an external component? Let's say I need a matrix multiply function. Adding a dependency on a huge linear algebra package like BLAS or numpy might increase the size of the build, add a new license to check, and just overall add a lot of complexity to the project. If the only thing I need it for is to multiply some small matrices and performance doesn't matter, I might implement it myself and use another library to verify that my implementation is correct.Last, is this something that needs to change/update frequently or is it stable? If it's parsing a data file that's internal to my project and not user-generated, then that code might not ever need to change. Writing some custom code to parse it might be fine because it's not likely to break. On the other hand if it's parsing user-generated PDFs, a third-party library probably keeps getting new bug fixes and improvements over time, so it's probably way better to use a library.",

But we also had a ton of niche cases and requirements. Sometimes management wanted a summary of the table, and it may need to sum, average, or count the number of times a certain value (or range) appeared in a column.Some cells also needed to provide a link, multiple links, or color-code text in some way. Some cells needed to reformat data in a certain way - for example, if we got a timestamp, did we need to show just the date, just the time, seconds since time, etc. One manager always wanted us to separate date and time as two separate columns for Excel reasons. Oh, yeah, and it needed to have a one-click download CSV export of the data in-browser (so, it couldn't re-send the data to the server to generate a file).Wrote one, it worked great, used it for about 8+ years and it got copied to several of our different systems. Eventually one of the juniors asked why we were using my library, and not some npm library he found that did \"the same thing but better\". My answer, after looking at the library, was that I wrote mine 4 or so years before the npm library was created according to its github history. It also didn't support all of the features, or at least not in some of the specific use cases we had. So it *wasn't* something that existed when I needed it, and it also still didn't technically do everything we needed it to do.Similarly, I'll also \"engineer\" extremely simple things from scratch if I feel like it would take me longer to find a library to do the thing than it would to write. This case was we had a dashboard for a monitoring tool that just needed to show groups of \"top 10s\", so 10 rows, each containing a bar, another bar (with a definable color) inside of it with width based on a percentage, and a text value (that could also be a link). Easy enough: div wrapping a div and p or a, a dozen lines of CSS, and a function to manage it, took 5 minutes to write, 100% localized code I don't have to rely on a library for.",

Not from the comfort of your room, but in the office while you work for example. You won't pull headphones to watch any videos there. For now it looks like cs50 or a Udemy course would be a better fit for you. But in the end it doesn't matter much. After the tutorials is where the hard part begins and there are no videos there.

Their main YT channel also has several long video tutorials and crash-courses to my knowledge.There is also lots of videos all over YouTube about most programming topics / concepts, computer science, as well as specific tutorials on projects.Second, unfortunately, reading is just a part of programming as I am sure you're aware. You're going to have to read requirements of projects and their documentation, as well as write it. You're going to have to read code and genuinely try to understand it, both the functions and the larger whole. You're going to have to read documentation of the programming languages, tools, and APIs you're using.I'm not saying that to shame you, God knows, I barely read books. But reading is very much a part of programming, from the learning to the actual process of doing.Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp are both what I have experience with. They're both solid platforms, and I'd probably complete FCC first, and then circle back to Odin Project and see about the gaps and more advanced knowledge it covers. One of the big advantages is that it is fairly unguided and gives you a set of objectives to complete. This forces you to think about what you're doing, how and why, as well as forcing you to acquire knowledge and documentation just like you would on any real project.At that point, I'd probably just try making projects. Maybe dabble in a game engine like Godot because of its lightweight nature, GDScript which is very easy to read and write, and ability to do web exports for Itch.IO. Hell you can even use it to make applications / tools, not games, but I digress.I'm just not sure what to suggest that can fulfill that video requirement, besides trying a hybrid approach. Try to at least read the highlights and general idea of a topic, and then look for some videos about it, maybe practical examples. Don't force yourself to deathmarch paragraph after paragraph, but I don't know if you can truly avoid reading either.I'm sure others know more, I mostly learned by messing around modding games, reading books, nibbling on these tutorial sites and such. Best of luck.",

Can you center it on the screen? Can you make it responsive? Can you add a display area? Can you add buttons? Don't even worry about making them do anything.Can you enable a button? Can you make it output to the console? What about to the display area of your HTML? Just keep going. One small improvement at a time. It's not just a way to build projects, it is the \\*only\\* way to build projects.If you want to get really organized, create a Trell account and a Kanban board to keep track of all your features. Your features will naturally grow as you gain experience, but always keep them tight and focused. One thing at a time. Good luck to you.",

Those “amount” of repetitions will really hone your craft in the long run. Keep building your portfolio. That is your green card. It will speak for you, especially if you wanted to go serious on things and wanted to explore how to render service for people.Actually, thats one way as well on how you can further build your skills.

For full stack I tried Django, Flask, and .NET Core before eventually getting into NextJS and now I exclusively use React/Express or Next with a Headless CMS depending on what I'm working on. I've also used React for my jobs over the last couple years, which was always my goal and why I eventually moved away from Vue. I also still have some interest in .NET Core since I see it pop up on job requirements a bit, but I am currently focused on mastering React and other aspects of building applications before I try to pick up another framework.",

C will take longer to create a useful non-trivial software. After you are comfortable with Python you can learn C to learn the details of memory management and compilers.

It will just provide a bit of reference for why things in Python are how they are and what is being abstracted away for programmer ergonomics.If somebody is only going to learn one language of these three then I would recommend learning Python as a beginner, again unless there's a specific goal in mind.Aside from pure interest in programming in general, I would learn C++ for specific goals, like interest in an industry where C++ dominates. I don't personally recommend C++ to beginners who have no specific goals in mind.All of that said, I don't think it matters THAT much which language a person starts with.

        "body": "You have to understand some programming history to understand why C and C++ exist.Lets roll back the clock to 1990 or so. Personal computers are just starting to become practical. For $3000 in todays money you can get a home desktop computer about as powerful as a super Nintendo is (286 or 386 PC running windows 3.1) At the time this is considered cutting edge, way faster than those atari and apple 2 computers people are using before. You can get real work done with these!Your options for programming languages really boil down to something like assembler, BASIC, or C / C++. Lets compare each.\\- Anyone programming in 1980 to 1990 or so to do real work was likely using assembler. This is as close as you can get to actual processor instructions. Read value from memory address one into register 1, read value into memory address 2, compare the values with binary math, if they are equal then JMP to subroutine that outputs string from memory address 3, etc. This is literal processor instructions - it doesn't get any more raw and fast than that.\\- You could learn BASIC, but BASIC is an interpreted language. Rather than the code being compiled into processor instructions BASIC is a program itself that reads the program you are running and figures out what it should be doing in real time. This makes it about 10 times slower. But good god, is it easier to write a program in BASIC than Assembler - you can just define an array, you can just write a function, you can just define subroutines that take actual arguments - its so much more clean. If you can write your program in BASIC it will be much easier to maintain and simpler to comprehend - but its going to run soooo much slower. In a world where making a FPS like wolfenstein 3D work stretches the limit of what is possible on the hardware, a 10x speed loss is just too much when your program relies on speed.\\- Then comes C and C++. The idea behind these languages is that you can write your code kind of like interpreted languages instead of assembler - defining functions, data structures, complicated mathematical algorithms - but instead of the computer interpreting the program in real time, it can convert it all to bytecode - basically the same thing as assembler - and run it almost as fast as an assembler program as a result. C/C++ is written like a processor actually acts. But as nice as this is, there are still significant shortcomings. Dynamic memory allocation which is something that just happens like magic in an interpreted language, is not automatic in C++ - stuff like creating an array, creating a variable length string, or defining a variable, or converting one variable type to another - this is not actually provided in C, you have to manage it on your own. Which you most defiantly can - and doing so is easier than doing so in assembler. So now you have all the advantages of assembler and the complexity is significantly reduced.But its not 1990 anymore, its 35 years later. Computers are hundreds if not thousands of times faster, have multiple cores, usually have 32,000 MB of RAM instead of like, 4 MB, etc. There is enough extra speed in a computer that you don't really need that extreme optimization anymore. And the way computers operate with all this extra resources have also changed - with multi core systems you can have some of the cores or the GPU handling the graphics pipeline in your program, which is like 95% of the processing time - and this is all handled outside of the program you are actually writing.There are also many, many more languages that more elegantly handle the problem of ease of development balanced against speed. Most modern languages, like javascript or python, act like interpreted languages in that they are flexible and just run, but under the hood they still compile to bytecode for speed - the performance loss of using them vs C++ is not as much as it used to be. Modern Javascript in particular is \\*\\*king FAST, thanks to google throwing millions and millions of dollars into optimizing chrome. The way the async cycle in javascript works is far more flexible than what C/C++ offers, and in general all the features in C/C++ are now available in newer languages, and usually they do it better.Finally, you should consider that your programs don't need the extra speed and complexity that comes with C++ because all the heavy lifting in your program will not actually be done by the program you are writing. The graphics are done by the GPU. If you want a video or mp3 encoder or something, you bring in someone else's tool into your program as a library (probably written in C++) and invoke it and get the results. Programming in 2025 is more about gluing premade tools together and orchestrating them, and your code is the orchestration layer. It is much more beneficial for this layer to be simpler and easier to comprehend and manage and leaving the dirty details to other tools. You will always be on hardware that is hundreds of times faster than you need for this purpose.",

I've heard good things about WGU.The main thing I'd be cautious about is stopping work for 6 months. That's not nearly enough time to be job-ready, and quitting work will just put immense pressure on you, which is the opposite of what you want.Learning a completely new skill takes time. Trying to rush it and squeeze more learning into less time rarely works in practice. You need time to rest and get comfortable with new ideas.I think cutting back on hours or finding work that's less stressful, but that keeps you employed, would be ideal.Take courses, learn to code, but most importantly build stuff. Make real, useful stuff and launch it - that's the best way to prove you're job-ready.

        "body": "You have a very similar situation to mine. But I'm years ahead of you. I have b-degree in business administration, never worked in related role. 2 years ago I was 27, applied for a second university, 2 years course which teaches programming (qualification at the end). I already had bachelors degree, I didn't need 2nd one. Before the school I learned some coding already, so the course wasn't that hard and I had a bit of experience already. I only had experience with frontend, today I can build full-stack applications. (junior lvl) I got scholarship for being the best in class so that helped financially.2 years later. I'm still looking for job since June. Yes, I'm a bit picky of which role I want. I don't want to work as administrator in a bank and answer old grandmas calls. I want to do something programming related cause I know I have a knowledge and experience more than some juniors today. And I will be hard working and learn as fast as I can. But I had mby like 4 interviews in 6 months for the roles that I was not really happy about so let that sink in.What I think: Bootcamps in todays job market sucks. 5 years ago they were worth it, cause you could learn fundamentals in 4-5 months and company was happy to hire you and they would teach you on the job without any experience or knowledge. Because to be real, nobody can learn advanced things in 6 months. You will only learn some simple things. You won't learn to build advanced full stack applications with best practices and high security. And today company expects you to know all of that, which takes 8 hours a day for 5+ years of doing real job.I will be completely honest. If you are not a genius (so that goverment can hire you) or you don't have a relative or a very good friend who can hire you. You won't get a job. There are already 1k devs with so much more experience, knowledge and skills applying for the same role you want. AI doesn't help ether, seniors can do 3 jobs now, generate things fast, they wont need juniors to fix buttons for them anymore. (You already know it, based on your generated post) While there are more developers than jobs available it will stay like this and I think it will only be worse. My hope is that AI will become so expensive without improving that it will be more rentable to hire juniors instead. Or companies realize that they need juniors to learn and become seniors one day.",

        "body": "The core idea of OOP is to associate data with behaviour. E.g. instead of having a `sort()` function that sorts a list of data based on an algorithm, your data has it's own `sort()` method, so it kind of sorts itself instead of getting sorted.On first glance this sounds very powerful, because a list of strings may be sorted differently than a list of numbers or a list of pointers. What OOP allows you is to have a list of any type, just call `.sort()` on it and the correct sorting method will be used automagically.This idea was then further applied to other things like a Date. Instead of using a library of functions and a collection of structs that the functions work on, you now get an object and have all functions directly associated with that object, so instead of writing `dateutils.to_string(date: Date, ...)` you now have `Date.to_string(...)`. In the early days of OOP this was used for code reuse through inheritance. Inheritance just means, that you define a new class and tell the computer that this class should have all the features of that parent class plus the new stuff you define and except the stuff you redefine in the new class.However, it turned out that Inheritance doesn't work well for code reuse, so nobody sane recommends it any more for that. It also turned out that it's more common to have different behaviour than different kind of data, so people started using \"Composition\" instead. Composition just means that your objects has other objects that are used to perform different kind of behaviour. For Example, you may have a class `Animal` and the animal is supposed to have different behaviour like walk, run, speak, eat. Instead of using Inheritance to create new subclasses of `Animal` and implement different behaviour, you define small interfaces `IRunner`, `IWalker`, `ISpeaker`, `IEater` (or similar) and write small classes for each interface. There might be a `Bark` and a `Meow` class implementing \"ISpeaker` and there may be \"BipedRunner\" and \"QuadrupedRunner\" implementing \"IRunner\" and so on. You then create different animals using the Animal-Constructor:```pycat = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Meow(), CarnivoreEater())dog = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Bark(), CarnivoreEater())horse = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Whinny(), HerbivoreEater())cat.speak() # \"meow!\"dog.speak() # \"wruff!\"horse.speak() # \"neigh!\"```This is what \"Composition over Inheritance\" refers to. So we're almost back to having functions applied to data, but instead we call a method of an object that then looks up another object and calls one of that object's methods (for each individual method call).A big downside of OOP is that contrary to its promise it makes code harder to maintain, because you create a compile time hierarchy that matches your domain model and with that you create boundaries around things (objects) instead of creating boundaries around properties (e.g. positions, prices, ... ). Maybe that helps a bit.",

I am a music producer that posts my type beats on YouTube and Beatstars (beat selling website), and I found that uploading things is starting to become increasingly annoying as I need to click through a ton of menus and upload files and such, so I wanted to streamline that. The idea is a desktop GUI app that uses web automation to upload to Beatstars, and then Google's API for uploading to Youtube.>What I've done so far is defined Pydantic types (I'm using Python) and started work on a setup wizard screen, but I feel like feature creep is really hitting hard so I wanted to step back and plan more. Any tips?Sure, start with the most essential functionality and build outward. That would be uploading your data to one service or the other. I guess Google's API is probably better supported if not simpler, so you might wish to start by automating YouTube uploads. Then, support uploads to the other one.Do types + a setup wizard, if necessary, once you know enough about your program to know where typing will help you and what sort of setup is necessary.",

The fact that you are stuck shows that you haven't hit that point where you are not learning anything any more. Now, I have no experience with Beatstars so I do not know but does it have an API? Perhaps you can skip all kind of menu automation and send direct POST or PUT requests to its API, instead. Sure, menu automation and such has its place, in frontend testing and such, but first try to get it done by using the API endpoints of Beatstars. Because any and all menu clicks and dropdown selections in the end send some HTTP request to Beatstars server. Or SOAP requests or websockets or something. Open the developer tools of your browser and see which requests with which information are being sent to the server. And then reverse engineer it from there. Unless Beatstars has an actual API documentation. Then you do not have to re-invent a wheel.",

My best learning experiences where when the lectures had streamlined content where all course assignments and exams were heavily or even completey based on those lectures. I always felt like I came away with something positive and felt a lot more skilled. Also, it depends on the professor but some will outright disregard any questions. And when so much rides on the assignments and with so little support and resources, you tend to focus on the lectures less and are scrambling for the assignments to the point where there's hardly any retention of what you were supposed to learn in the first place.

But academics depend on existing curricula because it is very hard to develop new lessons and lab projects, so MIPS examples will continue for many years to come.ARM is quite popular with processors available from many different vendors. Upcoming is RISC-V and 64bit ARM (also available from Microchip). Old 8bit standbys are PIC and AtmelAVR that can be important depending on your notion of \"embedded\" (not every toaster and microwave is running Linux-ARMs yet),. There are also 16bit processors that are optimized for motor controllers if you are into that sort of thing.Once you get the hang of any one of those then the others follow pretty easily so look at the market you hope to enter. Anything with wifi or ethernet will probably want ARM or newer. Motors will be the 16bit DSP engines or specialized ARM devices (often slightly more than the typical assembly instruction set). Light bulbs and toasters and hand-held appliances will probably continue with 8bit which is easily mastered.The important point is having something to practice on until you are comfortable with how it works. There are a number of [Curiosity Nano boards from Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/evaluation-boards/curiosity-nano) that can give a flavor of most of these for not a lot of $$ so its reasonable to have different versions.",

        "body": "“Assembly language” isn’t a generic thing. It’s a way to write machine code with mnemonics rather than just heaps of hex or octal numbers. The mnemonics and their meanings are entirely dependent on the machine instruction sets of the target processor. So, if you know PDP-11 assembler language, you don’t really know ARM-64 or x86 or MIPS or whatever. If you find an embedded job, you’ll be using the processor your employer chose. If you start a company to make an embedded project, you’ll choose the processor. So your core skill will be getting your coding process up and running quickly on whatever instruction set.If your time is worth anything, you’ll hammer out most of the embedded code in C. Both GCC and LLVM have really good facilities for turning C code into astonishingly well optimized machine code for your processor of choice. It can prolly generate smaller and faster code than 99.9% of programmers ever will be able to. I’ve worked with a couple of the 0.1%, those folks are amazing. But they still use a lot of C.Assembly comes into its own for small chunks of an application that are time- or power- critical. And often the assembly code is embedded in some sort of pragma directive inside .c source code files.There’s still a lot to learn by programming machine instructions directly. Learning how registers, stack pointers, program counters, and other machine concepts work is helpful. You may as well do it for whatever machine you have readily at hand. C compilers generally have options that make them generate “listings” with the generated machine instructions displayed. That, combined with the instruction architecture document for your processor, will teach you a lot. Especially, compare the generated code with optimization turned off (-g) and on (-O).",

Work on hobby projects. Because by the time you graduate you'll have to compete with everybody else. And then you have to stand out somehow, to be hired.And, do not rely on an AI. Can happen that your client prohibits any and all AI usage where the data goes through third party cloud services. What will you do then? Oh, and do not try to hack your university's/college's systems. Some of my course mates got into problems when trying out stuff.In terms of tech stacks then learn these things that are actually in demand in your area. Sure, the curriculum should already support that but if it does not do that then it is up to you to check different job offers and see what is required from developers, there. And that applies to any path you are picking. May it be an AI, a mobile app development, an IoT development, a web application development, a data science, or something else.",

        "body": "Funny story I actually just answered a very similar question is the cs majors sub lol I will paste my answer here:First, if you want to study cs get a cs degree and then specialize after. From my experience and talking to professionals degrees like cybersecurity, information systems, and data science (do a stats major instead) are not as good.As for knowing what you want to specialize in I don't think there are any shortcuts besides trying stuff and seeing if you like it. Either take a class or build a project and see if it's cool. You can also research online about the different cs disciplines. If you decide on embedded systems I think computer or elctrical engineering is a better major, but it prob depends on the school.Regarding how economically cooked the different cs subdisciplines are, they honestly aren't that cooked. What's (or rather who) is cooked is the person who graduates, has no extracurricular experience, and is only interested in the doing bare minimum to get money.The truth is that cs isn't an easy path to 6 figures. You either need to genuinely like it or be very disciplined because the degree is only like 30-40% of the puzzle. Join tech clubs, do competitive programming/leetcode, build stuff, and give it your all! It's such a cool subject that touches all the sciences, math, and unifies it under this neat idea of very clearly describing a process.PS: Maybe it's just personal bias but it seems that web dev is the most vulnerable to AI. There's hella ai tools like replit and loveable that can already handle most basic-intermediate apps. Also if you want to be immune to ai get a job writing like cobol for a bank or visual basic for some unc company.Now specifically regarding some stuff you asked: You should stay general until you know what you like, at least until like you finish your first year or two of uni. You'll have enough time to skill up specifically for your interest. Focus on fundamentals and you'll be flexible enough to pivot. Also, even if you end up going into like embedded, building a website will still make you a better and more well rounded programmer.",

AI is the latest hot thing today, but who knows what will be the next thing a year or two from now? Maybe the AI bubble will have already popped by then, and if you specialize in AI early on, based on current trends, you'll be left on ice.So be a generalist in your studies and only specialize once you enter the workforce. That way you will have the skills to quickly and efficiently learn any niche you want, and have the knowledge of which niche is in demand at the time you'll be looking for work.",

They necessarily are incomplete and approximate. They offer oversimplified explanations and tempt us to the [\"availability heuristic\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic).* We can become fascinated by models. Sometimes models turn out to be wrong and need to be abandoned and replaced with something better. But the [\"sunk cost fallacy\"](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy) can make it hard for us to abandon a bad model.We use models all the time. They are incomplete all the time and wrong some of the time. The challenge is to make them useful even when incomplete.",

You can learn programming with any language, no matter how outdated or obscure that language may be. Their role is to provide broad enough knowledge so that you can then specify in any branch of CS that you prefer. And teach you the key concept of programming that applies to any language.As you said, it's a begginers class to programming. What you are learning is programming itself not a specific language.

But it's one-way. You can't change in the same way a float* into a float[5].We have these relationships:- operator & used on a float gives us a float*- operator * used on a float* gives us a float- operator * used on a float[5] gives us a float too.- operator[] used on a float* gives us a float- operator[] used on a float[5] gives us a float too.- float[5] decays to float*So when you do &somePtr[0], the [0] happens first, and gets you from pointer to float, and then & happens and \"reverts\" from float to pointer.Does that make sense?",

Thus, the code that calls the function with the pointer is also responsible for telling us how big it is. Note, size of socres in the function is the size of the pointer value, 64 bits or 8 bytes in this case. The int here is only 32 bits or 4 bytes.> So both *scores and &testScores[0] are float* numbers? Well... your pointer is always just a memory location. It's how you talk about it that makes it float. So here `scores` is a pointer when it gets to the function. We've told our program the type referenced by that pointer is float. To be clear, it could be a single float at the memory location or thousands. Once you pass that pointer, the actual size gets lost. As, hopefully, seen in that trace above.",

Key terms in bold. float arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};The **name/symbol** `arr` **aliases** the **address** (assigned by the compiler) of some **storage** (allocated somewhere at compilation time or runtime) that has a specified **value** (or values in the case of arrays) of a certain **type**. A **pointer** type is a type that stores addresses as values (pedants: yes, I've read the standard and this is good enough here). Example with address annotations in parens: float a(0x01) = 0.1f; // addr 0x01 (alias a) contains value 0.1f. float *b(0x05) = &a = 0x01; // addr 0x05 (alias b) contains value 0x01 (a's addr).Name/symbol, address, storage, type, and value, are distinct things. Names mean we don't have to write addresses (though you can, and do in embedded). Storage for a single object (not in the OOP sense, object = datum here) can of course be larger than a single address. Value is what is in that region of memory when read at a given time. Books can be written here (E.g. *Modern C*, Gustedt), this isn't supposed to be exhaustive.Answers:1. It's the address of the first byte of the first element in the array.2. Those are expressions that yield results of pointer type. Dereference and addressof operators can be thought of as inverses, yes. The reason you can write a function that takes a pointer and then pass an array is because of the language semantics, no doubt influenced by what is happening on the hardware. When passing by value in C++, the values of the arguments are copied into the target function's stack frame (usually, compilers are clever and will elide things). How do we efficiently copy an array here? We don't. We say that arrays \"decay\" to pointers in this scenario, and we copy a smaller fixed-size pointer value instead (fits in a register, nice!). Referencing the above, we've copied the (base) address of the storage of the array into the storage for the function parameter. We have a pointer value that we can dereference and/or do pointer arithmetic on. **Whereas the original name/symbol (arr) aliased the address of the first element directly, the parameter stores that same address as a value. In this situation, the language doesn't force us to explicitly take the address using an expression and then pass it, it effectively does it for us.**Hopefully that makes sense. I do recommend both K&R C and Modern C if you want to go beyond this summary. I simplified and left things out.",

I've been trying to study the patterns like sliding window and two pointer and can usually identify when to use them.For this kind of stuff, then for me it's essential to have a well-illustrated example, in order to really understand. For example, you used the term \"sliding window\", which gave my brain a vague inkling of what you're talking about, but not yet enough to have a \"picture\" in my mind of what you're really trying to solve.Then I used Google and found this Answer which is illustrated beautifully: [What is Sliding Window Algorithm? Examples? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8269916/what-is-sliding-window-algorithm-examples)Anyway, as the Answerer points out, calling it a \"sliding window algorithm\" is really a misnomer; it is a useful technique, though.So, how does one get better at using this technique? Well, you've got to practice it, of course. The example shown in that Q&A is a pretty good starter problem (find the maximum sum of n consecutive numbers); you can adapt that to almost anything (e.g. find the lowest average of n consecutive numbers, find a particular small sequence within a large stream of numbers, etc.).For this example, I'd see the \"sliding window\" approach as an optimization of the brute force approach. That is, solve it first with the \"brute force\" approach (which will still be 'efficient' in computational terms, but will be a factor of n slower than necessary), and then solve it again with a sliding window approach.Solving a problem twice may sound lame or may sound like unneeded extra work, but in a situation like this will be satisfying because first, you'll be able to measure exactly how much faster the better approach is, and second, you'll have a \"testing client\" against which you can test your 'better' approach. For something like this, it's usually easier to make a mistake in the implementation of the more clever approach, so a handy testing method is to make a testing driver that solves your problems using both approaches.(I.e. the test driver tests some sample testing inputs against the 'dumb' solution way, as well as against the 'clever' solution way) and then stops if two clients give different results (which indicates that ONE of the approaches must be wrong for that particular input). Usually you'll end up with a bug or two in the 'clever' way, but by systematically comparing with the 'dumb' way, you can normally lay such bugs to rest in a fairly straightforward way (debugging will still be work to do it, of course, but it will never feel like you're totally stuck, because you'll have the alternate version to compare against).>I've seen many people say they took courses or they learned it in college, but I just cannot afford an expensive course let alone going to college. Does anyone have some advice?Robert Sedgewick et al's course on Algorithms is available free of charge on Coursera, the last time I checked (for auditing it); it's a pretty good course. You'll need the textbook to do the course properly, but I suppose you can find a low-cost edition, use a library, etc. if you cannot afford to buy that book.",

The Linux kernel is the thing that links Linux operating systems.

Each distribution can feel different so it's worth experimenting a bit to find what you like. If you're trying to think what to use before you start to learn programming, it's not worth thinking about. Whatever's on your computer now is good enough. You'll learn more about operating systems when you need to.",

        "body": "Other people have explained the difference between an operating system and a distribution pretty well (and the distinction typically only applies to Linux - with MacOS and Windows, there is really no distinction between the concept of the operating system and the distribution).If you really want to learn about what operating systems do and how operating systems work, there is really no better way than to use Linux: with Linux, it's much easier to have access to the way that the operating system actually works and how the pieces come together, and the code of the Linux kernel is open source, so you can actually look at it if you want to. I would recommend making a USB drive with a Linux installation you can boot to if you don't already have Linux installed (Puppy Linux, MX Linux, and Slax are all good choices for this - a Linux distribution you can use from a keydrive and save your changes and files), or have a virtual system with Linux installed on it, or if you're really determined, install Linux on a partition, which can be a bit difficult to do. Another option could be to buy a Raspberry Pi, which is Linux-based, and play with that for many of your tasks.You can get books on Linux that will teach you plenty about how the operating system functions:\"The Linux Programming Interface\" by Kichael Kerrisk is viewed by many as a definitive encyclopedia for understanding how Linux works. You'll learn about making system calls, OS library functions, and the relationship between applications and the kernel in detail. You'll come away from that book with a whole new appreciation as to how OSes work.\"How Linux Works\" by Brian Ward. It really covers the glue that holds the OS together, covering the boot process, how the kernel manages hardware, and how networking and devices actually function under the hood.\"Modern Operating Systems\" by Andrew Tanenbaum is also a great book. It's not exclusively about Linux, but it will teach you the fundamental theory of OSes, such as process management, memory, and file systems that Linux is built on.Keep in mind that you don't **need** to really understand your operating system before you can start learning a programming language. Most programming languages these days run on all operating systems (with a few exceptions). Pick the language you want to learn, and there's a very good chance it will run on whatever operating system you already have installed on your computer, and will abstract away the differences between operating systems, which is one of the main functions of a programming language: that way, programs are portable, and can be run on any operating system.",

But other than that, the thing is stable and \"it just works\". Whereas the newest thing can have multiple open issues.Is the newest thing actually maintained? Recently I had to make a technical analysis for a new microservice and had to come up with an architecture proposal for it. I considered different alternatives. There was a library A and a library B. Library A had been around for many years. Sure, it had a lot of bloat and stuff, but it worked. Library B also seemed to work. Less bloat. Promising. BUT the maintainer/developer/owner of that library had abandoned that project. For 2 years there had been no commits. Github issues were abandoned. Yes, that B was newer than A but it was abandoned. Whereas A was older, did have more bloat, but was in active maintenance. Recent commits to update versions. Recent commits to fix vulnerabilities. etc.Is the newest thing that you should consider in the current geopolitical world? Let's say you are a developer in the US. Will you use a library made in China, in Russia, or in Iran? By itself the library can be newer and perhaps also better. BUT the decision makers can start making decisions where they tell the developers to make the library close sourced and you won't have any overview of the changes. Decision makers can introduce kill switches or backdoors. Or, the developers will collect data and send it to their data brokers. And then that data will be used in a competitive manner. One of the many reasons why one should think twice if he should use Deepseek AI, for example. Technically very promising LLM model. Also, it introduced many changes to other LLMs in the world. But, it follows the political agenda of China. It is not neutral.Does the newest thing have enough documentation? Older stuff can have massive documentation compiled by many developers over years. A new thing can have close to no documentation and you have to be one of the pioneers creating that documentation on the go.How is the new thing fitting in the existing infrastructure? Perhaps it does not even work? Yes, stuff often is meant to be backwards compatible, but not always it is the case. For example Spring Boot 2.x vs Spring Boot 3.x and different libraries. Some newer libraries expect you to use also newer Spring Boot version. Also newer Java version. You can't just throw the newest library in the code and hope that stuff works.Do you have resources (time, budget) to make upgrades to support the newest tools and the newest versions?How will you balance constant upgrades with adding new functionality and maintaining the project as a whole? A new library version can come out every month, for example. Will you concentrate on version upgrades over working what the client actually cares about? It is difficult to \"sell\" version upgrades to a client. You have to prove that it is needed. Yes, Dependabot is a thing but some time will still go into reviewing its MRs and doing smoke testing to ensure that untestable stuff (for whichever reason) works.With you updating stuff, will you break something that external service providers are using? You can't expect them to update their stuff because you are doing constant upgrades.",

You'll run into tough problems that you want to solve in any way possible, and then look at frameworks or libraries to see how other people did it afterward, then build it again. The best thing to do is figure out very focused projects where there's one primary problem you're trying to solve. That way you aren't trying to do too much at once.",

It's not like a full scale backend infrastructure, but for smaller web apps this is often enough, because most times all they need is a way to hide some stuff, like API keys, from the client, make a hand full of database queries and calculate a few things here and there. It's called a 'Backend for Frontend', because all it does is usually all you need as a Frontend Dev. If you plan to only learn Javascript as a proper programming language, Node.js is a popular choice for backend development, if it gets more complicated than that. That's totally doable. For many things, expecially small to medium scale solo dev projects, you can totally get away with just JS, yes.At some point this no longer scales very well, but you can always cross that bridge when you get there and notice JS is limiting you. You can't build a 'Facebook' scale Project on just JS.. But Facebook started with just PHP, because that's what they knew how to write.Bottom line is - yes you can build useful stuff with just JS. Sure.VSCode the IDE you are statistically likely using - is entirely written in JS.",

For example, you should have progressively more complicated \"guided\" exercises (from simple to complicated, worked out step by step with solutions), and then you should have a series of \"solve it yourself\" exercises with no solutions provided, for which you must solve yourself.The above organization is how most textbooks are organized. Unfortunately, I've seen diminishingly few video lecture series that are organized in this way (i.e. none). Sometimes, video lectures on platforms like Coursera have a limited amount of this kind of organization, e.g. \"pause the video and try to work out the solution\" type of stuff, but usually the problems presented in that kind of video situation are very simple \"fill in the blank\" or \"answer a conceptual question\" variety.TLDR: Get a textbook.",

Through problem decomposition a large problem is broken down into multiple smaller problems: the more you practice problem decomposition the more you can intuitively tell where the sub-problems start and end.Breaking a problem down can become so intuitive that it just happens naturally while you read the exercise, like you read a sentence or paragraph and without any thought to the massive big problem that lays ahead of you, you're like \"yeah, I'm looking forward to solving this specific smaller part\".When implementing a specific smaller part becomes easier than looking up a YouTube guide you'll basically be where you want to be: chain the smaller parts together and you get a full solution.Beyond DSA exercises, problem decomposition is probably the most important skill a programmer needs in general. You can't tackle any larger project, can't work together with others, etc. without understanding how a small part of a problem solved with code contributes towards solving a larger problem.In practical terms when you get a DSA exercises if I were you I'd just invest a little more time into planning, before doing the actual coding.- If it's more of a linear problem (you can tell if the problem reads like a sequential recipe) you can add markers or paragraph breaks where you think sub-problems start and end- if the problem description is more \"wild\" and all over the place instead of just trying to pull the problem apart through line breaks it's probably better if you create a list which on level 1 contains milestones and on level 2 contains the actual sub-tasks. Your coding will always be a linear process, so you you have to re-shape the problem into something that respects program-internal dependencies and your project management style.",

During that time, I try everything - different approaches, simplifying the problem, drawing diagrams, sometimes even using pen and paper so the solution isn't an easy click for me. Even if I don't solve it, I write down my gaps/mistakes so I know what to improve on in terms of the problem-solving process.DSA exercises on LeetCode help, but I also found it effective to supplement my resources for more diversified learning. Look into textbooks, guides, and even entire platforms like Interview Query, as you get a breakdown of sample problems in a way that's applicable to interview settings - clear and concise.

Use proper variable names, var0 tells me nothing. Same with folder1. 2. Use less comments. 3. Split your code into functions, this together with proper variable names makes your code easier to understand and will lessen the need for commenting everything. Make sure to use the local keyword on variables to limit the the scope of your variables to that function. 4. Use \"#!/usr/bin/env bash\" instead of \"#! /bin/bash\" as this is considered best practice as it makes fewer assumptions about the underlying system. 5. I'd prefer you created the Bookmarked and Originals folder after the colour definition, but this is just my preference as I'd expect definitions to come before commands. 6. Implement error handling and have the script clean up after itself if something fails. 7. Avoid shadowing your variables by naming a variable the same in nested code, see file. 8. Less nesting, use function calls. And that's all I've time for.",

The test itself should be executable as a unit, independent of what other tests may have run before it, or be running in parallel with it.",

I'm glad my feedback could be useful.Hopefully you found this new code to be easier to read and to possibly extend in the future, at least from my perspective I would feel that way lol. If/Else statements are very powerful, but once you start chaining tons of them, it is always a good place to stop and ask if you can do it in a better way, whether that be with a match / switch case (some languages call them switch), or using a design pattern like a state machine.Good example of that would be a video game character with multiple states like crouching or jumping. Someone could string a dozen if/else statements, and check nested if/else statements inside those blocks... Or they could use a state machine.On that note, I hope this [website](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) all about design patterns can be of use to you.Happy I could help, all the best and happy holidays!",

Once you have your project set up, focus on displaying something - whether it's on a web page, or making a picture appear, or something move - whatever is the focus of your app.From there you can keep adding things gradually, testing to make sure all your previous stuff still works.

How do they find out more?I write this stuff down, super rough, for myself, as I dream up the project. I'm writing it as if the project is finished. Writing the sell sheet that way takes some imagination about the completed project. By the way, contracts for megabucks for software development look something like this sell sheet.

Developers in the west in general are obsessed with code quality to the point where it clashes with business outcomes. As long as the functionality works as expected and performance/stability is decent that’s all anyone on the business side of things and the customers care about. Code quality only matters to devs really. Let me reiterate functional testing is important to everyone, but code quality only matters to devs. A lot devs in India (and other off shore locations) aren’t paid enough to care about code quality but they do as a matter of pride care about the functional output being correct - the part their management and customers will see. Ironically this matches exactly with what the business and customers want. Why deal with a bunch of “overpaid” people complain about the need to refactor and take care of tech debt all the time perceived to be moving slowly and being difficult to manage when you can get others who will accept less pay and just do what you want them to do.",

Even if problems seem similar it may show up with a different constraint and you the solution you'd normally do for that problem might no longer be effective or even feasible. Basically you get an increased scope of knowledge on top of the hindsight of knowing what approaches works well in a situation of multiple approaches being \"correct\".In the example you gave the big thing is scope. You can design and architect a website or microservice but also remember generally thats an extremely small scope and more than likely is a solved problem. Like anyone could go on some system design prep site and know how to design and architect twitter or facebook or some trading site. Where the seniority in that comes in is knowing why you may want to take some approaches vs others based on needs because you've had prior experience making such calls. Often time what you think in your head or what works on paper doesn't play out the same in reality and there tends to be a lot of edge cases that are missed.What makes the big n experience so valuable is because you get exposed to a unique scale problem. Because they work around stuff so big they get to see the extreme edge cases a little more frequently even if theyll never directly work on it but just that visibility is so valuable especially to similar sized companies. But you can turn around and see big n employees might not do well at a smaller company because the breadth of tools they need to know how to use might be something they never even have had to touch or think about previously. Or that scale isnt the big issue and theres another type of problem that needs to be solved.Like if you can crank out a business/ecom site effectively without much help or guidance (this includes truly understanding the business reasons behind what your developing) you are probably a senior at a non tech non super huge scaled company. But you wont be a senior at a company where scale matters and vice versa.You could be a senior level expert at CUDA programming and then be junior at cloud stuff. Thats why again id put senority to yoe/overall exposer and it changes depending on the scope.",

Here it goes:I can offer my perspective as a junior. Got a job a year before graduation.TLDR: It’s still possible to make it, but you need a degree *with* internships. If you want to guarantee yourself a job, it’s going to be *hard* work, unless you’re a genius. I’m not a genius. Caveat that I’m Canadian, the market might be better or worse where you are.More details to give you an idea: I left my previous stem degree in 2022 when I realized that it wasn’t likely to yield a stable job. I started the CS degree in 2022. I’d programmed a bit before, always liked math and it seemed like a field with a bright future. I jumped in. Things turned sour for my cohort very quickly. By late 2022, many internships were rescinded, postings on universities’ coop programs dropped dramatically, the layoffs *started*. I was pretty dismayed by this to be honest, I’d left a degree that I loved in large part for improved job prospects and now there was a very real chance that it had been a poor decision. My family and I are really not rich (lower middle class at best) so I didn’t have much a choice, I wasn’t sure what else I could do either so I decided to work *hard*. I got perfect grades, I worked on eyebrow raising side projects, I TAed a math heavy class (thanks to my previous background in my other degree), I prepped for interviews. Got my first internship in my first year of the CS degree. Had to move to a different city temporarily for it. I didn’t quite like the particular field that it was in but it was really important for my CV, I finished it and got a good review. Didn’t want to stay in the city I moved to, so I decided to find another internship. Kept doing all of the above mentioned extracurriculars and still kept my grades very high. Meanwhile, things kept deteriorating for most of my cohort, the “best” students got internships, the majority did not. Keep in mind that I’m in coop so internships are *mandatory*.Prepped harder for interviews. Got a bigger company for the second one. If my first internship taught me anything it’s that if you want to be kept on after in this job market, you better be really good. I hit the ground running at this one, lost track of the hours I put into upskilling for it. I also took classes to not put off my graduation date. By the end of the 4 months, I was shipping year end deliverables. They were pretty happy and kept me on. Salary is about 80-90k TC. Quite good for a new grad in Canada. It’s been a huge relief and I’m immensely grateful for it.End all be all, success story in adverse job market conditions, but I want to be honest with you. I haven’t had a life for the past 2 and a half years or so. It’s literally all been school and working on side projects and interview prep and TAing. Now it’s working and still going to school. My relationship blew up and I haven’t been able to date because I just don’t have time, I don’t see my friends often. My own family that I live with doesn’t even talk to me often because I’m always in my room working one way or the other, they’re understanding and supportive though.I don’t want to complain at all because this is a thousand times preferable to being poor, but I want to highlight that this is what it takes to *guarantee* yourself a job now. You have to be the best of the best, whatever best means to the job market. Most of my cohort has not gotten internships and quite a few universities are working out deals with students: decreasing the number of internships, loosening the requirements of what classes to take when, actively involving themselves in our search. The situation has continued to devolve, at the entry level, things are not improving but actively getting worse.",

People legitimately laid off due to downsizing in a tougher economic period, though these usually are not looking for junior roles3. A very big number of people who were hired during/around the covid era, where tech hired literally anyone who had seen a computer, or maybe even a picture of a computer - are now unsurprisingly fired. These are the \"experienced\" people looking for junior roles you read about (when I say experienced this means 90% of them make websites with react)I know plenty of juniors getting a job, but most of them are *good*. Mid level I feel like is in a great spot as long as you aren't daydreaming about your salary - I know a lot of people saying they can't get mid level jobs requesting salaries that are simply unrealistic compared to the value they provide.Both mid and senior are heavily dependent on their stack and location for the initial interview - after which obviously you have to actually pass the technical *AND* not be completely socially inept.

Harden your alerts, metrics, and your tests and you will *reduce* the chances of an outage. In my experience I've categorized outages as unforced errors and just being unlucky.Was the system down because of an unforced error? Lead a technical review on it. Why did it get to that point? How? How can you prevent it from happening again and how can you apply this to OTHER cases in the future? Reduce unforced errors to 0.Unfortunately. there will be times that you will need to put out fires. That's part of the job. For example, [Log4Shell - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) was a week ruiner for many.

        "body": "First, this requires planning beforehand. It's no good if you're figuring out what the after-hours on-call process is while the roof is on fire. As a junior engineer, you can't decide this, but you can get the conversation going. \"Hey, what happens if...?\"Second, if there is no such procedure in place, then - all things being equal - I'm probably going to the concert. If it's one I could stand to miss, then maybe I'm making an offer: Cover the cost of my tickets plus something for the trouble. Something like that. But me helping you above and beyond the normal agreement is a favor, and sometimes I'm not in a position to grant you that favor. Boundaries are important.However, I'm also going to try to be accommodating within reason. In a situation like that, I'd offer to check in when I get back from the concert. If the issue's still ongoing, then perhaps some responsibility could be handed off to me so that others can get a break. This is probably really helpful as a junior, because while you might not be the best help for the initial incident, there can often be follow-up work that is less intensive. Like someone needs to run a database query every five minutes and make sure A stays less than B, until we can get the alert automation in place. And if I'm on the primary crew and I've been at it for six hours and a junior comes in at midnight and says, \"How can I help?\" you bet I'll hand that over and get some sleep.Finally, there's also the issue of Emergency Theatre. Do we really need all hands on deck? Or do we need the appearance that we're busting our butts to get it working again? There's not much you can do about this in the moment except recognize it and deal with it later. Figure out why this is the case. There's usually some failure in the management chain - some mid-level director with more power than sense, who has to be appeased. Or maybe a high-profile customer. Recognizing this and knowing it is very important as you navigate office politics in the future.",

So what I decided to do is turn that boring work into something exciting. Even if im not getting paid more for spending extra efforts on it, I felt pleasure in the work from praises by upper management. Just getting your name recognized at the top can be a motivational aspect that turns something boring into something exciting like: \"how can i surpass myself even more next time?\"For example, I worked a few years ago on a feature to create some key vault. So its a process feature, literally no programming, you could get it done in 1 hour by click click click > done. But I decided to present it on a review meeting and instead of the typical boring power point slides that engineers talk through to present their work, I decided to make it dramatic. Kinda like a thriller. I looked up articles on what happens if Secrets arent stored in a key vault. And I got a couple news articles about Uber for example or some other companies in which their credentials like API keys weren't securely stored and thus a breach happened. So basically I took these examples, added ominous bgm, and started narrating it like its a thriller movie lol. The meeting turned from boring to everyone quickly locked in. Their reactions were priceless. In the end i got all the engineers to store their credentials in the key vault. This is just one example of how you could turn something boring into something thrilling and exciting. Upper management started inviting other managers whenever they saw my name on the presenters list. They became like my fanbase \"I wonder what he has for us this time!\" Lol Personally that became my passion for a while! That has bolstered my mental outlook even if it wasnt a monetary incentive involved. Money isn't everything sometimes (in terms of satisfaction/happiness), and in a way, it actually unlocked a skill in me: story telling. Thats a skill of product managers, so it opens up more career options!",

You have more time to yourself to plan your next move, or take some time for self-care. So this would benefit you.Ideally you would have F-you money, so that you could take the mental/emotional route without the stress of wondering if you have enough to meet financial obligations. My personal opinion: if this job is really affecting your mental health to the point where you don't care about getting fired, then you should feel empowered to let it go.

It's a degrading idea to utilize technical workers as independent contractors, especially for SWE that are accustomed to being valued and in-demand as full-time workers.I don't think it's you aging out, it's more about the field itself abandoning you or at least devaluing you.

It produced a ton of products used in homes, and even had a massive research wing. Getting a job there was seen as being set for life. You had a job for life and a nice pension for retirement.In 1981 a new CEO came in. He cut any non profit part of the company. Every department was expect to fire the bottom 15%, no matter how they did compared to others. I think he removed the pensions, but not sure on this one. GE’s stock price soared.Jack Welsh’s tenure at GE was the catalyst that set corporations to become what they are today. Also a CEO’s job is to increase share price. They can be removed and fine (woe is them /s).If you want stability and to be appreciated for the work, and you’re in the US, go govie. Maybe not right this second, because the current admin is anti-government worker. However, you won’t make big tech money, but you can still get over 100k a year pretty easily. More if you go contractor, but you get more replaceable (being good at your job or having a clearance will still play a big role).",

Can't speak for the UK or Ireland or the Middle East. If you're trying to have a pick of jobs in your wheelhouse with transferrable skills, avoid the below if you're early to mid level. SF Bay Area, LA, NYC, Seattle/Kirkland. Having worked in FAANG prior, I find that most of these companies were fueled by hype and next-quarter shareholder value rather than an engineer truly making their salary in value. Most tech industry-only engineers don't know their asses from their elbows insofar as understanding the political and business aspects of development. The Leetcode-focused hiring process is also antiquated and a form of gatekeeping that people in these industries use to make it difficult to replace themselves. Also, quite a bit of the tech used internally is proprietary for big tech and the working process as a whole doesn't translate well to the broader industry (most of my ex FAANG cohort has struggled to hold employment or move jobs).If you look at the state of the tech economy, big tech (or finance) and the regions that espouse it are the cultural origin point of all of the grifting. It shows in the working styles and the hiring culture.In short, with the big metro regions, high risk and high reward. For consistent opportunities and steady (but not great) pay, I always look at Metro regions with well diversified & stable industries that have a use for software engineers. If they're far less populated then more power to you, as they'll have a higher need for entry to mid level engineers. These include:Dallas Fort Worth (huge), Columbus, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, St. Louis MO, Madison WI... Seeing a trend? With the exception of DFW, most of these are sleepier regions with less going on for young people. If you tough it out for some years and develop widely applicable skills, you can decide whether to go into big tech, startups, or non tech/enterprise.",

I’ve worked as an EE, SWE, ME, and optical designer. The common part of all of them is understanding how to solve problems and work with teams to solve incredibly complex ones. The only difference is the tools in your toolbox. Engineering majors do a much better job teaching this than CS.- you’re better prepared for data/noise analysis. P99 metrics, understanding distributions or finding a root cause for skew etc are all covered in EE, and I notice people with pure CS struggle with it- harder to self teach: my labs had $100k+ worth of equipment to learn on, whereas I was able to self teach software development using online resources.

The coursework is essentially hardcore maths and physics with a sprinkle of programming. The CS courses are the easiest part of a EE degree. 2) Since the curriculum is packed with difficult courses, you are not as competitive as a pure CS major for CS jobs, except embedded.

LLMs are a constant advancing threat to our jobs, and if that's not what ends up taking my next one, it'll just end up in India. If I do somehow find security, it will be in a job that I don't find nearly as fun anymore in a post-LLM world. And this isn't even getting into the headache that they have introduced into the job hunting process itself. I can't decide which future feels scarier, the one where the AI data center bubble pops or the one where it doesn't. I know LLMs aren't the silver bullet they're being marketed as but I don't think that matters much until the bloodythirsty C-suite ghouls stop drinking the kool-aid. To me it feels like the better outcome is for the bubble to pop but that could mean half a decade of a job market that will make 2025 feel like 2021. It all has me giving serious thought to a complete career pivot into a field with a stronger human element that provides better protection from LLMs.In summary, yeah, this environment is completely overwhelming",

It is ok to ballpark and \"saved X dev hours\" is a type of claim I've seen many times.For some things, we call them \"zero-to-one\" initiatives, where the impact of completion/rollout of the feature is self-explanatory (e.g. \"there was no two factor auth, now there is\")The real catch is that metrics solely for STAR format's sake won't necessarily look good, and it's a backwards way of thinking about things. E.g. \"saved dev hours\" sure, but to what end? Do they actually deliver more features or does the time end up being spent on other ancillary tasks w/ same overall velocity anyways?Metrics are supposed to provide finality to an overarching story that has actual metrics, so that the narrative sounds coherent rather than an aimless rambling. Just tacking on whatever metric to the end of a project doesn't necessarily make for a compelling STAR format story, just like adding sprinkles to the top of a poop cake doesn't make it a nice cake.",

They ballpark a number based on what they know and slap it in there expecting nobody to dig in too far.I think having actual real metrics comes easier working at some companies vs others. If you are at a company where the SW team comes up with their own work then part of that is justifying why it's important to do. More times than not metrics are likely to fall out of that. All of my 15 YOE has been at R&D companies working on greenfield medical device projects, think dialysis machines. It was very top down management style where you do as you are told at the product level. SWEs have control of code level design, but not really the direction of the productSo asking me to justify why did I implement X major feature over 1 year is on the level of asking why did you put as gas and break pedal in a car or why is there an infotainment system in the car. It's there because it's expected to be there if you want people to use your product.So asking me to put in metrics on my resume is pretty hard since we are implementing things on the project for the first tome and not iterating and improving something. Why did we need some feature comes down to the product owner saying this is what is needed based on conversations with X/Y/Z important person at the end of the day.There is obviously all shades of grey between the two extremes I gave as examples. Frankly I have no actual metrics on my resume. My bullets are along the lines of: I accomplished \\[X\\], that provides \\[Y\\] value, by doing \\[Z\\]. It works ok enough to get some visibility, but I don't have companies banging down my door to get me to interview or anything like that.",

For example, looking at latency of virus scanning for images. However, the cutoff is much more \"is this too slow at the scale we expect to matter\" instead of \"is this the absolute best option\". Also, we don't have free reign to choose whatever stack we want. There are languages that our developers are familiar with, ones for which we have tooling (e.g. Terraform modules), and for which we can easily collect metrics. I got in a bit of trouble for using Python for a cloud function script because it wasn't an \"approved language\". IMO, you can absolutely build something that would scale to 100m daily users in Python or Ruby (not that I would want to), as the language matters much less than the architecture and actual implementation. I think there is this idea that you need to use C or Rust to get the \"absolute best performance\", and that is probably true on a micro scale, but on a macro scale, you can just use a native extension and get the same performance boost without actually writing low-level code.",

My teams (also at “rainforest”) have all of the juniors working on infra at some point, and I highly recommend OP taking a step back and looking at the “meta” tasks. Explicitly “building AWS infrastructure” without seeing the patterns is a gap worth focusing on. I know life at that company suck and people will ghost you, but there are many people who WILL bend over backwards to help you figure these things out given you’ve done some digging yourself and can ask informed questions.In my experience pretty much all feature work at all levels is going to have to consider business logic and deployments to a service that runs on compute, extend or create DAOs that write to databases, add routing rules for new APIs to an LB, and update front ends — the foundation for an application; lambdas and queues and ddb streams are all very common patterns too. That alone is a really good place to start researching trade offs, which is something you can do very intentionally while building, or even by looking through low severity system issues during oncalls. If you’re on the hook for LLDs, there’s even more room to dig into trade offs and alternatives.",

While both data scientists and software engineers do some research and engineering, data scientists focus more on answering questions and R&D while software engineers focus on building things for users. At most large companies there is significant separation between the two roles.all else equal interest-wise i would just go with company prestige because experience can be transferable at the intern level for sure. but extra emphasis on these being fairly different careers so really think about what u r good at. try your hardest to work somewhere with good tech culture/practices, this can exist even at smaller non-tech companies so do your research and ask people on LinkedIn who work there.",

It’s the most portable base skill and keeps more doors open early.If you love **measuring outcomes** (experiments, metrics, forecasting, “did this actually work?”), go **data science...**especially if the company treats it like Meta/Facebook does: DS tied to performance, decisions, and product direction, not just dashboards.Quick gut check: do you want to be judged on **what you built** or **what you proved**?

Networking is crucial; reconnect with former colleagues, attend meetups, or join online communities to hear about opportunities and get referrals.

That's a little tongue in cheek, but it's worth having some perspective: people that work mining coal a mile underground don't do it for fun, don't study coal mining as a hobby, and don't participate in miner meetups. We all need to keep some perspective on how lucky we are that there's even a question there.In that vein:> I enjoyed going to the office, using my split keyboard, having triple monitor setup, cool desk decorationsI don't mean this to be discouraging at all: but you need to get more out of things than that. Not that there's anything wrong with enjoying better tools and environment - but careers are long and tweaking your setup isn't going to keep you motivated beyond the next few months, let alone decades.But all that said - you aren't entirely wrong. This is both a job and a career, and if you're not learning stuff or getting growth opportunities then that isn't good. You won't always have interesting things to build, but if you never get that then you're going to stagnate and that's where people run into trouble finding new jobs.You should be able to work with your manager to identify some growth areas and find some tickets where you can learn something. That's a perfectly reasonable expectation. But the key is to focus on what you can learn and what new skills you can build: it being \"exciting\" doesn't really enter into it.",

        "body": "Most of my favorite tools are old things, or they’re incremental improvements on old things. For example, I’m a Neovim guy now. I made the move this year. And yes, it really is nicer than classic Vim. If I were doing LFS, I’d likely use it over classic Vim. But at the same time, it’s a clear incremental improvement over classic Vim from 20 years ago.Modern debuggers are similarly old. I was showing a class of CS majors who hadn’t seen one how to use ‘em back when I was in school. I am consistently shocked by how many very experienced devs have never once used a debugger. I mean, even IntelliJ predates me by a bit. Of course, it wasn’t the hands-down best Java IDE for a bit, but now I wouldn’t work without it. VSCode is maybe the single most overrated thing in our space today. Yes, I have used it. No, I don’t like it very much. There are better text editors out there that don’t consume gobs of memory. That said, I do wish that `jq` had been around to be included in any version of the Single Unix Specification.ETA: I just realized that Git came out after I started. And yes, it’s a real improvement on the source control systems we used before.",

For example, home automation is one of mine.Most \"smart home\" tech is incredibly stupid and as a result if you really want it to do smart things, you need to get into the weeds of the tech. That work needs to run somewhere, so that's an excuse for building a home lab. Having a home lab also opens up other wishes, like a Plex media server or backup solution for the family's computers, etc.If I'm building a home lab and building/running all these services, it only makes sense to build it all with IaC and keep track of everything with Git, just like I'd do in a professional setting. Maybe I won't PR myself and yolo it all right into main, but otherwise I'm building things out for my home with the same tools, tech, and patterns I use professionally.Because of this I'm very often doing \"POC\" work for my job on my own home lab first. *That's* where I built my skills first for example, in building and running k8s clusters and all the downstream details that brings for how I structure my code to run on k8s, how do I handle CI/CD cleanly to deploy, etc.When it comes to actual software, I'm coding a lot of family management apps to help track kid chores, keep our finances in order, etc. I'm also coding on robotics and drone projects, including some with/for my kids to run their Lego robot creations. Beats the hell out of building yet another \"pet store\" tutorial app I'll never care about.But always building my own stuff as \"professional grade\" and not just half-assing it because \"it's just for me so who cares\".",

If AI replaces junior engineers (assuming AI becomes reliable enough to do that), that creates a future problem when seniors retire. Today’s juniors are tomorrow’s seniors which is why the industry will always need to invest in junior roles.

Then some basic devops implementation choices, ie ec2 server with nginx, api gateway with lambdas, how you'd handle scaling.I think system design is really just knowing about what the available tools are, and why you'd make one choice over another and the drawbacks and benefits of them. Using react or just plain javascript or nextjs, SQL vs NoSQL, lambdas vs EC2, ECS vs Kubernetes, client side rendering vs server side rendering (ie maybe you dont want server side rendering with immediately important information like financial data or medical data, but otherwise you'd want it especially publicly facing applications).",

If you need to use a car, the resulting depreciation of the car is a business expense that needs to be paid out of business earnings, or again you are stiffing yourself on wages.The figure you get from that calculation will look large.

They're both the same. I went to college in Virginia and every recruiter came to the state's #1 Engineering + CS school (Virginia Tech) and almost every recruiter went to #2 (University of Virginia). I'm talking over 200 companies at alleged #35 Virgina Tech's [expo](https://www.sec.vt.edu/expo.html) where I got internship offers. We interviewed on campus in rented rooms.What matters is #1 work experience in the form of internship or co-op. #2 is university prestige so rankings but, again T30 vs T50 is fake. #1 or #2 in your state is fine. Like University of Wyoming has garbage rankings but companies in Wyoming will recruit there. After first job at graduation, university prestige matters much less, if at all.",

If you get past the sentence above, then think like an investor and ask them the hard questions. Do not hold back. Go hard on them. If they're competent and experienced entrepreneurs, they should welcome these types of questions from anyone they want to bring on board. After all, they're effectively asking you to be an investor, not just an employee:* Does either founder have any past experience running any kind of business?* Has either founder ever founded a startup before? If so, what was the outcome?* Ask to see their pitch deck, for them to give you the pitch.* Are they already seeking investment? I would imagine they must be if they don't have any cash of their own to invest. Ask to get a detailed report on their efforts so far and why they haven't found investment yet* Does either of them have any connections to people with capital (VCs, angel investors, etc.)?* Ask the hard questions: How soon do you expect to get funding? What is your contingency plan if that gets delayed? (funding often takes longer than anticipated even for companies with a good product, previous investment, etc.)There are a bunch of other more specific questions about early stage startups that should be google-able.

Sure, working with others is better than doing projects on your own, but I would not hold my breath since realistically for now (and possibly forever if they don't get investment) it'll just be a few desperate juniors such as yourself (\"You get what you pay for\" will be their guiding principle). I can guarantee they won't hire a senior or CTO until they get funding. Also, good engineering practices cost money: licenses, infrastructure, etc.--not a lot of money, but they seem kind of short on money, which would be another good question to ask: if they can't even afford laptops, how will they afford AWS, etc.Good luck. I just want to make sure you approach this with hard realism: it's something to put on your resume, maybe you'll learn a few things. Anything else is like winning the lottery. Hell, I treat stock options at funded startups that are hitting their milestones as lottery tickets. If you want my labor, I work for cash, not promises.

If the team isn’t right, the scope doesn’t excite you, the comp isn’t real, or the location/logistics don’t fit your life, you can walk away without blinking....I prefer to live in a world and I always assume, most recruiters have positive intent in what they're doing and there's no malicious intent behind their actions.",

I spoke with at least a 8-12 of them in this time and while most were one time conversations, some of them I went further with multiple communications. Never once was it a problem, and it eventually led to me finding a position that was a monumentally better fit for me and I made the move. I, personally, wouldn’t sweat having a conversation here and there. It’s good for you, I don’t think your concerns of your current job finding out are realistic (but maybe I’m wrong about that), and if you end up not liking what the recruiter is selling you then you just move on, no big deal.

Then after that is really the beginning of the more \"cool\" stuff like operating systems, cryptography, robotics, databases, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, computer graphics, compilers, algorithms, etc.>If programming makes sense, which language suits a math student who’s learning for understanding, not employability?Python (due to amount of resources online)>I want to keep learning mathematics If you have never taken Number Theory, I recommend the Intro to Number Theory book by Mathew Crawford from AoPS. I did that when I was in elementary school and it's a phenomenal book. And like all AoPS books, challenging.For Discrete Math, it's Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications, Kenneth Rosen.Those are the more \"CS\" sided part of math.

I started learning C# early on in life because I loved video games and wanted to make them, there were two primary languages you could accomplish that with back then (this was about 20 years ago) C# with the XNA framework, or C++ with a library like SDL. XNA transitioned to monogame, and SDL is now SDL2. I believe Unity was around but it wasn't popular yet, unreal engine existed but the commercial license was expensive. I went with learning C# because I wanted to make games for the Xbox 360 and monogame was free to use, which I did, I launched two games before finding work in the industry doing web development. That was my path and it worked well for me.In your case, because you have a heavy math background and you're only interested in learning id try LISP or maybe Python. Those are less marketable languages but have heavier focuses on Math.Any mainstream language to start is a good one though. Game programming is fairly math intensive which you might enjoy but it's very labor intensive and requires a knack for art , if you don't mind trying to make your own graphics and aren't all that concerned about design philosophy then id still recommend C# and monogame. Maybe you could start by building pong and then transitioning to a game like tetris. Good luck!",

I've experienced some candidates show off flashy projects on their portfolios but don't really know how to present them to hiring managers, and we wouldn't want that. It's always good practice to also match it with your target career/industry, e.g. fraud detection for fintech or clinical prediction models for healthcare. I've seen some posts here and there that can be a good starting point to mapping out your next projects based on skills & goals, and can link one to you if that's something you're interested in.",

That only matters if you're talking to an actual engineer, or engineering manager, who knows the difference between \"wrote HelloWorld in Rust\" and \"on the Rust board of directors\". Most HRBPs/recruiters don't know the difference, and speak \"years of accredited education\" and \"years of professional experience\" exclusively, and those are the people deciding whether your application/resume ever lands in the inbox of a manager with an open [req](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150317-00/?p=44453).Be sure to emphasize the internship and accredited education in your resume first and foremost. The portfolio, or interesting GitHub personal projects, can and should be a footnote below things recruiters/HRBPs are specifically looking for. I'll also add that tinkering alone, by yourself, on a project is not nearly as useful as collaborating with a team on a project. Because in the real world, most engineers work as a part of a team or teams to get stuff done. Consider contributing to well-known open source projects. Understand that step 0 of contributing meaningfully to most open source projects is: You understand what the project is, and who its end users are, on a deep level. That can take anywhere from days/weeks/years depending on the complexity of the project. And \"I was part of SIG release for Kuberenetes 1.31\" is easier for a recruiter/HRBP to grok than \"look at this chatbot I made, isn't it neat\". It's especially easier to grok if that recruiter/HRBP is staring at a req with the word \"Kubernetes\" in 5 different places.For extra emphasis; Fix your resume first before you spend time chasing shiny open source projects. Also, the job market just extra sucks right now -- sorry about that. Not much to be done about organizations shy around adding headcount.",

The idea is rather than saying, “I did x,” you say, “I used Y to do X.” May make a difference. Right now, I don’t know if you just know SQL and a little bit of python. It were you manually fixing data by inspecting stuff individually? Most likely no one is doing that, but your resume feels kind of generic/shallow. There’s potentially missing stuff. Did you run this all locally? Were you involved at all with deployment or setup? You must have used some other services or libraries, right?

I have my own projects on the side but I did not have to deal with problems of scale, availability or other aspects of enterprise development that a mid-level would need to be able to handle. I've seen a few internships that are specifically only for undergraduates but largely they've been open to both undergrad and grad students, which I am, and prefer prior project/work experience, which I have. A transition out of this role into a different one where there is less red tape and more hands on dev work seems more plausible the internship route, where the expectation of delivery is less.",

Internships, connections, and ML conference papers are how people get jobs at those labs. Without putting in extra work, and potentially a lot of extra work, you won't have any of those three. Personally, I'd do it only if I were at peace with the full range of potential post-PhD outcomes. That includes not just the best case where you end up at an industry lab, but also worse cases including rejoining industry at basically the same level you are now (albeit with a PhD, or after mastering out) or being a postdoc. If what you'd work on during your PhD isn't so compelling to you to the extent that it doesn't matter where you end up after you're done, I wouldn't do it. I did my PhD at Stanford and I saw so many bright and talented people strike out on the industry research job market only to settle for \"worse\" jobs, including as data scientists or postdocs. That said, you don't have to view the next application cycle as your last chance, as I've seen many people start a PhD in their 30s or 40s or even later. But it is hard to justify applying again if you're not bringing something new to the table in your new application.",

So on the face of it, I do not think the PhD granting department being math vs CS is a big deal.However, yeah, some of your red flags are red flags. The repayment thing is brutal, attrition in PhD programs is very high and you don't want that hanging over your head. Why isn't it funded with TA or RA positions like a typical STEM PhD? You don't have to pay back your tuition waiver from those. Internships not being allowed is horrible if you're pursuing an industry role.Regarding your potential PI being new, do they have tenure yet? The last thing you need is your advisor going up for tenure and not getting it, and at least if you're in the US, that's a very real risk these days. I have a few friends from grad school who went the academic route and will be up for tenure soon, and despite playing their cards well, they're all very worried about this.So math vs CS, no real worries, but imo you are right to have reservations.",

From my understanding for them the difficult part hasnt been the coding challenges of the dev interviews because they stayed sharp but more like hiring managers look at them as a pm and dont want to interview them for an engineer role. So i guess it comes down to maintaining a stream/timeline of projects coding that you can use to say \"see this? I am still a dev i havent stopped building things\"",
