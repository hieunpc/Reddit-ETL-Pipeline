Today’s platforms have to support analytics, data science, and increasingly AI workloads alongside traditional BI.The criticism of Databricks and Snowflake feels a little unfair; they are not trying to replace data warehousing fundamentals, they are trying to support multiple workloads. Both platforms can absolutely deliver a well-designed data warehouse if the right discipline is applied.In my experience, the real issue is people rather than platforms; there is a strong tendency to chase modern tools and certifications while neglecting core concepts such as data modelling and integration. I regularly see engineers openly say they have no interest in modelling, which I would argue is foundational to being effective in this space.So I agree with the spirit of the post; that we have lost sight of fundamentals. I do not think modern platforms are the culprit; they simply expose gaps in skills and architectural thinking that were always there.",

In data analytics and engineering the real problems are and always have been people and processes. Technology only enables them. What actually got us here is weak data management and governance.That said, I also partly agree with the criticism. Modern data stack tooling has reached a point where many organizations think that throwing Databricks or Snowflake at every data problem and calling it done is enough. This is especially true in organizations where IT (which should not be the owner of data in the first place) is expected to “fix” data issues. They look for technological solutions to what are, in reality, problems of processes, roles, ownership, and culture. In that sense, the frustration expressed by Inmon is very much understandable.So the concept of the data warehouse did not fail. Technology simply made it easier to avoid the hard work. Vendors and consultants sold a convenient illusion. Integration and enterprise data are not a tooling problem, they are a design choice and an organizational commitment, and a governance problem. Expecting a platform to solve that is exactly the mistake that keeps repeating itself. Blaming modern platforms for the decline of data warehousing feels like blaming a database for poor data modeling. The real issue is that many organizations never built enterprise data capabilities in the first place.",

In my experience, I got jobs that I’m not even qualified for just because they liked me. A recurrent comment I hear around peers who are interviewing candidates is that, because of the amount of experience required for the position, they know you will learn whatever they throw at you so they focus on getting someone who clicks with them. Good communication, good presentation, knows how to move the conversation without making it awkward, shows ownership.Not an awkward guy in a hoodie asking for full remote position and just tanking questions in the interviews. Unfortunately, extroverted people get rewarded.Just trying to help and give you my experience. Good luck man!",

Companies using AI to screen resumes and applicants using AI resumes. Its just bots talking to each other. That being said, almost every job I have gotten I have applied into the void and gotten lucky. As far as unconventional spaces, more people than you think need a data engineer.

We explicitly said no sponsorship in the ad. What did we get?98% Indian candidates that were in some sort of work visa limbo. Most of the students with student work visas that were expiring within the next couple years, some h1-b or married to h1-b candidates. There were a few green card holders and 2 US born candidates that were extremely unqualified for the role. Also every resume seemed to come from the same template and pretty much looked the same with different schools, companies, starting dates but mostly the same skills and general experience. It was very difficult to go thru the stack of candidates because very few stood out as different. I think this market is broken. Qualified candidates have trouble getting thru the noise and it is flooded with foreign workers. My guess is that most employees are staying out of the market for now and waiting for conditions to improve. Those looking for work are those that were downsized or student workers looking to land someplace to start an h1-b process. My analysis may be incorrect but this is what we experienced posting on LinkedIn and indeed.",

Smaller result set limits by default, fewer auto refreshes, and leaning on the SQL editor instead of clicking around the tree constantly. That alone fixes most of the sluggish feeling.I have not found a single tool that nails fast exploration, smart autocomplete, and wide database support without tradeoffs. Most teams I know end up with one main client and a lighter secondary one for quick checks, rather than trying to force one tool to do everything.",

Pick up the Azure stack as you go as your skills slot directly into it.I have worked with a lot of people who have your exact stack and they all have what you have which is a lot of T-SQL and not a huge amount of general purpose programming. This is both good and bad. Good because if you applied to a Microsoft heavy company, you're probably going to get in. Bad because it means everybody on your team is likely to be like you i.e. not a huge pool of skills to learn from. If that isn't a problem for you, then that's cool. The job advertised is also likely to be on prem only. Again, depends what you want to do on a daily basis as there are going to be some on-prem only jobs with your stack which pay really well.If you want to get away from a Microsoft stack, brush up on DE and cloud fundamentals as well as pick up Python.",

In 99% of large organizations Kafka is a completely separate standalone cluster. It usually lives in its own VPC on AWS (MSK) or is managed via Confluent Cloud. It sits upstream from your data warehouse.2. Why use Kafka if Snowflake has Streams?Because Snowflake Streams are proprietary. If u use Snowflake Streams you are locked into Snowflake. But a large enterprise has 50 other systems that need that data (Microservices, Real-time Dashboards, ML Models, Fraud Detection). None of those can read from a Snowflake Stream efficiently in real-time.3.

Because typically when I say Data Engineer I think of Analytics / Data Provisioning for ML etc. - essential for the data platform - and for this do Snow pipes and other such platform tools help?Do Data Engineers also build Kafka pipelines for consumption by other software applications such as microservice ?

On most occasions as a DE you just consume the data and dump everything in a storage layer ( the single source of truth). if your job descriptions asks you to setup a cluster, manage, work at a source level, fine tuning, making changes and coding in Java etc. You need a lot more depth in distributed systems and understanding in Java and Scala to debug performance issues and stuff.",

You do not need to abandon Snowflake. The strongest DE profiles right now can explain tradeoffs between the two and have scars from both.",

Databricks, meanwhile, was built for big data and machine learning from the start, so if you want to lean deeper into data science, streaming, or large-scale ETL, it’s a strong addition to your toolbelt.From a career perspective, deep expertise in either is valuable, but having practical, hands-on experience in both will make you stand out. If you can get some Databricks exposure—even in one-off projects—I’d take it. At the very least, you’ll be able to talk intelligently about both in interviews, and more companies are running hybrid stacks.Long story short: Don’t abandon Snowflake just because Databricks is cool now, but add some Databricks to your arsenal if you can.

Even if you only have a single DE, they can use Kimball to guide the modelling that they do. And, depending on the needs of the organization, it isn't critical to make the model gigantic and intricate. Like most things, limit it to what you are working on and the level you need it at.Some specifics - Mesh is very much a decentralized approach, though the specifics vary quite a bit based on who you talk to. But in a Mesh environment, pulling a healthy fact table across is what you want to have happen. It allows that cross-group information flow, while minimally impacting either group. Yes, it is a dependency, but point to point isn't bad as long as there aren't too many; at which point you start looking at a central repository for these cross-group objects in place of point-to-point. dbt for all, I agree is not a good ideal and fortunately not one I've come across in the wild.",

You generate the code to download the historical weather and air quality data (backfilling) into feature groups (tables) and write an incremental pipeline to download weather forecasts, weather observations, and air quality observations. The 1st challenge you will encounter is how to perform a temporal join to join air quality observations with weather observations. This requires an ASOF LEFT JOIN between the tables. Only a few data warehouses support it it (and Hopsworks feature store). You want that data back in Python (e.g., Pandas DataFrames) to train the model. Hopsworks provides that data via Arrow from the Lakehouse tables. If you go via JDBC/ODBC to your data warehouse, performance will be vile - Arrow (ADBC or ArrowFlight) is best for Python clients.My book (referenced in the thread) covers these fundamental skills of backfilling vs incremental pipelines and data models - star schema, snowflake schema data model and OBT (don't use this for ML!).",

Then what the ML spits out, that is information, store that in Dim/Fact gold layer. Like a Customer Rating. The fact is the rating calculated by the ML based on history available at the time the CR was calculated. The Dims would be DimCustomer, DimCustomerRating, DimDates, FKs into a new FactCustomerRating table.

You can build data pipelines in declarative (SQL) or procedural way (Python).Then once you start to accumulate some data, you can use the platform as data governance tool using Unity Catalog and control who can access what or check data lineage.With sufficient amount of good quality data, you can start opening up the platform for data science team to let them train & manage ML models or create GenAI-powered application.You can further open up the platform for your Data/BI analysts team for data analysis purpose. Databricks has this AI-powered coding assistant called Databricks Assistant which can help your data analysts with SQL or Python syntax should they need it.If any of your software devs (or data scientist turned software engineer) are required to build web applications, there is Databricks Apps to let you build a web app based on popular frameworks like Flask/Streamlit or even NodeJS. Lakebase can also help if you need low-latency OLTP database for your web app.You can also open up Databricks to your business users, business stakeholders, or C-level to let them ask questions about data using Genie or to let them view dashboards. If those business users accessing Databricks directly, you can minimize the array of menu down using an access control called Permissions. Or you can also integrate Databricks with BI platform of your choice like Tableau/PowerBI/Superset/Metabase.I think that covers quite a lot of use case across several teams already.",

These are very good certifications in terms of understanding what databricks actually are. Bit of costly but worth it. Even Udemy has similar courses you can try it out.Always start with understanding their infrastructure and architecture and start understanding one by one features in terms of data layout optimizations, table formats, catalog layer, governance layer.Also try setting up each thing in databricks and by the side you will learn all the things.Frankly speaking I haven't taken any courses but I started exploring the features and did many pocs on each of them. Also my suggestion is that don't try to scope it into your usecase, try out all things and think of it as a data engineering platform journey because you will learn many things over there so. Happy learning!!",

Same works for if any service decides to call my endpoints, I can stop any processing to happen if request data to my endpoint is wrong.Dataclasses - used mainly for internal data transfer. An example for this is, let's say after my Pydantic validation occurs I now want to move around the fields I can set them in a dataclasses and move them around with pass by value/ reference. Now I can do this with Pydantic also but why I shouldn't. Pydantic does have an overhead when it parses the field this is very small but I've hit cases when it matters (Pydantic v2 is faster). Dataclasses are faster when I've already validated the data internal transfer is faster and makes more sense to use a dataclass when I just need to move and play around with the data. Additional point database updates I would make a data access layer which would be validated against the schema. I use SQL alchemy here for the models some people use Pydantic here too, optional honestly. This way it makes it easier to unit test too when you abstract everything and loosely coupled. Hope it clears things up!!",

From I can tell, you definitely can, and sometimes want to, use pydantic to load in your api data. It will not only parse and validate it, but it can standardize your field naming too. You can do a lot of cool things with it, like use a TypeAdapter for places where you need different structures that come out of the same API. That being said, I do view it more as an OLTP type tool, it *feels* more row based. For DE tasks, I would reach for DuckDB or polars to read in the API or json data and flatten it. Really depends on your use case and data volumeAs for landing your raw data and then processing it, that’s a valid way to do it IMO. Land your API responses as JSON and then process with whatever tool you pick.",

Tests and freshness checks punch way above their weight, especially for client work where trust in the data matters more than fancy metrics layers. Lineage and docs also get used more than people admit once teams grow.The newer features are interesting, but I have seen mixed adoption. Semantic layer sounds great, but many teams already solved that in BI tools or code. Sometimes it feels like dbt is trying to be the control plane for the whole stack, which is nice in theory but adds cognitive load. I mostly wish they focused on making the core workflow faster and simpler rather than expanding surface area.",

E.g. requiring that analytics solutions only use data from gold when in production, but allowing analysts to utilize tables from other layers for their development and testing iterations. Dogmatic approaches is reminiscent of the age-old debate/criticism of centralized data warehouses that took years to develop before anyone in the business would get data access, which reduced their value and usefulness and accelerated the development of \"shadow BI\"-setups in business departments that didn't get their needs met. You can't develop in a vacuum and expect users to accept a (to them) long delivery time just because you want to run the data through all the layers in your architecture. Of course, you also have to protect your setup and governance, but sometimes speed of delivery is more important than perfected delivery.",

Not a big deal for a small/solo project, but at scale it can introduce unintended changes if upstream schemas evolve (new columns, renamed columns, type changes) and can impact downstream models silently.* Your models appear to be **full refreshes** (not incremental), meaning tables are recreated on each `dbt run`. In that setup you generally don’t need: `now() as last_updated` to track row creation/update date This information is already available through **Clickhouse** **system table** called `system.parts`.Overall: not a complete end-to-end project yet (missing orchestrator and probably lots of other bricks !), but the foundation and structure are solid, nice work setting this up !",

Scalability -- build templated scripts of processes that only require inputs to run. For example, the name of a source, its connection, the name of the tables, and so on.Pros: scalable, easy to add new sources (just add a config)Cons: Harder to understand than \\[2\\] as there is an extra layer of abstraction (the \"metadata\" layer)2. Ease of understanding -- simply have processes for each source that move and/or process the data. It's a bit easier to understand for other people and new joiners since there's just one thing to look at which could be a bit more scalable in the future since other people can chime instead of you bottlenecking your data teamI've seen 2 work well when there isn't loads of data but a big need for data in the company. \\[1\\] works well in say traditionalindustries like manufacturing where realistically it will always be a central data or IT team trying to process probably quite a lot of data, so it depends but the key always is design first then modularity IMO",

At different layers of the stack there's different approaches.For custom API extractor's, I wrote the first two as completely separate. Then when I was working on the third, I started by copy-pasting stuff from the first two, looked at where things were identical and put as much of the overlapping code as I could into a library. Then I made all of our future extractors use that library. We were writing them in go so this took the form of an interface which extended `io.reader` that the custom extractor would implement.For loading, using the aforementioned library produced data in a standard format along with a schema file that could be used to generate a snowflake load statement. Then we had a single snowflake load component defined in our task orchestrator which we re-used everywhere, changing only the configuration. (We used argo-workflows as our task orchestrator instead of Airflow. I... don't recommend doing that)And then for transform jobs, I'd conceptually sort them into two categories. 1) Transforms which you can determine programmatically from some sort of metadata. This could be standard transformations you perform on every table like an upsert, or it could be parsing fields out of a JSON document based on a schema. You should generate these SQL statements with code. You can have that code be DBT macros, use code-gen to generate DBT statements, or just generate and run the SQL statements from your application. I'm not a huge fan of abusing DBT macros for stuff like this because I find JINJA to be kind of messy, but a lot of people swear by it. Probably comes down to personal preference. As for having the code that generates the SQL statements also run it, you should avoid this unless you directly benefit from detecting and implementing schema change on-the-fly. Otherwise just having a daily/weekly pull request that you generate with a script is probably fine.2) Custom business logic transformations. I wouldn't do anything special here. If it's in DBT that's enough standardizaiton.Then once you're writing custom transformations you can kind of do whatever you want. DBT forcing everything to be SQL select statements is a pretty high level of standardization.",

You could even write a test for it if you've got that kind of gumption, Trying with specific date ranges that you mentioned the API accepts. Also, if you did a merge statement instead of a copy into (just assuming I guess) on primary key, it would probably fix the dupe issue, even if the API returned everything every time. Seems like that shouldn't be the case though, and is likely a param in the API call that needs to be verified.",

Alternatively, your filter doesn't work the way you're expecting it to work or the param you're filtering on isn't the right one.>I’m deliberately not deduplicating downstream because I want ingestion itself to be incremental.Would suggest implementing something like a rowhash and which you can use to determine if a row \"exists\" or not. Will make your pipeline a lot closer to being idempotent and a lot less likely to see double insertions.Means you can run your pipeline in an incremental fashion now in an efficient way (only call the data you need ever X hours in a time period instead of doing a full load every single time), and it also means if you are in need of a full load for whatever reason, you can run the same pipeline one time to backfill.",

Do it on a smaller subset over more than a day,  make sure check your filter parameters are also parsing correctly e.g it’s not expecting datetime in some specific format and its erroring on their side and becoming 1900-01-01. They should return you a bad request but other systems often don’t follow best practice. Remember the [robustness principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) when it comes to integration. Ultimately if you’re going the route of a watermarking pattern to ingest incrementals and not dedupling downstream it doesn’t hurt to have some internal validations e.g asset min(created_at) > last_created) that fail the processing.",

It's a combination of:* Market temperature* You as an individual at a technical level* You as an individual at a personal level* How realistic your expectations areFrom what I read on the subreddit, people who struggle a lot tend to have very unrealistic expectations for their first role, underestimate how much work is required, as well as overestimate their own position within the job market e.g. no years experience, done one bootcamp, \"can't find a remote job paying $200k USD - job market is COOKED\".Purely anecdotal although I got into Data Engineering during the previous DE boom 5 years ago, so I had market temperature on my side. Additionally, I was unemployed so was programming, studying, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours per week as well as applying for jobs within the country I'm a citizen of, so a lot less complications in terms of borders.Based on what you have written, there is a possible issue with borders although if the subreddit is anything to go by, a lot of US work is being outsourced to your location. I'd definitely consider asking r/dataengineersindia as they're likely well positioned to answer your question.",

But coding basics (syntax, logic, looping) in Python, PHP and SQL is a must. Getting a Minor in SWE at any university should be fine for the « minimum ». Can be done part time within 2 years including summers. Salary wise for a junior it will be less than a full SWE until at least 12-24 months of pertinent experience.Data Analyst is a different branch at university. A DA will first get a degree in BA (business administration) then database courses including design, using, transformation, QA. Not an engineer. The DE is an engineer with SWE plus the same database design / usage / transformation. So the same DB courses as the DA, but no business admin courses. Analyst courses though included. So both DE & DA can do SOW, plan on paper a POC, various DB design patterns - like staging, Kimball & Medallion.At work I can do the DA job, but the DA cannot do my DE job.

In real pipelines, the biggest gains aren’t perfectly structured outputs, they’re time saved on discovery and triage. Analysts, data engineers, and analytics managers spend far less time opening PDFs, scanning documents, or hunting for the “right” version. Error rates improve mainly because fewer documents are missed or misinterpreted early, not because extraction is flawless. Complexity still exists, but teams get faster at deciding what matters and what needs attention, which is often the real bottleneck.For data roles, this is where a local, intelligence-driven system like VaultBook has had practical advantages. Instead of forcing everything into schemas upfront, it keeps documents intact and applies intelligence at the retrieval layer. Data analysts quickly surface related reports, prior assumptions, or historical decisions. Data scientists revisit source material tied to experiments or models without re-parsing files. Managers review contracts, specs, and analysis together in context. Because the intelligence runs locally and focuses on relevance rather than brittle extraction, workflows stay simpler. The measurable benefit is less context switching, faster recall, and fewer “did we already analyze this?” moments. That kind of efficiency compounds quietly, which is often more valuable than flashy automation.",

Use the INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA.TABLES to either limit scanning to particular partitions ( if datetime columns are present). E.g. if upstream did not update in the last 3 days you are good scanning only the last known updated partition instead of full deals.3. See a way is the test scripts can be written in a better way. Maybe instead of scanning the entire table scan last paritions etc . Can you avoid hourly and just run it once per day ? E..g if the ingestion is not happening hourly there is no point running them hourly etc. understand the data better and workflow. 4. Better awareness among the org and your peer group to cross check parameters, timings, query writing. E.g I know a lot queries are just copied pasted from the UI ( which are always written in a quick fix way as exploration) and then they are pasted as such without realizing the downstream consequences.",

When you get to the \"Set Scripting Options\" part of the wizard, there's an \"Advanced\" button—click that, then look for the \"Types of data to script\" option. Change it from \"Schema only\" to \"Schema and data\" (or \"Data only\" if you just want inserts). That will include insert statements for your data.For views and security objects like users/permissions, the wizard sometimes skips them by default. Make sure they’re selected under \"Choose Objects\"—expand the tree to manually include your View and Security options. For user permissions, you might have to script those out separately, as SSMS sometimes leaves out the explicit DENY/GRANT statements for users.Once you've done this, your .sql file should include create table statements, insert statements for your data, view definitions, and possibly some user/permission scripts. Double-check the final script to see if everything you need is there—sometimes for things like user permissions, you'll have to supplement with a bit of hand-written SQL at the end.Good luck! If your module ever evolves into building internal tools around this database and you want a less manual way to let others view and update data (especially if you don't want to give direct database access), there are platforms that can help you spin up safe, web-based interfaces pretty quickly. But for now, the scripting approach should tick all the boxes for your assignment.",

A couple became lite-DE who also do lots of DA work. Most went into BA and project management instead because there were more opportunities there and they dont have to do lots of self-learning. If you go that route (management or lite-DE), prepare to have very strong domain knowledge and stay within your industry even if you switch job. The pay isn't bad, and maybe even better if you're political and ambitious. There are heaps of companies who are still using legacy systems and still need DE who are really good at SQL. You do have to upskill and learn data modelling. You should volunteer for those sort of project in your current job to at least say you have experience with data modelling such as Kimball. There are lots of courses on data modelling you can take. Once you got your foot in the DE door doing SQL and data modelling, you should learn Python, infrastructure etc and become a more well-rounded DE. The job description for DE is constantly changing. It's getting more and more heavy on infrastructure and companies just expect you to be able to do anything. But always know your strong point. The expertise I'm still advertising for myself is data modelling, Databricks and the ability to step into Data Analyst role if needed (because I was one). You'll be competing with DE who used to be software engineer. They'll be much better than you at coding. There might be DEs who were SREs/DevOps and they'll be better than you at infrastructure. I also have another friend who isn't that technical but she became the data lead and earns way more than me. She has excellent leadership skill, communication skill and also very studious and has a millions certificates so she can participate in any technical conversation even though she doesn't write code that much. So work with your advantage and continuously learn to overcome your disadvantage, regardless which path you take.",

When they break, it will be noticed and important people will know your name.If you want to DM me - feel free to. I transitioned from Biology (Genome Sciences and Technology, University of Tennessee Knoxvile) into industry about a decade ago. I can’t promise i’ll have relevant advice on how to do it yourself; but if you have questions I’m happy to do what i can to provide you with my opinions/observations.",

One option is parallelize copies with multiple Lambdas or AWS DataSync to increase throughput and reduce wall time. Another is use S3 Batch Operations to do object-level operations without client-side copying which offloads work. I built a service that generates realistic PARQUET from SQL DDL so you can quickly reseed data instead of moving archives, it can generate 1,000 rows in under 100ms and seed a DB in ~10s vs 20+ minutes, would love feedback or to connect if you try it, good luck.",

How much stuff will they need to return?

What about Windows 12?Usage/Telemetry - how and when was the asset last seen on the network/in-the-office/stock-taken on a shelf?Policy - what usage/returns policies are there for different asset classes?

This is meant for things like system or temporary files, but it can be annoying in cases like yours.If renaming isn’t too disruptive, prefixing with something else is an easy fix. Otherwise, in Spark 3.0 and above, you can tweak behavior with the `spark.hadoop.mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.input.dir.recursive` option (set it true), but that doesn’t affect the underscore rule—hidden files are still skipped.A more targeted workaround is to explicitly list files you want with something like `spark.read.json(list_of_files)` instead of giving a directory, or you could rename the files as part of your ingest pipeline.There isn’t a PySpark flag to disable this hidden file rule, unfortunately. If you need to keep underscores, consider scripting a rename step or using a pattern that Spark will pick up. The docs are a bit buried, but this is standard behavior and catches people out all the time.",

Gold - if queries are costing you a ton - it's probably inefficient queries executed against them. Maybe you can implement some autoclustering to help, depending on the pain points.",

Stations were MSDOS and later Win95, 98, etc. SQL Server in 2000 on an NT4 server. It was worse than Informix. By then Informix & DB2 was awesome, but it ran on a mini server (remember mainframes?) that cost twice my yearly salary. NT4 was cheap in comparison running on micro computer server tech. So true cost? What would happen if all data wasn’t centralized? No history?

But I try to look at it this way, Data team serves the needs of the BUs, so should the data team bear all the cost?Bronze: our ingestion rate (and cost) grows proportionally to the scale of business. More businesses tend to mean more data sources and more data. So this should be measured as a fraction infra cost. How much that fraction be will depend on how much the budget holder willing to allocate (and how much the VP of Data can justify the importance of data to the business). And as the storage grows, can we archive the old data?Silver: similar to bronze. Its scale and cost grows proportionally to the business needs. Optimizing compute is a matter of optimizing the query, using spot, tuning knobs, etc.Gold: Many data analysts may not create an optimized query. No filtering, no limit, select *. I feel that the cost per query should be charged back to individual BU because it depends on the BU needs and how adept each BU's analyst optimizing the queries.Just my 2 cents based on what I saw.",

I recently learned that our frontend only accepts status codes 200-299 as valid responses from the backend, the rest is treated as errors, exceptions and a fail to the query, they return an empty string, funnily enough, a 204 also returns an empty string...intentionally... but because it's an empty string, all the error handling treats it as a failure. So instead of returning 204 I must return a boolean for a success or not. This is a mechanic implemented by some guy who quit years ago and the codebase is too large to change all of it..so we work around it while convincing the people in charge that we need to rewrite everything due to...security reasonsThe fun here is discovering all the hacky stuff and dealing with the people in charge diplomatically. Just got to look at it as a game, and that you're slowly making progress",

        "body": "I'm gonna tell you something that took me way too long to figure out and honestly still pisses me off that nobody just said it to me directly when I was your age.Stop building shit to impress other programmers. Start building shit that actual people need.You're seventeen, and coded for like 6 years? Cool. I was similar. And I wasted years, like genuinely wasted them building technically complicated garbage that nobody used. I'd make elaborate systems with clean architecture and clever algorithms and other developers would be like \"wow nice\" and I felt smart. But you know what? That's just jerking off. Nobody outside of programmer circles gave a shit because none of it solved actual problems.The real turning point isn't learning another framework or getting better at leetcode or whatever (ofc that's important too at some point). It's when you stop asking \"what's a hard technical challenge I can tackle\" and start asking \"who around me has an annoying problem I could maybe fix\". And I mean really asking. Not imagining problems, not building solutions looking for problems, actually talking to real humans about real annoying shit in their lives.I wish I'd done at seventeen instead of building my tenth todo app with a new fancy tech stack. Go find someone, it can be your parents, a teacher, local business owner, literally anyone, and ask them what repetitive annoying thing they deal with. Then build the dumbest, simplest possible thing that makes that less annoying. Not elegant. Not impressive to other devs. Just useful.For an Example, my friend used to manually copy-paste data from emails into spreadsheets for her work every morning. Took her like 45 minutes. I could've built a script that parsed those emails and dumped it into a CSV in literally an afternoon. But I didn't, because that wasn't \"interesting\" to me. I was too busy implementing a custom database engine for a project nobody would ever use because I wanted to understand B-trees. See the problem? She had a real problem that cost her actual time every single day. I had the skills to fix it in hours. But I never even asked because I was focused on impressing myself and other programmers.This will humble you hard. All that clean code and design patterns everyone is proud of... Nobody cares when they can't figure out how to log in. The clever optimization doesn't matter when they just need a button that exports to Excel because that's what their boss wants. You know what's funny? Even Linus Torvalds had to learn this lesson. When he built Git, he didn't start by designing the perfect distributed version control system architecture. He started because he was pissed off at BitKeeper and needed something that worked for the Linux kernel workflow, specifically handling huge numbers of patches from contributors he didn't fully trust. Git's internals are actually kind of ugly if you look at them. It's basically a content-addressable filesystem with some scripting on top. But it solved the actual problem he had, which was managing kernel development. All the elegant design came later after people were already using it. He built for the problem, not for the architecture. That's why Git won and all those \"better designed\" version control systems nobody remembers lost.Or another time, built an inventory system with proper relational database design, normalized tables, foreign keys, the works. User wanted to bulk-edit 50 items at once. Couldn't do it because I'd built individual edit pages and never thought about bulk operations. They just stopped using it and went back to Excel where they could edit multiple rows. My database design was objectively better than Excel. But Excel let them do their actual job faster, so Excel won.You'll realize pretty quick that like 80% of what you thought was important is completely irrelevant and all the boring stuff you ignored is what actually matters. Authentication, error messages that actually tell you what went wrong, handling edge cases like what if they upload a file that's too big, making sure it works on their old laptop with Chrome from 2019, having an undo button, that's the stuff that makes or breaks whether someone actually uses your thing.This field is packed with people who started young. I've met self-taught developers who picked it up at 25 and they're way better than me at a lot of things because they focused on solving problems instead of collecting technical skills like they're achievements in a video game. There's a guy I used to work with who switched from being a chef at 28, learned to code at a bootcamp, and he's one of the best developers I know. Why? Because he spent 10 years in restaurants learning how to handle stress, communicate with difficult people, and deliver under pressure. Those skills transferred. His code isn't always the prettiest but he ships things that work and people actually **want** to use them.[continuation in the replies]",

Worse, when people do not ask anything and you just silently are stuck. Just ask your question away. No matter how stupid it sounds to you. A stupid question that gets answered is better than a stupid question that does not get asked and you remain stuck.2)when you get this idea about comparing yourself with others then instead of saying \"I might have an imposter syndrome\" then self-diagnosing yourself with it solves nothing. When a person knows more stuff than you then learn from him. When he does something better than you then ask for hints and for advice. People who are more knowledgeable than you are your opportunity not your threat. Talk with people not self-diagnose yourself with irrational stuff.3)when there are hackathons, open door days, seminars, internship offers, student job fails, then again, talk with people. Use these opportunities. Attend these events. Even when you are saying \"But I do not know anything.\" When you know nothing then you have nothing to lose but only to gain. Be proactive.From technical side:1)go for degree studies. Pick a university/college that is known for its CS program and apply to it. Does not have to be Harvard University or something. A local state college also does. Without a degree you'll be fighting an uphill battle. For various reasons.2)do not build calculator apps or TODO apps. Build stuff that matters. You won't be using that calculator app you made. And there is no \"But perhaps somebody might start using.\" No perhaps. If there is no need for it, then do not make it. Make things that matter. Start with yourself. Build stuff for your own use. Something related to your interests and hobbies. Perhaps something to make your daily tasks easier and faster for you. Something for your friends and family. Like this you are learning to solve real world problems not making useless template \"projects\" that everybody is copy-pasting from some tutorial.2)Leetcode and competitive programming are useless in the real world. Yes, there are companies that might ask such questions during their interview phase, but other than these, useless. Prioritize actual real life problem solving not focus on how to make an X task as fast as possible. DSA (data structure and algorithms) has its place but that place is not in Leetcode nor in competitive programming. Apply DSA in your projects, instead.",

        "body": "Most people responding in this thread are wrong. They’re coming from only their own personal experience and they don’t realize how much variation there actually is between people. I’ve taught software engineering to a couple hundred people. There is a spectrum for what you’re describing. I used to call it rabbit hole vs. fuzziness. Some people are comfortable moving on with just a vague understanding of a topic (these people are “fuzzy” on the details). Others can’t move on until they’ve understood every last piece (they get lost down the rabbit hole). Go too far on the spectrum in either direction and you have problems. In my experience with people learning programming, you run into way more people having problems because they’re too “fuzzy.” But you DO get some people who struggle because they consistently go too far down the rabbit hole — even when working on a specific project, even with a tight deadline. You should 100% address this. I have two tips:First, keep a very dynamic, organized todo list. What I mean is, before you start working on pretty much anything, you should explicitly write out high-level goals and todo items. Generally, what do you aim to accomplish? And what do you think the high-level steps are that you need to take to get there? Then as you work (and get a better sense of what needs to be done on a granular level), start to populate more specific sub todos (nested/indented below the correct parent todo). Cross todo items off as you complete them — and add more as you realize you’re missing them. You should be switching back and forth between doing the work and managing the todo list. Keep the todo list correctly organized in a hierarchy (sub todos indented below the correct parent). This process is helpful for a number of reasons, but in your case the biggest one is it helps keep you focused on the bigger picture. You’re constantly reminded how what you’re doing fits in to getting you to your initially stated goal. That way you’re working toward the goal rather than being distracted by every single thing you don’t totally understand.Keep a separate list of open questions. Writing them down can help you resist the urge to chase down all the answers right away. You can always come back to the list and answer the questions later if time permits.",

        "body": "A socket is provided by the OS as a means for different processes to communicate, essentially acting like a file handle. You can write to it or read from it to send or receive data. It’s like a mailbox where the OS acts as the mailman and figures out how to transport the mail. Sockets don’t necessarily need an address - e.g. you could have an anonymous socket for communicating between processes on the same computer. In this case, it’s usually held in memory by the OS kernel until the socket is closed. Sockets can also be local-only, and are often bound to a file path so other processes can also go find the socket and send mail to your program.When you’re writing an HTTP server you *do* want an address so that others can send you mail (HTTP requests), so when you bind to a socket with a specific port you’re telling the OS “if you get any letters to this address, stick them in my mailbox.” By binding your socket to a port, you’re giving it an address that is reachable over the network. Otherwise, you couldn’t have a server that just sits and waits for requests - nobody has a way to send your program any requests!Here’s a pretty good [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/D26sUZ6DHNQ) that explains sockets simply and in better detail than many developers ever know or care to learn. In practice, you usually just need to know that it’s a stream of data handled by the OS, very similar to reading/writing files, and how that data is handled beyond that is not really your application’s business. It is helpful to know that sockets usually stay open for a while after you’re done with them (in case the other side has more data to send), and you’re limited in the number of sockets you can create, so it’s prudent to reuse sockets where possible rather than open new ones regularly.",

Usually the first file you open is file #3, the next one is #4, the one after that is #5, etc.In traditional UNIX sockets, when you say \"I want to make a network connection\" the OS says \"OK, your network connection is #3.\" Then later you can say \"I want network connection #3 to connect to server 10.234.5.67 on port 80,\" followed by \"Send the bytes 47 45 54 20 2f 0a 0a over network connection #3\".Most of today's networking systems evolved from traditional UNIX sockets and work basically the same way, even on \"non-UNIX-like\" platforms such as Windows.> Is a socket an object?The socket is the object in the OS's internal data structures that is manipulated when you tell the OS to do something with network connection #3.> Is the socket a number?For the purposes of asking the OS to do something with a socket, the socket is #3...but \"3 means the connection between this computer and 10.234.5.67\" is only valid in the context of a specific conversation your program had with the OS.> Is the socket a file?The \"numbers the OS hands out, like #3 above\" are called *file descriptors*. They were originally made for files, but were adapted for sockets. When you want to write the word \"hello\" to a file that you previously opened and the OS told you it was file #3, you tell the OS \"Write these bytes to file descriptor #3: 68 65 6c 6c 6f\".One interesting decision they made was that if #3 refers to a network connection instead of a file, then *you can still tell the OS to read or write bytes exactly the same way*.A socket isn't a file, but it sort-of acts like one.(UNIX domain sockets are a different beast. I'm not going to discuss them here.)> Is a socket an IP:port combination?No. IP:port combination is a setting you put on the socket for outgoing connections. For incoming connections you set a port; the OS only gives you connections from others requesting that port. You can also optionally set an IP address for incoming connections, sometimes called a \"bind address\". In case your machine has multiple IP addresses, the bind address tells which one you're interested in getting connections from.> when creating an HTTP server, why do we use sockets\"Why do we use sockets to make an HTTP server?\" is like asking \"Why do we use a print statement to put data on the screen?\" Because that's what the system provides.There's a lot of stuff going on under the hood! For example the humble print statement could be replaced with a syscall or a BIOS interrupt or writing pixels directly to a framebuffer or [building your own graphics card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs).But as a beginner you don't want to think too much about the underlying layers just yet; you'll just get confused and overwhelmed. \"Use a socket for network connections\" is the networking equivalent of \"Use the print() statement to put text on the screen.\"",

New things happen, assumptions on what is important might change, and you need a cycle to manage this reality. Waterfall strategy only works short term, agile strategy is what separates success stories from failures long term. This is, again, something that comes with experience.As far as what technologies survive long term? Well, bash and linux scripting, javascript (specifically async), sql (on the administration and optimization side), and react state as a design pattern I feel are all key. Linux in particular hasn't changed much since I learned the basics 20 years ago.Good ideas will persist and better ideas will replace them over time. This is just how it goes.

        "body": "source: Professional Programmer since 1990Here are some skills which, in my experience, help keep people in demand. These are all skills one can learn, hone and master if you want.6. Learn the basics. Understand how computers works, how software works. For instance, what is actually happening when a line of code calls an api function and gets a result? Become familiar with general architectural principles/patterns to help know when to apply what, and to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different tools and frameworks. For instance, understand why certain architectures, languages and frameworks exist, and their pros/cons. Why does C matter in some cases, while in others Python or R might be a better choice? When should you use third-party libraries and frameworks, and when should you not take on extra dependencies? This leads to the next item. 5. Moving comfortably between deep debugging and a wider perspective and knowing when to dive in, when to zoom out, and how to switch quickly between the two.6. Scoping problems quickly. Recognising when you have enough information to act, and when you need to pause and go andlearn more.1. Be good at delivery. Being able to get things done and helping manage your work well. If people can trust you to get things done, they are more likely to want you on their team. Everyone takes time to get better at estimation. Practice getting better by reflecting on why sometimes things took longer/shorter and where you might need to plan better. 2. Knowing when to move fast and accept trade-offs, and when to slow down and lift quality. Knowing to trade off quality, reliability, (all the 'ilities') etc 2. Always be learning. Stay curious about new ideas and whether they make things better or worse. Spending regular time getting hands-on with new technology, techniques, processes and engineering practices matters. There is endless information out there, so be selective, but genuinely interested. Whatever your preferred medium for learning is, make sure you get a good spectrum of quality info3. Being able to step out of the code and talk to senior leaders about risks, benefits and costs. This means understanding the bigger picture well enough to help them make decisions that affect the organisation, without getting lost in detail. You have to be genuinely interested in their problems to really understand them. They will appreciate it generally.4. Bringing technical and non-technical people together to solve problems, both day to day and long term. Knowing who to involve and when is a very great skill. This can be applied whether you're in an org or working in your business for others 7. Being a heavyweight engineer. Someone with N years of deep experience and judgement, not the same year repeated N times.8. Be good at spotting trends and patterns early and calling them out so plans can be adjusted in time. This applies at every level, from yourself and peers, all the way to the big bosses.9. Being a decent person. Don't be the twat that thinks they know everything and treats others with disdain. Even if you do know more, you should treat people with respect. Some will be dicks who don't return the favour, but most people I've found just want to do good work and get on in lif. If you treat them with decency, they are far more likely to help you achieve your goals. 10. Be a producer. Most people are consumers of stuff. If you go out of your way to be a producer. This could be as simple as taking time to share your knowledge with others, or even speaking up in discussions, even to ask questions. You'll be more noticed and more likely to be in their mind when people want to get something done. Often this leads directly to getting better work and with it more impactful rewards. This is a bit of a haphazard list. And you'll see that I've not listed any particular tech. It took me a long time to transition from being quiet and technical to being more interested in the bigger picture and interacting with others more. I really wish I had this list when I was a junior. Overall, this transition, I feel, has made my software engineering much better.",

If you're wanting to deploy something with Docker then pick something that can run in a Docker Container, figure out how to containerize it or if it's already done try to figure out what they did to get the project container ready, look into how the container is built, and then look at the steps needed to deploy the project somewhere.

From there I try to build and stop to review materials and to brainstorm on how to get around blocks.

A lot of these are in the [subreddit FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq)* \"Am I too old to learn to program?\" (No.)* \"Do I have to be good at math to program?\" (No, but you should be comfortable with basic arithmetic. You don't need algebra, calculus, etc unless you're working on software that uses that stuff.)* \"Am I learning the right language?\" (Learn Python to start. But if you're learning something else, that's fine.)* \"Do I need to get a new, more powerful computer to learn to code?\" (Absolutely not. The cheapest desktop or laptop is more than enough.)* \"I want to learn a second language at the same time but I've heard that's bad.\" (It's fine. You can learn more than one thing at a time. There's no actual research or studies that state that learning.)* \"I feel like I always have to look stuff up. I can't memorize everything.\" (That's fine. Everyone is constantly looking stuff up.)* \"I heard X is slow.\" (That's not really a concern for your needs, and probably isn't even true in the first place anyway.)",

I thought I would be able to work day in and day out dealing with data structures or trying to reduce time complexities to suddenly gain a ton more performance, but the truth is stuff like this doesn't really matter, until it does. What ends up happening for me is that I go with the simplest solution and just run with it. If we find value in increasing performance or reducing resource usage, then we spend time doing that. Otherwise, get the functionality out and get feedback ASAP. There's no point spending a week to reduce cost & complexity when the client is gonna say no to the entire functionality anyways. This isn't to say it's not important and you should skip it though. It is important, and not knowing it will be detrimental towards your progress imho. What _is_ important to me that I never expected? The skill to pry information out of people. Not just what they _say_ or what they _think they should say_, but _what they actually want_. Trying to understand what someone is asking for, and asking clarifying questions can sometimes get very tricky.",

I don't know where you are in your career and while I don't want to spread masses of fear, but I can tell you that I am currently getting close to 30 years professional XP with some recognisable stuff and posh sounding three letter job titles on my resume and I do not currently feel especially comfortable in this industry, relative to really the whole of this century. It's the darkest now it has ever been, but I think this will now change. There will absolutely be a correction in headcount I think. We have over-attracted through the crazy times of the dot com bubble and subsequent aftershocks and the industry became the goto for everybody who wanted a comfortable office job but didn't really know what else to do. The industry accepted it because there was enough grunt work to do and people could be absorbed but this is coming to a very sudden end. The internet business landscape is now \\*much\\* more clear, it's not being pumped full of money like it was for the first quarter of this century. In fact, most of the money that was made in that process is now going into AI development, but they already have the barons in place there. It's not the same free-for-all the early internet was, so a recession is happening now. I think we probably all need to take a moment to mourn the fact that our \"golden age\" is coming to a close. It's still, and will probably remain a respected and well compensated profession, but not the wilds it has been. In the interview you did absolutely the right thing. I've interviewed quite a bit and the second you presented your, \"You know, I think you'll be able to get a better impression of what I can do if I show you this....\", I think you're getting very close to a yes from me for almost this alone. If, afterwards, I feel like I do have a better impression that I might have got with my own questions, and that impression is of somebody who will do a good job, then welcome to the team. I can't tell you it will land with \\*every\\* interviewer, but the goal of the meeting is to figure out if a person joining the team is for the mutual benefit, if the interviewee can legitimately help us to mutually achieve that given what they know and I don't, then, yes please.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqjA04\\_dpk&t=4239s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqjA04_dpk&t=4239s) You learn SQL, C, Python, HTML/JS/CSS, Networking, and Flask. Generally, you \\*alone\\* decide what you need to know based on the problems you would like to solve. Nobody else does. The deep knowledge beyond 'checkboxes someone told you to fill' comes from your own independent learning. To learn 'real coding', pick something in your life you want to automate, or you wish was better. That's the key. Toy projects are fine, but it is nice to make something someone can use. Say you are in a Discord server, why not make a bot that does some useful task? As you make the bot, let people test the commands, see if they identify errors. The Python classes you teach to kids, what resources do they have to learn? Wouldn't it be nice if they had a pretty website with all the information related to the course? Wouldn't it be nice if they had a Leetcode style interface to do problems at your website? Wouldn't you want to tell them, \"Hey kids, look at this website \\*I made\\*, let me know if there are any problems with it?\"Is there any software you use you think is dated? As you make these useful projects, you get a hunger for wanting to improve it incrementally. You identify the necessary technologies to learn as you make these useful projects.if you were making my website suggestion, the learning could be like this: \\---1. \"i wanna make a website. how do i make a barebones site?\" -> consult youtube, perhaps watch Harvard CS50 for an HTML introduction, watch other youtubers you like. copy down the examples the lecturers give, maybe afterwards start writing your own barebones site. when you start writing, you consult documentation for intricate questions. learning generally goes: YOUTUBE VIDEO \\[brief intro\\] -> WRITE CODE -> CONSULT DOCUMENTATION | Repeat.2. \"i wish the site was pretty!\" -> learn css, watch a vid on css, put it in your site3. \"damn, this code is getting messy... maybe i need this fancy react.js format to make the webpage snappier & stop repeating myself.\" -> learn react.js, watch a video, start writing it, consult documentation as needed4. \"i wish the kids had a pretty editor they could write in... oooh what's this, monaco editor? i'll use it in my project.\"5. \"what's this tailwind css thing i've heard about? it could make making my site prettier easy, lets try it.\"6. \"hmmm... i want my site to have a backend so they can submit code.\" \\*google\\* \"oh, what's this, Judge0 is a framework that allows me to implement a judging system for the coding problems students submit?\" \"hmm... flask is good for site backends? lemme try it out!\" \\---Learn by DOING... there are 'buzzwords' to know, such as: Docker, Tailwind CSS, PostgresSQL, CI/CD, Flask, Django, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn. But the main way to learn these things is writing useful software you care about",

As far as react, I fiind react to be too daunting of a skill to learn when you are just learning javascript from scratch - start a little simpler and learn how the DOM works in a website, and how you can manipulate the DOM to create dynamic effects on a web page such as responding to clicks and looking up autocomplete search results with ajax.What you have to understand is react is a solution to the difficulty of doing the basic DOM manipulation when programs start getting more complex, but it itself is just working with basic DOM manipulation under the hood. When you understand what it is doing under the hood then you are able to better understand why it works the way it works.",

Pick a small annoyance in your own life or school routine and try to automate or improve it, even if the result is boring and ugly. The learning happens when you hit decisions about structure, tradeoffs, and maintenance, not when the project idea is exciting.Also, getting lost in frameworks like React is normal.

At first I just stored the data in a pandas dataframe (a super easy way to create tables in Python). Later I figured out how to put the data in a SQLite3 database. As I continued I learnt how to create plots and test trading strategies.I believe it’s a good starting point if you know a little python beforehand. The project will grow with you as you improve. When you have some basic code down you can start to implement databases, JIT compilation, asynchronous code, genetic algorithms and other concepts.",

You will also understand the limits of various AI architectures, be able to parse the papers and get a sense of where the field is at. If this stint studying would result in a loss of income, or debt, I would advise to optimize for FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) or any other sort of effort where to the best of your ability and assuming no societal collapse you have guaranteed income. The knowledge and the field are amazing, and fascinate so many of us. But sadly we have to optimize for income and money.",

System topics and real-world tradeoffs mattered more than I expected.If there’s one thing I’d share: you don’t need to rush interviews, but doing a few earlier can be really useful.

Learning to separate your logic is important. Python has more frameworks/libraries to solve a larger variety of problems. JS -> Python basics are pretty straightforward, unlike say C# or Java. Something that’s bitting more than you can chew can be good. It forces you to think about modularity and separation of logic. Tutorials can be good as a reference, but not worth copying and pasting beyond getting a foundation, like a working web page or mobile app that’s half way presentable with standard practice folder structure. Build your own unique application from there",

I don't know exactly how the math would work, but traversing the array would be fairly easy since you effectively map a 3D surface to a 2D \"space\". If you want to store more geometric data than just the points this may not be the best solution, but I think it would still work well enough.Each position in the array would represent a cross point of a longitude and a latitude line.Something like```Point[][][] sphere = [[ [], [], [] ], // Latitude 0, longitude 0,1,2[ [], [], [] ], // Latitude 1, longitude 0,1,2[ [], [], [] ] // Latitude 2, longitude 0,1,2]```Of course, you would define the sphere something more like```Point[][][] sphere = Point[3][3][1]```Then if you wanted to reference a specific point, it's just an array lookup. Traversing the array can be done by storing the current lat and lon and then incrementing/decrmenting them, with wrapping logic as needed.",

Sure, from one side, you'll be learning a bit less than you'd learn during your Bachelor studies as your Master studies will take less time. From the other side, you have already covered probably a lot when it comes to Databases related courses in Bachelor program. Still, a Master degree for non-CS people should teach you various topics that will be covered also in CS Bachelor program. So, you can cover that gap.I personally think that you won't get such quality from learning online. All these bootcamps and online tutorials are more like for beginners. I have checked some and they do not cover more complex topics one will learn during his university studies. They won't force you to work on your thesis project where you have to come up with something more unique than another \"X management system\" that you'd get from bootcamps. University studies will also give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects in your Github. When going by online tutorials and online bootcamps your imagination will be limited. They will tell you to make a TODO app. You will make a TODO app. Nobody will use that TODO app.If Master studies cost a lot for you then you can try some online learning and see how it works out for you. Your current career definitely will be a bonus point. But if you see that you are not landing a Junior developer or a Junior data engineer role (forget jumping into a Mid-level or into a Senior-level position) then consider going for a degree.",

Build things with the intention of them going nowhere and try to enjoy the process. If I were you, I’d pick Go.

I don’t see much value in inventing my own Netflix or re-implementing an HTTP library, especially when AI can do that with a single prompt.Because of this, I sometimes feel like I didn’t manage to get into the industry in time — and at the same time, that the industry itself might soon look very different from what it is now.And on top of that, there’s real life: buying a home, raising kids, all the usual responsibilities.I guess overall I’m just worried about how to live this life the right way.",

AI will be/is important and will be/is generating this stuff super easy and quick, but it’s not quite that simple…..A few months ago I decided to dive into Identity in ASP.NET (basically built in .NET authentication) and .NET does so much of the heavy lifting. It abstracts all the details away, allowing you to just focus on plugging it in, creating your policies and then focusing on your business logic instead of infrastructure.However…. I sort of quickly realised, that if you don’t understand how it works internally, the abstractions don’t really help or make it any better. You still have to call the relevant methods in the relevant order, and understand what’s going on in order to get the most from it. The abstractions, just save you having to write your implementations… it’s not a substitute for understanding how it works.I see AI as the same. It’s an abstraction. We ask it to generate code, it does. That saves us time and speeds up development, but if we’re unable to understand the inner workings, we won’t be able to get the most out of it. The best way to learn is to build. So build these solutions yourself, and understand how these work not because you’ll be building these yourself in the future but because it is imperative you understand the inner workings to get the most from AI generated code….",

If you don’t know what’s happening under the hood, you can’t really use them well — whether it’s [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Identity or AI-generated code.My struggle is more about the next step after that understanding. Even if I go deep, build things properly, and really learn how they work internally — will there actually be an employer willing to take a chance on someone without formal work experience? In many cases, resumes are filtered out automatically before a human even sees them if you don’t have 3–5 years of relevant experience.Part of me knows that building something unique, finishing a real project, and showing it publicly might be a way to bypass the traditional job search. That also takes time, just in a different way. And realistically, 6 months isn’t a long time at all — maybe even 1–2 years isn’t.So for now, I’m trying to treat programming as a serious hobby and long-term investment, and see where it leads. No matter how the industry changes, I still believe that understanding programming fundamentals will become almost mandatory, and once you have that, switching languages or technologies is much easier.I’ve also been living outside my home country for 6 years, and while things are generally fine, being a foreigner adds extra friction to everything — internships, official employment, even simple life stuff.

However, just because theres many job listings for particular languages doesn't mean its always easier getting a job. Javascript is the most in demand (going by listings in the U.S.), but there are also many more Javascript developers than any other language and can be very competitive depending on where you live. You'll often find that knowing a niche language and a niche industry/application will in many cases make it easier to get a job and you will be paid better for it, the mean salary for Rust dev's is like 150,000, almost 50% more than a Javascript developer. In my country, some of the best paying and hardest to fill dev roles are for COBOL developers because COBOL is the ancient backbone of a lot of finance and government systems. What you learn to build is also probably more important than the language itself (although these are often related). For instance, python developers are in demand because of the boom in machine learning and AI, if you learn python but don't develop skills in machine learning or AI you're going to find relatively fewer jobs available to you.",

Some people find a lot of success with formal training like Toastmasters, but what worked for me is just make a point to talk several times in every single meeting. If you don't have anything to say, just ask questions, ask for clarification, inject yourself into the conversation. You will have more impact, you will even have an easier time staying engaged.It's true that some people truly are more talented at particular skills than others, for sure. But I think a lot of \"talent\" isn't innate ability, but more like a very minor calibration of personality that slightly reduces inhibitions to do something. Imagine if you were 5% more likely to speak up, or 5% more likely to cook a meal, or 5% more likely to exercise each day. Over time it could create a huge difference in outcomes. 5% is a small enough margin that, even if it isn't your DNA, you can just consciously make yourself do it. Old fashioned discipline or initiative or whatever. It really does work!",

Don't go crazy learning the language like you're going to make a career of it - if you're fast at picking up syntax, you'll probably do the most learning in just a few hours. Smalltalk is a single-paradigm, OOP language. It is **THE** OOP language most modern OOP has derived from.The principles of OOP are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism; but these principles (idioms) don't *MAKE* OOP, they each exist in nearly every other programming paradigm - imperative programming has all of these idioms. These principles *FALL OUT* of OOP as a natural consequence.OOP is the paradigm of message passing. I don't move your arms for you - nor do I COMMAND you to open your umbrella, I just have to tell you it's raining. You have autonomy and agency to do whatever is appropriate in response. You could ignore me, you could open your umbrella, you could tell me to buzz off, you could call the police.Objects are a black box that can send and receive messages. In C++, standard streams are the de facto message passing interface, and you have to integrate some of it's interfaces into your implementation - for us, we have implementation level control over the details. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level feature built right in, which is convenient, which was conventional for the 50s and 60s, but Bjarne took certain issue with that - hence he made C++ the way it is.An object is implemented in terms of state and functions. Your state is typically member fields and objects. Encapsulation *isn't* about tightly coupling functions with **DATA**, it's about classes modeling behaviors by enforcing invariants in member state. Data is bulky and dumb - data doesn't DO stuff. State is an implementation detail. A car has an engine, and so the throttle has to pass a message to the carburetor to accelerate. An engine has an RPM, which is just a number. In C++, you'd mix these types and concepts, in Smalltalk even numbers are objects.Smalltalk is very dynamic and has no type safety. You can ask an integer to capitalize itself; at runtime, it can either ignore the message, or respond with a `:dontknowmessage`, or defer to an exception handler. C++ allows for type safety - another reason Bjarne invented C++, but there's a fair amount of syntax to go with it.Very few multi-paradigm languages get OOP correct. The 1990s were TERRIBLE for OOP. Eternal September came in 1993 - when more people entered comp-sci than the industry as a whole could absorb and mentor them; OOP was oversimplified to the point of being wrong, but the egotistical blind were confidently leading the blind, who couldn't have known better.As a result, you get \"C with Classes\", which is what I'd call most all of it - even in Python. It's actually a strictly imperative style that doesn't have an OOP bone in its body. Getters and setters are a consequence of the C type system, and are often seen in frameworks - but if you're not writing in C, if you're not writing a framework, they're an anti-pattern. Classes model behaviors and enforce invariants - a car can accelerate, turn, stop and start... They can't get make, get model, get year. The car doesn't use those properties to implement it's behavior. Those properties can be associated with the car in a map or table.There are many kinds of polymorphism, and late binding (virtual functions) are just one of them. Javascript has this in spades since you can just ASSIGN additional functions to instances - they are not strictly bound to a prototype. There are several kinds of static and dynamic polymorphisms - function overloading, type erasure, multi-dispatch, overlapping types, indirection...Then inheritance principally models IS-A aggregation or HAS-A composition. There are other types, like C++ has LIKE-A. While neat, inheritance is often misunderstood and misapplied - for everything you might think you want to use it for, presume you're wrong, first.---If you want a book on the subject, the seminal tome is `A Theory of Objects (Monographs in Computer Science)`. Good luck meeting anyone who has ever heard of it, let alone read it. When I tell you you'll likely never meet a developer who has the first clue what OOP is, I mean it. This is our industry's singularly biggest Dunning-Kruger.Note that Java has no de facto message passing interface. Not like Smalltalk. Not like C++. Many languages, like ECMAScript, Java, and C# are so fundamentally wrong about OOP they'll tell you that function calls ARE message passing. Absolutely insane. If that were the case, then Assembly is a first-class OOP language.",

You'll be told that OOP is: public class car { private int speed; public int getSpeed() { return speed; } public void setSpeed(int speed) { this.speed = speed; } }And this is wrong. But everyone SAYS this is right. There is nothing OOP about this code whatsoever. The principles don't make the paradigm, the paradigm makes the principles. In Java, you need to make messages and a mechanism for passing them between objects.You can create objects in Java, but Java isn't inherently Object Oriented. Having objects isn't enough. Fuckin' C has objects - it's explicitly in the language standard, but no one thinks of C as Object Oriented.I want you to have a chance of understanding what OOP is.You won't understand OOP until you study Smalltalk and original materials from the OOP era before the late 90s disaster. You cannot understand the technology without understanding the history.",

When you apply with only knowing C, the non-technical HR recruiter will probably gloss over your resume. It's a shame because a technical manager would see you know C and realize \"hey this person knows a low level language and it's easier for them to probably adapt to and learn Java because they already know a lot of coding fundamentals\"The thing about learning C is not just learning the language, you are learning invaluable skills for programming itself, skills which are often missing for devs who only learned say Python. When I took organic chemistry, the professor said you'll almost never need any of this knowledge outside of a lab, but what the skills you learn from this course will be beneficial - critical thinking, problem solving, how to tackle multifaceted problems in different ways. Learning C is kinda like that, you're learning skills that most programmers never bothered to learn, skills which are highly desirable to managers if they know them.So my advice is keep learning C and keep progressing. If you wanna get a job, maybe learn Rust or Golang because those are hot new languages that are getting a lot of buzz from employers.

Other times, you get into a rabbit hole because of a structural error, and, on those cases, it is worth to be patient and learn the reasons, as well as the other ways around to do what you wanted to do. Many times, there are many ways to do that, so it's valuable to understand them, their pros and cons, and choose one.Last, it's nice, if possible, to not code too much before trying to see the program or algorithm in action, even if not complete.

Any non-prime number would then be a multiple or product of other prime numbers. 11 prime12 is composed fo 2 and 313 is prime14 is composed of 2 and 715 is composed fo 3 and 516 is composed of 2 (multiples)and so on.

You can work out the factors to multiply by as you work out the multiples for each number, so by the end, you have the number.

But you may not have thought of it that way. -----I think you're doing okay, but there are a few things about \"optimization\" of algorithms you haven't been exposed to. So you just need more practice. Maybe try some of the simpler problems on Hackerrank or such sites and see if you can figure them out by yourself. \"Optimizing\" an algorithm is basically trying to recognize a pattern, so you can do a LOT LESS WORK than you think you need to at first.

Globalization of talent, outsourcing, the complete reluctance of tech companies to train the next generation of junior talents, etc etc. No one can tell you what the tech scene will look like years from now, and only people who are already well-off today can afford to take such risks.",

I use AI at work and half of the time it underperforms. Even IF we talk about the future even then the AI, as we know right now, will have similar limitations. AI is not actually \"intelligence\". It does not think. The current LLM models just process your textual input and then calculate which words should be most likely for the output. They do not analyze the whole picture but have a tunnel vision.So, having said that, go for programming if you want to do that. First, learn to make stuff without AI. Then, when you can already build stuff on your own, learn to use the AI (and also how to NOT use the AI). AI should not fill a gap of knowledge, for you, but it should just speed up these tasks that you would know how to do on your own as well. Like this you'll be able to assess the output that AI gives. If you use AI as something to fill gaps in your knowledge then you are unable to review its output.",

They don't understand what's going wrong, so they start a new chat and go from there until it starts to go wrong. AI also expects that the path to the goal is known, but it's not and technical debt grows.This is the AI that non-developers are so impressed by, they're blind to how bad it is. They don't understand how having AI add patches creates difficult to maintain code, they don't understand that it's a bad idea for AI to play chinese whispers with themself as they rewrite a codebase, they don't understand that AI can't actually think and strategise and plan for the future.The AI that programmers are impressed by is it's like having access to a senior developer who isn't tired of you. You can talk strategy with it so that you can enter new fields, like you can go to AI and ask \"I'm looking for a high level overview, no code, use and explain jargon, and provide multiple options. How would I go about implementing {*whatever it is*}, thank you\". It's able to present you with what you're meant to do and not rob you of the learning experience of understanding and implementing it, and you unlock the jargon to make searching more efficient.There are significant flaws with the claims people make about AI, it can't do what they think it's doing, and they need programmers to sort it.",

It's one of those (mostly) low-pressure desk jobs that you do to make a stable income while you do what you really want to do in your free time. That said, it will contribute close to nothing when it comes to helping a career in game dev. The knowledge will 100% be helpful, but it won't help you get a programming job unless it's ultra entry-level (and 99% of game dev jobs aren't entry level).It is an excellent job to have for paying bills though, and depending on the environment/level of independence, it can give you lots of time both at home and at your desk to learn programming independently. As long as I get my tasks done each day, I can pretty safely bring my laptop to the office to study/work on my own projects most of the time.I will say though, \"building a multiplayer online game\" is a very, very ambitious goal shared by many aspiring game devs who don't know what it actually takes to do something like that. To the point that it's a known red flag/meme if a dev tries to crowdfund an MMO. If you intend to make games by yourself, your scope needs to be reduced \\*drastically,\\* and you'll not only learn more but be more satisfied with the process if you focus on making small, simple games. If you want to make something bigger, then find friends/collaborators to work with-- particularly people who are willing to work on something for the fun of it instead of trying to turn it into a business. It's very, very difficult to \"start a game studio,\" so you want to start by making games for fun and learning to enjoy the process of making them before you \\*ever\\* think about monetizing. Basically don't think about monetizing/turning it into a business until you \\*have business.\\* And if you want to get into programming for an existing studio, be prepared to spend years and years doing contract work to build a reputation, and to navigate a highly competitive field where you could be let go at a drop of a hat.Make small games. Fail faster. Fall in love with actually making the games, not the idea of making games. And know that game dev, especially solo, is a very multidisciplinary endeavor where each discipline within it can take years and years to master. Pace yourself.Source: IT person of 6 years who gave up game dev because I found out I don't actually enjoy the process of programming after even more years of trying and going to school for it. What I discovered was that I actually wanted to tell stories, and I didn't need to force myself to be a programmer/artist/designer/writer/composer unicorn to do that.

IT generally isn't really a path to (games) programming work per se, it's more a path to help desk, ops, sysadmin, database admin, infra, devOps, etc. If you want to work as a programmer, providing you can already operate a computer to do basic file admin, web browsing, text editing, etc., you should just start programming right away and focus on that. If you need to earn money right away and IT jobs are all you can get right now then it's better than starving... We very much need IT people to keep the software we write up and running.For games and multiplayer online games specifically you'll need to have good overall programming skills and pattern awareness to implement the gameplay logic. Plus OS awareness, networking, database design/implementation for the online part. Plus a good understanding of 2D or 3D graphics as applicable for the rendering part. Then there's all the art...If you use a modern game engine you can mostly get away with just doing the art and use their abstractions for most of the other stuff. Still very much need to know most of the above though, just not as much as if you were to implement it.\"multiplayer online game\" is very ambitious, so a very rough idea of what your expectations starting from zero should be: A small/toy 2D game you could build within the next few months. A very simple 3D one within the next year. A moderately complicated multiplayer online game within the next *decade*.",

I'm designing and building some DIY solar garden lights where the LEDs do interesting animations. I haven't found any commercial lights like what I want. To finish the project, I will have to code my first embedded microcontroller, design the electronics, learn to design circuit boards and have them manufactured, design and 3d print the housing.This may seem overwhelming, but I've been taking it one little step at a time. It's not linear, though, not steps in a straight line. Sometimes, working on the software gives you bright ideas for changing the hardware to make the software smaller/better, and vice versa.This project pretty much illustrates why experienced developers encourage you to pick a project that interests you as a tool for guiding your learning. It gives you something concrete but with unknowns to work on.",

Even the second version just has C89. It's best read as more of a historic classic; someone wanting to actually learn C in-depth in 2025 should look for a more modern resource, with modern C standards, modern library expectations, modern expectations for compiler flags (like ASAN, or [the openSSF recommendations](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html)) etc.A lot has happened in the world of C in the four decades-ish since the release of K&R.",

Our team have seen much better results and project velocity in training engineers up in software development than we have in trying to teach software developers about the AEC space. All your current experience plus a reasonable amount of software development knowledge should open up some exciting doors.My second observation that you are more than welcome to ignore is that, based on your comment at least, you might be at risk of spreading yourself quite thin. Python alone is going to open up hundreds of rabbit holes you can dive into, web development is fantastic to have an understanding of especially if you want to hook your python scripts up to services or APIs but again is a bit of a behemoth, and ethical hacking is of course a huge field in itself.I'm not trying to dissuade you from any of it, it sounds like you find loads of it interesting which is fantastic, but focusing on one at a time to a reasonable depth and making sure to cover your fundamentals would be my advice. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is a great course / website / book if you want to start seeing some results early on. LLMs can be great personal tutors too if you're happy to be patient with them when they lose the plot, but they're pretty double edged in that they will also rob you of learning opportunities if you lean on them too heavily.Hope some of that helps!",

Because I used to have the same questions when starting out years ago.Dicts and classes are different, but both can be made to do similar things (ie composing objects from scalar types).The difference is that, in most languages, classes provide neat abstraction features, like inheritance and methods, and greater control about how you can use it.Classes can be defined, shaped, and optimized however you like, while dictionaries will just be dictionaries which is optimized for doing 1 thing that is O(1) access time with acceptable storage for the key space.On optimizations, let’s say you’re modeling a square rectangles. With class, you can just define it as having 2 fields like this{ width: int, height: int }Every instance of this rectangle object will cost you 2 ints of memory space. If the int is 64 bit, then your rectangle is just 8+8=16 bytes each, and 10 rectangles will cost you 160 bytes.If you instead wish to use a hash map/dictionary to represent the rectangle with int width and height, that dictionary is probably using much more space than just 2 ints because how hash maps are implemented. If you have multiple such rectangles, it’ll waste more space pretty quickly due to having to initialize mostly empty map to store 2 values. Every insert incur further work as the program needs to hash and potentially resize the haystack or change hash function to fit more keys.Another thing to think about is a dictionary is just a hash map, so its access time is slower than just field access (it has to compute the hash value of the key, whereas with class, the location of the field value within the object is already known).Oh and another thing is with dict/map, you don’t know if you’re gonna have a value at that key unless, you know, you access it. This happens at runtime. With classes, it’s a compile error if you’re accessing the field that does not exist.Last thing is maintainability and DX - with maps, if you decide to change the “key” you’ve been using pervasively like class fields, you’re gonna have to change all occurrences of those string keys. Whereas with classes, your LSP might support renaming that field with just a press on F2. This is very useful when the codebase is huge.Use maps to store values when each key is considered sibling or equivalent to each other, e.g. mapping post codes to region names. Think of it like dynamic lists/arrays, but with key access instead of index access.Use classes to encapsulate more complex objects that you want to extend with methods and your own initialization rules, etc.I’m sure you’ll get it the more complex your program becomes.",

Languages that impose strong typing can't usually get away this kind of thing.> for most cases where you need a data-holding object, do you just use a class?This is based on context. There are a few tuple syntax options. There is also a dynamic type which is pretty close to duck typing. Your basic typed options are struct, class and record. A record is a class with a lot of sugar and what I'll reach for initially.> c# the statement is so complexA code example would be good here.> I read that classes are faster in execution.Depends. Strong types allow for a lot of optimization. However, in the end, you're running functions against data.> need for all the explicit type declarationsDepends on where you want to fail. Using type declaration allow for a lot of issues to be caught at compile time. This mayn't seem like a big deal when the project is small, but... Imagine you have tens of thousands of lines of code and a pivotal object just changed structure. Perhaps a value that was once a string is now a number. That change can be tracked down easily in a typed language: the compiler will know. Without types you'll have to hope all your tests cover every point of failure for that.

To the point that some people want the flexibility of dynamic programming but will actually go to the effort of invoking the Rosslyn code generator to verify property names at compile time to get the benefits of both worlds. Like if you’re consuming a json file in a data dictionary you can use this feature to compile time verify property names and so forth.

        "body": "So I think you are misinterpreting what a class is; a class is a language-based concept that allows you to create custom data structures that also have behavior (or member functions) attached to it. This allows you to make ANY data structure that you want that follows the rules of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Classes allow a language to be called object oriented, since in object oriented programming, the focus is on creating more and more of these data structures which when declared in code are called objects, hence object oriented programming.A dictionary is a data structure. So you can for instance create your own dictionary class implementation, though I’m sure one exists in the C# STL. So two completely different things essentially; a class/object is a programmer-implemented data structure with associated behavior(s) attached which follows the 4 laws of Object Oriented Programming, and a dictionary is a data structure that if you really wanted to you could implement that.As for your second question, explicit type declarations are very important in the programming world because they essentially allow one to know at all times a general idea of how many bytes/chunks of memory a variable is taking up, as well as help with avoiding implicit type conversions which can cause a lot of issues. You won’t see this come up much as a beginner but the second you start working on anything that’s a bit complex, you will see why this is a big deal. This was something that I struggled with when I started in JavaScript, as the dynamically interpreted types would lead to really odd behavior at unexpected times. This becomes more apparent the further you get towards the hardware; python is built upon a great deal of layers to emulate natural language to its best ability, whereas in C/assembly you are dealing with extremely explicit operations that having a byte offset could cause the entire program/system to crash. To give even more explicit control for this reason, you will later see C/C++ users will use even more strict types like uint_32 and long long or even stranger looking types to someone who has never used lower level programming languages. Also, tbh, it just helps with readability, being able to know exactly what each type is defined as.As far as running a script, anything dealing with Windows is gonna be a pain in the ass (I’m an arch Linux user if u can’t tell by my windows cynicism) but it’s what u gotta do since C# is .NET. But essentially all the stuff u did in VS is just for programmer ease of mind, but really thats just an automation tool. Hell if you want to just open up a terminal and run a script real fast all you gotta do is type dotnet run [name of program].cs And it will run it. VS generates a ton of metadata files to help with the building process which is why it’s a pain in the butt to set up but once you do it will make it a little faster.Anyways do you have any other questions? I hope I explained well, I use a great deal of Java but I’m mostly a C/C++ developer so much different domain but still same concepts",

        "body": "Now, why use namespaces when it’s such a hassle? Why don’t we put everything in 1 file or 1 folder and have automatic access to code written in other files?TLDR: it’s for organizing large codebase. We can separate different concerns with namespaces.If you have organized folders for other computer files/works, why not source code?You probably don’t feel the need to modularize your code into modules/namespaces because your program is not yet complex enough.Imagine if we work at Google, with millions of lines of code. And now you want to name something specific to some implementation, maybe you want to implement search result for a TV. There’s a very high chance the name “SearchResult” is probably used somewhere in there. Without namespaces, we must come up with new names every time we want something different, like “SearchResultMobile”, “SearchResultMobileWeb”, “SearchResultTV”, and so onWith namespaces, each names or symbols are confined to only have meaning in its namespace, so you can have mobile.SearchResult, mobile_web.SearchResult, and tv.SearchResult instead. All code relating to TV implementation will live in the namespace “tv”, not cluttering other namespaces.Namespaces help separate concerns, and the “import” part is explicit - you have to define wht and where you want to bring symbols outside of our namespace (eg folder, in Go) into scope, to avoid you running/compiling code accidentally (which might be malicious or just bugs).My example might not be good, but at least it demonstrates the point.My tips: Whenever you are asking why programmers do stuff the way they do, imagine you have to work with big ass codebase (100k LoC++) with incompetent coworkers, and maintain that code for years, then you’ll understand why.",

        "body": "I agree with the other comment, general loss of volition and enthousiasm is not something you should ignore. You should probably start there.That being said, about programming itself: I think the first step is to really understand why you want to program. Is it because it fits the idea of a \"better you\"? Do you want it to be your profession? Do you want to impress people? Do you need tools to make your life easier? You need to spend time thinking about that, otherwise you will program for a whole lot of bad reasons. And programming is probably one of the less gratifying crafts for people who do it for bad reasons, because you're inside, on a chair, you encounter a lot of problems, you create a lot of complexity; it can easily make you feel like a fraud, dumb, and make you realize the human brain is very ill-equipped when it comes to computing. In a way, that can be depressing.Once you understand your reasons and don't lie to yourself, I really think you should understand your learning profile. Some people like the bottom up approach (like [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), [Build Your Own Lisp](https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/), things like that), other like high-level stuff. Some people like to study pure algorithms, others need to build tools. Some like \"boring languages\" (boring can be good) like Python, Go or Gleam, others need more exotic languages like Haskell, Clojure, etc. Some people like to read books linearly, others explore and start 10 projects in parallel. The point is to understand how you learn the best.Once you do, please pick preferably one technology (language) that fit your personality and let it be your main mode of expression for a while (probably years if you're serious). Don't rush. See [this page](https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html). Understand the language and the ecosystem. Become good at it. Mastery plays a strong role in pleasure and contribute to create that wholesome \"flow\" feeling.And please don't be too hard on yourself, don't seek perfection. Avoid burnout. We all need to have some unstructured fun sometimes. Kanban boards are good, but not very fun, especially if you just sit in front of them. Don't overthink or become fixated on \"protocols\"; just do stuff without producing artefacts - no notes, no plan, no Git repo; avoid paralysis. You can even delete your code afterwards, that's ok. The absence of metrics or artefacts doesn't mean there's no improvement. It's a bit like learning a foreign language: even if the only thing you do is speak with people, you will improve, sometimes way faster than people who use elaborate notes, methods and tools.",

Im also reading how linux works on the side although I dont really understand anything in that book tbh. My plan is to finish python crash course abd then work through the big book of small python projects and do it all on my kali system in vim and implement git once im done with chapter 11 but I kinda just hit a wall and haven't been putting in the same effort for the last 3 or 4 days and am afraid im falling off. And after python the plan is sql and then networking. All the while im worried that I dont know shit about computer architecture or organization or how os actually work. I also bought a raspberry pi to dabble around with because iot is also interesting. My biggest problem with I.t. has always been that there are so many avenues that its hard to choose what to do aside from the worry if one can actually even grasp what the hell one has taken upon themselves to learn. Like what if I invest x hours, days, weeks ,months and you dont learn squat? Im hoping after I've done the python projects I will at least have understood what I am doing in programming but im still waiting for some aha moments on topics like oop or funcs methods and what the fuck is recursion?",

        "body": "For your website development, if you're looking to make a full web app with dynamic content, pick a stack like MEAN/MERN/MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Angular/React/Vue.js, Node.js) which are well documented and leverage technologies/languages you're probably familiar with. If you don't need dynamic content, just go down a static site generation route with astro, eleventy, nuxt, next.js/nextra etc and deploy it for no money with github pages, cloud flair pages, or vercel or other similar services.For desktop applications, it depends what exactly you want to do. If you want to make a productivity app, chat app or monitoring dashboard for instance, electron is a good choice because you are already familiar with JS/HTML/CSS and its got a well supported ecosystem. If you want it to be lighter weight but stick with javascript, you can use NodeGUI/ReactGUI, although theres less plugins and a smaller community. If it's anything where you need performance or deeper access to windows APIs, it's probably got to be C# or occasionally C++. Java is an alternative if you want moderate performance and easy cross platforming.",

It’s not uncommon to have a pure backend as a purely internal piece with very clean, use-case agnostic API routes (the backend backend that you already have) but have another “backend of the frontend” (e.g., SvelteKit, Next, TanStack Start, etc…) that server-side renders UI routes using the true backend, exposes specialized API routes that compose elements of the true backend. It’s overkill for many personal projects, but is the standard for enterprise software in my experience. I also just think it’s nice to have a server for the UI for a million reasons, even just to have things like environment variables without rebuilding. Even if you don’t want to hide away your true backend, server-side rendering and other server features that are UI-specific are still useful.",

You need to build things yea but you also need to monitor your weaknesses and practice.Start by learning a programming language and core software development concepts until you can build something. For this look at courses (free or paid) and also doing coding exercises like from [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/).Once you feel confident you can start to look at small projects you can build, aim for something you can build in 2-3 days which will require some core concepts or development pattern. This is practice, not designed to build things to release or for a portfolio. Repeat building more core understanding and building bigger projects.During this process try to step back and identify weak areas and focus on them.Key advice, don’t get hung up on remembering syntax and language specifics, that can be looked up while coding. But you do need to understand core concepts and patterns. Example: having to look up the syntax for a for loop is ok, not knowing when you need to use a for loop not ok.",

Look up Bob Tabor and go through his javascript course. It is as easy as it gets, but you won't be a developer when you're done. What it will do is instill concepts and maybe give you some confidence, because when you are done, you'll realize, Bob Tabor makes it look easy. But he's slow and methodical.2. Start on a free and easy platform like w3schools. They are constantly adding content and I have full access (got it on sale), so I can pretty much do anything, learn new skills as they are added, get certifications.3. Lookup roadmaps and game plan all this4. Eventually I think you need to consider paying to learn, on a platform or in college.5. You might look into Team TreehouseI have used Team Treehouse's platform and they have what's called tech degrees. Some companies have heard of them and people have gotten jobs after completing their curriculum. But it's no guarantee. Thing is, without something reputable on your resume, you won't get a job, so if you're learning for fun, great, if you're looking for a career, well, just go on indeed or elsehwhere and see how many jobs there are for inexperienced engineers and look at the requirements. Nearly all require a degree, and nearly all are using ATSs to scan resumes, so no degree means, resume is dragged to trash bin. Self-taught is alright, but you won't save yourself time, and you should think about paid school, just because that's the smart route. Employers trust Professors, not youtube instructors. I mean, it's okay to be home-schooled, but I'll tell ya, you may still be studying in 6 years on your own.So that's my recommendation for you. Have some goals. Lookup roadmaps. Game plan.Honestly, you should consider a different career, like delivering pizzas. Something that's less resourceful than building code. Dreams die when reality hits. None of this is easy. If you use Tabor and w3schools, maybe they instill the confidence for you to move onto harder learning, because that's beginning stuff, and you need to get into intermediate and advanced concepts and learn far more than HTML/CSS/JS to get a job (or to show anyone you're serious). My guess is, you'll give up like everyone else. But if you are driven and surprise us all, please check in with progress reports. Use all the doubters as your motivation.Remember, failure is not only an option, it's expected.",

So if you want to use the term \"functionally retarded\", you've come to the right person. Don't worry, I'm not offended.You do not need to know a lot of mathematics in order to succeed in the field. C is not significantly more math-intensive than any other language. Things like pointers are tricky for beginners, but those are tricky for beginners regardless of whether they're good at math or not.Modulus is something that will come up in any programming language. It's usually used to determine if a number is evenly divisible by another number. It's pretty easy, conceptually. Divide two numbers. Discard everything before the decimal point. That's modulo. Like, 9 % 3: That's 9/3, or 3.0. Discard the 3. You're left with 0.0. It's evenly divisible.Now do the same thing, 9 % 4. I'm pulling out my calculator for this part. That's 2.25. Discard the leading 2. You're left with 25. Not evenly divisible. In most cases, that's as far as you'll need to go with it. Some sub-disciplines within software are very math-heavy, such as graphics/games programming and AI/machine learning. But that's mostly at the very deepest, darkest fringes, and not something you will likely encounter outside of specialized roles that will highlight the need for deeper math skills.

If you build a game using raylib, you'll need to learn quite a bit. If you encounter difficult maths problems, someone has probably figured out how to do it so you don't have to work from scratch, and there are plenty of good resources online to learn the harder stuff. You'll also naturally develop your math skills as you progress as a programmer.I will now offer rambling unsolicited advice on learning math based on my own experience. I believe many people that believe they are bad at math are encountering two related problems that make it difficult to identify or articulate why learning math is harder for them relative to others. The first is missing prerequisite knowledge, the second is study methods that do not work or are inappropriate for them. The exception is for some cases where neurodevelopment and learning disabilities create hard limits, however in many cases these can be managed by adjusting your study methods (as was the case for me, as I have ADHD and dyspraxia).Learning math and learning to program are very similar in that there are foundational concepts/skills you need to learn or develop in a particular order before you can learn more advanced content. When I got to university I had a lot of gaps in my knowledge; elementary stuff that compounded from my early education through to high school (which I ended up dropping out of). This conceptual debt made it harder to progress over time, while others only had to learn one new concept to solve a problem, I might need 5 or 6, which snowballs very quickly. This also made the traditional lecture -> tutorial -> homework learning pipeline ineffective because it assumes you have certain prerequisite knowledge and they cant/won't help you identify specific concepts needed to catch up.I found it much easier to learn at home following youtube videos (I highly recommend organic chemistry tutor), khan academy lessons, resources on the r/learnmath mega thread, or good textbooks with clear progression and references to related previous topics. These formats are easy to pause if something is too advanced, giving you the opportunity to go learn prerequisites as you need, before returning to the original problem. To practice I would follow videos of worked examples, print 50-100 problems to work through, then mark my own answers to find if/where I was going wrong. I'd also return to reattempt packets of questions later. Now I have the ability to not only deal with difficult math problems day to day, but when I can't I have learned how to learn to solve things. Good luck, and apologies for the wall of text!TLDR; Don't worry. You probably aren't bad at math, missing prerequisite knowledge and/or study methods that don't work for you might be falsely giving you that impression.",

That said, it's one of the more primitive options. If you feel another language has something more to offer you, that's your call.

Programming really doesn't require math. A mathematician will say it's all math, but that's their problem. Programming requires a way of thinking and, amusingly, some folks who are very good at math kind of suck at it. I hate seeing folks with math frustration allow that to gatekeep their possible programming glory.I got a minor in computer science, where the only higher math course required was calculus 1. I took it twice, passed the second time. I also tutored people in programming. One student, a science major, had her 4.0 in jeopardy because of a basic programming class she thought would be easy. Another student I helped out was my former calc professor, trying to learn programming.Being science or math oriented doesn't equate to programming success. Some of the worst code I've ever seen comes from engineers; folks who know and use far more math than most mortals.I mayn't be great at math, but I can program and have done it professionally for decades.

I would lightly suggest web because I think a lot of things are moving more to web but if you do either your experience will transfer. Then start programming. If you have trouble with this start really small. Put an input box on the page to enter a transaction. Try to get the transaction into the database. Try to display a transaction. Then start adding features one by one from there. I would do authentication later as I think it can be complicated to start with.",

You can set it up so that when you push a new change to github, a build will be started, you can set it up in such a way that new code changes can't be merged into your main branch UNLESS that build succeeds. You can write automated tests to test your code, and only merge into main if those pass. For a small project you might just think \"whatever\" but a big project this is very very useful.Log viewer looks fine - but path to log is hard coded in. What you should do is change it to take command line arguments, for the path and the different options it presents the user with.Look at some code that accepts and parses command line arguments - You want to use this mechanism if possible. Consider this: if you want that interactive aspect where it asks you to pick an option and then you pick one, you can still have that if you use command line args, but you'd wrap it in a shell script (or batch file on windows). You don't really want to restrict any tool you write to interactively ask the user for input, when all user input it requires can be given up front as command line args.",

        "body": "IMHO, The injecting and delegating points OP mentioned add complexity to composition. I much prefer patterns that promote simplified calling code. Inheritance promotes this naturally, composition can as well through factory methods if designed well. So, assuming the calling code doesn't know or need to know the difference, we can look at the tradeoffs in the interface implementation.It is not clear to me how composition supports sharing of common behavior. It seems like it would require complex rules for the \"base\" class to execute or skip common behavior based on instructions from the \"derived\" class. This adds complexity to the delegation mechanism and reduces flexibility. In this simple C++ example, `derived::foo()` has flexibility to add to or completely replace `base::foo()`. It also has access to shared behavior in `base::bar()` at any time. I am not sure how this flexibility can be supported with composition - would love to learn more about that.Furthermore, this inherent flexibility of inheritance supports unique implementation requirements. I believe with composition that must be designed into the equivalent \"base\" class from the start. It is impossible to think of all the odd requirements clients may have in the future. class base { public: virtual void foo(); protected: void bar(); }; class derived : public base { public: virtual void foo() override { // derived::foo() can choose to add to, or entirely replace base::foo() // derived also has access to base::bar() at any time. } };In the end, it is best to avoid \"this or that\" thinking. Both composition and inheritance are tools available to be used when they make most sense. I get the idea there are a few problems with inheritance from people using it incorrectly and they look for ways to not use it all, even if it means bending over backwards.",

Low level stuff, like C++ with Allegro or SDL or SFML. Or Java/C# with no engine (this is how minecraft or factorio got made). This will really get your gears turning, but you will have to do everything yourself. You learn a lot, but slow progress.2. Unity (or Godot). Faster results, but a lot of complexity gets hidden away and you learn more about the specific engine and less about programming.3. Maybe something web based?

Now about the tips:-do not implement stuff until you fully understand the logic behind it. Its really hard to debug a physics engine if you dont know how the state is supposed to look at each step of the process. (If you have to make the calculations by hand for some test cases, then do it, its slow but it helps a lot with debugging)-get yourself the best way of debugging you can. Something that lets you visualize stuff like the vertices, lines, bodies, variables, etc. Do not debug by guessing whats happening.-start small, make you engine by breaking it down into its smallest parts and making sure each small part works and connects easily to the rest of the code (like legos). Using assertions helps but im not sure the general opinion on assertions.-dont be against looking at the industry standard solutions. For example, if you are dealing with colision detection, trying to make your own version instead of just looking up the already existing algorithms (aabb, gjk, sat) is most likely going to take you longer and give you a worst result. The algorithms that already exist where created by really smart people with a lot of math and programming knowledge and, unless your use case is really strange, its probably better than anything most people could come up with.Lastly, seriously, this is a humongous task, you should only make a physics engine if you either-find it fun-want to learn-your use case truly cant use any existing engine",

Back then it was basically the equivalent of a \"computer systems\" 1st year module at the university I was at.Like you say it starts out looking at morse code and gradually builds up your understanding of computation over the book.This isn't a programming or coding book. It's more about how the logical underpinnings of computation work.I can't comment on the second edition, sorry.I replied to someone with this earlier but [Joel Spolsky](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/96504/how-can-i-teach-a-bright-person-with-no-programming-experience-how-to-program/96506#96506) recommended using this book as the first step in becoming a programmer. I have to say I agree with him. Understanding things at this level at these early stages is more important for your development as a programmer than whatever framework you'll end up working in eventually.",

That's the major differences.Otherwise it's mostly timeless - at the level its discussing, not much has changed since the 70s.(At the same time, being rather timeless by design/intent, if you find the first edition cheaper I wouldn't sweat the difference in that direction either).And yes, I'd recommend this book to anyone who isn't clear on how computers get from numbers to information, or from gates to processing.

It’s up to you how much effort you’re willing to spend to get a certain level of results.As the other commenter says, having to pick how many colors you want before seeing the image can be a problem. A photo of a street fair and a charcoal portrait aren’t going to have the some complexity of palette. But if you accept that it has edge cases, and are fine with how it looks on a nice diverse set of test data, then _k_-means is probably a reasonable choice.Color space conversion is very wise. Straight lines in sRGB (the default color space in 95% of situations) are not, in general, perceptually uniform. The first image [here](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/color/perceptually-uniform-color-spaces/) is a nice illustration of that. There are a few computationally simple but roughly perceptually uniform colorspaces that make much better choices. The page I linked recommends HSLuv. Personally, I prefer [oklab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space); I’ve also heard good things about [Jzazbz](https://observablehq.com/@jrus/jzazbz), and there are a handful of others. All have their strengths and weaknesses. But almost anything will be better than sRGB for this purpose.Be cautious of color spaces that are just called HSV, LAB, etc., because both those terms are more like categories than specific spaces. The simpler ones are merely new coordinate systems for sRGB, which will not solve anything.",

They are also not designed with long-term maintainability in mind. Python does not support async, making it a poor choice for UI. They also scale terribly; every line of code will inevitably slow down the applicationUsing JS is a no-go if you intend to support mobile. WebView-based solutions like Tauri or Electron drains battery like a mf.NET is pretty much designed for exactly the kind of thing that you want to make; supported on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS and various others.I'd also recommend looking into [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/), as MAUI does not support Linux desktop (currently)Other reasonable alternatives would be Java, D, Rust or C++> Any pitfalls I should be aware of?Never use floating point to represent money Don't depend on libraries or frameworks where there's a big chance you might end up paying huge licensing fees some time in the future with no escape> Would you choose differently for a solo developer?No. The \"productivity\" of a developer is subjective and entirely reliant on how familiar the developer is in the language, rather than a language having some supposed inherent productivity benefit. Especially not when the alleged productivity is from dynamic typing which is just outright nonsenseI'm of the conviction that programming language matters a whole lot more than many people are willing to admit. Just picking something solely for the reason that it's familiar is poor reasoning for anything other than personal hobby projects that will never end up on someone elses computer. It's not subjective; languages makes different trade-offs, and specifically JS and Python trade off basically everything just to have a simple syntax which is not something that you want in a financial application or any long-term project where you expect a lot of changes and new feature requirementsI was involved in a buyout of a company where the code base was Python. They went bankrupt because their solution ended up costing way more money than they could possibly hope to make. Even just for the infrastructure. Each transaction has a set price, and if the cost per transaction is higher than what customers are willing to pay, then that's game over. A lot of companies go bankrupt this way, it's just not talked about because it's depressing",

Knowing what to write and build is important. If you give either to an unpredictable AI… what is left?And no, AIs (plural, it’s not a singular thing) can’t build much - let alone “anything.” They require a lot of handholding, create bad code, keep adding instead of fixing or modifying, have no idea how to do a lot of things and so on.Anyone saying they can do “anything” or “a lot” is always doing basic menial copypastable CRUD stuff etc. Stuff that has been done myriads of times so the LLMs can just vomit it out. And nothing wrong with that work. There’s a lot of it. But the problem is those people often don’t realize there’s different kind of work.For me LLMs mostly never produce anything working. They don’t understand anything so they can’t grasp what to do. And I know many want to jump into “you’re using it wrong” so for those I say: show me how to get them to create Playwright tests using websockets instead of REST reliably and then we talk. Just one example. So of course you need to learn the skills you’ll need. Code generation is not the problem anyway but AIs will not do even that. Unless you want to work in the menial CRUD app space.

I used Claud code opus 4 for 3 months with context management and barely got any utility out of the code! This is after pouring countless hours in code refactoring cleaning and restructuring to reduce slope and keep the project manageable. At one point I deleted about 80% of the entire code base without any change to functionality! AI cannot reason! It can only fake reasoning. A more appropriate denomination for the technology would be pseudo intelligence! It generates a lot of slop and then takes that slop as input to generate even more slop! It takes human experience to know what is efficient and what is not. AI can still be a useful tool but you still have to learn how to drive it!",

What I mean is that a concept doesn't change, but with so many frameworks and technologies, the implementation changes. That's why the fundamentals are necessary. Nobody masters a programming language, but it's important to have a solid foundation. Use AI wisely; have someone explain it to you so you can learn. Don't let AI do everything. You have to orchestrate the AI. However, using AI without a foundation is dangerous for beginners.If you have any questions about my comment or want me to clarify something, let me know :ninja:",

The FAQ has plenty of options. If you're starting from scratch you need to learn to code before you can start learning AI. Python is perhaps a good place to start because it's one of the main languages used to train AI models these days - certainly not the only thing you'll need, but a good starting point.One good course is: [https://programming-25.mooc.fi/](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/)Basically there are plenty of excellent free courses on how to code, and there's nothing stopping you from learning to code and building stuff - including AI - completely on your own.To get a career in the field, though, you generally need either a college degree, or somehow you need to prove your skill and experience without one, which is possible but quite difficult.",

The Gold Standard StructureAdopt the src layout. It keeps your actual code separate from configs and tests. project_name/ ├── .gitignore # Ignore venv, __pycache__, .env ├── README.md # Documentation ├── requirements.txt # Dependencies ├── src/ │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── main.py # Entry point │ ├── config.py # Settings │ └── utils.py # Helper functions └── tests/ # Test files mirroring src structure **2. When to Split into Modules*** **The Scroll Rule:** If you find yourself scrolling up and down constantly to find a function, split the file.* **Cognitive Load:** If a file handles Database logic *and* UI logic, split them. Keep files focused on one \"domain\" (e.g., [`database.py`](http://database.py), `api.py`).* **Reusability:** If you need a function in two different scripts, move it to a shared `utils` module.**3. Patterns to Learn Early*** **The Entry Guard:** Always wrap your execution logic. This prevents code from running if you import the file elsewhere. Pythonif \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == \"\\_\\_main\\_\\_\": main() * **Virtual Environments:** Never install libraries globally. Always use `venv` (or `poetry`/`uv`) for every project.* **Type Hinting:** Start using standard type hints (e.g., `def greet(name: str) -> str:`). It acts as self-documentation and helps IDEs catch errors.Good luck!",

If you can get your character to move left and right, stick with that for now, and when an idea that's better than having a ton of if statements comes along, you should back up your code (well, version it in GitHub), create a branch, and give it a try. The worst that will happen is that you'll learn what won't work, and you can revert your changes, and in the best case scenario, you'll learn what does work, and you'll have levelled up.Just to give you an idea: I've been programming for 43 years (since the age of five) and for about 10 years now, I've wanted to write an abstract algebra library that was clean and well-organized with property-based testing and lawful certification of objects. I have literally tried to do this about six times now, and finally, on the sixth try, I have gotten it right and it is working beautifully.The moral of the story is: don't feel intimidated. It's hard to learn what **to do** without also learning what **not** to do, and if something isn't broken, you don't have to fix it. You can come back to it and improve it when you feel ready for that step, but don't put yourself down for having code that does what you want it to do, even if it isn't the prettiest code at the ball.",

But you are learning, even if you stop with Python right now and jump to C# or any other language, the muscle of programming grows and sometime you will probably come back to see ways to simplify your logic. One advice I got early was to validate and then execute behavior. This means:Dont -> if(true): {desired behaviour}; else: {error/stop execution};Do -> if(false):{error/stop execution}; desired behaviorThis is helpful because you can have like a header in the top of your methods with your validations or if you need to check in the middle of the method you can do it in three to five lines without pushing or nesting the rest of your code",

I mentioned previously that I misunderstood functions at a basic level - not realising that it is the data type(s) that matter, and not the variable names themselves i.e. you do not need to use the same variable names in main code in your function. Once I understood that, the basics became (somewhat) easier:* variables* data types* control structure | flows and conditionals* basic data structuresNote: I also have copies of K&R and KN King 'C Programming: A Modern Approach'. I decided before I properly dove into C, I needed to have a good basis for the fundamentals first re: finishing CS50x. Are you using a structured course such as CS50P or equivalent? As you learn, you can gradually build more and more appropriate structures into you code. Start small and gradually build. Hell, in C even moving on beyond \"Hello, World!\" and taking user input becomes a rabbit hole of why not to use SCANF, memory allocation and bounds, buffer overflows, etc.It sounds like you are trying to stand up and run (C#) before you can crawl (create FizzBuzz in Python).Focus just on learning the fundamentals with Python, and feeling comfortable writing code, doing some basic and intermediate projects before even considering yet another language. One is hard enough - and you need considerable hours | days | weeks | months with Python as a learner as it is, without adding C# into the equation!",

I’m not sure about the temperature of the water among the community today but when I was learning to code, it was universally accepted that everyone should learn for the first time with C.2. I recommend going to learn some leetcode to practice the basics. Do like 50-100 leetcode(look it up) problems in C and carefully understand each of them and the best implementation. Once you do that introductory training, you get my endorsement to learn to develop a game in C#. Remember that all development is a learning process. You’ll be looking everything up all the time for a long time. Don’t stress too hard about making your software perfectly optimal. Just focus on publishing a game you’re happy with and fix the bugs later or don’t. Usually the first dozen or so games you develop will get little to no traction until you’ve learned some important lessons about game development that can only be taught through practice. Good luck! Development is a lifelong skill that you will appreciate you learned",

One company we worked with had a NSFW mode on their site, so I usually worked with that toggled on whenever it was possible. Otherwise, browser extensions can also be useful to blur/black out images as-needed, and on staging sites where we did a lot of our dev work we wouldn't test with actual NSFW content, and instead use whatever bland imagery/videos we had on-hand. This actually works out better in most cases; If you're troubleshooting compression issues on UGC, it can be handy to test with specific images/videos so you can see differences in compression in a more controlled format.Now, when troubleshooting production problems? Yeah, sometimes you can't avoid seeing some.. Stuff, and even if whatever it is \\_is\\_ your kink, you're there to work, not jack off (especially if it's a production issue that's costing the business money).Given I primarily do front-end work, the hardest part for me can be focusing on the issues no matter what is being displayed front-end center..

Other fellow CS graduates changed careers to blue collar jobs like plumbing, and they never got went back to a tech career. Best of the best CS grads got jobs though. It took until 2006 to feel normal. It started sucking in 2001.2008: barely felt anything, already a senior eng, and tech industry didn’t get impacted as bad as other industries like finance, except for entry level engineers. Felt normal by 2010.Now: this is the worst since dot com, jobs have dried up for all levels.Not going to sugar coat it: this feels much more like dot com bust than 2008. You’ll have to change careers if you need to now. When things recover, they’re going to hire new grads, not older grads who haven’t worked and been sidelined for years. My best advice is to take those super lowball offers from crappy companies, as the experience you’ll get will be much more valuable than the actual salary you’ll earn. Yeah, your career lifetime earnings will be impacted and behind people who graduated in the good times, but it beats leaving the industry altogether.",

I got fired from my first job for poor performance and had a new one lined up a month later. Interviews were a breeze compared to today. A simple phone screening, and a single 2-4 hour in person round. Maybe half the interviews I did involved some light whiteboarding.In 2006 I decided I wanted to live a different place and started interviewing for new opportunities. It was so easy to get offers. In March 2006 I had three offers to choose from after interviewing over a span of a couple months. I choose poorly and so in August I started interviewing again. And again, I ended up with three offers to choose from by the end of September.In 2008-2010, like 60% of developers at my company were laid off. I barely missed the cut because I got lucky and transferred to a strategic project just before my old team got decimated. But everyone I kept in touch with found a new development job within a few months at most.In 2018 I got laid off and had two job offers within a month. Interviews were a little more challenging than they had been in 2006 but still stupid easy compared to today. Things seem to have become so much more cutthroat since then. Now even the experienced people I keep in touch with seem to really struggle with finding new jobs. I feel like the amount of people now in the software development workforce has finally reached saturation in a way that is fundamentally different than throughout most of my career.

        "body": "I dropped out of school in Jan 2000 as I was offered stock options for AutoDesk’s web start up. The first crash happened 2 months later. I’ve worked steadily since then in the industry. The **2000** one was wildly different because we didn’t communicate well on a global scale at that point. Prior to the crash, I heard stories of people making it rich in tech, but generally tech wasn’t all that well respected. The average person wasn’t using the internet for a ton. My out of college salary was 38k if I remember correctly. The prediction was the options I got would be worth 350k, which was more money than I’d ever dreamed of. (Spoiler: They were worth 0). The crash happened, the company failed, people were laid off. That part was similar to now. Everyone was just waiting for it to be their turn, comparing themselves to their peers. Fearful. I eventually took a job working for the government for 34k. Getting a job was hard. There was a fear that this internet thing was just a fad and we’d struggle to get pretty mediocre pay. Still, I wasn’t super nervous. I got into it for engineering and if all I did was write C++ Windows apps forever, that was fine at the time. For me, things started returning to normal in \\~2004 when my original company had been sold and asked me to come back for 63k / year. I took the job and worked there until 2012.By the **2006** crash I felt more like a mid level engineer. The *economy* felt bad, but in my corner of the world it felt like everyone knew tech was the future. Things were still optimistic for me. There were still layoff fears, but we didn’t really have any and my company was pretty stable. What feels different to me this time? It’s been an employees market for a long time and that’s changing. I know so many people who have made more than your average doctors do. Hell, I do and I’m a college dropout. It feels to me like this could be a huge realignment if it continues. How long do I think it will last? My personal, uneducated guess is that companies will shift back to wanting engineers. At some point they’ll realize the tools can multiply their productivity (Not replace it) and at that point they’ll want more people and produce more faster. I think this will come in the next 2-3 years likely? At the same time, I think some damage here has been done. You need a job more than it needs you and I think it could take a long time for that to shift back completely (If it ever does). I don’t actually thing we’ll see the boom at the level of \\~2018. Or at least I won’t. Maybe you will!In the early 2000s I saw a ton of people who got into software to “Get rich quickly”. They took an online course and called themselves web developers because they could “Save as HTML” in word. A lot of them shifted real estate agents or other jobs. I think we’ll see the bottom of the industry drop out like that again. What helped me survive? Uh. I’m a hard worker. Probably a bit of a boomer take (I’m Gen X), but I’ve always been very professional. I saw so much shit that I wouldn’t pull during the late 2010 boom era. Don’t get entitled. Don’t be a pain in your bosses butt. Entitled things: Complaining about a company offering only vegetarian food on certain days of the week. Someone had a hissy fit at my company when they told employees they could no longer take home entire boxes of Snickers after work. New engineers turning their nose up at 200k at FAANG right out of college.",

My interview was canceled before it was scheduled because they decided to stop all new grad hiring. - MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This was basically a defense contractor job. It didn’t work out because I wasn’t interviewed for a specific position. They did general screening. I got put in a database then never heard back. - Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Same story as with MIT Lincoln except it’s an atomic lab. - Hewlett-Packard, working in their printer division. I would have had to relocate to Boise. I turned this down even though I had no better offer since the work and location seemed too boring. I eventually got a part time job working for the university. This was supposed to convert to full time but the funding fell apart. The project was funded by tech companies who were cutting back. I ended up going to grad school instead. By the time I finished four years later in 2005 (with no PhD), the job market was somewhat better. It was not hot but more places were hiring. I got an offer to work in big tech on well known but old school software. It was pretty good for what I needed then. Salaries were way lower than now, especially when it came to stocks. I think my initial grant was like $5k over 4 years. Later, the job market improved A LOT. I got raises but eventually jumped to newer, better paying companies.The Great Recession in 2008 was very different. Tech was hit but it was short lived. Maybe a year? All my friends in other industries got laid off and the bad job market dragged on.

He wrote a lot of the code that was used for midsize long distance carriers. From what I understand, a bunch of that was done in assembly. Probably 99% of developers today have never used assembly in a production environment.

At 4 YOE I got into FAANG by just doing a DSA study guide. I didnt even spend hours on leetcode i just did a few questions a day. Barely could get past a medium without struggling. At 7 YOE i got into a big tech company with the same study guide. What sucks is google has removed that study guide, but it linked many videos of Cracking the coding interview author who explaind each DSA in a pretty simple way.

If you can accept and find a way to keep your leverage, learning, and identity separate, you'll be far better off. When you lose one of those things, like your job, it really helps if you don't spiral and remember you still have leverage, and keeping learning.The failure mode for some many people in this field is basically: job loss -> identity collapse -> loss of continued learning -> inability to frame leverage for new jobs -> out of field. They have everything they need to keep moving forward, but the ideal of accepting the chaos and moving incrementally through without the shield of formal employment is too much. You have the skills, you have the experience, you just adopt a resilient mentality. It's okay to take a break, and of course none of this is far, but also, no one is coming to rescue you.",

This includes making it easier for authorizing officials to approve the use of AI in high-consequence development. Things move more slowly in the defense space, and with good reason: there's a lot of well-warranted concerns about agentic AI, for instance. That being said, the major AI firms are working closely with government partners to secure FedRAMP approval and the like. In the meantime, I know people who are concerned about not getting exposure to new tech in their job, and you're not alone in that.Anyway, I'll tell you what my manager told me, which is that your career development is ultimately your responsibility. It's very easy to feel like you're stagnating if you're not intentional about professional development. That's true no matter where you work and no matter what stage you're at in your career. If I were you, I would have an earnest conversation with your manager to identify opportunities for you to develop your skills further. And by skills, I mean that very holistically; it's not just about learning specific technologies, but also soft skills like leadership and other complementary talents. For example, I'm looking into taking a statistics course since that's something that comes up often in my work. I also have set a performance goal to read at least two articles on relevant topics each week. Regardless of whether you plan to change careers, you can be cultivating a transferrable skill set; if you don't, these anxieties are likely to follow you wherever you go.",

Since the context is specifically remote, suppose you went on Twitch and livestreamed solving Leetcode exercises. I did this myself once and it was enlightening. Even one audience member, because I have no idea who they are, triggers entry into somewhat of a performer mode. You know you're being perceived, so you become self conscious, much like in a real interview.Though I note it won't be pleasant for the first few trials, I suspect it would cause adaptation to this problem, and work like gangbusters. Like you'd specifically intend to work through verbalizing algorithm complexity analysis in front of an audience on Twitch to practice working thru the issue in a similar state. You can modify the idea but the core is to be live streaming solutions, in front of an audience of at least one person (max ten maybe), who you know or don't know. As a separate point, I suggest that there's multiple ways to approach becoming more comfortable, less nervous\\*, and cognitively smooth during interviews. Could even work to just approach some programmers you know IRL and ask them, \"hey can I spend forty minutes explaining complexity analysis to you with examples over coffee? I'll pay for it.\" And then focus on being calm and collected throughout.",

He is killing team morale, and if his behavior continues to go unaddressed the good people on your team are going to start heading for the exits.Taking the management position puts you more in the line of fire, and TBH this is kind of the most un-fun situation you can walk into as a new manager, but it also gives you more control over how this goes down and *potentially* gives you an opportunity to get some great peer feedback from the other team members at performance review time if you effectively clean up this messy situation.It's up to you, and how much initiative you want to take. Taking the manager position under these conditions is definitely the higher risk, higher reward path. I think I would have a very honest discussion with your boss and tell them you might take the position, but you need to know the full context of what you're walking into before committing to it. That seems like a fair request to me. The comments that concern me most is the current manager saying things like \"this is a really delicate situation right now\". That *could* mean that they are just naturally conflict-avoidant and are (unrealistically) hoping that the kid will knock it off on his own (he won't). *Alternatively* it could mean that the manager knows something about the situation that you don't, and as a new manager walking in to deal with it I would want to know what I'm getting myself into.",

And the process was not competitive (avoided leetcode and technical interviews ahahahha) but Ill see if I wanna branch to data engineering or business analytics in the future/ would like to explore a diff industry. The idea that I can branch into different fields without necessarily having to start from ground 0 is appealing because I’m a type of person who likes the idea of moving around cities and trying new things. However if you feel like you don’t like technical work n a diff major is more aligned to what is fulfilling for u; go for it.

I’ve always been skilled with coding but knew I needed to put in extra work to learn more tools and languages, as well as come up with impactful projects to have on my resume. I thought a lot about it and realized i didnt want to do the upskilling work necessary to be appealing in the tech job market— this led me to realize that the industry work in general may not be for me. So as a CS major— be very introspective about whether you are willing to do the work you’ll need to do to get internships and jobs rn. Even if the job market gets better, it will still be just as competitive in my opinion— from here on out just the degree won’t be nearly enough. Ask yourself if you’re afraid of doing the extra work because you’re doubting yourself *or* if it genuinely just doesn’t interest you. It was the latter for me, so I switched. Lastly, look at any data your current college puts out about career outcomes, and look on Linkedin to see how people who graduated in CS from your college recently are performing. Talk to any upperclassmen you know about their struggles or successes in finding internships, because if you dont get an internship during college, the only thing thatll help you in the postgrad job search will be luck and an immense grind on applications and a project portfolio. Ask yourself if you enjoy CS enough to do that. A lot of people are! I was not.",

Most people in tech would not make it in either of those, especially not HVAC. You can't be soft in those jobs like you can be in tech. And then are you really sure you want to take those 13 years of experience and basically flush it down the toilet? Because that's effectively what you'd be doing at that point. Basically no going back to tech if you go that route.- In regards to starting a business, you really should think long and hard about some of the problems you've encountered at work in the past and see if there are missing tools that you could work on. Doesn't have to be complex or fancy, just has to have no real or good solution currently. I'd put this variant way way higher than career switch if I were you.- What's your education? If you are some other engineering degree (electrical, mechanical, etc) you could probably look into more hardware focused companies and get more luck there. The job search for SWEs is different in those industries in some ways.- Sounds to me like you really need to do a deep postmortem analysis on your last failed interview and either grind LC much harder or get some help figuring out behavioral/system design questions...- From my recent experience with small companies, they aren't as rigorous with their interview process, so if you really do want a job sooner rather than later you might want to expand the search to those companies as well. Check yc for some of those companies, plenty posting jobs on LinkedIn as well. They come with some downsides obviously but beggars can't be choosers.",

Or are you used to clearing interviews with rusty coding skills? At what point in the interview do you feel it shifts negative. After coding, system design or behavioral. Some of the companies some friends have gotten hired at recently don't do the leet code style grind interview and focus more on experience, design and some normal problem solving. Most of them have describe what sound like normal interview experiences. But having worked with them both, they were both competent engineers, one of them was brilliant. And they are both very easy to work with and likable.My personal goal while employeed is to master the tricks to provide optimal solutions for the majority of leet code mediums or hards.

Don't pursue it because of the career aspects. There's other careers you can choose that have lower burnout rates than CS if you just want a decent career.

Sometimes yes. Sometimes no.

It has little to do with whether or not AI is useful; it’s clear that there is a market for access to LLMs (even if the people who want to pay for them are wrong about their usefulness, which I’m not saying they are or are not.). Think about previous bubbles: the dotcom bubble did not mean the internet was useless, for goodness sake, nor did the housing bubble mean uh, houses were useless. In both cases, it rather meant investors had made foolish decisions about where to put their money in a mad rush to profits driven by hype. It is pretty clear at this point that there similarly just is not a path to investors making their money back given how much investment has gone into this now. However, the thing about any bubble is there’s no telling what it will take to pop. It may go tomorrow, or it might take another few years. There’s no way to know, usually. In the case of the housing bubble, you could look at when the higher rates of crappy ARMs kicked in and make a pretty solid bet things would fall apart at that point (see The Big Short) but that was a special case.You can look at the AI buildout and see, “okay, we’re building data centers like there’s no tomorrow, Nvidia’s accounts receivable is ballooning [ie, they’re allowing companies to take out debt to pay them], we keep inventing more 2008-style debt instruments to build these data centers, OpenAI and Anthropic and Cursor are completely unprofitable” and you can see that this cannot go on. But the bubble will only pop when investors lose faith in a major way, and there’s not really any telling when that will happen. There are some signs it might be soon, but it won’t happen until it does.",

If you’re an engineer at heart, your best bet would be to market your experience elsewhere but keep your job. A long vacation may be what you need to at least stave off burnout for a little while longer while you do it.But burnout, contrary to popular belief, comes from a sense of a lack of control over one’s situation, not simply just the overwhelming workload you’re tasked with. In other words, a vacation will not save you on its own, no matter how awesome it is.My advice would be to get 1:1s with the senior engineers on your team (NOT anyone on the management track.. yet). They should be on your side. Explain the challenges you’re facing and whether they have any advice for you. Best case is they identify that you’re being overworked and will help you manage upward. If you’re a high performer with a boss that won’t look out for you, it’s common that they will just assign more and more work for you without taking into account your workload. Managing upward comes with your growth as an engineer.",

But our team is a little dysfunctional in the sense that it isn't a team and individuals are siloed on specific applications. As an example of a better arrangement, in my team's department we matrix developers onto various other projects across the organization. At best, only small subsets our department work on the same project at the same time, and there can be a lot of siloing.On the other hand, we do our best to cultivate a robust team culture of our own. We frequently share insights with one another (including at regular, roundtable department meetings), do all sorts of bonding activities, try to ensure our bench is at least 2-deep on any topic, and we have a manager who thinks strategically about how we develop our staff and which projects we engage with. Even when our junior staff are going off on their own, we ensure they're never truly alone.Anyway, I would encourage you to speak with your manager about your concerns and what you can do to ensure you are learning/growing/thriving, not getting burnt out, and so on. You need to be managing up, helping your manager better serve you. Meanwhile, as others have said, you should have earnest conversations with the senior engineers on your team.",

I ended up not taking the offer, and honestly it ate me up for a few months knowing that I chose much less certainty and pay in exchange for an opportunity to get promoted in a role I prefer. It was a gamble that paid off after I got promoted, but it could have easily not panned out that way. Could have gotten a shit pay bump or no promo at all. Even after all this, Im still not sure if I made the right decision. I guess the takeaway is that problems with your employer may feel more immense if you had the opportunity to leave but didn’t. And there’s no guarantee that it will work out in your current role. Consider if those risks are worth it to you.",

It did everything they wanted, using every tool they requested. I included a demo of it running, install instructions and a README section covering possible improvements.In the end I got rejected for not including tests. When I brought up that tests were not mentioned anywhere in the requirements, the recruiter admitted they weren't fully aware of the challenge description. The actual things that were requested and took several hours were barely mentioned - for example, pydantic schemas got ignored, but the fact that I had methods with >20 lines was a big issue.

I’m on one team so I have to have heavy in-depth of knowledge of what my team is working on but I also need to have a good breadth of knowledge of the application as a whole. I need to know how the work my team is doing will affect others. I often play devil’s advocate especially in planning meetings because honestly, a good QA engineer will know the most about how an application actually works. You do not work in isolation and you will always be communicating with other members of your team be it about bugs you find, clarity in acceptance criteria, making suggestions, offering a test strategy, etc. All of this holds true if you are focused on manual QA or automated QA. I feel that the current industry expectation is that a QA engineer should do both. In my last job, I was wholly focused on automation. It was nice but maybe too nice and too easy. In my current job, I have to do both plus work on various QA initiatives. I really don’t like the manual part but understanding test case writing, test planning and various manual techniques has just added to my skill set. I still advocate and do automated testing at every opportunity, though.",

Management is a lot less fun in an era of shrinking budgets and doing more with less, and at our particular company, all of the process stuff got much heavier at the same time.That said, making the jump with an eye to moving back to management in the not-so-distant future seems like a poor move. If you want to manage in a different space, look for internal mobility opportunities as a manager. If you want to be an IC, commit to it for a couple of years.FWIW, I'm 50.

Have two versions of your resumes even if there's just 1 line of difference.Online CS programs are fine but there are many people in them so 1) you don't stand out 2) you don't attend in-person career fairs which is where I got internship and job offers.Unless you have shit undergrad CS program prestige, grad school doesn't make much of a difference in job applications. Real CS work only needs the BS and HR could think you want to be paid more to do the same job. There are some MS preferred CS jobs though and the coursework should in theory benefit you.",

Picking up “slower” hobbies. For me specifically, the gateway drug into slower hobbies was painting. Having a hobby/skill that takes a long time to develop and see results from is what you need to get out of the lowest effort dopamine cycle of social media. You need to do something that delays your dopamine payoff for much longer than minutes to start training your brain to not expect it all the time.3. Diet and Exercise - this fits in the same category as #2 in that it’s a slower payoff activity, but I think it deserves its own mention because being able to physically see your progress is huge motivation and doing it just puts you mentally in a better space.",

I remember implementing wanting LL, DLL, Binary tree, self balancing binary tree, hashmap, graph, and a few other things but it definitely gave me a different perspective on programming. Obviously common sort algorithms etc. Just have fun with it",

Source: Writing Java microservices is my job; I thought using a language I already know and use everyday would be the best path, but a lot of the things I love about developing with Java do not translate well to solving DSA problems.Mainly every other array problem uses primitive arrays for args and expects a List as the return type; just extra code that has no material purpose in solving the problem. Also, it’s just very verbose and opinionated and that feels cumbersome for this application.",

Another resource that was recommended to me was the Algorithms book by Sedgewick and Wayne. It's a more in-depth resource, but I heard it provides a strong theoretical foundation and has Java implementations for many algorithms. Also, LeetCode is invaluable for practicing coding problems, especially easy and medium-level ones for solidifying your understanding. Once you feel comfortable with the basics and assuming you are practicing DSA for job interviews, I also recommend looking at frequently asked DSA interview questions just to check where you're at based on industry standards.",

But you shouldn't constrain yourself to what you're being taught in school. It is a very specific discipline which requires a lot of self-initiative, curiosity, and ability to learn on your own. The upside of this is that you don't need to spend hours in library or school. All of the knowledge is available online in a variety of forms: articles, blog posts, ebooks, crash courses on youtube, etc. Don't get discouraged by the current job market condition too.

Sometimes, this is because the teacher does not clarify ambiguities because to them things are obvious. As a simple example, let's take variable assignments: x = 1 y = 3 y = x print x print yWhat would the output of this block of pseudo code be? Among students new to computer programming, a variety of answers are common:Some, intuit overwrite semantics and answer: 1 1Some, intuit swap semantics and answer: 3 1Some, intuit move semantics and answer: 0 1A good teacher will have a series of test questions designed to ferret out these mismatched mental models, and correct them. Once students have good mental models of how languages behave they can finally start learning.So I doubt that you are cooked. You probably just need a bit of guidance. If you're struggling with a particular concept, go talk to your teacher. Write out the different possible code snippets you're considering to achieve a particular task, and have him explain why they do or don't work.Have you tried sitting down, and just writing some simple code to see if you understand things. I would suggest using a language that offers a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) so that you can try things out interactively without getting bogged down. A google collab notebook, or a Jupyter notebook can be great for this.I got started writing software when I was in 4th grade on my Commodore 64. Started out just faffing around with loops to repeatedly print things like \"I am the greatest!\" on the screen. I played around with sorting algorithms. I created a program to display the Mandelbrot set (it took about 12 hours to calculate on the C64 when written in BASIC). I even learned to use raster-interrupts and bank-switching to create a double-resolution interlaced display (albeit at an eye-watering 30Hz).",

Minus the comparisons with other people, are you happy with where you're currently at in your career? If no, what do you need to do to move to the next level? As a side note, you can't really compare salaries at a 1:1 level. If you live in a lower cost of living area, 135k for a senior engineer makes total sense. If you're comparing that to what people are making in Seattle, you'll be disappointed but their cost of living is considerably higher. The median rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in Seattle is more than my mortgage for my 3 bedroom corner lot home. There's also the matter of hours worked. If you're in a job with a stable 40 hours, you might make less per year than someone working 60-80 hour weeks but ultimately more per hour.",

The chill rotations I've had you'd maybe get one off hours page every six months or so, maybe.It's more of a mixed bag for the rotations I don't like, but when I see corners being cut for deadlines and product managers being okay with that I get real nervous. I had one rotation (also at Google) where I could expect to get a 2AM incident at least a few times that would take hours to address, and I held the pager every other month. It was hell. I burned out so fast.On call bonuses were normalized at Google, I wish that was more industry standard. We essentially made half pay for the 16 off-hours on-call time (double pay for two weeks). The whole team was on the rotation, so everybody understood the responsibilities and how to prevent incidents. It was awesome.",

I had multiple instances of middle of the night calls being put on the spot in front of higher ups for unfamiliar systems. Worst case was a week after joining a new team, hadn't even gone through onboarding yet lol. The FAANG was much better. Engineering had a lot of power in determining what's actually important. So I got a lot of tickets, but they didn't have to be settled as soon as I got them. I had 2 instances of staying up overnight, and both times multiple engineers across my organization worked on the issue since it touched all of our systems.In both instances, I was expected to be near a computer or phone. Telecom you had a 15 minute window to answer a page before it's escalated to backup then manager. FAANG had a window as welp and provided me with a separate phone which helped keep me on top of oncall.",

At the same time, build security-focused projects like secure APIs, auth systems, or basic threat modeling for your existing apps. That keeps your portfolio useful..For certs, don’t rush or overspend. Start with free or low-cost learning, then one entry cert if needed. Experience and projects matter more early on...Cybersecurity is not entry level, but your CS background helps a lot.

The problem right now is that there is no strong signal you can do a job someone is actually paying for. Degrees get you past HR, but projects get you hired only if they look like real work. Generic advice like \"learn a new tech stack\", or \"biuld apps\" don't easily map to real business problems or existing teams.That said, I'd recommend doing the following: 1. Focus on one of those areas (iOS, dbs, cyber). 2. Do projects that directly replicate an existing job function. Not a cool app, but stuff that maps directly to job skills. 3. Write them up like professional work.You're not too late, but the market isn't going to meet you halfway, you have to make yourself legible as someone who can do the work. That's going to be challening, but the first task is to figure out what exactly the work even is. Use job postings, complaints, and look at the work juniors are assigned, and build a small system into a project that does that.",

Ofc a lot of folks don’t do that in 4 years either",

My 2 cents:The startup will make you better at building things quickly, give you access to way more interesting problems, and also allow you to have more responsibility than you ever would at big tech. The tradeoff is that it’s the wild west. Coding best practices, well-scoped projects, clear roadmaps, internal tooling, may be minimal or nonexistent. That’s not inherently bad, and it can make shipping much easier, but there is less support in ensuring you’re writing good code, so it can very much be a sink-or-swim environment. I have learned much more in less time at my startup than I had at my previous big tech job, but my big tech job was very important in teaching me what large-scale corporate software development looks like: what guardrails are important, what good docs and code look like, how to navigate corporate politics, etc. I also think unfortunately brand name does matter and it was helpful to get my foot in the door when I started looking for jobs, but that can be overshadowed by building cool stuff.So my main advice is to do your best to learn best practices in software development, and actively look for someone who is experienced and can mentor you.",

Or is it more involved (i.e. coding-wise, distributed systems, etc.)?It's a broad area. Anything related to infra supporting developing and running ML models is counted as ML infra. It's not all about MLOps. E.g., supporting models to run on a new type of accelerator (think about TPU, ASIC, ...), is also ML infra; code-designing software + hardware for faster network for ML workloads, ... \\> Could you explain what the day-to-day looks like? If you could also describe what a typical sprint (something like a new project task) looks like, that'd be great too.E.g., the compiler is supposed to take a model and compile it to hardware-specific code that should be able to run on a specific type of accelerator. But the model keeps crashing in the runtime --> the compiler didn't handle an edge case properly (this needs lots of efforts to repro) --> submit PR to patch the compiler --> re-compile and deploy the model.\\> a Master's/PhD necessary for this type of engineering? Personally, I am planning on attending my school's +1 Master's program, which (hopefully) will complement my knowledge/skills in this speciality.Not necessarily. But you need lots of self-learning while you work. It's unlikely a school program can cover what you need.\\> On a related note... Is this role entry-level friendly? I.e. is it something that will be extremely difficult to break into as a new grad? If so, what would the career progression look like to eventually end here?It's not very entry-level friendly. Lots of folks worked on adjacent areas (maybe non-ML) like databases, networks, compilers, before joining.\\> What type of courseload is most important? I'll be taking Distributed Systems next semester, Operating Systems in my senior year... It's admittedly quite \"late\" in my college career since I took a while trying to figure out what I wanted to do. These are recommendations that ChatGPT recommended to me but am seeking some further details from real experts and professionals.Highly dependent on what type of ML infra engineer you want to be. But generally fundamental courses like OS, compiler, database, DSA, can be very useful to help you self-learn more stuff along the way.AI can help you progress faster -- but you need to have the basics to understand what it is talking about as things can get abstract at first place.",

When I wrapped up that work-cation and got back into software dev I felt like I had new life breathed into me. Despite my skills being a bit rusty I came back overall much better than I was before the burnout, mentally a lot sharper. Over the following 7 years I was able to nearly triple my pre-burnout salary.During the work-cation time you could also do some kind of side project that you always wanted to do like game dev, some AI project, whatever cool thing. It'll keep your skills sharpened and you can actually enjoy using your skills for yourself for a bit. Put the results on your github, and then you'll have a leg to stand on for the resume gap.",

Make sure you’re getting through understanding the problems and the patterns of problems and the use cases for different data structures and algorithms. Also, write out the time/space complexity for your solution before checking it.After that, you can spend a little more time on the python syntax side. I’ve given quite a few interviews at my current company, which is a pretty well known tech company (not faang or however it’s abbreviated, now), and I’ve given passing grades to people whose code didn’t run but explained the solution, and they have been great co-workers.",

I would still require a visa to live in the US, but I've had multiple points in my life where I could have chosen to move to the US permanently. I chose to move to the UK.Dublin, Paris, and Berlin don't, imo, have a better tech scene. You get a lot more jobs and variety in London. The pay also doesn't compare and you usually have much more growth opportunities in London. I speak about Dublin from experience, I moved from there to London. The other two I've mostly seen from a distance and talking to friends. Berlin is probably the one that gets closest, but the truth is that FAANGs all have large tech offices in London, they don't all have one in Berlin. Add that to the language issue (I don't speak German) and it doesn't make much sense to move there.The US tech jobs are a much more interesting problem. The Bay Area and Seattle have objectively better tech scenes, higher salaries, and more variety in jobs. My problem with both of them (but especially the Bay) is that I do not enjoy or want to live in either of those places. I enjoy living in a city where I can walk places, where there's public transport, where there's a museum, culture, and arts scene, where it's easy to travel to other countries, and where not everything is tech.NYC would be a good option, and while the salaries aren't as good as the Bay, they're still likely better than London. I think it provides a good mix, and if I were to ever move to the US I would go there. I do still not like living in the US generally though. As I said, there's certain aspects of how European cities work that I enjoy, and to add to it, I enjoy getting plenty of days off to enjoy my free time and I feel like I have more breathing room while still finding interesting things to work for good pay. Between that and the fact that I've now established myself here and I have a friend group that I'm happy with and a flat I own, I'm unlikely to want to move.Edit: another issue with the US I forgot to mention, the immigration precarity has always been an issue for me with the country and to a degree still is. In the time I've moved to the UK, got permanent residency and citizenship, many of my friends in the US haven't been able to get permanent residency status. In that period I've not really had any prolonged periods where I can't visit family or leave the country for holidays, whereas I've had friends who weren't able to leave for **2 whole years**. Most visas you can get to move to the US can put you in that situation if you ever want to turn your status into a long-term one, and you're treated throughout a lot of the process as if you're somehow doing something wrong. It's not a situation I want to put myself in",

It's also an S-tier world city on basically every axis except the weather.The Bay Area and NYC tech scenes are bigger, and better paid, but the cost of living is a lot higher, work-life balance is nowhere near as good, and the Bay Area has a lot of groupthink and tech politics and significantly less culture and non-tech attractions. I lived in London for 20 years and had various opportunities to move - and quickly concluded that while I liked visiting SF / Bay Area just fine, I did not want to live there. I did think about NYC sometimes, but by the time I was ready to seriously contemplate leaving London, all the Trump nonsense had started and what I wanted had changed. So I went somewhere else entirely.",

The four big ones in the US: Bay Area, Pacific Northwest, NYC area, perhaps Austin area all need London people to go through an already difficult and now even more difficult US immigration system. Besides those what is there? Dublin, Paris and Berlin are downgrades from London in terms of volume of opportunities. There’s no single city in Europe, Canada or Australia actually that I think has more opportunity than London. Lots of other places are better to live in imo for quality of life btw, but if we’re talking strictly about volume of job opportunities there aren’t as many. Dubai and Singapore also have less opportunities and then India/China aren’t going to work for vast majority because of low salaries and cultural differences. I’m of Indian origin and just got back from a trip to India, it’s a fine place to live if you have an online business making an income to sustain your life there, especially if you like sunshine, but to work there, it’s not going to work for people born and raised in the west and for those wages your lifestyle would be very poor.The reality right now is tech jobs are in a precarious position all around. Outside the US, London’s probably the best, but that’s not saying much with the changing landscape with AI and lack of VC investment in anything other than AI. It’s the most stressful time to be in tech imo with respect to knowing what’s happening I’ve ever seen in my 20 year career.",

Management is a very valuable role in a company but if you are encouraging everyone to become managers for pay, value, and recognition in many companies that is just by bad management and bad leadershipThat doesn’t mean there are zero companies for which a primarily management centric view of advancement makes sense, just with the rising role of ai, technology, global competition, and flatter organizations, self directing team, etc it is becoming less and less prevalent",

If you start preparing early, build a few solid projects, and apply consistently, you’ll be in a good spot..",

If I’m not wrong, Epic systems are used by actuaries and data scientists at insurance companies to crunch numbers and derive metrics.The insurance industry is definitely not sexy. It’s boring af. But the salaries are on par with broader industry SDE salaries. So even if you are unable to move to another sexier industry, you will have a strong future in the insurance industry, if not the traditional SDE career path in a sexy tech company.",
