A common loading pattern we have been using is:- for streaming: source --> Kafka --> snowflake (snowpipe streaming to tables)- for batches: source --> AWS s3 (~lake) --> snowflake (external tables)- in both cases once in Snowflake: raw staged tables (bronze) --> structured, type-cast, deidentified views (silver) --> Kimball/star/mart views with metadata (gold)I've been liking this system so far. The key difference with streaming and batch in the above cases are that the batch method keeps the raw/bronze data in s3 via external tables, so I guess that's a \"lake\", while the streaming method loads the CDC events into a table resting in the snowflake data warehouse. We use dagster to orchestrate and dbt to run the jobs. The technologies are good - the challenges are behavioural in nature.There's probably a more consistent way to do the above, but it does work. I guess the lake/s3 component just exists because it is simple and cheap to read from some provided s3 dump than to add a \"copy into\" step. We would probably would have done the same for streaming, but snowpipe streaming is a good enough solution at the moment so we can skip a redundant intermediate load to s3.",

Model the infrastructure (make it modular and scalable), create some processes, and give power to the people within some defined boundaries. It’s more work, but I feel it’s easier — after inital cost I can go do streaming, swap out tools, optimize DB tables, create alert systems and stuff.Plus the experience managing your own files, metadata, debugging fucking notebooks is atrocious. But maybe that’s just me. I like sitting in my black terminal with a box cursor….",

I had a similar thought about a candidate that was clearly using AI to answer questions. My initial thought was to pass, but the more I thought about it the more I realized that it was old thinking and pretty hypocritical to judge someone for using AI when we as a team use it all the time and I used it to cross reference their resume to the JD and produce the questions they were answering. Ultimately I set up another call to just chat. Told them that I use AI regularly and asked what they used. I asked them about using it to help answer questions. I told them I'd like to talk about some things and just wanted their answer in their own words. It became clear that they knew what they were talking about but there was a confidence issue. I have the same thing in interviews, I often freeze in my thoughts when I should be able to easily answer. I don't know what the right thing to do is, but as of now the use of AI is so ingrained in business life how can I dismiss its use completely. I think these are conversations we need to have with recruiters and recruits.",

Second system syndrome is incredibly common at all levels.You can try to document everything, and particularly provide metrics around how things are running to make a case that it’s actually in hand. I would assume there’s a deeper issue with data access that you aren’t fully informed about, so you might not even know what you’re arguing against.Ultimately these decisions are completely out of your hands, a C-level executive that’s recently hired has absolute authority to start changing things entirely by opinion. It’s going to take several quarters for wrong decisions impact to be felt to the point of them being blamed for them.If your new CTO doesn’t buy what you’re selling, and you’re not willing to go along for the ride with an open heart, absolutely look for the quickest exit.I say all this as the C-level executive. It’s also very possible the new CTO is seeing/know something you don’t, and what you’re reacting to is the first step in a long term plan that they themselves can’t clearly articulate because they are new.If you do stay on, you should try to build a new relationship and pull in the same direction for the next year before passing judgement.

Your performance reviews are about to get worse as well, due to downward pressure to push you out. They do not have to be fair, and defiance is pointless - if the CTO wants it, a \"case\" will be built for removing you, even if it takes months or years.The safest bet is to update your resume and reach out to contacts you trust. Presumably you have those, from former coworkers happy with what you accomplished. It is far easier to change your environment than to change the nature of a CTO who is not interested in engaging with you on goals, tech, costs, etc. on their merits. I am sorry you are dealing with this, but you should not pass up outside opportunities while holding onto \"hope\" that something gets better there.",

        "body": "I don’t know the nuances of your situation, but here’s my two cents. Your manager has likely built his career and secured his position by, as you say it, running the corporate playbook. He is in meetings you are not in and has access and built in authority in a way that you do not. This gives managers a natural political advantage over their ICs - so you need to tread carefully. I would not risk overplaying your hand by going to the CTO to break out from under him unless there is a clear business need you can point to - even then this is even harder without your manager on side. I’ve worked with managers like this before, yes they suck to work with. But judging on your post and responses I think it’s very likely that your manager has marked you as someone to keep an eye on and plan against. You’ve tipped your hand by openly having conflict with them. A coup at this point will fail. This person hasn’t made it to this point just to let an IC who wants to do things their way ruin their career. If you go to your CTO and effectively say “I can’t work with this guy because he doesn’t let me operate the way I want to”, what would your CTO say? You need a better way of framing it. Also you only get one shot to pull the “change things or I’m leaving” card and you better have an offer in hand that you’d be ok taking if things didn’t go your way.",

They don't really care about new customers or cost savings, that's just how they control and direct underlings what to do. The only thing they care about is how they can directly steal even more from the company for themselves. So the only real option, as always, is to find another job.

Being dependent on a single engineer is his nightmare. You think you can take this to the cto because he smiled at you and said good work a couple of times. That’s not the case. If you wish to stay at your current place, you should stop the open conflict with your manager. Continue putting out great work, making sure you get the credit and the cto sees it. Eventually there will be an opportunity to move, either vertically or laterally. But don’t hold your breath, people like your manager often stay with a company for a long time. You’re stuck with him (and he’s with you). Your best chance is leaving while you’re ahead and have something to show for your time spent here. You can leave feedback about your manager on your way out, but don’t even think about complaining about him to the hiring managers. As far as you are concerned, things were just peachy between you.",

But here are some general pointers from when I first started that might help.\\- Learn general data engineering practices / lingo. You're going to hear things like: Data Governance, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage, Data Warehouse, ETL, ELT, Data Lake, OLAP, OLTP, Data Mesh, etc. You don't have to learn everything all at once, or even fully understand everything the first time. Start with who / what you'll work with, expand from there.\\- Learn SQL VERY well. Two sides to this: learn a dialect VERY well and learn a database implementation well. The former will help you with your day to day job as a junior. Learning how to solve common patterns, use common functions, solve common SQL problems, etc will help you for your whole career. For the latter, you would want to really be able to explain things like indexes (which ones to use, why), data storage internals, how to read execution plans and optimize, etc. This is something you should be picking up gradually throughout your career, and I would only expect more mid level / senior engineers to know more and more about these things. For a junior, just begin learning it slowly, but don't stress out too much. \\- Lots of companies are now on the cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP). If your company is one of them, you should learn the stack. Learn the services that your company is using, what role / problem it solves, and how to configure/work with it. Whatever your company uses, be it Azure Synapse/AWS Redshift for data warehousing, ADLS / AWS S3 for object storage, learn that tech deeply, learn how authorization/authentication works on your cloud platform, and those two alone will carry forth across cloud providers. Once you learn what you work with, you can slowly expand outwards if you so desire. \\- Additional point to the above, lots of companies also use Databricks / Snowflake. If applicable, learn what each of those companies provide in terms of offerings or services. IMHO learning either of these opens the door for more data engineering roles in the future.\\- Maybe a controversial tip, but as a software engineer turned data engineer, I personally still apply software engineering principals just through a data engineering lens. That means following best practices when writing clean code, working with things like CI/CD, git, code review, etc. This may seem like a no brainer, but not every shop hires data engineers from the software engineer / CS grad pipeline. Lots of DEs I knew came from data analyst or scientist positions, and had no clue of the SWE fundamentals. I think treating this job as a specialized SWE position will help you a LOT with the menial stuff, and it'll allow you to pivot if you ever want to.I omitted a lot, but I think this is good to start, and I think these are general enough to help you no matter what kind of DE position you're put into.",

I am not sure about your proficiency in either, but try to solve some difficult problems in both without using AI (or may be ask AI to generate questions for you to solve). In SQL, try to build common patterns in data engineering with some sample data - MERGE INTO, SCD Type 2, some small star schema design. In python, know common patterns used with data structures - list, dict, set and iterators. These will help you in first few months. You can slowly move towards understanding the bigger data engineering architecture - SQL Optimization techniques, ETL, Data Vault modelling. I recommend you get 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering' book and read it once in a while. Re-read the concepts again once every few months as it will add new perspectives as you gain experience. Once you master SQL and python, tools are not going to be difficult for you. You will get to see that irrespective of tool - Spark or Snowflake, Airflow or ADF (or any GUI based orchestration) - the build patterns and outcomes are almost exactly same. While you master technical things, also try to be curious about the business problem you are solving. It doesn't matter if you know 4 different tools, if you cannot answer what business problem you solved. For this, AI would be immensely helpful. Let's say someone wants to build a CRM dashboard for which you are building data model - You might hear terms like Sales Funnel or Conversion rate - Try to ask AI and get an overall perspective of the problem you are trying to solve. You will work with lot of business analysts who will be more than happy if you talk their language. These should be enough for now.",

Even with a great gym AI tool in my experience a client is only going to be able to explain about 80% of the queries they want in layman's terms. There's certain things that the client won't be able to explain without a deep understanding of the table structure because they wouldn't know to ask. It can move us as data analysts and data scientists away from the simple monotonous queries that probably make up 80% of the work, into more interesting queries and working more as a consultant/advisor to our non-technical business partners. What's going to be critical for this is that the data scientist or data analyst needs to have excellent communication skills, specifically being able to take technical subjects and communicate them clearly to non-technical people.",

Your current plan (Dagster+dbt on ECS) is the right tool for this scale.The real problem is not technical. A senior analyst from the parent company does not know how to use your stack and wants to replatform because Databricks has a schedule button he understands. That is a political problem not a tooling problem.Before you rip out six months of work, try this. The analyst needs a UI to schedule SQL. You can give him that without Databricks. Set up Airflow with the UI exposed (or use dbt Cloud if you have budget). Show him how to drop his SQL into a dbt model or an Airflow DAG. If he still cannot work with it after that, then the real conversation is whether the parent company is going to force their tooling choices down regardless of fit.Sometimes you lose these battles and the decision gets made above you. But make sure the tradeoff is clear before it happens. Databricks at your scale is expensive and you are not going to use 90 percent of what you are paying for.",

The whole \"medallion architecture\" thing is stupid. It isn't new just new names that actually causes confusion in a field that is already difficult enough. The lack of business understanding and thinking tools are the most important part of the job blows me away. I am very comfortable saying that tools are the least important part of the job. You can pick up a tool in a month or so but knowing where and how to use it will take a lot longer.The trouble is employers want a way to measure talent.

There is more to Software Engineering than backend software development and shipping code, so it really depends on what you mean by software engineering knowledge. You should still have to get requirements, build something, write tests, get feedback, provide support, maintenance, etc. I find it better to think of data engineering as a discipline or specialty of software engineering, rather than a subset. However, the other disciplines are less tool dependent, and because of that, tend to be standardized across the industry. You may find that a data platform engineer role is better fit for you if you want to solve data problems but ship code to a large codebase.",

The goal of software and data engineering has always been the movement of data. Its really just a question of who is your audience? Historically, software engineers would focus on transactional data and data folks would focus on batch or analytical. Once streaming and microservices showed up, the lines really blurred. So you could be a data engineer who does a lot of platform engineering and a lot of backend streaming, or you could be a data engineer who builds star schemas for power bi.

Larger companies have also started to build larger data teams, so it's more common to have dedicated data infrastructure teams and data modeling teams. It's very possible to have a career doing just data modeling, dbt, and Airflow. Even on the infra side, if your data is relatively small and simple, you can get a lot of work done just configuring and managing tools and services like Fivetran, dbt, and Airflow.I personally don't think data engineering (or analytics engineering) is software engineering, but there's still a lot of skillset / mindset overlap. Even if you're \"only\" doing data modeling and SQL, that process is much more rigorous than it used to be: design reviews, code reviews, source control, and established frameworks.",

Kubernetes is mostly abstracted away by managed services in most data stacks, so I would save that for later unless you are actively building infra from scratch.Starting order that made sense: Docker first. Get comfortable building containers and running data tools locally before touching anything else. The official Docker docs are solid, and TechWorld with Nana has good intro videos if you prefer something visual.For Terraform, Terraform: Up and Running by Brikman is the standard recommendation for good reason. Work through the first few chapters and deploy something real, even if it is just a storage bucket with IAM policies attached. The plan/apply/destroy muscle memory is what makes it click.For CI/CD, GitHub Actions is the lowest-friction starting point for most DE projects. Build a pipeline that runs your dbt tests and deploys on merge to main. Once you have done that once, the concepts generalize to Jenkins, GitLab CI, or whatever else you run into.Raw Kubernetes knowledge is rarely needed for DE work specifically. Most orchestration on GKE or EKS you interact with through Helm charts or managed Airflow, and the k8s internals stay hidden. Docker and Terraform solid first.",

That is all irrespective of AI.I do agree with your idea of treating metrics like APIs, that’s a really key thing to get right for AI, and you’ve got some other really good practices in there too.

Add explicit executor level signals, structured logs, per partition failure metrics, and batch level health metrics like lag spikes and sink write ratios. Treat executor errors like distributed telemetry, not exceptions. Few things like Data...Flint can help by turning raw logs and metrics into actionable observability so you actually see where things fail instead of just hoping the driver surfaces it. Once you stop expecting the driver to be your source of truth, the silent failure problem mostly disappears.",

The other is to think about distinctions between: abstraction, generalization, opacity, and other similar \"operating at high level\".Usually abstraction in engineers context means finding a simplifying solution over otherwise individuated problems. Example, any math theorem you learned in school, or theory in engineering. So the abstractions applicability is limited to the details covered.Thus how abstract is your problem space and what are the details, in rough terms it's variety. Then do the solving & problem abstractions vary in requisite ways?So to answer, if you are truly lost in core syntax and implements like debugging, you don't fully know the abstraction. But does not mean anyone cannot use the abstractions, just being general to a problem or solution. With all the abstractions these days, you won't know everything and a general knowledge is often where one starts.Lastly your final questions around AI model roles, my feel this is opacity not (your) competence. The core vector and matrix abstractions in AI and context models are not that deep, nor new. But given they're \"cutting edge\"-ness often these models are purposefully opaque. So if you simply cannot see detail, don't blame your abstraction skills lol",

But to answer the part that has not been answered here yet, normalization does save space when contrasted with raw data entering the transactional system, e.g. displayed or entered at Point of Sales terminal, as well as with denormalized data in a DWH. That is not the point however, as storage has grown and cheapened even for on prem systems, since normalization was invented. The point is speed and scaling the write operations. When yoyr transactional (e.g. sales) system has to record hundreds and thousands of items scanned, or ordered online every second, it doesn't have time to repeatedly write the customer address, or name in each row of a big table. Rather thatbinfo is saved once in a normalized table and its id is used in each row representing item bought.In analytical (dwh) workloads, in contrast, you want fast bulk reads of whole chunks of a table, and each join is a burden for the analytical system, while storage and write speed are more relaxed",

I mean, PostGIS is everywhere, they tend to use very domain-specific fileformats (shapefiles, COGs, geojson) and datatypes (geometries, WKT, WKB). Oh, and projections gave me a headache at first.In addition, at least where I am, remote sensing companies mostly seem to be quite small / young and often lack people that can look at properly scaling things and handling the data. So I'd say being a GIS-DE would make you quite marketable!Good luck dude!",

There aren't a ton of geospatial DE jobs but then again not that many people have that intersection of skills. It is a niche of DE but an important and interesting one, I think you should lean more into that side of things and find jobs there. Create some dummy projects showing off your skills with Vector and Raster data, intersect that with H3/s2 cells at different aggregations. Connect this with real world data like open street maps. You can explore using duckdb/bigquery geospatial functions. Learn about Apache Sedona and maybe try to set it up and get AI to help guide you along and learn. Use tools like OpenCode or ClaudeCode to start building and then ask a lot of questions and make it explain things to you. Then you can have some projects on your github and start applying for the smaller geospatial jobs. I feel like there is less competition for those and not the 1000+ applicants problem for the more promoted posts on linkedin.",

        "body": "Disclaimer: I’m a cofounder of Bruin, so take this with that context. My favourite topic these days :)I don’t think “100% self-healing pipelines” exist in the way vendors describe them.If a SaaS provider completely restructures their API or deprecates an endpoint, no AI magically understands your business intent. If a column disappears, the system doesn’t know whether you want to drop it, replace it, backfill it, or redesign downstream logic. That’s not a syntax problem. That’s a decision problem. (Which can be taken by AI, but most of the time it doesn't have enough context)Automatic retries and exponential backoff are not self-healing. That’s just basic resilience. Even auto schema detection only gets you part of the way.What I *have* seen work in practice is more boring and more controlled:1. Detect the break and narrow down what changed.2. Create a new branch.3. Spin up a sandbox data environment for that branch.4. Let an agent attempt a fix there.5. Run tests and generate an impact summary.6. Ask a human to approve before touching prod.That’s not some magical self-repair system. It’s letting a machine try a fix somewhere safe and asking you before it does anything risky.If a vendor claims it can fully adapt to major SaaS API changes with zero review, I’d be skeptical. Skipping isolation and approval is how you corrupt downstream models quietly.Even though I think Airflow is not the best tool for AI, I also don’t think this is really about Airflow vs X vs Y. It’s more about whether your stack is reproducible and easy to run in isolation. Systems that are CLI-friendly and easy to spin up in a sandbox are much easier to automate safely. Highly stateful setups are just harder for any automation to reason about.So for me the answer is: true self-healing? Naah, we're not there yet. AI-assisted repair with guardrails? Yes, it works. It makes the boring parts of your job much more easier.",

Those requests pile up faster than before because the friction on their side dropped but ours did not.The other thing is the quality of what lands. When devs can crank out features with AI help they sometimes skip the part where they talk to you about how the data should flow. You get surprised by schema changes or new tables that were not designed with downstream use in mind. Documentation does not keep up either.What helped us was requiring a data impact checklist before any feature launch and making schema changes part of the same PR review process as code. Slows them down a bit but prevents the mess from landing in production first.",

Even scala, for good and bad, isnt a focus much in the Spark space where Python is still king. Is it good to look into these languages and understand them? I think so. I have had on countless times needing data from the software engineering team, or need to understand how the function of said data works and its way easier for me to just see the endpoint and understand what it's doing. Sometimes you get crap data and you need to identify why the data is crap. It isnt often, but it has happened a few times where it's useful. Also, if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to build out REST APIs for any reason, while you can certainly use django, and I do like me some django, you might be forced to make them in .NET or Java or Rails or whatever it may be that the company dictates. I have built many personal projects using all sorts of programming languages just on the sheer fact it allows me to understand the inner workings of the data I am getting. That has allowed me to have deeper conversations with the SWE team for when and how they produce data. TLDR, I think its good idea to understand it, and makes you a better DE, but is it necessary? I dont think so at all.",

I've been on both sides of the river: SWE and DE, but haven't come across a scenario like this, not that it's a really complicated one.My tradeoff lies between the complexity of querying to the delta table for the ops team versus duplicating data on SQL server while making it easier for them to read it.",

But, I’m not sure why you care about it being the same unless you are trying to build dbt pipelines in the lower environments that you want to just promote to the upper environments. If that’s the case, then your business needs to find or create a way to enforce data contracts with the source data properly. Maybe you could try using form submissions that convert to an ingestible file type on the backend and ingest those instead of just allowing users to submit their own CSVs?Edit: clarity and spelling",

Alerting on those meant we caught issues within minutes of ingestion rather than days later when someone noticed a dashboard looked wrong.The other thing was making rollback trivial. If bad data gets through, can you restore the table to its previous state in under five minutes? If the answer is no, thats probably higher leverage than trying to make dev look more like prod.Still doesnt solve the underlying chaos of user uploaded files, but at least you stop pretending your lower environments prove anything about production behavior.",

SCD means “slowing changing dimension” and is a concept coined by Ralph Kimball to denote capturing versions of a dimension.

        "body": "Hi, I work at LanceDB but want to add a bit of detail here. Lance's file format is versioned, with the current default version being 2.0. 2.1 is already out there and is going to be the default soon, and 2.2 is also implemented and in the testing phase. The choice of file format used can impact the level of compression and performance you see, as the format is continually being improved.Re: performance, the F3 paper ([https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf)) shows numbers comparing Lance vs. other file formats and this is a good source of information (outside of the LanceDB team) in terms of scan and random access throughput (it shows that Lance is the fastest). The compression ratio shown in the paper is the worst, but the paper benchmarked against an old version of Lance (pre 2.0).From a roadmap perspective, Lance file format 2.2 that will come out soon has significantly more compression algorithms implemented, with some performance improvements as well. So more numbers will be published soon once that's out.Re: your performance observations, a) the version of the file format used matter, and b) the data types may not have the best compression ratios for that file version used. In LanceDB's internal suite, we regularly test against these modalities: long-form text, images and video blobs. For these cases, the write amplification in Parquet due to row groups is significant (which is the reason Lance was created in the first place). That said, even for conventional tabular data types (floats, booleans, etc.), Lance should perform on par with or better than Parquet, no matter the scale of the dataset. If you're getting sufficient performance out of Parquet, then well and good, in the end, what works best in practice is all that's needed!",

And building a usage graph is far from trivial. There are countless ways to write SQL that ultimately accomplish the same thing. On top of that, every tool interprets queries differently, since each has its own parsing logic and assumptions. Unless you have the first-hand control over the execution engine itself, extracting things like:* Column usage and aliasestypically means parsing user-written input (i.e SQL query) which comes with countless edge cases. So the solution you're coming up ideally has to be something that can be plugged into the compute engine itself .i.e. OpenLineage is taking this approach for collecting lineage information by integrating directly with various compute engines rather than relying solely on query parsing.I would say go for it and no one had a good solution for it yet afaik. Ultimately, the value comes down to what kind of usage graph you're building and how it leads to actionable insights. That’s challenging because interpretation itself is dynamic.",

The gap between what is documented & what is actually used, is a massive headache, so your head is in the exact right place.u/Johnlee01223 is totally right about the complexity, though, building a custom usage graph means parsing millions of messy SQL queries. It turns into an edge case nightmare real quick, and parsing all those logs at scale can easily nuke your warehouse compute budget.tbh, to save you from reinventing the wheel, DataHub actually has this built in natively. It hooks directly into BigQuery (`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`) or Snowflake (`QUERY_HISTORY`) and automatically translates those raw logs into the usage graph you're prototyping, mapping out column level lineage, real join relationships, and showing exactly who is querying what.To keep the compute overhead low, we use server side query pushdowns to filter out high volume bot or service account traffic before it ever hits the parser.If you're curious how the architecture works or what the output looks like, check this quick breakdown [Dataset Usage & Query History docs](https://docs.datahub.com/docs/features/dataset-usage-and-query-history).btw, which warehouse are you testing your prototype on right now? I can point you to the exact docs for it, happy to chat more on this..",

But think of it this way: Modeling is the bridge. Whether you’re a DE or an Analyst, understanding how to structure data for value is what separates you from the pack.To move fast, use Claude/AI for the boilerplate. You'll be surprised how fast it'll go. Have it write the ingestion scripts, then ask it to explain *why* it chose a specific schema and made the decisions. Focus on the architecture, not the syntax. You need to understand the why across all of the decisions; this is very important. This gives you a ton of experience.For a project, just use a public API like NYC Open Data (Citibike)**.**  \"Which stations run out of bikes during Monday rush hour?**\"** . Collect the data, model it, and show some insights to answer that question. Then go a step further, do holidays change the trend? What about YOY growth?This isn't 'extra' work; it’s proving you're a partner who builds systems that actually solve problems. That’s what gets you hired whether you go for DE or analyst.",

It actually makes me write better code when doing DE stuff, though nowadays copilot writes 95% of my codes. I use fastapi and mysql so maybe different than what you do. Job wise, backend interviews are more competitive in my experience. Not because it’s harder but because there are a lot more people applying and surely you wont be the best",

It allows you to virtualise the parquet files (and other sources) as a single db table (recent iterations also work with Delta tables with limited features, but I believe pushdown and partition pruning are supported) which removes the need to have the separate staging layer. I then just set it up with ‘staging’ model files which query the external table and set the right column types because it will do things like read your columns that are supposed to be CHAR(8) as VARCHAR(MAX) since most flavours of parquet that I’m aware don’t have that extra column metadata, and the rest of the project builds from there as normal. I had a similar thought process while I was designing this in terms of it enabling an easier transition to a proper lakehouse architecture in future, and it does help a bit with managing schema drift, but for an established DWH I’d be doubtful about whether the juice is worth the squeeze - the only reason I did it is because everything is new.",

We also have 20-40 api scripts through azure functions ingesting to bronze prod. And a couple of bigger source systems that ADFs copy activity handles.

I ran into an issue using Linked Server in the dev dbt env as I cant reference it cleanly (different SQL Server on VM). As its a 4 part identifier. [Linked Server].[BronzeDB].[schema].table_name and dbt expects DB.schema.table_name Also I wont mind at the end if in the Source System of yesterdays data smth breaks. I would simply handle it with either a blue/green deployment and more precisely simply not updating the gold (presentation layer) if anything in bronze or silver broke. I am playing around with polybase rn tho and a data lake solution possibly as the linked server setup doesnt really work cleanly.",

        "body": "I have been tasked with similar issues but in way less complex environments, and I don't envy you on this. But it can be fun to dive in, and play Sherlock Holmes.I would start simple, and forget about the 350+ pipelines. Start by diving into the easy places to get a head start and list all the problems you've found to kind of semi-cover your ass and set expectations:* Sporadic errors* Data loss on type conversions, * Lineage tool needs to fed better data or it is useless for this purpose.I would write something up, saying that the first 2 points must be fixed in order to get reliable result and success. How far have you found the first 2 points in your flow? If it is near the end, get some colleague to focus on fixing this, while you audit numbers earlier in the pipeline. Get someone else to fix it anyway, you focus on auditing data at other places.The 3rd point about lineage tool is not relevant yet. If you don't find a few clear errors that fixes stuff down the line, and you must go detailed through almost all flows as your last resort, the lineage tool *must* be improved and to be relied on. That is probably probably not a small task in itself, and there's likely a reason it is superficially setup as is.As for the actual data hunt; you most likely have already done so, but compare the 2 curated tables. If they are identical you know to whether to go forward or backwards in your flows for errors. If you need to go back in your flows, make an audit somewhere in the middle between the source and curated tables of going backwards. Does data match, does transformations makes sense. Then you do the same, figure out if you need to go forward/backward again. Audit somewhere in the middle again so you don't go through all steps. Break down your audit spots, and focus on 2 to 5 KPI's and the data they rely on. Document your code to easily reproduce the check at different spots for that part of the data, so you can show others.And make those others quickly check you're on the right path, and that they agree you compare the proper data, so a misunderstanding does not lead astray.Depending on urgency and resources available, I would show findings and clearly point out, that it doesn't make sense to compare and audit those KPI's if you can't trust the data in the first place. Suggest a plan, split up the tasks. Whether you are solo or can get help from team mates, don't do a bit of data loss fix, and then some audit, and then some check on sporadic errors, back and forth, etc. In all 3 tasks there's a bunch of rabbit holes to dive into, and I at least had trouble keeping a mental overview on the project itself and its progress while jumping from rabbit hole to rabbit hole. Almost fixing almost all problems at once, so the puzzle pieces suddenly match perfect at the same time hasn't happened for me, at least. And it sounded like a simpler setup than yours. Now it became quite long, TL;DR, break stuff down, audit certain data for certain KPI's midway though the flow, and midway from last checkpoint, etc. Focus on specifics tasks, don't do everything at the same time, and then you've got this, as long as you don't let yourself get bullied on timelines. Stand up for yourself, and let management know if you've discovered deeper problems, which requires more time than initially expected.",

In Iceberg, the more standard approach is to run DQ checks per snapshot, which can be done periodically by querying the Iceberg snapshots table",

I can easily add or modify these scripts using a regular text file and put the fields I want in with {{ label }} tags and it will replace them with customer record data. I can just add a template file to a directory and it'll use it. That builds the texts I can bulk or individually send out. As I work, it dynamically keeps track of my availability across the day and updates the scripts for me on the fly as my schedule fills up.Although it has some required fields in the single SQLite table it uses, like first name, last name, phone, status, but other than that, it can import any csv file with at least those field names into it and it'll just slurp up whatever and show the fields from the csv in the GUI. It also has a customized note taking page where I can put the customer's data into a UI and it'll save is as a json document in a directory and attach the name of that file to the client record. That document is also a json document, so I can modify it without coding anything and those fields in the notes are not on the client record directly and they don't need to be. I could of course add them later to any data structure I want if I want to.Also, now I can parse PDF files for data, match them to a record and update the database and attach the now renamed pdf file to that client and open it in a window from the gui. I can also create a new record if one doesn't exist, or just fail and spit out a not found. Whatever I need it to do at the time.That pdf view window dynamically changes to the corresponding file if I change customers in the gui by selecting, hitting the next or previous client or page buttons, and doesn't break if it's not there, it just happily displays there's no pdf file found for that one.It also has color themes, a dark, light, slate, blue and pink themes. These are CSS files and if you want to add one you just drop it in by the name light.css, dark.css into a config directory and it'll pick it up and let you select that from the menu and save it so it always uses that theme until you change it again, with all the other config options that you set as well. They all stay active until changed across runs.It can build lists I can use for bulk texts or anything else I can dream up for it. I can just code that in.As I built it and made changes, I just kept adding the ability to customize it from the way it used to work, to the new capability. So, it basically just gets more and more powerful over time. Everything it could ever do, it can still do perfectly fine.It's awesome and it's 100% mine, 100% free, and 100% not on the cloud, it doesn't even use a web browser either, although it easily could, but I like that it doesn't for now.Would it pass corporate IT coding standards. NOPE! I wrote them so I know, NOPE! and I like it that way.Is it easy to use - Yep.Is it user friendly - Nope.Is it well documented - other than the code is clearly written - NOPE. lolThat's (Hell\\^Nope)Did I vide code it? Kinda. I've got plenty of experience writing software. Big software. No direct experience writing anything quite like this before. It's got the simplest data model I've ever used in any DB lol. There's a lot of room for more things it could do here in the future if I get around to needing it. For now, I just don't.I started with free AI because I didn't know a some of the available API's and I wanted to try them out. I went through a few of these before I found one I liked and wanted to work with. AI got me off the ground with them,I got amazingly far down the line of a prototype and before I knew it, I had something basically working. As I kept adding more capability however, it quickly ran out of context area and now gets lost and makes so may errors and just poor coding choices I rarely use it anymore. The cool thing is I don't really need it now. I learned the API I landed on and I'm comfortable taking it from here. I also got a very good idea of what AI can and can't do these days as well.Replace coders and people with technical skills? Maybe some junior slog roles. It can be used to write slog job automation that would have otherwise been way out of scope and not cost effective.What are you going to replace them with? Don't even tell me business analysts. Don't even think about telling me corporate executives or nepo babies. They don't know their ass from a hole in the ground and AI isn't going to help for that. They can't bully a robot caddie into ignoring that extra swing and a miss. I wonder how they make it through the day without dying.",

In many segments you focus on one solutions such as git. However you should make a point to highlight a number of similar systems. The idea is to make students aware that there are many options. Covering the common solution is find after highlighting that students have lots of options. I actually like that GIT and VIM coverage as good introductions.2. I'm still of the opinion that everyone needs to learn VIM, as a command line tool, to some extent. It is the VIM is everywhere base reality. However in the modern world using the command line environment with a GUI editor of choice might lead to more productive students. I'm not even sure students grasp that command line control can be mixed with GUI apps. This may be personal thing but I find GUI based editors far more productive. So in the same regards a paragraph that list out a few alternative command line an and GUI editors to inform students makes sense.3. A port for compiled languages or an additional segment within this package, would be useful for programs that don't use Python. A focus on C++ would be advisable as the use of GCC is similar for many languages. The idea is not to teach the language, but to teach how programs are built with compilers. Like I said only a very brief view of this site, but guys it looks like it covers much of which sidelines students at the start. In fact this sort of stuff should be covered in a high school prep course.",

You cant optimize \"after you're done\", there wont be anyone paying your time to do that if it already works.You need to clean it as you go, and your starting state is increasingly better with experience; not a single giant god-file of procedural code.That then takes you to the next trap. Once you've finalized one use-case, you want to refactor it, because now you can do it \"better\". That's a trap, you'll need to learn to accept \"good enough\" somewhere along the way and take your lessons to the next project instead of getting stuck in this loop.With that in mind, I actually think this is bad advice. I prefer devs who think a little before coding. Knowing your context boundaries can already help you structure your implementation greatly; starting with something like hexagonal is not slow anymore, it's fast and you can use scaffolders for it; openapi generators if you're using good structure will also accelerate API exposure AND consumption; so you arent over-engineering it if it took you 1 hour to setup and saved you 50 hours of refactors or bug-hunting as you implement, while simultaneously making it easier to change.You write code once and read it 100 times. Optimize for readability from the get-go, and continuously improve as you go.17YOE here.",

They correlate, but they're not the same thing.Math gives you vocabulary (sets, functions, proofs) and trains abstract reasoning. But the specific skill of \"I have a complex problem — how do I break it into tractable parts?\" is best built by solving a lot of programming problems with deliberate reflection, not by restarting algebra.Follow the math list others recommended — it's solid. But in parallel: do structured problem sets (Exercism, Advent of Code easy levels) and after each one, write out in plain English how you decomposed the problem before you touched code. That explicit practice of \"problem → sub-problems → approach\" will do more for your logical thinking than math alone, faster.",

Get error reporting setup. - From HTML, learn [templating](https://phptherightway.com/#templating). - Learn proper routing using urls vs direct file links. Introducing HTTP, like 404 Not found. - Learn routing with HTTP methods using forms (`GET /form` & `POST /form`). Starts the thinking in \"MVC\" & \"Restful\" like patterns. - Learn about validating (not sanitizing) data, returning early, sending error messages to the template with HTTP response codes. - Learn about databases (using SQLite, less setup) to populate & read data. - Next would be refactoring to smaller testable functions (Are you receiving the data (input or code to function) you need? Are you getting the output you expect?), - Then OOP and better project structure. - Try this out using the common beginner User Registration/Login projects and learn about password_* functions (vs md5, sha1, etc), etc.A beginner would then be comfortable getting into current concepts found in libraries and frameworks.See how this was more focused to learning based on experience?",

Imagine us telling \"Yeah, learn that Go.\" You'll learn it. Nobody in your area is developing his stuff in Go. Countries differ, job markets differ. What is in use in one place can be not in demand in another place.Now, to your questions:1)Backend is backend. If you are targeting web application development you won't be using any other math than some simple primary school math. And sometimes even not that. There won't be any difference between picking Python or Java or PHP or something else. If you have to add up your end-user's monthly bills you will use a simple primary school math.The only thing you do have to look into is Boolean algebra. AND, OR, NOT and the combinations of these in IF/ELSE blocks. To decide how the process flow will switch based on one or another criteria. But you should have studied it during your degree studies. In Discrete Mathematics course or such.You'll need more math in data science.2)Pick the backend language based on job offers in your area. Sure, you can pick some language that less juniors are using... but you won't be using it at all if there is no demand after it.3)If you are going to work in web application development you'll need SQL and git for sure. Linux can come useful when having to do some devops. But also useful in general. Stuff more often than not just work when working in a Linux or a Mac. In Windows you have to figure out how to get it working in your WSL and stuff.No idea about boot.dev. But as you already have a degree then whichever bootcamp you are picking, should just remind you what you were studying 7 years ago.You do need OOP and DSA but that should also be covered by your degree studies, already. It won't be anything new. Just a refreshment course for you.Now, when it comes to remote jobs then there you should be less optimistic. Better target local office jobs. At least where I live (a country in Europe) they are more often expecting the new junior to show up in the office. For onboarding, for mentoring, etc. It is a bit risky to let a new junior to work remotely on his own. Not saying that there won't be any remote jobs, for you, but expect to find an office job before finding a remote job.And when it comes to a saturation then a web application development in general is a saturated field. Does not matter if you are picking Python, Java, Go, PHP or something else. Because everybody is \"speedrunning\" and trying to get a job fast. And a web application development has its entry barrier lower than in data science and such, where one might need more theoretical knowledge in things.",

The intense math in Python comes in AI and data science, which you can totally stay away from. Java isnt having less math than Python; theyre pretty much the same in this aspect.2. Should you pivot to Java to avoid Python saturation?Java is definitely a good choice in enterprises, but changing to it now would stop you from moving forward fast. What is more important is if you can build backend systems and talk about them. After your gaining understanding of backend fundamentals, it will be very easy for you to learn Java.3. Should you stick with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) and learn OOP, DSA, Linux, SQL, and Git?Yup... Those are good to have backend skills. SQL, Git, Linux, and backend architecture are the things used all the time in real jobs and will make you employable no matter the language.The most significant factor is practical experience.

        "body": "I wouldn't worry about math too much, nor choose a language based on that. The business domain will determine that, not the language. And the vast bulk of programming jobs out there don't require much math. It's a misconception that all of us programmers are doing lots of math.The most math you may benefit from is boolean algebra (and simple arithmetic), and that's very easy and fast to learn and has some payoff for working with logic in code. See the first two chapters of \"How to Prove It\", he covers the topic really well and it's a breeze.Another good topic, related to logic, is how numbers are represented in a computer in general with a \"finite number system\", and in various languages more specifically (integer vs. float vs. double, vs. BigInteger/BigFloat [using memory to sidestep the limitations on the primitive data types]), and to understand the pros and cons of the common approaches. You should try to come away with a good working intuition, e.g. when to use an integer vs. a float/double based on the actual numbers you're working with, how floating-point numbers increasingly lose precision in the integers as they get larger, the kinds of problems you can run into when FP values are part of boolean expressions, i.e. exact equality checks, due to floating-point rounding error (and also how errors can creep in based on how you group operations on numbers of various magnitudes).Java is a great language. Personally I would choose a language based on the job market, not based on your perception of Python seeming easier to use. IMO it would actually be beneficial to confront that \"strictness\" sooner than later. That strictness you perceive is generally a good thing, it's an up-front cost that pays off in a bunch of good ways. With the exception of `var`, it generally gives good visibility on expected types (and you can always use the IDE to help inspect `var` variables). Types give you something firm to latch onto when reasoning about code at development time and debugging time. Python (AFAIK) has made improvements here, but I don't know the current state of things, how ergonomic it all is, and how good the tooling is. Maybe it's great, I have no idea. But Java is pretty decent in this regard. Anyway, types relate to logic, particularly when using the primitive data types, as you can abstractly think of the types as the sets of all possible values (restricted by the fact that the computer is finite).With DSA stuff, I have no knowledge of boot.dev, but I'd probably just think of it as a potential problem bank. With DSA, you want to get exposure to various categories of problems, regardless of where you got the problems from. DSA problems are all scoped down majorly, so it generally doesn't matter where you're getting them from (as long as they're not poorly written). A key though is being able to check your solution for correctness. If boot.dev lets you _run_ your solutions to see whether it passes or fails, and on which inputs, then that's great. Otherwise, platforms like LeetCode can do that (or see Neetcode for a narrower list). With these, focus on quality over quantity. There are more problems than you realistically have time to do, and that's fine. If you do one problem from each fundamental category, that's an awesome start. Hopefully boot.dev's problem set gives you a diverse sampling.Other than that, a key for your career in programming is to actually build small projects of your own choosing on your own time, because you need exposure to the \"problem-solving cycle\". Getting real projects done can be an arduous process of cycling over and over through planning, coding, verifying, and repeating until you reach some clearly defined \"done\" state. At times it can be a psychological thriller. Anyway, DSA won't help you much here - DSA may have some payoff for when it comes time to implement code and not make as many silly mistakes, like \"off-by-one\" issues (or when it comes time to vet an LLM's output, if you choose to use them to actually write code [which I don't recommend doing while you're _learning_, because you really want to learn from the ground up so you can adequately vet their output and more confidently/quickly accept or reject or modify/refactor their output]). LLMs can be useful, but whatever you do, you have to protect your own mental clarity and attention span - LLMs can easily exhaust it and cause more trouble than they're worth, depending on your skill level and how and when you use them.In the process of working on projects, ideally you also learn more and more about how to build whole systems, rather than just \"code\". This is why working \"full-stack\" on your own can be a good idea, even if you don't actually work in a role that is itself full-stack - it gives you exposure to a broader set of concerns that are all part of the building the whole system. Your value to a software company will be your ability to implement systems or at least your part of them, and hopefully in a thoughtful way that minimizes friction for your teammates.",

After that id start to expand. Something front end. Probably react / node. Then I’d hook that up to my back end thing I’d built. Learn things like responsive design by trying to run your front end in things like a mobile or tablet emulatorAgain have that checkin and deploy functionality all automated. And then I’d look at replicating my back end code with Python. So I can see the difference between the two languages. Then take all that database code and replace it with an ORM doing the same thing in a new branch. Compare how the two perform and the differences you get in things like execution plans etc. understand what the ORM generates vs what you did. Amongst that I’d study DS&A and Design patterns. Why all this?Because it will give you experience with tech that is used in enterprise and also in smaller startups, you get full stack experience and you have options then to deeper dive into either language if you want to focus on one area or another. Learning sql directly rather than just ORMs is something people miss these days and very important for debugging. And the cloud / infrastructure stuff is something which will help you later in your career and interviewing. It helps knowing what’s out there when you need to do system design interviews.",

Then, to make yourself even more valuable, learn how to build a data warehouse and the pipelines involved in that.I still do a ton of coding.

You need people flexible enough to use different languages and are comfortable on different databases.On a parallel track to this - monitoring. Large orgs will want visibly into all of this.

And I mean any help, mental, development, hobby, what ever it takes to not spiral out of control. Also, this is how you grow... by learning new things. That's why I switched teams a year ago. I felt like I had plateaued where I was after 7 years. I was afraid I had stagnated. When an opportunity came up to change to a new area, I leapt... with out thinking it through. Part of me regrets it because there was another opportunity that might have worked better, but overall, I'm good with where I am... I kind of like not having a ton of meetings. :P",

Improve on what your work-related issues are. Make a plan, to the things that will help you the most first, just to calm yourself a bit more at work. Stress is the worst thing ever to have when problem solving, so I’d work on whatever stresses me the most.Use resources to get yourself up to speed fast. This is one place I enjoy AI even though it might not be perfect. I can get a TL;DR version things, or have it question my planning.One of the most important things for me has been to split up problems at work into tasks and be organised.The difference between that and jumping into coding is massive for me, unless I do something I already know a lot. I had issues with sleep apnea and it was the only way I was productive.Good fundamentals. Good problem solving. Good productivity organisation.You’ll do fine! If you like books on the topic I’d recommend Chris Bailey, his book on focus called «Hyperfocus» helped me out a lot.",

(Of course it depends on the use case what/how it makes most sense).And so on...For any actually \"extreme\" optimizations, first think really hard if you really need it.

Those are tools that let you build for multiple platforms using JavaScript. The same is true for Capacitor. These tools make more sense if you already have a solid grasp of web development.In regard to Java vs. Kotlin, you'd be using Kotlin. Java usage has mostly shifted into development of the actual Android OS itself, with Kotlin becoming the preferred language for apps, and Kotlin is way more pleasant to work with.So, it's hard to give a strong recommendation without a better understanding of what you're interested in and what you are trying to pursue. If your goal is to become a web developer who also builds mobile (and desktop) apps, then I'd pick Tauri (personally) or React Native (which is technically better, since it produces real native apps, with real native bindings).If you're starting from scratch and don't really care one way or the other, then Kotlin with Android Studio is probably the more natural choice.Beyond that, you can also build apps for every major operating system using C#/.NET, which is a nice middle ground. Colleges are more likely to teach C#, and a lot of enterprise software is built on C#/.NET. The same team that created TypeScript also created C#, so the two languages play nicely together as well (and have a lot of the same features) - which is a good lead-in to web development.And then there's Dart/Flutter, which I wouldn't recommend (I usually recommend against it), but it is intended for making cross-platform development \"easier\", so as a beginner, it'd be easier to pick up (at first).Point being... you can build mobile apps in whatever you want. So, it's more about your overall interests/pursuits - they typically define which approach you'd pick.",

For c# / visual studio I use windows for python / nvim I use Linux.To your questions:- windows is easier to learn on (compared to linux it is an os designed for less technical people). That said if you are serious about programming 90% chance you will have to learn Linux in some capacity anyways. - windows is easier for tool setup at the beginning, at a certain point it flips. The more consumery the tool the more the easy of use starts to favor Linux. In my experience windows has nicer GUI tools and Linux has (significantly) nicer CLI/TUI tools- windows + wsl. I write a lot of c# and play video games, so pure Linux is a nonstarter. Dual booting adds way too much friction. WSL is the best of both worlds - Linux cli + windows gui. - yes. A lot if not most server-based software runs on Linux via vms and containers. A lot of automation and build tools also run on Linux. Familiarity with the system is a huge boon. - it's good enough for me. I use it both at home and at work. Some tools I use, fwiw: git, tmux, c#, ts, python, rust, nvim, vs, vscode, docker, K8s, k9s, ansible, terraform. I use all of those in wsl except visual studio. Modern wsl networking is pretty seamless. I can run a postgres db in docker desktop, a .NET backend in visual studio and a next.js frontend in wsl and have everything talk to eachother just using localhost urls.",

Instead of asking “what should I build,” try “what do I repeat every week that’s mildly inefficient?” Even if a better tool already exists, rebuilding a tiny version yourself forces you to understand how it works under the hood.Also, don’t think of projects as products. Think of them as experiments. Recreate a simple version of a tool you use. Add one feature it doesn’t have. Break it on purpose and fix it. That’s where the learning actually happens.Your website is already a great start. If you’re comfortable with HTML and CSS, maybe add a small interactive feature with JavaScript, like a habit tracker or a mini dashboard.

I'd say that the software developers (professional or not) who do it (perhaps also) as a hobby, are the best developers. This is because the people who are the most interested in the field, are likely to be better at it than those who are not. And if you're interested in it, it is probably a hobby of yours, even if you do it professionally also.I sometimes hear the question \"Can a software developer be self-taught?\", and I'm usually like... who the f--- *isn't* self-taught in this industry? I mean, if you're interested in software development, did you seriously *wait* to start doing it until college? I started with BASIC on the Commodore 64 when I was 12 years old. Switched to C at around 17 years old. In college, I had to show our *teacher* how to implement linked lists (not because I was good, but because he was inexperienced with C). Sure, there were things I learned in college which I probably wouldn't have learned otherwise - or at least not as soon - for example, SQL, and other things which I found boring. But all the advanced stuff I learned on my own, because I wasn't going to sit around waiting for college to finally get around to teaching the stuff I was interested in.So, yes! You can definitely learn software development as a hobby only. I know things are more complex now than when I was in school, but on the other hand there are so much more resources available for free now. Back in the 90's when I got started, while the net was around, there wasn't as much content as there is now. For most things I wanted to learn, I'd order an O'Reilly book. You don't have to do that anymore.Here's what I would do if I were you. Do some tutorials, but don't *only* do tutorials. Find something simple to build - something you *want* to build. And I do mean simple - really simple at first. I started with text games like \"Guess my number\" - \"Your guess is too high, try again\", and so on. You don't need graphics. Just find something that interests you.And when you get stuck - google it, ask an AI - not to do it for you, but to *teach* you how to do it - or come here, and ask us. Since you're not trying to do this professionally, only because it's fun, you don't have to stress about it. Just have fun with it.Good luck!",

Are you working on a CRUD app? A REST API?

Generic code is reusable code. DRY up your code.. Do Not Repeat Yourself.A very simple way to approach this would be \"let's write the code in a way such that making a change here, does not break or affect code over here\".If you break something else while cleaning something up, that might actually be a good thing, because you proactively addressed another potential bug in the future, and made your code more resilient in the process.Writing test cases can also help tremendously toward building repeatable approaches and also to ensure your code does not break again due to some change later on.",

But honestly, having to mutate an array while iterating through it, should NEVER be an excuse for using a traditional for-loop. Always use the foreach-version if you intend to iterate through an entire list, no matter the language. The only reason to use the traditional for-loop would be when you don't want to iterate exactly N times, but some other arbitrary number.And also you rarely want to mutate an existing array, most of the time you would want a new array with a different set of elements, created by filtering the existing array or something like that.And if not, most languages also have methods specifically for removing elements from arrays depending on certain criteria.",

        "body": "Have you tried using a fake instead of a mock?As an example, let's suppose you're mocking a storage layer, where your main class saves data. You unit test a function and you assert that when you tell it to do a series of operations and then save, it should write A, B, and then C to the storage layer.Now you change the code around and it outputs C, B, and then A to the storage layer. Your test fails because the mock was expecting calls in a specific order. Or maybe it's more complex, like now it write A and B in one transaction and then C in another transaction.It can be really hard to express in a mocking framework the idea that A, B, and C need to be saved, but the order and number of calls doesn't matter.So instead, write a \"fake\". A fake is a tiny, trivial implementation of the storage layer's interfaec, maybe it just keeps track of the objects that were saved in a HashMap or a sorted list.Instead of asserting that certain methods were called in a certain order, have your method write to the fake storage layer, then fetch the list of things written to the fake storage layer and assert that A, B, and C are in them.Now your code asserts that the end result is correct without being nearly as tightly coupled to the implementation details. Any sequence of operations that results in the correct output will pass.",

        "body": "I have done many lectures on this subject, which are difficult to summarize in a Reddit comment, but I'll do my best.**What to test**Each unit of code has a contract. Input: it expects specific parameters of certain types and/or a specific starting state. Output: it returns a specific type and/or changes states. When choosing what to test, you want to test only public methods, whose contracts are not expected to change frequently. Do not test private methods directly unless they contain something particularly complicated. In that case, try to refactor the complicated bits into separate pure functions to reduce churn during later refactoring.You also want to design and edit your code in a way that avoids changing contracts unnecessarily. For example, add new parameters to the end of the list and make them optional, preserving the previous behavior in which they did not exist.If you find your contracts changing all the time, this is a problem with your code design. Not only does it make unit tests fragile, it makes coordination with other people and new features far more difficult than it needs to be. Read up on clean code strategies and code architectural patterns. **How to test**The most common issue I see in fragile tests is allowing state changes to fall through from test to test. You must start and stop every test at a neutral baseline state, not allowing tests to affect each other. Every test should be able to run by itself or in any random order compared to other tests. In fact, there are many test frameworks that provide a randomized run feature to help you find and prevent this form of fragility.To do unit testing correctly with non-pure functions, you must make sure to create fixtures, which are state controls. Before each test, your fixtures set up the correct state. After each test, you tear down those fixtures back to a neutral baseline. Do this using the test framework's built-in services. In class format, these are often methods named like setUp and tearDown. In spec format, they are named like beforeEach and afterEach.Each test has the following pattern:1. Set up fixtures, mocks, fakes2. If state may change, assert beginning state3. Call the function under test4. Assert returns if applicable 5. Assert state change if applicable6. Assert mocks/fakes were called as expected, including the expected parameters passed in7. Tear down fixtures, mocks, fakes",

If the expected behavior is \"data A, B and C are stored\", then the test should check for that and not care about the order of calls.In the end, it all boils down to understanding what the contract on interface level states: \"This function saves data by calling the storage layer\" does not say anything about how this is done or in which order. So, one can only check that once the function has been called, the data has indeed been stored. \"This function saves the data from the given data array in atomic write operations for each element of the array from first element to last element\" as interface contract describes a different behavior to check for - here the order and amount of calls to storage indeed matters.

        "body": "This is why I often say programming is easy, at least at this level. The real challenge is taking a specification (word problem) and turning it into code.One thing I can suggest is to take everyday tasks, that a person knows well, and turn them into a word problem and then turn that into code. It might be as something as simple as checking the mail. That might sound simple at first but you generally have to open a door or two, walk to the mail box, open the mail box, grab the mail and return. The more one thinks seriously about what appears to be a simple task, the faster one realizes how detailed one needs to be to get software to do the job. Creating the pseudo code becomes a challenge of iteratively walking through the code until you can actually get the mail. The interesting thing about checking the mail word problem, is that you can check your work by physically walking through your pseudo code.In any event there are lots of things in real life that can help you understand the conversion of tasks into code. The more \"everyday\" the task the more impressive the complexity of what a person does everyday not thinking about it. Brush your teeth in the morning and start to think about how all those actions would be expressed in code. Would the stroking back and forth, be a function to simplify your code.As for the OP I have to point out that this is an extremely common issue. That is turning written requirements into code and frankly it often has nothing to do with programming. However it is absolutely critical to becoming a good programmer. In the real world many times your specification might not be well defined causing one to do some research. That might mean reading a manual to get a device into a mode that you wan work with. The point is your word problems become outlines leaving out critical information you need to fill in. In other words in school you are lucky in that the word problems are generally complete, sometimes you need to figure out what a department really wants.",

I've been using it for years when I need a GUI toolkit and I'm not on Java / Kotlin, and it really is easy to use and fantastic. I can't recommend it highly enough.",

So, for me personally, it is to have everything planned out ahead of time so I don't have to struggle with decision paralysis. AI is very useful with this.Also I take a lot of notes because that helps me be focused.Reduce distractions. Uninstall any crap you can't live without and remove notifications for any app that isn't life or death.Lifestyle make a huge difference. Sleep a full night. Every night. Have a consistent sleep schedule. Keep yourself hydrated (with water, not soda) and try to eat a well balanced diet. Remove alcohol from your diet. Do some sports, even just a light jog (search for c25k if you're a couch potato) and preferably do it in the morning just after you wake up.You're brain is all over the place so you need to create habits that give you structure and stability. Removing distractions and having a healthy lifestyle are the most important things you can do.After that go for a course with some structure and predefined pace.

Usually this only triggers on activities that the person finds personally interesting, though.Anyway I bring it up because I personally have been diagnosed with ADHD, yet I have no problem focusing on programming when I sit down to code or design even without my medication, 'cause most of the time I end up hyperfocusing.",

Makes for a lot fewer headaches when trying to determine if we can trust the result.A lesser known detail about two's compliment is that it inverts the CY OUT flag as well. For example: 77h - 76h = ? 77h + 1 + 89h = ? (apply twos compliment) 77h + 1 + 89h = 101hThe 101h at the end ends up overflowing the adder and setting the CY OUT flag - which ends up conflicting with our definition of the overflow flag I assumed above.That explains the XOR on the CY OUT but not the CY IN. Fortinately this is just to make it so that we can use our 8 bit adder over multiple instructions to compute a sum/difference for larger numbers. It undoes the mucking about we did to make the CY OUT flag serve double duty as an overflow flag.",

The difference is that some people have been struggling for 3–5 years already, so it looks effortless now.The fact that you’re building your own projects while learning GitHub and Java is actually a strong sign. That’s exactly how you improve.A few practical tips that helped me:1.Stop comparing progress. Compare consistency. Are you coding weekly? That’s what matters.2.Focus on one path at a time. Git + Java + side projects is good, but don’t constantly switch directions.3.Build tiny projects you can finish in a few days. Finishing builds confidence.Programming feels hard because you’re literally rewiring how you think. That discomfort is growth.You’re not behind. You’re just early.Keep going.",

        "body": "My opinion: AI is for when you need code yesterday. It’s a Bandaid until you can get proper stitches. It’s a way to improve efficiency. And no matter how hard you study or what you accomplish, one person can’t know every language or navigate legacy code (in a single day) you have to maintain. AI gets a lot of hate, but…just being honest, you either stay on top of it or lose your job. You WILL learn the fundamentals and more because it’s the smart way to go. AI isn’t something you need to become a slave to. It’s something you use so you don’t get stuck. I’m still very much a beginner. I’m pretty solid with Python, but I’m not good with flask or SQLite, which is something I need at the moment. So I need a lot of help in that area along with building a web UI. My main problem with using AI is that AI isn’t really good for niche, edge-case applications. So I spend more time prototyping so I can capture the logic of what I want to do at every step along the way before writing the prompt. The flask route seems really straightforward to me, but I have to connect overything over HTML, JS, and CSS. For me, AI has really democratized programming and allowed me to do things I couldn’t do before. I can get stuff done and still learn as I go. AI hasn’t been all that helpful in troubleshooting. My personal rule is AI has three chances to get something right. If I can’t get what I need after three prompts, it’s tome to break down the logic and code in smaller steps.",

Where AI can be useful is bouncing ideas or questions off it. If you don't understand something, then you can use an LLM to help you gain that knowledge. Maybe you wrote a thing and it all kind of fell apart and you're not sure why - an LLM can give you some guidance.Don't become dependant on the models. If you find yourself asking the same questions over and over, that's a sign you're not retaining the knowledge. Treat the models like an interactive version of Stack Overflow that won't be snarky and lock your questions.As long as you are internalising the knowledge through actual practice writing code, then LLMs are just another tool you can use. Don't ever ask them to implement features for you. Use them as tools to get instant feedback on the code you write and your understanding of concepts. Also remember they can be stupid and wrong! That's also an important step in learning - when you realise you understand something better than an LLM, or some bozo on the internet :grinning_cat:",

You start seeing systems, inputs and outputs, constraints, edge cases. That mindset transfers to mechanical design, controls, simulation, data analysis, almost anything technical.On the AI point, it is similar to calculators in math. The people who benefit most from AI tools are the ones who understand what is happening under the hood. If you can reason about logic, data structures, and basic algorithms, you will use those tools better rather than being replaced by them.Also, you do not need to decide your life direction right now. Treat coding like a low cost experiment. Spend a few months building small things. Automate something in your daily life. Analyze some data. If you find yourself losing track of time while doing it, that is signal.The bigger win here might not be the skill itself. It is the habit of choosing deliberate practice over passive scrolling.

Stay curious Because you don't know computer science fully so you have. Many mystery stuff to uncover And if feel something easy then make it relatable to thing you already know or like Eg. String data type Eww :nauseated_face:,what the hell is string?HuhSo it's basically sentance that we write in coding?Nah man!! They call this thing an string,lol :face_with_tears_of_joy: I know it since childhood ..,...........My personal advice:If you are learning it as hobby then keep it in that way .You don't need to follow any course or strict roadmap to learn itWhen curiosity hit just drive in randomly and if stuck then solve it and do it again And by doing this you don't have to stay consistent because it will come automatically and you will become addicted to it.

Turns out that very few companies actually need to hire random bachelors degree holders or lower that learned a bit of Python and SQL that have no specific industry expertise i.e. the overwhelming majority of people looking into the field.  The few people who do this work are highly specialized and highly educated and would never be caught dead taking a udemy course.The technical barrier was perceived to be a lot lower than it is for swe so it got absolutely flooded in the last five years even more than SWE has. Add universities everywhere opening data science bachelors degrees, bootcamps, certs, self learners to the mix and the uncertainty of AI on top of the movement away from hiring generic \"data scientists\" and the field is a total mess.  All this hype for an industry that doesn't even exist in its former state anymore.Many grifters that shilled DS have moved onto AI.",

First, hardcode values directly where they are used.2. Then move them into variables3. Then combine those variables in classes - the same classes that handles objects in the game4. Then move then out of those classes and into separate data-classes, separated from the behaviour5. Then make it possible to read and write the data-classes to files - enabling savegames6. Then go further on with your online multiplayer-game, and transmit the data-classes across the network, or whatever :)The idea is that you don't build anything more complicated than you need at the moment - always remember the YAGNI principle when deciding to make advanced solutions - and that you only take small steps, always making sure that everything still works as intended, even when moved around in the code.",

Or... perhaps put better, it is a good language for people to learn if they are academics, mathematicians, researchers, data scientists and so on, because it does the thing and it is easy to understand. The people described above, are also the people pushing the AI at the front so it's their choice and they have chosen what they know. As they should. You could be looking at it the wrong way though, as terrifying as this is to say for a guy who has been doing this for multiple decades, we are moving beyond picking a language I think. Few years left but if you want to get started with all the AI developments going on, go and build some software with AI, find out what works and what doesn't, build in multiple different languages that you don't know and see how that feels.

It is a more specialized field. Even in current boom and that companies want these engineers the hype is dwindling down and the market for new AI / ML engineers will become smaller for the next few years. Most likely Software Engineers will be creating tools that are AI wrappers with foundation models with a RAG or post-model training. You will likely need regular Software Engineer XP to make these things good.Also ML and AI engineers are a bit different. If you plan to make wrapper, RAG tools based on foundation models you will still benefit from good Software Engineer skills..NET Software Engineer: Established ecosystem and jobs. There are many tools that need to be expanded or maintained or even new tools to be created that attach to the current ecosystem of a certain company. There are multiple tools, languages that do a better job than the current common choices in the market. The established ecosystem, documentation, information, experience and hiring pool make it hard to change to a tool. That applies also to AI. There are 20 ways to skin a cat and AI is just another way to skin the cat (create software).In reality. You should look into the regions you plan to work at and what technology is needed. It might be smarter to learn Java with Spring boot or Node.js. There are also many related tools you will need to learn that are framework agnostic, for example PostgreSQL or MySQL and not forgetting good fundamentals and more theoretical stuff. Also the fact there are so many tools in the software market and it is hard to stand out nowadays therefore it is also smart to develop some social skills. Social skills are half of the game in the market. Communicating in a team is very important.",

What helped me decide was asking: what do I actually want to build right now? Not in 5 years, right now. For me, the answer was AI-powered tools, so I leaned into Python + ML basics. But here's the thing I don't think it has to be either/or. The .NET job market is real and stable. Enterprise companies need .NET devs constantly, and the barrier to entry is more predictable: learn C#, build CRUD apps, get hired. AI/ML has a higher ceiling but also a higher floor you need solid math, Python, and often a portfolio of projects just to get noticed. honest take for 2026: learn the fundamentals well in whatever excites you more (motivation matters a LOT when you're grinding through the hard parts), but make sure you understand how AI tools work regardless of which path you pick. Every .NET dev is going to need to integrate AI features soon, and every ML engineer needs to ship production code. The best position is someone who can do both, even if you specialize in one.",

Anyways, the question to ask is: do you want to be the person actually building and making cutting edge breakthroughs with advancements in the types of models we're creating (e.g., GPT, BERT, MobileNetV2, etc) or are you just wanting to apply them in a production environment?The former requires a lot of background in Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics, and the latter requires understanding APIs and what an AI model is built/trained for..NET is just a framework. You can learn it enough to be proficient with the tools and C# in a couple of weeks if you already have background in other languages and tools (especially if you're coming from Java).",

If you’re running into the same syntax errors, don’t fix the problem right away, try to understand why you need indentation, colons.Syntax changes from one language to the next but the fundamentals generally apply. If you need help debugging, honest to god, you can do it on paper or a white board. I graduated from Uni not that long ago and my first 2 programming classes required us to take exams with pen and paper, so we had to learn how to walk through the code without fancy debugging software. It’s something that really worked well for me.Track your variables, update the variables as you walk through each line of code, keep track of what variables are in scope, etc. This should make using a debugger a bit more intuitive. Also, some of the debugging functions were confusing to me when I started:* Put a breakpoint where you want to stop the function* step over means move to the next line of code* step into means step into the current line of code; ex. if this is a function call, now you’ll be walking through each line in that called function",

Full stack tends to give you broad exposure to how systems are actually built and shipped, which can be useful early on because you see the whole lifecycle. Cybersecurity is more specialized and often sits a bit downstream, reviewing, testing, or defending what others build.AI is going to change tooling in both areas, but it doesn’t remove the need to understand fundamentals. Secure systems still need to be designed, and applications still need people who understand architecture, data flow, and tradeoffs. If you’re unsure, I’d think about whether you enjoy building features and user facing stuff, or digging into threat models and failure scenarios.You can pivot later from full stack into security with some focused learning. It’s a bit harder to pivot the other way without hands on build experience.",

In my opinion, it’s easier to get into cyber with a background in programming than it would be to get into a programming position with a background in “cyber”.Job ops wise seems like others here on the thread have already answered this pretty well for ya and I would agree with them. Patternrelay and Overall-Worth-2407 both make good points there.

That is awesome for reasoning, resource bounds, and making performance predictable, but it also means you do not get general recursion or unbounded while loops without adding extra machinery. From a formal methods angle, that is a feature, not a bug, if you lean into it.If you allow unbounded loops or something like “loop until condition,” you are basically back to general purpose computation, and then the “loop centric” part is more about ergonomics and how you restrict or structure control flow.Two framing ideas that might help your design doc land with people: what is the smallest set of constructs you need besides loops (variables, arithmetic, conditionals), and what property do you want to guarantee (termination, time/space bounds, ease of verification). If you can say “Gamma Loop is intentionally total” or “intentionally resource bounded,” that becomes a clear conceptual advantage rather than just a vibe.Also, if you have even a tiny spec for the loop form and what is forbidden, folks can give much sharper feedback. Right now “loops are central” can mean a lot of different things.",

In C code ai often writes something like: buffer[received_bytes] = '\\0'; It's making sure that there's always null terminating character at the end of received message string. It would seem correct at first but the received bytes variable could have a value of the size of buffer (e.g 1024) So we need one more byte in the buffer to accommodate the final null termination.

        "body": "The word `static` has to do with the linkage of SYMBOLS.Compilers translate source code to object code in a \"translation unit\". Typically that's 1 source file = 1 object file, which is 1 translation unit.Statics typically have \"internal\" linkage, that the SYMBOLS are ONLY visible in that translation unit.If we are to presume a source file: int x; static int y;Here my symbol `x` has \"external\" linkage, and `y` has \"internal\" linkage. Therefore, if we go to another source file: extern int x; // Fine extern int y; // Linker error extern static int y; // Doesn't fix the problem, compiler error, can't combine `extern` and `static`So half your question has to do with linkage. Then there's scope. Statics have whole-program lifetimes, so then the question is what in a translation unit has access to that variable? If you put the static variable at global scope, then everything in that TU can access that symbol.If you put a static variable in a function, then only that function can access that symbol. If you put a static variable in a class, then only that class can access that symbol.What doesn't have linkage are REFERENCES. And that's what you're talking about. You describe: void fn(std::map> &);Well, you would have to call `fn` from a TU that has the `myMap` symbol in scope. You can pass the reference at runtime, because linkage is a compile-time issue.",

If the spec calls something ill formed or undefined, there is no overriding that. Undefined means the compiler cannot prove the code is correct - and there are lots of scenarios that's true. The language therefore relies on YOU to be personally responsible and write correct code.And here's the thing about UB - the compiler is free to make assumptions. For example: int i = j + 1; if(i < j) { // Check for overflow?The compiler is free to deduce that this is impossible - because overflow is undefined. So the conditional code block can be completely removed.Though your hardware may support signed integer overflow, that cannot usurp the language spec. The compiler is going to generate machine code that operates under that assumption; the rest of your program can be incorrect.",

From what I’ve seen, beginners struggle not with Python syntax but with understanding how frontend, backend, APIs, and databases connect into one system.If you’re evaluating the course, check these first:• Do they make you build complete apps (auth, CRUD, deployment)?• Do they teach backend fundamentals like REST, async concepts, and database design — not just frameworks?• Is there code review or mentorship instead of only recorded videos?For me, the biggest learning jump came from projects + frontend-to-backend connectivity, because that’s where everything finally makes sense.Courses can speed things up, but they’re not magic — combine them with self-built projects and you’ll get way more value.",

        "body": "One thing worth remembering is *why* Ruby and Rails were huge. It goes something like:At the time, backends were *huge* clunky things built out of Java, maybe .NET, and sometimes mainframes and COBOL. That means tons of Java-isms -- better bake a serial number into all of your classes in case you use native Java serialization to save sessions, but also you need an ORM with fifteen XML config files just so the ORM knows to set the `email` property to the `email` column, and that the `users` table goes to the `User` class. Except wait, you don't set the `email` property, you call `setEmail()` on the `User` class. And you don't create a `new User()`, you call a method on a `UserFactory`, which you need to get from the AbstarctDefaultFactoryImpl or whatever. And this isn't even Java 8, even a *simple* Java list looks like: List emails = new ArrayList();Yep, repeat `String` twice and `List` twice and generally be the most verbose, repetitive thing anyone had ever seen until Go gave us `if err != nil { return err; }` after every goddamned line.Or, at the other extreme, there was the LAMP stack -- stupidly-sloppy messes hacked together with Perl and PHP, the kind of thing people were building blogs out of. Wordpress was maybe the state of the art. PHP is a whole programming language that grew out of a glorified template language, so any notion of separating the view from the model was not really happening -- this is a world where you're taking some static HTML thing you built in DreamWeaver, renaming `.html` to `.php`, and adding a mysql query right to the middle of it with `` tags. IMO this explains a lot of why Facebook is the way it is -- it grew out of a tool that was built for adding a guestbook and a hit counter to your Geocities homepage.So Rails did a couple things: It cut out a ton of the boilerplate with \"convention over configuration\" -- if you have a `Users` model class and a `users` DB table, Rails can figure out that those are supposed to go together, and you only need to add configuration when you have something that doesn't fit the very obvious pattern. Ruby cut out more of the boilerplate by not making you repeat your type names five million times. It gave you a CLI tool that generates a working Rails project for you instantly, makes it super easy to get started filling in the blanks. It gives you enough structure that you're probably not building your whole app inside the HTML view like you would in PHP. On top of that, Ruby was a nicer language than most of the competition -- PHP and Perl are both pretty ugly, and Java doesn't even have lambdas.Other replies have pointed out things that made Rails less relevant -- more microservices and fewer monoliths, more web APIs and React and such instead of pure CRUD at the HTML level. But I think it's also because a lot of the basic ideas Rails had either ended up going way too far -- to do that `User``users` mapping, every Rails server needed a complex set of rules on how to pluralize English words! -- or ended up not being necessary for what they were trying to do. Like, turns out with decent type inference (Typescript, Golang), you can do strong, static typing and not constantly have to repeat yourself. Java and even C++ got lambdas, `var` and `auto`, and other basic quality of life code-level stuff.",

They know how to market themselves and how to fit in well in a new job. Getting a job is a simple process to them.The weaker engineers who want to get a job, cruise, hope for an easy paycheck, can't contribute to technical discussions well, and feel entitled to a job because they have 8 years on the job? They will not survive without reflection and adjustments.But now the average senior engineers are in a new market. During the COVID mass hirings they were golden, they were in the \"good\" half by default. You could get the job done and that was great. Unfortunately, the bar has been raised where that's no longer the case. You *need* to be a good engineer or by default you are a poor one.At my work, I have seen the engineers I loved working with get a new, higher paying role just because it fell on their plate in a LinkedIn message and they decided to go through the process, nail it in 3 weeks, and put in their 2 weeks notice shortly after. Similarly, I have seen the engineers I detest working with, constantly argue and are not fun to be around, make the same mistakes constantly, etc. complain about how the market is dead and they can't find a new position anywhere.Who you are and where you fall in these categories is really up to you. I think if you are a senior engineer, you have the resources all available to be a good hire. It just requires a lot of effort - if you don't understand it, it won't work out.",

That's a workflow an LLM could do before breakfast.But the reason AI won't replace CEOs anytime soon has nothing to do with their actual decision-making ability. It's about who controls the purchasing decisions. CEOs buy AI tools. AI tools don't buy CEOs. The incentive structure means AI companies will always market their products as \"making leadership more effective\" and never as \"replacing leadership entirely.\" The tools will always be positioned to eliminate the people who DON'T sign the checks.The real irony is that middle management is probably more vulnerable than either engineers or C-suite. The \"translate strategy into tasks and make sure they get done\" layer is genuinely something project management AI is getting decent at.

Everyone who doesn't drop what they're doing and switch to AI coding will be completely unemployable and out of the industry in 3-6 months.2. AI assisted coding isn't ready for primetime yet. It leads to maximum technical debt, with repeated code and subtle errors. After awhile, the AIs start adding 2 new bugs for every bug or feature it adds. AI only works for the simplest of tasks.I don't see why \"YOU MUST URGENTLY LEARN AI CODING!\" is a thing. If it really does work and is effective, why should it matter if I switch now or I switch in 2-5 years, when the AIs will be a lot better and using them will be a completely different workflow?I also wonder how much of (1) is coming from people pushing AI hype or who work at AI firms, and how much of (2) is coming from people who actually worked on complex projects that AIs can't handle.",

See Gmail as a reference. The issue is: 85% of your engineers are going to do nothing and that creativity leash is basically just free hang out time.

I would say it varies a lot by company and even team.Some companies hire more “worker bee” type developers who are focused on implementation then lean on PMs or other business functions to decide the details of what to build. Others expect developers to make more choices about what to build and do the building. Those companies also tend to pay more because they expect more from developers. It does seem to be loosely correlated with how structured their processes are because if different people are making decisions than doing the implementation, process will generally be necessary to facilitate the coordination. The most obvious marker of this in my experience is the number of PMs or BAs or whatever they call them. If you’re evaluating a job offer and trying to understand how much autonomy you’ll have, look at how many of these people there are in comparison to engineers. The more there are, the more of that kind of work they will have to handle.",

Those students may be like 2-4 yrs out from graduating so they r making those decisions based on how they see the job market going.Do what you will with that information.I do think, AI is going to make getting a junior job harder, you’re going to have to bring in much better logic and design imo. Any junior dev now with AI if given the specs and what not can generate easy endpoints no problem. I think grunt entry level WebDev work is most affected.Critical infrastructures or more low level closer to hardware I think will be a lot harder for AI to intrude on currently I think",

CIS heavily focuses on business operations, has a bit of coding, some network stuff, etc. It overlaps tech with business management and that sort of stuff. IT strongly focuses on Networks, servers, traffic, databases (which is a bit businessy), etc. The programming tends to focus on more automation type stuff similar to CIS. Some colleges have different curriculums for these courses, others don’t really and you can take any classes. It’s just a big toss up. That’s why almost all job posts have CS, CIS, CIT, IT, or other tech related field. Even if they don’t, it’s usually just implied. Someone with a CS degree that has an oracle box virtual home lab setup, has maybe messed with their home network, and builds computers would obviously be strong contender for Helpdesk. Vise Versa, someone with an IT degree built their own small OS in Rust, maybe has another project developing their own language from C++, and maybe does science and math simulations in OpenGL then they’d obviously be a strong candidate for a true entry level (0-3 years experience, unlike the 3-5 we see now) low level software engineering position.So, all of this to say, it just really depends. They 100% have their differences and should be recognized for that. In the world of experience trumping everything, it doesn’t even matter which is why I can see these roles asking for any tech bachelors.",

In other words it will be a tool that is useful in some areas and not in others. It will take judgement on your part to know when that tool should be used. Those that use it like it's the only tool in their toolbox won't do well. Look at Amazon, they just had a big outage due to AI. Of course they tried to blame the humans. But AI was the one that made the mistake. That is very telling.Unfortunately there isn't an unbiased news source on AI. As you read articles you'll have to think about what the author is benefiting from by their stance. E.g. article by C\\*O of an AI company that AI will replace white collar workers in x time in the future (long enough for people to forget the said declaration at that time). Translation buy my AI tools and don't get left in your competitors dust. If you don't we'll go broke because our tools aren't profitable yet because they aren't good enough. If we get you to pay then we might be around long enough to make them profitable.",

People know it has value, but they don't yet know how much value.The improvements that companies keep making, makes it seem like the potential value is much, much higher than it actually is. Right now, everyone knows it is not as valuable as it is valued at, which is leading to the intense speculative bubble we're seeing. It is the belief in what it will do later that keeps the bubble so strong; if several PhD level papers come out showing we're not even close... that will probably kill the bubble.And of course, that probably won't happen for a while. The folks who would do such research are also largely funded by the people who need the bubble to continue.This is normal for an immature technology. What is NOT normal, is thinking the technology is going to replace everyone, without actually proving it can, and everyone hedging their bets on this happening anyways.Companies like Apple are probably going to be the big winners at the end of this. They're not firing their teams and replacing them with unproven AI. And at this point in time, it is looking more and more like AI usage just shifts the bottleneck further down the line rather than eliminates it (as far as automated programming goes).Since the changes it makes can be breaking and it has no accountability, a lot of devs are being forced into code review for thousands upon thousands of changes. It is likely to lead to unstable software, with limited ability to diagnose and maintain, even if companies increase headcount. You just cannot fit the context of the changes into your head fast enough to tell when the AI is doing something dumb.As such, the workflow we're accustomed to is not very accommodating to AI autonomous changes... until it can actually take over dev jobs, which is still a long time away.Site Reliability Engineers and Cybersecurity developers are going to feast.",

Try to weather the storm, maybe AI turns out to be less apocalyptic than we all thought and everything ends up okay.2. Try to pivot into something sort of tech adjacent. Someone will need to test the AI slop apps of the future or review the code they generate or whatever sad new jobs come about in the AI era. No guarantee these jobs are great, or that I could get one, or that they'll even exist. 3. Start over. I've spent the last 20 years building tech products that have by any measure made the world a worse place. Maybe this time pick a 2 career that actually does some good. 25 years is still a long time so while it feels too late to make a change, maybe it's not.",

First, I think your bullet points focus too much on the technology you used and not enough on the impact your work had on the company. Keep in mind that a lot of recruiters are not very literate in terms of tech (as weird as that may be), and so to them it looks like a lot of jargon. I'd really suggest formatting your bullet points like this: (1) what you did, (2) in layman's terms what impact it had (business metrics here a plus), and (3) optionally mention the tech used. Second, unless those non-work projects you did are very meaningful or impactful, then I'd suggest getting rid of them and use the space to add more bullet points to your work experience. Anyone off the street can create a school-level project with AI. Business impact is key. Last, keep applying and practicing. Take whatever you can get. Don't be picky. Target smaller companies.",

You can still apply for these roles at large companies but you’ll need referrals to get you past the automated resume screen that will see your 6mo of experience and peace out. Reach out to your previous lead and manager at Amazon, as well as people you worked with, friends, mentors. You don’t need to feel close to people to reach out. Send them your resume and ask them to send it to people in their network who may be hiring. Ask your friends to ask their boss if there is an opening in their org. Meet up for lunch, send a message from linked in. Reach out reach out reach out.The other approach that works well in this situation is to apply to startups and smaller companies.

Hiring managers may have no clue what skillsets the others are looking for, so there's not really an automatic pool where everyone can just take their pic, no matter how efficient that sounds.

And sometimes it's not just about technical skills, but cultural/fit. Doesn't mean you're a bad candidate overall, but you can adapt by networking even during the interview process. Research about the company beyond the job posting and their website, read company- and role-specific [interview guides](https://www.interviewquery.com/companies) if you can so you really know what they expect across teams.",

Engineer time is *expensive*. Claude has read the C++ spec in full, I have not, every time I have a finnicky template meta-programming task it saves me 2-3 hours once I have a good definition of what I want the unit to do. But I'm still fairly underwhelmed by how it handles most tasks without quite a bit of guidance from me.If I had to put numbers on it, I'd say that *of actual heads-down dev time* (which is probably only 8-10 hrs/wk at best!) it's probably a 10-15% productivity boost for me. Which is *absolutely massive* but not world-changing.",

As for people talking about parallel agents and 50 thousand MCP servers and gas town and ralph loops, etc, etc. I think that’s mostly just grift. There is definitely an AI-maximalist side of the internet that rewards content showing ridiculous overusage of AI. When I’m working on something it often feels like I’m at my cognitive limit trying to stay on top of what is getting built, validating it, debugging, and planning next steps, it’s hard to know what I’d do with all that extra stuff, but maybe that’s a skill issue, idk.",

It may take a LONG time to pay off (jobs are especially hard to get right now) but eventually it will succeed. Hopefully you'll find a position that is better than this one.In the meantime, there might be ways for you to work around the problem within your current organization. This advice will be appropriate for some companies and not for others so consider your situation before applying it.Sounds like you've effectively been \"demoted\" by being assigned less valuable work. Also sounds like you aren't being given enough work to actually challenge you (\"haven’t touched a line of code in 2.5 months\" \"just got assigned the most absurdly simple defect\"). Maybe you should go ahead and \"promote\" yourself without asking for permission.Figure out who at the company WANTS the system rebuild that you thought was a good idea (\"rebuilding the existing native application with my language of expertise that I’ve worked with & loved my entire career\"). Maybe this is a product manager outside of the tech world, maybe it's a VP who doesn't have the clout to get things moving. (If there isn't anyone who wants this done... maybe it shouldn't be!) Talk with this person. Say that you aren't being challenged in your current position and you have some free time. Offer to build what they are looking for as a \"Proof of concept\". Invest some time and just BUILD the darn thing (it's amazing how much faster a \"skunkworks\" project can go. If you succeed, maybe you end up as the tech lead for the project (which would consist of releasing the \"POC\" that you built).As I said, it's not the right solution for all companies, but it CAN be effective in some places. And it doesn't sound like you are especially worried about annoying your current manager.Sometimes, the way to stop being a mid-level SWE is to stop behaving like a mid-level SWE and start behaving like a senior SWE.",

Try to find people in the type of company you’d like to work at. Follow what they post about, comment, message them with a specific question. Post on LinkedIn about projects you’re interested in. Maybe someone is willing to meet up for a coffee and give you some tips about your local job market.Are there any local, in-person developer groups you could join?The more active you can be at looking to connect with different people the better.It’s not usually a natural thing for CS folks like us :) but when it’s about interesting projects or programming topics then you can’t shut us up :)",

Idk how your experience has been with your current company, but my biggest takeaway from being at the position I am at currently is that you should switch jobs when you feel you knowledge has stagnated (as in not learning much) or you prefer to go in a different direction in your field (switching from a Full Stack Engineer to say a Back End Developer).It also appears getting past the 2 year mark is pretty much the golden rule. Now depending on how much you are learning or if you have stagnated, the 2 year mark could be a good indicator to look at how far you have come since starting and analyze how much you have learned. I specifically plan on getting to around the 3 year mark before I start applying to much higher paying position. Be it, I am only a few minutes from my house currently and don't have a house, car, or kids to worry about in terms of big monthly payments. Whatever you do end up doing, do not just quit your job and hope to get picked up elsewhere fast! When I graduated college in 2023, it took roughly 10-11 months before I got the position I am in currently. Just be aware that when you do start looking, it could be another full year till you find that next job.",

        "body": "Spent 6.75 years in my first job out of college in a defense contractor, and now am making my leave out of the defense life next month. It really depends on how much friction you want your next job search to be. It's easy to remain in the defense ecosystem, especially if you have a clearance, because getting interviews/callbacks from other defense contractors is much easier after having a proven track record in defense. It's also a very comfortable job outside of the work aspect; a 9/80 work schedule is game changing if you are in company that does that and the slow work pace can be relaxing. I honestly don't think I'll ever attain that same level of WLB anywhere else outside of defense after this. I will definitely consider defense again when I am older and ready to just coast to retirement. I think these factors are huge reason people get stuck in defense; it's what I've seen from my older, high tenured colleagues do and people that have left my company to go to other defense companies.I will say that defense is varied and even teams within the same company can have wildly different directives and experiences. I was fortunate to be in a team that got to do really cool stuff that also had a more relaxed pace, and I still got to learn a lot about SWE at the same time. Some of my colleagues that got placed into the big money maker team in my company were working left and right on different projects every month from what it seemed like. My recommendation is that you give this a fair shot for 1-2 years and make an adjustment if needed.You may actually enjoy the work you do and discover that your team isn't as slow or not productive for learning as you may initially thought, or you completely hit the mark on your initial assessment. As a general life advice, use this opportunity to really isolate what you want from a job, and align your next actions to directly support that goal and don't compromise it just because it's easy. If you want out, commit to finding a job that fits your desired career track or work towards joining a top company that can give you that clout you need to work at your end goal role. Going for what is easy to get is how you really get stuck in a niche.",

In my experience, we've never exceeded that budget so these promotions always pass their business justification.Starting with senior to staff, then staff to principal and principal to senior principal the business justification becomes stricter. Staff is defined as a role that works \"across teams\", usually within an org. Principal is inter-org work and sr. principal is company level work. We must justify why we need individuals operating in those roles. For Staff it's not too bad, we produce a list of they type of work and project work that requires tech/engineering focus aligning teams (usually building something global/working directly with internal customer teams etc etc).Principal and Sr. Principal things get much harder. There's really not that much work at that level. My org of 100 has one principal, who focuses on cross-org database work, and one principal who is working torwards sr. Principal by focusing on aligning our entire orgs tech with other org tech leads. I really have no need for more than that.I have about 10 Staff engineers however, some recently promoted into that role from Senior. (We do a lot of inter-team work/support). They are all told if they want to make principal, it is /unlikely/ they will get the role within our current org (we'd either have to double in size, not likely, or one of the two principals would have to leave and require a backfill).For those staff engineers that want to \"grow\" by title change I encourage my managers to do several things. First, keep a constant eye on opening roles in the company, anything principal they should consider having their staff report apply to it and be considered. Likewise there are some other career paths, such as engineering manager (if they want to stop focusing on being an Individual contributor) or even other leadership roles (technical program manager etc). And lastly, yes, it is not a crime if my managers support their staff engineers in their next career step outside the company (referrals, helping be a career mentor, assessing other jobs etc). All of this is to say, yes, at some point, a \"promotion\" must consider business need, and that business need should get harder the more senior the role is. Managers should focus on the realities and be aware that sometimes growing people means having them leave the team or company, but it should happen at more senior levels.If your company doesn't have good definitions of what various levels of engineers should be doing for the company, I'd start there.",

        "body": "Promotion requiring a corporate need is actually the norm, it just isn't usually made explicit. Now, early career, you can generally show \"yes, we need person at L+1, we expect our L to grow into that role\", but major career transitions (Senior, or Staff) generally require a business need.In many companies, this is actually hidden by the modern practice of retrospective promotion, where you promote people after they demonstrate a sustained performance of L+1. Since there was L+1 work for them to do to demonstrate that, it is a lot easier to demonstrate a need. But it is also normal for people to be in a position where there are no career growth opportunities for them on their current team, or even at their current company. After all, if the company has a CTO, and you are ready to take on a CTO role, you are probably going to have to leave. A good manager helps employees realize that and make that transition.Think about it this way, if you tried to open up a new headcount for a Senior or Staff level role, would you be able to justify it with the work your team has to do? If you could, you can make the case for a promotion. If you can't, then people looking to go to Senior or Staff need to leave your team anyway, because even if you did promote them, their reviews would inherently be awful because they would have no ability to demonstrate performance at level.",

I would imagine that as a manager it is your responsibility to make the argument for promoting and keeping your direct reports. Is there a need for someone to increase the scope of work they’re during and provide further technical value to a line of business? If so, make that argument and push for a promotion. If not, that’s just an honest assessment of the business’ needs. The way I see it, if a team’s responsibilities evolve then the needs of the team change and it’s up to the manager to facilitate that change.Think of it this way:You have a business and all you sell are apples and the market only has a demand for 100 apples a year. Would you care if your employee was skilled enough to sell 100 vs 1000 apples? Probably not, right? As long as they fill the gap, there’s no incentive to cut further into your profits.Your decision to stay or leave is fully up to you. That stagnation might be what you want for your career or you might want growth but that’s a personal decision.",

It's just that some grow fast enough or have enough turnover to justify the high amounts of need such that engineers of a certain level can be promoted based primarily on merit. The farther you go up the ladder, every company will eventually hit a level where the need simply does not exist at all times for everyone.If that level is at very low junior levels, I'd be more worried you're in a company that is very focused on cost savings compared to growth. That's just not the kind of place to be if you or your reports are primarily focused on professional growth.What you describe is the norm for most jobs outside of growth tech companies. You climb the ladder by applying for a different job that you must compete with others for, not by growing in place like is common in tech.If you want to be an ethical manager, you should be upfront with your reports about this. If you can make it happen, helping your reports find those roles elsewhere in the company where they can be successful is amazing, but that is often thankless work in situations like this. It can pay off for you down the road though, because those same reports may open doors for you on other teams or at other companies in the future.A lot of managers in this situation make the short sighted choice to say what they need to their reports so that they won't leave, even if it's detrimental to them.

Maybe you would learn something if you had to build the same project without Claude. It's super easy to understand code especially code that Claude writes. It's a whole lot harder to think of that logic and write code from the ground up. Think about how easy it is to read a book and how much more difficult it would be to write a book.From the sounds of it, it looks like you don't like CS but kept going with the degree and now don't want the last 4 years to be a waste. If I were you, I would really consider what you want your job to look like. I only have 2 YOE and I spend my days sitting in a cubical doing full stack development. In this time, I have learned that real world coding is very different from the fun projects I had during college, so now I'm getting a master's to pivot into a data analytics field. I had a couple data driven projects during this time and realized it was way more enjoyable. However, I also know that I don't have the discipline to self-study without the fear of an exam or project deadline so that's why I am getting the masters.Ill end with this, you're not alone at all. Over half of my friends that graduated with a CS degree went into a different field that involved no coding. One is in audio/visual, one is training to be a pilot, another a scada engineer.

I'd do both in parallel — projects carry more weight in interviews.Your SWE background is actually an advantage for data analytics that most people underestimate. You already understand data structures, can read/write code, and know how systems produce the data that analysts work with. That context is genuinely rare. For the pivot, SQL is the most critical immediate skill — probably 80% of day-to-day data analyst work is SQL. The good news: with a CS degree you'll pick it up fast. Focus on window functions, CTEs, and aggregations with GROUP BY/HAVING since those show up constantly in analytics work. A couple of practical suggestions:\\- Practice on real datasets (Kaggle, Mode Analytics public datasets, or the Google BigQuery public datasets)\\- Build a portfolio of 2-3 analysis projects that tell a story with data, not just queries\\- Learn the basics of one BI tool (Tableau, Power BI, or Looker — depends on what's common in your target companies) For getting comfortable with SQL query patterns quickly, [ai2sql.io](http://ai2sql.io)",

It seems like everyone recognizes that quality is declining across the board, and yet the trend of trying to push it off on individuals who have little to no passion for it continues. All the focus is on speed, and testing goes out the window. On the flip side, deploying changes only gets cheaper and cheaper, so production issues are viewed as less of a liability -- until you have a $10,000,000 issue.My hope is the eroding quality issues and disruption risk of the modern landscape will make quality somewhat a competitive advantage moving forward. Any team who has had effective quality advocates guiding processes and shifting quality concerns left/bringing the quasi-adversarial perspective knows the value they bring to a team/org.

I think programs in AI or Cybersecurity could be additive, or a masters program in CS that specializes in one of those (since those can be argued as additive)",

It is especially doable because you are taking a gap year. The industry is becoming increasingly competitive for juniors and hostile to “self taught”. University name often doesn’t even matter. And I know it sucks to go to a less prestigious school; but, engineering has always been more competitive and engineers always had to downgrade even when I was in college 10+ years ago. Don’t take shortcuts and sabotage yourself before you even start college.",

Pretty much every system with users is going to have user data. An extra integer field on the user object is not going to increase dev time or costs in a meaningful way. Paying licensing fees to save 3-5 minutes of dev time a week is silly, especially when in doing so you're now wasting 35-70 minutes of dev time in a week to utilize the unnecessary software.

It just means better.I've seen people with 2 YOE get Senior titles because they were at the right place right time—young team, desperate, whatever. Or just dumb. It's all dependent on who's in the room when. Someone can be at a place where they don't have anything more than Senior because, well, they don't, and cap out at Senior even though they've been doing the same shit for 25 years. This exists... more than I want to admit. Remember: There are more than just 1000 companies in the world that are powered by applications—custom or out-of-the-box.I'm not saying titles don't matter—they do, they gate a lot of things including but not limited to your dating life—but if you want to level up your skill, that's a lot more of a different thing than just saying \"I want to move up to Senior Backend.\"",

I think learning kotlin and building apps is a great way to boost your resume and show you know how to build real systems. The industry wants to move towards Kotlin Multiplatform to share business logic between iOS/android. I would recommend building your apps in KMP and not neglecting iOS if you're building on your own and not for a company.That said, at least when I graduated tech companies preferred to hire a leetcode grinder with no android experience rather than an experienced android developer who couldn't leetcode. My intro to android development was applying to amazon, passing the leetcode rounds, and getting thrown on an android team with no prior android experience. Unless Android is truly your passion, I wouldn't commit to only applying to android roles. This career is a lot about luck and taking opportunities where they come. From my experience leetcode, networking, and career fairs with the goal of an internship are likely going to be a better use of time than diving deep into mobile dev. Use mobile dev as project experience to get those internships, but don't force your career in one direction.",

I don't know how often timing was an issue in my Q4 2025 job search because I don't have visibility into whether I failed a resume screen or they chose someone else, although I got offers from companies where the job posting had been up for months and where they took up to two months to get back to me.3. In my Q4 2025 job search I made a spread sheet because I applied to many (62 versus at most a handful) more companies than I did historically and that was the most convenient way to keep track.4. I'd apply if the job was a good fit even with a 99% ghost rate. I'm an individual not the average candidate who is under qualified as Joel Spolsky discussed 20 years ago in [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/06/finding-great-developers-2/](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/06/finding-great-developers-2/) where \"almost every hiring manager in Palo Alto right now with 1000 resumes on their desk has the same exact set of 970 resumes from the same minority of 970 incompetent people that are applying for every job in Palo Alto, and probably will be for life.\" Google hired me in spite of a reported 0.2 - 0.7% acceptance rate, although to be fair that position came through an inbound recruiter contact.5. Along similar lines I don't think stats would be useful.6. Tools facilitating automated application are the biggest BS in tech hiring presumably causing long backlogs to talk to a person and some good candidates being lost in the noise.",

The screening process feels so disconnected from actual job performance, especially when you're more direct or don't play the corporate small talk game well. I've noticed this pattern too where founders tend to hire differently than HR departments do.To answer your questions: I do bookmark companies but honestly it's pretty manual and messy. I use a basic spreadsheet to track applications because most job platforms are terrible for this. Timing is huge though, I've definitely gotten rejections that felt like they already had someone in mind before posting. The ghosting stats would actually be super valuable, like if I knew a company had a 70% ghost rate I'd probably still apply but adjust my expectations and not put as much energy into customizing everything.The biggest BS right now is probably the AI resume screening stuff. You're getting filtered out by algorithms before any human even sees your application, and nobody tells you why. It's this black box where you could be perfect for the role but get rejected because you didn't use the right keywords or format. Companies are posting jobs they're not even seriously trying to fill, just collecting resumes or satisfying some internal requirement.Super cool bc I'm also building something in this space too (called Sprout) because the whole system feels broken. We're trying to give people more visibility into company response patterns and help optimize applications for these screening systems. But honestly the real problem is that hiring has become this weird theater where everyone's pretending the process makes sense when it clearly doesn't.What specific automation stuff have you seen people build? I'm curious about the more elaborate setups you mentioned.",

I think the bigger issue isn't just *how* you search, it's that you're fighting a volume game where everyone else is spending 2 hours per application while you're doing the same, which mathematically means you can only reach like 10-15 companies a month max before burnout hits. The unconventional approach that's actually working for people now is automating the repetitive parts without losing quality.Not talking about spammy mass-blast stuff, but actually letting software handle the grunt work of finding roles that match your criteria, customizing your materials for each ATS, and submitting at scale so you can focus energy on the companies that actually respond. I've heard really good things about SimpleApply for this exact use case since it handles the end-to-end application process and lets you reach way more opportunities without spending 40 hours a week on form filling. To answer your actual questions though: I track in a spreadsheet (Notion got too heavy), I absolutely would skip companies with 70% ghost rates if I knew that data, and the biggest BS right now is take-home assignments that are clearly just free consulting work.The fact that we're all pretending 8-hour unpaid projects are normal interview steps is insane. good luck with your product btw, sounds like you're tackling real pain",

On one of my worst projects in terms of hours, I lost weight because I was very mindful of my diet and how I dealt with stress. We’re all human, though. I’m not sure where the cutoff is between discipline and caving. Probably flexible and impacted by a lot of different factors. For me, personally, there have been times a switch went off for whatever reason. Perhaps a visual representation of the behavior spurs action more quickly.I think burnout is a different beast from smaller actions related to cognitive load. Interesting to see Monday your biggest food ordering day.

You could also load up a crock pot in the morning and come home to a nice hot stew and an amazing smelling house.If you can get into the habit of making larger portions and storing them in the fridge or freezer, it really simplifies meals in a way that's consistently higher quality and less expensive than delivery. You can also do some simple little side dishes like roast carrots, cooked spinach with garlic or even kimchi, so that you get some variety with the main thing you're eating.I'm much less inclined to order anything, since a meal for one for one night will usually cost about the same as a meal for one for a week. Even just driving over there and getting an order personally will at least cut that cost in half.",

In my experience at a very large worldwide conglomerate: * It is weird a manager would not already be tracking performance of the full team.* Planning for succession starts from day 1; and a big part of that is cross training other team members so we can all step in for each other. This also helps if you want to take a 3 week vacation to some place with no cell service. It also helps if you want to move to a different role in the same company. No individual person should be \"too important to lose\". I'd rank this as neutral, although if peer reviews are not already part of your yearly review cycle, then it'll be hard for them to get meaningful feedback.",

All I'm saying is that it sounds like you're a problem-solver, and as long as you can articulate your problem solving ability to you can translate that into the role you're looking for. I'm on the product side, so maybe stepping over my skis here, but I had several conversations with people who feel like they wanted to transition into product management but didn't know how to translate their experience; so a lot of that time was helping them draw the connections. That's how I moved from outside tech into tech. I know that's not your specific question, but I was giving some advice from that perspective (as a random stranger on the internet).And yeah, I'm building a tool to help with that, so I thought I'd offer it.",

I had to shadow build an application just to prove that I could do it, and even then there was never any movement to get me into that group. At another company, I was a lead developer and when we were acquired, I was not taken seriously because my formal background was mathematics.
