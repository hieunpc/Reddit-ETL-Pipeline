If you do then there's nothing wrong with using them in prod.Some more thoughts: The issue that I usually see in practice is that once you start introducing these things then notebooks' convenience is reduced, so there's a lot of resistance against controls that prevent people from just yeeting something into production. And once you let people yeet their non-important work, its only a matter of time before people start yeeting important work.",

Its real value is allowing systems to adapt as business meaning changes over time, and that benefit is easy to defer.* Tech debt is real, and under delivery pressure the cleanup backlog rarely wins. Even when modeling could be part of the design, timelines usually cut it first.* Storing source data indefinitely is becoming common, which makes replaying historical transformations feel like an acceptable substitute for managing change semantics.* Data teams are increasingly embedded in business units. Without a central steward, consistency across domains erodes even when the same underlying data is reused.* AI increases speed and lowers the cost of repetitive work, which further shifts effort toward shipping and iteration rather than integration rigor.* The idea of a single source of truth still matters philosophically, but if leadership doesn’t care when numbers don’t line up exactly, it’s hard to justify enforcing it.The common thread is that modern data systems are optimized for reversibility rather than correctness. Cheap compute, infinite retention, replayability, and AI assisted iteration all increase tolerance for semantic drift. Dimensional modeling still addresses that problem, but its value only materializes when the organization is forced to care about consistency over time. Modeling is rejected in favor of these other mechanisms which isn't a better approach but it does align with the systems that are readily available.",

We observed that the actual data loads we were processing were never big enough to necessitate a Spark cluster.2. Getting rid of Spark meant we could get rid of the whole complexity of running a JVM using the massive collection of libraries Spark requires (with all of their attendant security vulnerabilities) and replace it with a single, dependency-free DuckDB compiled binary.3. When we tested it against Spark on our real data it ran about 10 times faster and used half the resources (and _yes_, I'm sure the Spark code could have been optimised better, but that's what our testing for our specific use-case showed).Point 3 was the major one that allowed us to convince ourselves this was a good idea and sell it to management.",

Is it possible they were expecting you to address them and communicate your plan?The way you explain how you ask about a road map just feels like \"hey, got any work for me? what do you want me to do today?\".I only have your words to go by here, so my impression is likely misinformed. Just throwing it out there that if you really are asking about a roadmap and inserting yourself into other teams' projects and getting shut down, that seems to me that they're expecting you to manage and direct yourself more than you are.And now they're asking you what value you bring. Without actually being there to see for myself, this is the best take I can come up with.If I were you, I'd take the other job offer and consider the lessons to be learned here with the luxury of a fresh start. I've been in a similar spot and it is very frustrating to navigate. \"Do they want me to be my own manager?

I've been through a migration from Tableau to Looker, as well as standing up and maintaining a self hosted Looker instance, both at AWS shops. Quicksight wasn't really considered as an option for either project - one was in the public sector and they put a lot of value on the governance baked into Looker, and the other was scared off of anything primarily UI driven and really valued the idea of BI as code.The public sector project was pre-acquisition. I don't recall the costs from back then, but I'd bet that it was less of a factor than today.Quicksight is way less expensive, though I still doubt I'd choose it if I was the first data hire at a standup today. There are just too many no contract/free options to create decent reports that would satisfy a startup for quite a while.",

My recommendation is actually play around with a front end tool like Power BI and understand how data is used and what is recommended for best practices for how data should be structured. If you understand that and refer to the Kimball modeling techniques and can actually internalize it that will get you most of the way there. It’s not really something that is easy to explain in a video I don’t think. You need to be able to really mentally visualize how data ties together and what shape will make it easiest and most flexible to work with.",

        "body": "My POV is someone who is closely following the work happening in iceberg, arrow, ADBC, data fusion, etc. These are technologies that are making data tools more interoperable and standardized which is what open here refers to.—-So back to my point: The majority of the disagreement here comes from how people are defining “open.” This doesn’t mean open source. If you pay attention to the current developments, it’s about open standards and moving away from “proprietary interfaces” to tools and formats that can talk to one another and in general, enable much more efficient data transfer. These two alone unlock many downstream applications!As a small example: warehouses bundled storage, compute, and proprietary file formats together. That’s where the lock-in came from. If your data lived inside a proprietary format (like in Snowflake), you were effectively tied to that engine.The thing that’s really exciting and evolving is the maturation of standardized components of technological primitives that many modern tools use today. Open table formats like iveberg and delta, arrow (as a shared in-memory format), ABDC for super fast data transfer ,and newer engines like duckdb and data fusion all are working towards the same future. They’re all open source, want to converge to open standards, and if used together, enable an “open data infrastructure”. Which means the engine you use for AI/ML, real-time applications, and BI can all be based on data that lives in one storage layer and yet, can be run in any compute engine. Developers can live in a world where you can work towards running local dev in DuckDB and prod workloads in Snowflake. Minimizing vendor lock-in to me is just the a small side-benefit.Vendors are still vendors. Nothing about this means tools like Fivetran+dbt are suddenly open source. The idea is that they operate on top of this new infrastructure that is less restrictive than the old warehouse model for the technological benefits, but also allows them to compete with Snowflake/Databricks/etc at a completely different angle. If engines are swappable, these big platforms lose a lot of their architectural leverage. Now the power and thing to control is the stuff outside of that (I will let you think through that part as an exercise haha). All of this to say, I try not to take anything with face value. There’s always nuance. Yes “open data infra” is a buzz word and is marketing for sure, but if you follow the current state of technology, there’s real nuance here!",

Have you considered having an “intermediate” type table materialization? We have several large models that have to be broken up into intermediate steps because they would either overload memory, or perform poorly due to CTE’s that are called multiple times, which we can instead just process them once in a separate model. What gets annoying with this, is we don’t want any of these intermediate models taking up space in our warehouse, so we have to use a custom post-hook on any end-state models to clean up the upstream intermediate models. It would be really awesome if you integrated this automatically. Let us use intermediate as a materialization strategy, and have them be autodropped once an end-state model finishes. I know you have ephemeral and view materializations, but none of those solve the problem of having too much stuff happening in the final query that uses them. Thanks again!",

We're pretty happy with this. But when we want/need to develope new/different model features, we really struggle with versioning. we only have one database: production. So end up duplicating the entire tree of tables with _version[] appended. The development is then done in the version suffixed tables until eventually it eventually becomes prod and the old tables/definitions are deleted. Why is this bad? Massive PRs, drift between trees during dev, significant risk of manual mistakes, entire tree must be duplicated even for small changes (complexity and cost).Can DBT help with our architecture problems?",

Feels like either you're overoptimizing for cost when it's really not worth it or else doing something wrong when it comes to query optimization for the intermediate products to truly not be worth keeping around. Are your joins exploding? Is storage really so expensive that rebuilding these intermediates makes sense? Are you doing too much in your final query? Without more info it's hard to say for certain, but intermediate products aside I suspect something isn't as optimal about this scenario as you think.",

        "body": "Did that move about 3 years ago, can share my 2 cents.Why I switched: I realized the parts of DE I enjoyed most were modeling data for analysts, arguing about metrics definitions, and making dashboards actually useful. I cared less about perfect infra and more about “are people making better decisions with this.” Analytics engineering was basically that full time.Day to day difference: as a DE I spent a lot of time on infra, pipelines, performance, random firefighting. As an AE I’m still writing SQL and some Python, but I’m way closer to the business. More time on dbt models, tests, documentation, semantic layers, and collaborating with PMs / analysts. Less Kafka / Spark / k8s, more “what does ‘active user’ actually mean and can we stop changing it every quarter.”Step up or step down: it’s more of a fork than a ladder. If you like infra and scale problems, AE will feel softer. If you like modeling, metrics, and being involved in product / strategy chats, it feels like a step up because your impact is easier to see. Comp for me stayed roughly the same, slightly higher later because I became the “metrics owner” and that’s valuable at product‑led companies.Branding / career path: I brand myself as “data platform + analytics” now. Titles I see after AE: senior AE, analytics lead, data product manager, head of data, sometimes even PM for data products. You become a good candidate for roles where you’re the bridge between pure engineering and pure analytics.Gotchas:You will write a lot of SQL and stakeholder‑friendly docs.You’ll spend more time in meetings explaining data than tuning clusters.If you hate ambiguity and politics around definitions, it can be frustrating.With 8 years as DE you’re probably overqualified on the tech side. The real question is whether you want to move closer to the business and be judged more on clarity, communication and “does this metric make sense” than on how elegant your pipeline is. If yes, AE is a pretty solid move.",

I work with a DE only people and ive noticed a here a huge difference in design patterns. Their solutions tend to be one off purpose built imports. They almost never parameterize their solutions and any meta data used is typically a json file in the app and locked behind version control.When you are tasked with modeling an enterprise asset, you're forced to figure out ways of genericize your solution to support future initiatives. Alot of times this means data driven solutions for DE tasks... and I dont see many DE only peers that use data to drive their pipelines.

There is not strict time limit - if you have a new job offer in hand, then it doesn’t matter if you were at your previous place “long enough”.

Sometimes, teams decide to go with small improvements like standardizing ingestion and transformations, while sometimes they decide it’s a good point to redesign the whole stack.Where does most of your time go today, getting new data into the warehouse, or shaping it into something usable for reports?Thank you",

I don’t think it’s very good when people use it to create code they don’t understand or could t write themselves with more time, but right now it’s just a fact that it can write out code that manually would take me hours if not sometimes days and generate it in a fraction of the time. At this point I think it’s just a required tool to stay competitive, if one dev can get a solution in two hours and another takes a week doing it all manually it’s just not even a comparison.",

We have a specific workflow for each type of model that the LLM follows to generate the docs. Moreover, we instruct the LLM to produce the same structure of documentation for each type of model.For example, curated (mart/gold etc.) models are directed more for the end user and contain sections such as purpose, business use cases, metrics ect. So not too technical. Intermediate models ,i.e., models used to split up complex transformation logic are documented with the developers as an audience, so they are much more technical and basically explain what we are doing CTE by CTE.For most models #Business Logic is a section where we explain the specific business logic/rules implemented. The LLM infers these business logic by lopking both at the RAW query and inline comments. Also if it detects a business logic from a query, we instruct it to add short inline comments explaining it. So it goes both ways.Using LLM to generate documentation increases the doc coverage in our project and increases the uniformity of documentation structure across all models. In turn this documentation is then indeed used to power AI Agents for Data Discovery - think chatting with agents to discover which/where data is stored to answer specific request, so they don't answer the question, they just point the user to where they can probably find their answer. It may be also a documented exposure, not model per se. And eventually it could also power AI analytics, where they actually access a semantic/metrics layer or directly query the database based on all of the context. So yes, we document business logic and use LLMs to do so for uniformity and completeness.",

Another suggestion would be to avoid hardcoding the countries and the category, but put them into two seeds `top_countries` and `top_category` (these could become just models in future) and reference them in the query, so it's clear that you are picking the top countries and category and from where.",

So you better make *really* sure that what you measure is what actually adds value, or what you want people to be focused on.Doing something around story points is awful, but is one of a small number of equally bad choices. You can minimize the harm by equalizing story points available across the team, and using discretion to add points (or subtasks) dynamically for things that wind up being more complex than estimated. It still puts a LOT more pressure (somewhere) on estimating and updating points. And you will still get people trying to cherry pick tasks with the most ROI (points to level of effort) or pad the points numbers. Have fun with that!I would still rather have a performance review from a human who knows all the nuances of what I did and why. That way I can focus on doing things we (collectively and dynamically) agree matter, and not worry about gaming metrics. Then it is upper management's job to make sure those leaders are good at what they do, and my option to go elsewhere if they prove not to be.",

It'd be possible to sync a drive your account managers can access to a snowflake stage.

The tool foeces data into a standard and offers some agents for clean up. We have a fundign and culture problem though. Also, once the 50% that are eager to do things with data are showing the leaps and bounda they are making over other departments, we may get another 20 to 30% adoption.

On the other hand, on call has been such a major pain point and source of attrituon for the team that management has jumped through several hoops to make it more manageable, including hiring more people in the understaffed time zone and creating an AI agent to run oncall for us. Personally I feel it is all very performative and silly, but I recognize that in a global team, no formal oncall would simply mean \"urgent messages at all hours\" anyways.",

Then you can add an ontology that defines relationships between taxonomies, such as cities follow the laws of states and countries can enter free trade agreements, defensive cooperation with one another etc. Then you can draw logical statements from these, like if John is a farmer in midlands, Texas he can sell beef to a company in Brazil free for tariffs. You can build knowledge graphs on top of these ontologies that can ground LLMs into context specific answers.",

We might define a relationship that says \"A sibling is defined as someone who shares the same parents.\" The ontology can then (given enough input data) infer these additional relationships logically, even though they've not been expressly provided by the data.",

Then we create more tech debt to solve them.",

You might get some additional storage savings because JSONB is per-row, but that's pretty marginal saving that requires some benchmark to show the actual benefit of moving to VARIANT at this point.",

You end up spending more time wiring stuff together than actually trusting the data, and governance is always the thing you promise to “add later”.What worked for us was putting everything in one place. Governance stops being a separate project, and the bonus is that AI can finally use the context properly which speeds teams up a lot.Without a proper framework around it, it's not an easy job to do it.

You can always load golden data into redshift (or clickhouse) to support certain query patterns that the lakehouse may be less suited for. The issue with having golden data only exist in redshift is that it'll limit who can consume it. A spark job for example will not perform well when reading 100gbs of behavioral data from redshift (and the load will degrade query perf for other users)You mentioned not doing cdc yet but definitely don't stream cdc (or anything) from your oltp into redshift",

They’re usually good at giving you the vocabulary and a toy pipeline, but you still need to build 1–2 semi‑real projects yourself to not get wrecked in interviews.If you go with that first course, I’d use it as a structured intro, then immediately try to replicate something closer to a real setup: pull data from an API, land it in a warehouse, schedule it, add some tests, and wire up CI/CD on GitHub/GitLab. Even a small end‑to‑end thing like that looks way better on a resume than “finished X course”.If you can share the second course’s link or syllabus, people here can usually tell pretty fast if it’s just rebranding the same basics or if it actually goes deeper.",

Treasure I know have self-paced learning and certification available that would be worth exploring. There's not a lot of opportunity to try them out and learn by doing though, as they're all licenced commercial products.I'd recommend familiarizing yourself with the concepts of what they all cover (ingestion, customer unification, segmentation, activation), which can then apply across the board. Rudderstack have an open source offering that covers the ingestion and activation parts of their platform, so this may also be worth exploring to allow you to get hands on with at least part of a CDP.Also, personally I find very few customers that actually need a CDP, or manage to implement one effectively. In a lot of cases, they'd get more mileage for significantly less investment by implementing a data activation or \"reverse ETL\" solution on top of their existing stack. The likes of Hightouch provide CDP features on top of your existing warehouse at a fraction of the cost.",

Learn the patterns: traditional CDPs vs warehouse-based/composable setups, tradeoffs around data silos, real time vs batch, and governance.AI track: worth understanding, but I wouldn’t chase it as “I must build models.” The valuable part in marketing is being the person who makes data clean/unified/usable for automation and personalization. Most teams struggle way more with data plumbing than fancy ML.That’s basically it.

If you would not translate the 5 letter SAP column names going to silver and then gold, that would be almost crazy to me. We are mostly not SAP specialists as data engineers, and it would be a much larger chore to have to remember and translate the acronyms every time I want to use a column in any layer.Now for the Polish to English translation - can you expect this codebase and data system will be maintained by Polish people forever?Cause if not, the same thing as for SAP applies.After all it would be far more overhead than for (I suppose) you - a Polish language specialist. If it's a core service of the state infrastructure, then it may fly to not translate.And from the other perspective - if this wasn't data, but software engineering - if you were integrating with a system that for some reason was written completely in Polish, would you also write yours in Polish to ease debugging? For me - in 99.99% of cases the answer is no. Any translation to Polish would be in the frontend in this case.",

I meant to keep the naming in the Silver for those tables we don't change, for us it's just a historization layer in the Staging area, which 100% copies the source.The main reason I wouldn't rename in Staging is that there is no such scenario as \"just going to the Silver for data\". 99% of time, if anybody wants to get data from Silver, he/she has to understand the source system database first (in Polish) and all the communication will be held in the source system db structure language. So every round going to the Silver, we will perform those translations, same goes with testing and debugging.Speaking of the next layers, where data objects are prepared in more 'unified' way (say Invoice, Order, Customer..) 100% that's all in english onwards.Even on top of SAP tables on previous project - we just learned the tables, as it's so much easier without the extra renaming layer (and I am not a SAP person).Would this make sense?",

State management is much cleaner, and you have much more control over the streaming pipeline. Also, it's so nice having real streaming and not \"micro-batches\".In our case, Flink was used by a software engineering team. They use Java, as it was the language they already used.We then tried to adopt it with a Python DE team. Turns out, PyFlink is quite limited, and does not really offer the power you would want from Flink. DE teams continued to use Spark, because their streaming needs were much more simple (basically moving data around, transformations, some aggregations with no low-latency requirement).",

Most orgs use both, they're not competing tools.One thing that helped me when I was starting out: pick one real dataset you care about (sports stats, music listening history, whatever) and try to build a small pipeline end to end. Ingest it, transform it, make it queryable. You'll hit real problems and actually internalize the 'why' behind the tools.The cert mill setup sounds rough but hang in there.

My understanding is that the typical undergrad CS curriculum is not that in-depth relative to what you experience when you've worked in this field for a few years. Even if you majored in CS, you would've had to learn a lot of system design on your own through work experience. Recently, I did the AWS Solutions Architect Associate cert to build my knowledge in this area and I found that it helped to really understand the building blocks of cloud architecture and the purpose they each serve. The course I completed also covered a lot of common architectural patterns. I'm also interested to hear what other resources for system design folks here recommend.",

When it comes to working vertically on bigquery I didn't adopt it for a few reasons:\\- It could correctly parse queries with clear syntax errors (e.g., this one: with cte as (select 1 as x) insert into foo select x from foo -- the cte must be within the insert) \\- It didn't support nested types nor multi-statement queries (haven't checked if they added support for them in the meantime!)\\- I wanted to be it as fast as possible (I use inbq during pre-commit and CI). Parsing alone is 17x faster (compared to the last release of sqlglot with the rust tokenizer) on my codebase (586 sqls, 102k LoC, 1020 schema objects with an average of 30 cols per table). I will try to add some benchmarks to the repository in the next days",

You don't want big batch processes to hit Cosmos directly as they can flood its request capacity and cause issues for other processes. The change feed+function+eventhub is very simple to set up as you're just copying data as-is, it is essentially the minimum amount of reads to get the data, and it spreads the reads evenly over the day. Using capture on the Event Hub means you don't need to worry about retention periods or having some parsing error on the document, you get a full binary copy of everything.edit: Also if you ever needed limited streaming options, you can have a second reader on the event hub that does stream processing, while still running the normal capture for batch processing.",

However, we do bring in parquet files that get generated from a stream which gets way more new columns. The way I currently handle that is I check schema and if a new column shows up I alert for it and ignore it in the process so it can at least continue and do the job as the new field is rarely needed immediately for reporting. I basically have to handle that in a very similar manner, I update records for the most recent set of files with the new column data that did not get put in with the run today or whenever the column first came up.",

For example, you could say that you applied your traditional dimensional design knowledge to support an experimental design that aimed to, say, boost pipeline visibility (or something that viably sounds like why they hired consultants). That project didn’t quite meet its goals but it’s given you good ideas to try next time.

It only takes a clock cycle. Python made this obvious to everyone because it isn't c fast. There is basically no amount checking you can do that guarantees much of anything is true unless it involves the os helping you.So when you boil that down to it's essence it amounts to just skip the if statements and go straight to the try catch logic.The principle is called EAFP.",

        "body": "Howdy. Twenty-five-year-professional, thirty-eight-year passionate programmer here. I think you're feeling the right feelings but you might lack context.I used an LLM this weekend to knock out some database code. We have models (sqlalchemy talking to a Posgresql database), ORMs, and then GraphQL interfaces to fetch that data. So I had a collection of A's and I needed new collections of B's and C's and the interfaces for them. I described the problem to Copilot, and it did the work for me by creating new files, each of which was a 90% rewrite of an existing file.You see the problem already. \"Why do you have to rewrite 90% of a file to do something as simple as 'a collection, but for a new type of data?' Because our abstraction is bad.But here's the thing about software engineering in a professional setting: *the abstraction is always bad.* We are, forever, solving real problems real people have, balancing correctness, speed, and maintainability. As a programmer passionate about the profession, I want to push maintainability *all* the way to maximum.I am not paid to do that because it impacts speed. So we write enough abstraction to do the job and we limp it along until it becomes too burdensome to maintain.You see code as art. And it is! I love creating a beautiful abstraction that cleanly describes and solves a problem. I do my best to write that code in my hobby-time outside work. But problems in the real world are not clean, they are often ill-described, and the deliverable solution is, as a result, messy and tricky to maintain. We can and do refactor, but not until we're *very* sure that the problem domain is so well-defined that hiding it behind abstraction to make it less verbose and error-prone will be worth costing us the flexibility of writing everything long-form. You don't write clean code to solve the problem every time because you don't even have a clear picture of the problem you're trying to solve. But each possible solution clarifies the problem and gets you closer. And LLMs, it turns out, are *great* at recognizing fuzzy patterns and applying transformations based on that.If you treat code *only* as art (which you can choose to do!), you'll get paid like an artist. I'm not gonna tell you not to.But solving real problems for real people usually requires writing mountains of bad code fast. LLMs are great at that. They're also surprisingly good at fast analysis of bad (overly verbose, redundant, ill-fit to the problem domain) code and creation of more code fitting the pattern. Which means someone's real problem gets solved faster.No surprise people are gravitating towards that, because people have problems and want them solved.My advice to you is to keep the passion. The algorithms *are* beautiful. Code *is* art. And, as you've already observed with your peers, letting the AI spit something out you can't understand and putting it in production is just the Sorcerer's Apprentice enchanting the broom to carry water and then letting it go.But... Your mastery of craft will take you further *with* AI because you can use it to write code faster than your fingers can, and that gets real solutions into real people's hands faster.And programming and computer science is about the algorithms, but software engineering is about solving the problems human beings have right now.Good luck out there. The world is a big adventure right now. Bigger than it was when I was in uni. I envy you that, in a sense.",

I wouldn't recommend outsourcing your thinking to AI at this stage of your career however:You will learn a lot by noticing what AI does wrong and formulating why your code is good and AI code isn't. The sooner you start thinking about code quality, the sooner you will grow in seniority. Read books like Refactoring/Clean Code/Tidy First and understand the exact reasons AI code is bad.At my level that understanding turns into a fun problem to solve: What will it take to get AI to produce the highest code quality possible? This then turns into a problem of defining and automating the enforcement of good code, design and architecture.",

To be honest, some of it is not bad; if you'd trust an intern to make repeated changes to your software, then AI can usually be leveraged to your advantage. But if your codebase is complex and is 90% complete, AI often does a lot of harm along with some good.>And AI can't even code to save its life. It spits out nonsense inefficient code that doesn't even work half the time.Yeah... I once asked AI to re-write code to be more efficient, and it wrote it using an algorithm that many people think is efficient, but that I knew from experience wasn't very efficient in my case. It's as if AI takes common misconceptions as fact.>The fact that people are saying that \"Programming is dead\" infruits me so much.Cool word! I don't know what \"*infruits*\" means, but I like it already! I might even start using it myself! `;-)`>I want my classmates to learn and discover the beauty of writing algorithms. I want websites to have strong cyber security measures that weren't vibe coded by sloppy AI. And most importantly to me I want to write code.Honestly, I don't know what to say. This AI and Vibe Coding boom has only been going on for a handful of years now, so in another five years I wouldn't be surprised if the programming landscape will be very different. Perhaps competent coders like you will be in high demand in 2030.I will say, however, that AI is unlikely to go away completely, and I've found that AI results tend to help us ***provided that a knowledgeable human*** *vets the results* first. So if an AI generates results that are only 10% significant, a human can review them and find lots of good stuff. But if we blindly use AI results that are only 10%, 50%, or even 90% accurate, we're liable to get nasty surprises 10%, 50%, or 90% of the time.So my take is that blindly putting AI on autopilot has its problems, but using it as a search tool to find results we wouldn't normally find on our own is not so bad, provided we review all its results.",

It helps to know that.But: polymorphism -- methods of the same name doing different things based on context -- is a useful thing to understand.But: the more recent innovation of Interfaces is actually useful. It's not nearly as clunky as interitance, and certainly not as clunky as multiple inheritance. And it lets us do lots of useful things.

Right now with functions, you're passing data around like handing a folder to different people in an office. \"Here, calculate this.\" \"Here, validate that.\" Works fine. But the folder doesn't know anything about itself. If you change what's in the folder, every function that touches it might break and you won't know until it does.A class is giving the folder a brain. It knows what's inside it, knows what you're allowed to do with it, and can refuse things that don't make sense.Now that's great and all but let's think about this from a real world problem... say you have three types of reports. With just functions you end up writing process_sales_report(), process_inventory_report(), process_hr_report(), duplicating logic every time. With a class you define what a Report is once (it has data, it can be processed, it can be exported) and each type just fills in its own specifics. You swap behavior without rewriting structure.The honest answer to \"when do I actually need them\" is probably not for small scripts. But the moment you have two things that are similar but not identical and you're copying functions and changing variable names, that's the signal. You're doing manually what a class would do for you.I almost use classes religiously with the pydantic library when I'm building large machine learning or agentic systems, makes life ten times easier.

You will understand better once you have spent a year re-writing, re-writing and re-writing either your or someone else's code.ANOTHER VIEWLets say you wrote something to track prices on Amazon. There is a lot of setup, saving of files, formatting a report/GUI & overhead to a script that does this.You get it working and it's great.Then - someone says \"Make it work against Timu\" or eBay or some other shopping site.If you wrote linear functions - all the special code that deals with how Amazon displays & stores things is all throughout the code. It takes days or weeks to find all the spots in the code to convert to Timu.But if you had used a class to deal with Amazon - all the logic to deal with the Amazon web site is in a single class. It probably has 7-20 methods. You now have 2 choices:* Copy the Amazon class to create a Timu class and start changing things.* Get fancy and create a base 'website' class. Get the Amazon version working then get the Timu/Ebay version working.Either approach will let you modify your code to do something new a lot faster than if you wrote the original with nested functions.IMPORTANT: This higher-level design of your scripts comes from experience. You can totally use AI to help - but a human must look at the problem and decide how to structure the system. This is the difference between \"Design\" vs \"Implementation\". Let a human come up with the design, then let AI help with the implementation.",

It made sense to have a class for reading the entire file, and another class for reading a single line - of course nowadays you could just read the entire file into an array of strings, and then have a single function to split each string, but back then it made sense to me :)But again, classes are just a way of structuring your code differently - the \"problem\" it solves is in how programmers organize code, not in anything the code does.",

Functions call other functions, and the project works fine.Great that is exactly how any program work. There is no other way actually. The difference is how you look at functions together with data. You may actually code in an OOP style without ceating any classes at all. It all depends on what functions use what data. If you pack a set of functions together with a set of data and limit other functions from this data then you're basically coding in an OOP style.> If functions get the job done, what problem are classes really solving?Classes are useful because they tie data and code together in a very visible and safe way. With a class you can create a group of data and functions that work together and you can protect the data from changes from other functions outside of the class. You can also make the data work as one unit or object and tie operators to the object making it easier to use. This may seem trivial in a small program but in a large program with hundreds of files you can isolate the use of data and you don't need to check all files for usage.> This has become a big hurdle for me because almost every take home assessment or practice project I see either requires or strongly expects the use of classes, and I just can’t seem to wrap my head around how or where they fit.This is not difficult. Just look at the problem from a data point of view. What information is needed and belongs together. This pack of data is a class. What relations does the data have with other data. How many of each are there. What changes to the data is needed, these are the functions, or methods in OOP, that take the data as one parameter.Hope this helps you on the way.",

If you can build things that work and explain how they work, remote options tend to show up later than you expect. Keep going. You are already ahead by asking these questions now.",

This can also get into doing things asynchronously, networking, sockets, pipes, signals et. al.You'll need to learn to use some different ones, relational - SQL, ( sqlite, postgresql, mysql/maria, oracle ) and non-relational ( mogodb, etc. ). You don't need to become a super pro on these, but knowing the basics will certainly help. You can't get away without knowing something, at least SQL at some point, or you will stop being able to do anything. I once had to tell a developer this directly to his face, he learned it and became a superstar almost overnight.How will your tool be launched, maintained? You'll also need to know something about how to integrate your tools or apps into the overall system architecture. User launched, launched on boot, launched on application startup. So, some nuts and bolts know how of how to implement that in at least Windows and Linux will serve you well.Bash isn't too bad to learn, but it's hard to master. The whole documentation isn't that much and if you at least thoroughly peruse it, you can know what bash can do and go look up specifics when you need them. Pro Tip : use getopts for argument handling and your scripts will be more powerful than anyone else's and similar to other unix commands) Powershell honestly sucks to learn but once you have some bash down, AI can write most of the Powershell these days and you can just tweak it, which is a lot easier. When you get under the hood in windows, it's a hellscape, so if you don't already know, Windows sucks, but at least it runs now, mostly.Security. How can your tool or app be penetrated? How do you code to stop this?Payment processing: Can you take payments for transactions or periodic payments for services?Integration with service APIs: Can you connect to other things and call services?

[You may see a bad example code from my prior Reddit post in r/programminghorror](https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/1qqwo6t/this_boss_fight_trigger_code_in_a_video_game/)* Some string generation and normalization methods like .ToLower(), .ToUpper(), and .ToString() give results according to the *user's* Current Culture info, which can be pretty much any language around the world.

        "body": "First, domain names are like file paths, just backwards. Instead of /foo/bar/baz/folder/myfile, you have myrecord.domain.baz.bar.foo. The domain name 9gag.com is registered as living on a set of nameservers that the folks at 9gag control, and they can put as many records there with as many levels of dots as they like (up to the limits of the system, which maxes out at 255 characters for a full domain and at most 63 characters between dots).Second, the Internet predates the Web. There used to be many different services that a site might want to offer besides HTTP. Like an FTP server with files at ftp.whatever.com, a gopher server at gopher.whatever.com, a mail server at mail.whatever.com, a USENET server at news.whatever.com or nntp.whatever.com. If you were coming from inside whatever.com's network you might hit smtp.whatever.com to send mail and imap.whatever.com to retrieve yours. Back in the day these would likely have actually been different physical computers. And in that world, www.whatever.com was just another service - \"www\" for \"World-Wide Web\".But it did not take long for the Web to take over the Internet, after which pretty much everything else took a back seat to it. The web was everyone's \"front door\", so they wanted to make it as easy as possible to get to. For that reason, most companies arranged for their top-level domain (\"TLD\"), when looked up all by itself, to point to their web server's IP address. That way you could just type `whatever.com` into your browser to get there. (Later browsers would add this as a fallback behavior; if you enter 'whatever.com' and it can't find an IP address for that, it will give 'www.whatever.com' a try. But originally it was up to the site owners to make that work.)Rather than just duplicating the web server's IP address record, which could lead to forgetting to change both in the future, the equivalence is usually accomplished by making the \"www\" subdomain an _alias_ for the TLD. (Not the other way around, because the root of a domain can't be an alias for technical reasons.) In the DNS database, the value associated with an alias record is the \"canonical name\" that it is an alias _for_, called a CNAME for short; for that reason, they're also called CNAME records, and sometimes aliases are called CNAMEs, even though that's sort of the opposite of what it means. Anyway, your example is one of those: $ dig +noall +answer www.9gag.com a www.9gag.com. 300 IN CNAME 9gag.com.What that means is that when a computer goes to look up the IP address of \"www.9gag.com\", it gets an answer back saying \"use the address of 9gag.com\". So it has to turn around and look up \"9gag.com\" to get the actual IP address. (Fortunately for the sake of net traffic reduction, when your computer looks it up, your ISP's nameserver has likely already done that for you and just returns both the CNAME and the IP addresses - A records for IPv4, AAAA records for IPv6 - in response to the original query.)",

Writing and maintaining docs (even small READMEs). * Basic security awareness (auth, secrets, common vulnerabilities). You don’t need to be an expert in all of this as a student, but having working familiarity makes a huge difference and makes learning new stacks much easier later.",

Frankly in college this was a huge challenge, more difficult than just about all other courses I took. In the corporate world it can be more important than really understanding what you are doing. Yes that is sad.2. Learn to navigate at least two Operating Systems from the command line. This includes multiple tools that these OS'es deliver.3. SCM! Yes git and github are extremely popular these days but in the corporate world you use what they currently have set up. So understand the hows and whys. 4. Docker might not be a thing, in fact there are plenty of jobs that never touch the web. As a programmer you may need to target platform specific applications. So don't dismiss native app development. This Reddit seems to be very web development focused but people need to know there are many jobs where programming skills might be leveraged.5. If you are not doing web development learn the default IDE for the platform you are working on inside out. With modern IDE's this can take as much time as learning Python. This especially with AI integration. So if you are programming a Mac, that means learn XCode, if you are programming a PLC. that might mean RSLogix. 6. Which brings up AI, learn to leverage it as a programmer to improve your productivity. This is entirely different than trying to implement AI features in an application.7. Learn Python even if Python might not be your primary development language.8. Speaking of Python, spend some time with C or C++ at the command line. This should be covered in the first few classes of a good CS program. The reason here is that understanding how compilers, linkers and such, work is important, especially in the future when the IDE breaks. Command line development might not be the norm these days but understanding how an app is built is still required knowledge.9. Keep you math skills up. You may go years not needing a particular math skill in your programming career, then one day somebody asks for a specific statistical result. Yes there are reference manuals and text to refer to but in all honesty rusty algebra can really trip you up. Some people believe mathematical thinking and practice helps keep you programming skill honed, I don't know about that, what I do know is removing rust can really set you behind.10. Someone else mentioned typing, this is actually huge. I literally learned typing in high school well before I could even get access to a computer much less buy one. Yes this was a teenager looking towards his future - shocking. In any event it is a skill that makes the job much easier.11. Take an assembly language course as part of your college education. The point here is not to become an embedded programmer but rather to get insight into how processors work. In the past a good CS program required one quarter of assembly, in that case done on a emulator. These days you could just as easily buy a small microcontroller system and learn there.12. I touched on this above but when it comes to computing systems, the world is much bigger than delivering web apps and in some cases these alternatives pay much better. So don't dismiss these alternative paths in IT that may or may not be programming heavy. Examples: Security, embedded programming, industrial automation, platform apps, network management, compiler development (because most languages suck), interpreter development (because Python has been taken over by mad men), API and SDK development, test and validation, SQL (databases) and so forth. Others can add to this list, ultimately this should be an FAQ someplace. 13. Have a well defined minor. Lets face it programming as a skill by itself is not going to be a huge career driver. Rather it is how you apply those programming skills to solve problems. While a weak example if you are doing web development a minor in business might be a big plus. If you are going to be involved in embedded as stronger background in electronics can be helpful. If you want to work in the optics industry a strong physics background should be considered. Actually a strong physics background can help for many paths in a programming career.There you go a bakers dozen. I suspect the most important point above is to avoid this idea that programming means the web. There are actually many career paths to follow.",

The more indices there are, the more maintenance is required and the slower database updates get, so there’s a sweet spot somewhere where you’re getting performance indicators where you want them. Pro tip: it’s MUCH better to properly design queries to run optimally even without the index. Like avoiding correlations like the plague for example.

You can assign them to variables, pass them to other functions, or store them in data structures like lists and dictionaries. Not all languages allow this.one clarification is that you're not actually storing the function itself in the dictionary. you're storing a *reference* to it (called a pointer). The function exists once in memory, and the dictionary just holds a way to find it. That's why you write `\"start\": start_game` without parentheses, with parentheses you'd be *calling* the function and storing its return value instead.Typical use cases:```python# Command dispatchcommands = { \"start\": start_game, \"quit\": quit_game, \"help\": show_help,}action = commands.get(user_input)if action: action() # Now we call it``````python# Replacing long if/elif chainsdef handle_event(event_type, data): handlers = { \"click\": handle_click, \"submit\": handle_submit, \"load\": handle_load, } handler = handlers.get(event_type, handle_unknown) return handler(data)```This is cleaner than a sprawling if/elif block, easier to extend, and the mapping is explicit. You'll see this pattern in CLI tools, event systems, parsers, and state machines.The only things to watch for is to make sure the functions have compatible signatures if you're calling them uniformly, and don't over-complicate simple cases where a basic `if` would be fine",

It’s often just a vector implementation rather than a hash table, but there’s no reason it couldn’t be one. Like, in win32 programming a form button or other event source will have a vector of function pointers (void*) and will loop over them and call the functions when the button is clicked. Very normal.I will say that in a wholly owned system, you won’t normally use this pattern because you know the function caller and function to be called and don’t need an extensible pattern of hooks for third party consumers. You’ll just call the functions or call abstract or interface functions implemented by a known set of child classes. At most you’ll use an IOC container to control which implementation is used through configuration. Keep your system simple unless you really are building a platform.",

Here me out though: work is still work. You will find yourself creating ”the same” endpoint over and over again, while having meetings that should have been emails and tight deadlines. Second. You probably are ready. There’s no reaching the end of programming. Either some new version of your language comes out, some new language appears, libraries update with breaking changes… technology changes. If you need a graduation ceremony to feel you are ready, that’s ok, but then self learning ain’t gonna help much.Start one of those projects. The 3d section thing is the one I think is the most exciting. I think you like graphics programming, animations. Artistic stuff. Backend can get so predictable that it feels mindless. Frontend is more chaotic and feels new everytime but can’t get annoying when what you did last time doesn’t seem to work. That 3d section project is something in the middle there. Is more abstract code, closeish to backend and produces something you can look at.No matter if you get a job tomorrow or start your projects, learning is always needed and it will never end.",

It's almost self reinforcing that you'll feel like you need to specifically have been guided through a project in order to do it. Pick one of your things, and just try building it. If you run into a stuck, find a project that does that thing, look at how they did it, and implement as needed for your own. Alternatively, talk it through with an LLM. Don't use agentic modes, just open a chat with GitHub copilot or something and ask it for suggestions on how to solve X problem, preferably multiple ways.Personally, I'd take your art catalog project and write a web scraper that can scrape a single website. Then build it for a second site. Look at the patterns between the two scrapers you built, and build one that can effectively scrape both. Finding patterns and making code reusable is an essential skill to have. For what it's worth I think you've probably put more time into raw practice than I ever have. Just build, learn and rebuild when you learn something new.",

Also starting to apply is the only way you'll begin to build a clear picture of what work is available in your area and what skills you need to focus on to get those roles.From my experience, it sucks, but the best to get a job it to already have a job, and it can become harder the longer you've been out of work, I can't remember if the above you said that you were still self studying full time. Possibly trying to get into an IT help desk type role as a lower barrier of entry to support yourself while you continue to learn, and seeing if that's another avenue to break into the industry might be another idea to consider.Best of luck!",

Eh, programming languages are a bit like cars. They are a tool to achieve an outcome - just like cars. But, and just like cars, there are people that love a specific make or model and there are people that loathe it with a passion. But at the end of the day it is still just a car/programming language and does what it does.

You have asked should I learn screws and screwdrivers and are now wondering that as a result of all the haters on screws and the learning curve you might be better off learning something else like maybe glue or nails?To me, you are asking is the wrong question. You should be identifying what you want to do and then identify the tools used in that space.To continue the analogy, suppose that you ultimately want to work with metal including forming shaped items in a lathe.If you didn't specify that in the above (analogy) question and someone convinced you to definitely learn nails and maybe glue, can you see the issue? Screws and glue would have been much better to learn - not so much glue, but as an inroads to welding and soldering it might not be a total waste as if you learned nails (unless your ultimate plan was to make nails).I hope the analogy makes sense. TLDR, pick an area of interest (not a language) and learn what tools and languages are used in that field then learn those.",

The target resource in a POST request is intended to handle the enclosed representation according to the resource's own semantics, whereas the enclosed representation in a PUT request is defined as replacing the state of the target resource. Hence, the intent of PUT is **idempotent** and visible to intermediaries, even though the exact effect is only known by the origin server. In plain English, **PUT** is where the *user* dictates to *you (the server)* to make the resource at the URI look a specific way and it should always look that specific way no matter how many times i send that **PUT** request especially if the request is duplicated. It's an *update or insert if non-existent* like in SQL. **POST** is where the *user* gives something to *you (the server)* and the server has free range to do whatever with it (including creating a new URI where the thing *you* gave them will live. If you **POST** the same request multiple times, you can cause the server to have *duplicates* things (in this case, you could either replicate the full favorite list multiple times or end up adding the same song to the one list multiple times). It's just an *insert without a primary key* like in SQL. For your use case, you should just use **PUT**.",

It's hard, we do it anyway. An old-school method that I stand by for learning is working without copy & paste: typing things out is good for developing a syntax instinct.I think there's two big categories of gaps to distinguish though: algorithmic gaps and library gaps.Algorithmic gaps are gaps you have conceptually: Can you even break the problem into steps that are easier to code? This is very important to develop independently, breaking down complex problems into steps computers understand is arguably what programming *is*.Library gaps refer to not knowing specific tools that your language or libraries provide you. You mostly pick these up over time and it's not a big deal to look them up.For example, if you want to convert a string to lowercase, algorithmic thinking tells you that you can iterate through the string, convert each letter (with e.g. ascii code math), and build a new string. You should conceptually be able to write that code in your head in your preferred language, even if you don't type it out. Library knowledge tells you \"in python, you can do string.lower().\"Stackoverflow (and docs) is good for learning library knowledge. As you build more library knowledge in a language, it translates to having an easier time thinking algorithmically in that language.",

The first cli-tool I ever tried to make was a library system to store my records and books. The first version was barely functioning, and after literal days I finally managed to input my book and not have something crash randomly.

This will build familiarity, but won't build problem solving skills.Once you have the gist of how and why some functions work, start learning the terminology. This is arguably one of the stronger skills you will need in the age of AI. Knowing exactly what to look for or how to phrase the parts you are stuck on will help immensely.Problem solving skills are the top priority skills for all programmers. The ONLY way to build this is with practice. Projects are great ways to practice breaking down big problems into tiny problems. If you need to practice tiny problems, chug away at LeetCode, HackerRank, or other platforms that can present a problem to you and give you instant feedback on if your solution is acceptable.All projects/apps/features boild down to this line of thinking: \"how do I break this problem down into chunks that I can work with?\"I generally have a rough idea of what the end-project looks like, then I split that project into milestones, then I keep splitting each milestone into smaller parts until I find a place to start building out everything within the milestone. If your milestones are independent of one another, you can rotate which parts of the project to do if you get stuck and don't want to burn out. If one milestone depends on another, you gotta finish all of the first one before you can work on the second one.All project structures will be different. There are countless ways to solve most problems once they are larger. Usually the \"right\" way to solve something either won't exist or won't be evident until after you have tried a bunch of different things. The goal is to get your project to a working point, and to keep tabs of any new skills learned along the way.Edit to add: you will always be looking stuff up. There is far too much technical documentation for anyone to fully memorize. If you need something done quick, look for shortcuts or similar completed projects. If you have time to learn, deliberately practice your problem solving when you get stuck instead of looking up an answer right away. Try to default to documentation pages before hopping to stack overflow or AI for an answer. Feel free to search error codes if the traceback is too complicated to parse yourself, but don't get into the habit of offloading your learning to other people or AI when you first start out",

Programming language doesn't matter.It is more problem solving than actually writing code. My first professional programming job was in 1983. Today after I figure how or what the structure of the program should be, I sit down and just type. Most times I don't think about the code and somehow like magic, my fingers just type away. But I will tell you this, I learned typing in high school in 1978, not because I knew I was going to use it one day, but because I was 1 guy in a classroom with 29 other girls for an hour every day. It somehow just worked out that I was going to need it and can now type words out as fast as someone can talk. Learning computer language after computer language can also be really difficult. But what amazed me is the structured process of learning another spoken language. Classes always start with \"Who, What, When, Where, Why and How\". With those 6 spoken words, learning those 6 words in another spoken language and building on those, makes learning another spoken language so much easier.I'm fluent in Spanish, and Portuguese as Portuguese is basically Spanish with some French mixed in. I can survive speaking German on the basic level and I know enough Mandarin to order in a restaurant. All computer languages have the same basics as spoken languages. If, do, while, loop, for, next, with a majority of languages also having a switch statement or something similar. If you can get those procedures down, learning another computer language becomes so much more easier. It also makes fitting a square plug in a round hole so much more easier in a different computer language you may not be familiar with.So, don't spend that much time concentrating on the actual computer language and concentrate on problem solving to use the language you are currently working with.And if anyone really wants to know, when I sleep at night I dream in C#.",

What you seem to be describing is a process where you have a problem, and you arrive at a solution by searching for code written by others and copying that.You should be able to do simple things without doing that. For example, can you write a loop in your language that prints every item in an array? (Without looking for help, that is). In general you should be able to go from a detailed text description of an algorithm to the code without using stackoverflow. Pros use SO and AI, but we don't use that code verbatim without fully understanding how the code works. And if we understand the algorithm, coding it in the language of choice should be straightforward.My suggestion is to look for help in a language substantially different from the one you work in. Need a hint on how to do a binary search in Java? Look for Python code to do it instead, and YOU do the translation to Java. That will force you to know Java.",

The jump from recursion to memoization is way smaller than trying to build a bottom-up table from scratch.

Then eventually I learned how to make things using Python and then Java. I learned more out of school then I ever learned in school. My suggestion is to find a task you do today and just try and automate it. Have fun and don't treat it like another topic you have to learn. Treat it like a hobby. Cause you can have a lot of fun with it.",

People would overthink things too much. Tbh most programmers don’t really understand how everything fundamentally works unless thats what you specialize in or need to know which itself takes a long time and lots of effort to do. I genuinely think the best way to overcome this is to see what you are trying to learn in action by doing small projects. That way u can piece together your own unique intuition that makes it easier to understand. No one’s wired in any certain way I don’t think, just keep at it.",

If you go to the footer and click support/help center, then click subscription faq, the bottom faq is a link to a support post about the money back policy. It reads:> Our goal is to help you achieve meaningful results in your learning journey, and if you are not satisfied with the results you’re getting within the first 31 days of the initial purchase, we offer a Money-Back Guarantee. You can learn more about the policy and check the eligibility criteria here.If the conditions are met, you may request a refund by sending an email to info@codefinity.com or submitting a request. Please note that the Money-Back Guarantee is only valid if all criteria are satisfied. If you click the word “here” it takes you to a policy that says: > We are convinced that our product (hereinafter referred to as the “plan” and/or “program”) will bring the user meaningful results within a chosen Subscription period. If no results will be reached by the user, he/she is eligible to receive a full refund, if all the following criteria are met: 1) the user contacts us within 31 days after the initial purchase, 2) the user has followed the recommendations from the provided personalized plan at least during 28 consecutive days within the first 31 days after the purchase, and 3) the user can demonstrate that he/she conscientiously has followed the plan (ex.: provide photos and/or video of completion of recommendations, tasks, etc.).So their money back guarantee requires you use the platform for 28-consecutive days, following their recommendations, and document that you did what they recommended after that on day 28 (after doing what they tell you to), 29, 30, or 31 you have to email them and provide your proof of following their guidance to get a refund. If you get sick, your kid has a soccer game, life happens any time during the 28 consecutive days and you miss a day? Your SoL. If your documentation doesn’t pass there test? Well you’re not getting a refund. Absolutely horrible policy from a company I will never do business with.",

You end up wiring libraries together without understanding failure modes, limits, or trade-offs. That is not machine learning competence.Start by separating Python from machine learning. Python is a tool. Machine learning is applied mathematics.First phase: foundations.You need linear algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues), calculus (derivatives, partial derivatives, gradients), probability (distributions, expectation, variance), and statistics (hypothesis testing, bias/variance). Without these, concepts like gradient descent, regularization, overfitting, or loss functions are opaque symbols. Use textbooks, not shortcut videos. Expect months, not weeks.Second phase: Python as a numerical language.Learn Python only to the level needed to express math. Focus on:Core syntax, functions, loops, list/dict comprehensionsNumPy for vectorized computationMatplotlib for visualising functions and error surfacesIgnore \"Python for ML in 10 hours\" content. It trains imitation, not understanding.Third phase: machine learning from first principles.Before touching scikit-learn, implement algorithms yourself:Linear regression from scratchGradient descent manuallyLogistic regression with your own loss functionk-means without librariesIf you cannot derive the update rule on paper, you are not ready to code it.Fourth phase: libraries.Only after the above should you use scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow. At this point libraries accelerate work rather than replace thinking. You should be able to predict model behaviour before running it.Rules to follow:Avoid tutorial playlists that jump straight to neural networksPrefer courses that derive equations before codeIf math feels uncomfortable, that is the signal you are on the right pathExpect frustration; ML is not a \"learn a library\" skillBottom line:Machine learning is mathematics implemented in Python. If you skip the mathematics, you are not learning machine learning you are decorating code with buzzwords.",

There's always new problems and challenges to be faced and new things to learn that you haven't quite faced before, every time you think, jeez that was tough, I might just be a programmer now, there's always a new mountain to climb which would make you feel like you're starting all over again.I think it's just important to stay humble and realise that it's not really about reaching a destination where things click and you're now finally a programmer with nothing more to learn, there's always another lesson to be learned, things you can do better, and don't get into the mindset that you're now done learning, because you've learned xyz will make you believe you're more capable than you actually are, I remember reaching many important milestones, thinking I was now great, only to realise there was still things I was struggling at and creating real projects was showing me that. What feels really satisfying is achieving deep knowledge in one specific area, where you feel like, almost no matter what challenge or assignment were shot at you, you'd be comfortable you could solve it in a reasonable timeframe, without having to learn more frameworks or new concepts or doing tons of research and exercises. Realistically you're only going to reach this at maybe one or two niches, and that's extremely satisfying, but I guess my point here is that, stop trying to aim for some 'now it clicks', because it won't, there's always new things to learn.",

Review solutions and see what you missed and grow from it. Your goal shouldn't be \"I need to master React/HTML/JavaScript etc..\" It needs to be \"do I know how to learn to do X\". I would be reviewing jobs that you're interested in (junior front end developer for example) and see what it wants from you and start becoming familiar with those technologies.

The BEST we can do is SOMETIMES detect SOME cases of UB and emit a warning.There's an insidious nature to UB - no one can define it. Signed integer overflow is often well defined on hardware, that doesn't mean the C++ spec or the compiler gets to defer to the hardware. It's still undefined behavior. In fact, UB allows a compiler to optimize very aggressively. If, for example, you overflowed, you cannot reliably detect you've overflowed. You might think hey - just see if an increment of a positive results in a negative. But the compiler KNOWS overflow \"cannot\" happen, so it can correctly optimize the \"obviously\" impossible check out, and code paths that presume overflow didn't happen get a negative value anyway.Thus is the nature of UB. You're not going to win against the compiler's CORRECT assumptions that you're NOT going to fuck around with UB. And you don't know how the compiler is going to act upon those assumptions at any given time. Believe it or not, compilation itself is not inherently deterministic.Further, you may not even get consistent behaviors between program runs, or even while the program is running. And once UB has been evaluated at runtime, you cannot rely on what the program is going to do afterward.UB is to be respected. Your x64 or Apple M may be robust, but UB is what bricks a Nintendo DS, most famously when glitch hacking Pokemon or Zelda; you end up accessing an invalid bit pattern that fries some circuits in the ARM5 core.A lot of engineers are incorrectly dismissive of UB. These engineers would NEVER get a job working on critical systems, where that attitude is going to get a people killed, cause billions in damages, or cause unrecoverable losses.I hear the attitude - \"We're not saving lives, here...\" Yeah? You wanna diminish your company and it's product more? Do that in front of the CEO. You might not be saving lives with every product, but to be dismissive is also putting the revenue streams and the reputation of the company at risk. No one wants to hear it. It's as serious as it can be everywhere you go - and anyone who isn't serious about it is a toxic person you shouldn't be working with.",

You can't expect anything specific from undefined behavior.Most modern compilers will detect such an obvious attempt to return a pointer to a local object and *deliberately* punish you for this, i.e. they will make deliberate attempts to force your program to crash in case you attempt to dereference the pointer later. GCC, for one example, will ignore the `&x` in the return statement and explicitly return null pointer instead. This is what your function translates to on x86: getNumber(): xor eax, eax retI.e. it becomes plain and explicit `return nullptr;`.In addition to that, for such an obvious example as yours (i.e. a single translation unit, the function definition is visible at the call site), GCC will refuse to call the function entirely and instead generate a \"crash now\" instruction in the code of `main` (e.g. `ud2` instruction for x86 platform or something similar for other platforms).This is what your `main` function translates to on x86: main: mov eax, DWORD PTR ds:0 ud2Of course, the outcome can easily depend on the specific compiler, its version, is configuration and weather on Mars.

        "body": "This is very good, and I concur with the bulk of it. I think there's good reasons that Golang and Rust lean far more towards a model of \"These are the shapes of data structures and we describe them and then write functions to act on them\" (with a syntactic sugar to do method calls) than their predecessors. I'd also like to add one more thought in this space: as software engineering has cared more and more about the network and shipping data between execution domains, coupling data to behavior has fallen grossly out of favor because **behavior is local to an execution engine and data is not**. If my data is wrapped up in a class instance and I have to ship it over the wire, I now have to peel the \"shippable\" data from the \"unshippable,\" i.e. any dynamic method pointers, vtables, or other mechanisms to specify what class this is an instance of, and that's annoying. If your data is in a bog-standard language-supported generic structure, you can ship it to a bog-standard language-supported generic marshaller and be done with the problem of getting it on and off the wire.I think I'd like to tune your thoughts a bit, because OOP conflates a couple of goals and we might want to talk about how we toss the bathwater without the baby.**Encapsulation and interface boundary**: You mention the challenge of \"re-opening\" a class to add new behavior. Some languages allow that! It's generally considered an anti-design. The reason is that being able to wall off code and say \"You can touch this via this mechanism and no other\" is a feature that enables large, decentralized teams to collaborate better by hiding details. If I hand you a Date object with methods, you do not need to care how I'm implementing the methods (with the tradeoff being the only things you can do with *my* Date object are the ones the interface exposes). This leaves me free to change my implementation without breaking you (maybe; see Hyrum's Law), and that's extremely important for being able to iterate to a solution because we almost never know how to write the best solution the first time. The humble `string` is actually my favorite example of this; crack the actual implementation of strings open in many high-level languages and you find that they're fascinatingly complicated (implementing things like caching and memory-reuse on string copy and substring so that the programmer doing the most obvious things with strings doesn't immediately torpedo program performance). If programmers touched the string internals directly, it would make using strings in those systems a nightmare. Golang has interfaces and structs instead of classes and objects, but it also has the rule that you can't write a function that acts directly on the contents of a struct if you aren't in the same module as the struct so that developers can't write code that depends directly on another developer's implementation without consent.**Discoverability**: So I have a struct. What can I do with it? How do I find all the functions that could be applied to that struct so I don't reinvent the wheel? In OOP, the answer is simple: the methods on the class and the parents of the class. In the data-and-functions paradigm... Good luck!It's not quite that bad. It *was* when computers were slower and smaller, which is one of the reasons I think OOP took off when it did. Nowadays, with a language with good static typing and an LSP, you can find all functions that take a given data type as an argument (even grep will work in a pinch, although you'll have to do your own composition analysis). But OOP gives someone a big leg-up on the discovery problem by imposing a paradigm of how code is sorted.Though I highlight the above, I concur with OP: **you don't** ***need*** **OOP to get those things.** It's just worth noting that when you throw OOP out, you're throwing out a paradigm that tries to give you those things for free (well, for cheap... The documentation engines I've seen for Java factories kind of give the lie to the notion that OOP \"solves\" discoverability). The trick is to know what your plan is to get those things without OOP in the languages you plan to use.",

OOP is about message passing - which you've missed entirely, OOD is about object modeling, which is orthogonal to OOP and entirely at your discretion - I don't use it. Objects don't couple behavior with data, they couple behavior with state. You can use OOD to model data. You conflate objects with types, and your arguments are mostly about types. You misunderstand aggregation vs. composition. Your conclusion is confused, because ECS is an architecture you can implement regardless of your paradigm.You do have one valid criticism of OOP, and that is due to the agency of the object. Each object is an island of one, which for batch processing is bad, and for stream processing is worse. While you can make a character object and a string object - to get adequate performance, you can't composite one in terms of the other, so you get a scaling problem that composition in FP solves.While I still say stick with FP, I can also say the difficulties you have suffered from OOP is due to your misunderstands.

Emphasis on \"balance\" because overdoing it makes it harder to read.As for testability, I look for functionality that would be suitable to unit test separately. Functions with side-effects like writing to a database or calling an API are good candidates. It's easier to test when there is a clear boundary between the implementation details of side-effecting classes and business logic. It can also be a good idea to limit leakage of implementation details such models (errors, responses etc) of your internal dependencies.On a final note, when planning and writing code it's good to think about future extensions of that code. Writing complicated abstractions to support future possible functionality is usually a bad idea, but just thinking about how a current solution would hold up in the future can be helpful. Sometimes it can help you design a simple solution that is also future proof, and other times it just gives you a better understanding of what extensions are easy or difficult to make (would you want them).",

It will get you more benefit, both in terms of knowing your work is correct, and, later, being able to hand management a win.OOP is great in the right contexts, but here's the secret. OOP isn't for the computer, it's for the programmers. It's a different way to think about the code, and when you're in an environment where your software has hundreds of thousands of lines of code to maintain, thinking about it in terms of entities instead of functions and whatnot is helpful. You're not in that situation; defining all your objects would be a bunch of overhead with little gain.But correctness is important especially in a database context.",

Maybe it uses the same 5 functions which operate on a bunch of variables. Those can go into a class and you can refactor them by extracting the same variables from them into class attributes. Then you can use that as a black box. Drop in some variables, call a method, and it spits out the report. Collect these generalized building blocks into a library, but there is a catch. If you generalize them too much to fit all use cases they become these very hard to use super configurable objects. Lets say if a class needs more than 5 constructor parameter that should start to get suspicious. To know where is the line, that takes experience :)",

Having the bulk of your functions be side-effect free2. Using immutable data structures (e.g. don't modify your dicts/lists/dataclasses after they're created)...would be a good fit for the more pipeline-oriented nature of your task. You have data you're slicing and dicing, and want some reasonable assurances that each 'transform' or 'analysis' function you have in your script is self-contained and bug-free. Having a clean divide between IO code vs business logic and keeping mutation to a minimum are two good ways of helping you do this.The OOP paradigm is usually more useful when it's important you maintain certain 'invariants' around data: things like 'my data structure must always respect this property, no matter how it's modified' or 'all interactions with this particular 3rd party API must include these magic headers'. If you have a lot of these fiddly rules to manage, it can often be convenient to create a class that wraps around your data and presents a cleaner interface to the outside world.But I think this sort of need is rare in data-slicing or 'pipeline' style programs.Note that this sort of decision-making has nothing to do if you're writing a script or not. I've written short 100-line scripts that ended up making heavy use of OOP, and longer 5k-10k LOC production-ready services that used it very sparingly. My ultimate goal is to make the code as obviously correct as possible (which in turn makes it both easy to understand and modify). Sometimes objects can help with this, other times they won't.That is, OOP is not the same thing as 'clean code'. OOP is a _technique_ that can _help_ you write clean code -- but (a) it's not the only technique for doing so and (b) it's not a technique that'll be applicable 100% of the time.w.r.t. SWE best practices, I would look into:1. Writing tests and perhaps even a CI/CD pipeline for your scripts, starting with the more business critical / frequently run and modified ones. If people are actively making business decisions based on some of your analysis, you'd want reasonable confidence it indeeds behaves as expected. 2. Creating and popularizing a helper library that streamlines common operations. The goal here is to speed up the time it takes to author a new pipeline.I don't know anything about your company, but I'd imagine both correctness and speed-of-delivery are two factors that matter most to your team and your bosses. So, I'd prioritize applying practices that directly help with both.",

You will probably get more targeted answers in data engineering or data science subreddits.For starters, I would try using something that can translate between notebooks and .py files like jupytext. Would make source control and other checks a lot easier.Based on what you have said, traditional unit tests are often difficult to apply here and tend to provide less value in data workflows than people expect. I would focus more on testing the output instead. Things like row counts, nulls, ranges, schema changes, distribution shifts, and data freshness usually catch issues much earlier.A lot of the unit test advice you are getting is common in app and web development, where the failure modes are different. In data, things usually break because the shape or semantics of the data change, not because someone touched the code.As far as OOP is concerned, you are less likely to run into it in many data jobs. It becomes important when dealing with graphs or hierarchies. Otherwise it is mostly useful for providing structure.Generally, anywhere you are passing a lot of variables to a function or manipulating large dicts, you will probably want to turn those into a dataclass. For external boundaries like configs, inputs, or outputs, use pydantic. Use type hints everywhere, and use a linter and code formatter as well. I'd recommend ruff as a sufficient linter and formatter.I would also recommend arjancodes on YouTube. He has a lot of good content on Python design.",

I’ve done a lot better focusing on procedural, data driven, or functional programming designs. That isn’t to say that OOP doesn’t have its place. But lately I’ve had a lot more success waiting until the last possible moment to start using it. Like when my program is basically working, but I’m getting tired of passing around long lists of parameters, or a function seems to be tightly coupled to particular set of data. Only then will I introduce objects, and if my code suddenly feels cleaner and easier, then I know it is helping and not hurting my codebase. And usually I only end up needing a few objects here and there. Anyway, I think it’s still worth practicing OOP, but don’t feel obligated to use it everywhere. There are lots of other ways to organize your code. It is good to experiment and get familiar with as many as you can, to learn when one approach is better than another.",

Oop just means to group together data as objects with functions for those objects (originally without state, but today state is the center of oop -> state is probably the biggest cause of bugs, given that you test your code)Declarative programming is functional programming, reactive programming or logic programming. All similar, but for fp: you describe a function with other functions, to do that, you write functions that create functions and take functions as parameters, there is no state and a function only does one thing with one parameter… for example in procedural programming adding 2 numbers is done with a function like this: add = (a,b) => a+b Functional programming is a bit different, you have a function returning a function: add = a => b => a+b So, looks a bit unnecessary at first, but you can use functions to build functions… you can do: inc = add (1), while procedural would need a inc (a) => a+1. Increasing the items in a list is also easy: newList = oldList.map(add(1)), in procedural, you would loop over the list, getting every item, adding 1 and then pushing it in a new list. And oop would have a class inheriting from list, then have some build method that then changes the internal state to transform itself. (Yeah, there is a reason people mix paradigms)There are also other paradigms, like concurrent programming (lots of data and shared resources), constraint programming, dataflow programming (aka forced recalculation hell), metaprogramming (manipulating code, instead of data… extremely powerful, easy to fuck up, hell to debug and only really useful, if you know exactly what you are doing) and there is also pipeline programming -> build pipelines…And a few others… but yeah, can recommend functional programming within oop, so constants instead of state and single param functions, as well as higher order functions",

For example, Blockly with javascript is probably as simple as it gets for learning the basics. A big step up, Pascal is a strongly typed compiled language that was originally developed as a learning language and is available with a visual designer known as Lazarus open source IDE for writing desk top apps.",

It is like human DNA which contains old codes not useful any more. But this is done for a reason: to keep the full ecosystem compatible. And this ecosystem is what makes C++ outstanding still in 2026. Just check language popularity indexes (like Tiobe, PYPL, Redmonk); stack overflow developer survey results; Google trends etc. – both C and C++ are still widely used and within the top 5 languages (together with Python, JavaScript and Java).TL;DR: the best language to learn DSA is what you are the most familiar with.",

When the talk gets technical, it's usually at high level: which technologies I would use to solve a problem, why I would use them, what tradeoffs are being made going with one path over another. If I were interviewing a brand new engineer, I'd probably throw them a few language specific questions just to see if they actually know what they're talking about or if they're just throwing out buzzwords (what's the difference between a List and a Set? Why use a TreeMap over a HashMap?). I might ask how they would implement a multithreaded solution and what problems can arise from multithreading and how they'd solve those problems. I would expect questions on REST API development (maybe GraphQL, but honestly, I've yet to see a valid use case for that). I'd definitely expect questions on unit testing. Why would I not expect too many low level questions? That stuff is already implemented in various libraries and APIs or is well documented and available online or through an AI prompt. Nobody is going to ask you to implement a red/black tree from scratch in a real world environment. An implementation already exists and is thoroughly tested and optimized.

Java and Python are both fine for interviews. Pick the one you feel more comfortable writing quickly. Interview performance is mostly about problem solving clarity, not language difficulty.The bigger mistake beginners make is trying to learn DSA and grind random problems at the same time. That usually leads to frustration because you recognize solutions when you see them but cannot reproduce them later.A simple structure that works well is learning one pattern at a time. Study the core idea, solve a few easy and medium problems, then come back later and try to rebuild the solution from memory. That last step is where most actual learning happens.If you are transitioning from a service company, consistency matters more than speed. Two focused hours daily with review and recall usually beats long random grinding sessions.I built a small platform called [algodrill.io](http://algodrill.io) after mentoring people making this same transition. It focuses specifically on helping you rebuild solutions from memory instead of just recognizing them. It might help if recall and retention are the parts you struggle with, but the main thing is staying structured and consistent regardless of resource.Five months is enough if you avoid resource hopping and focus on depth over volume.",

It can make a big difference on how you solve these, but just pick whatever language is actually relevant to the kinds of jobs are interested in, so you're not spreading yourself thin for no good reason.I don't have an opinion on the resources you mentioned. What they're mainly good for is narrowing, say, the entire leetcode problem set down to a _much_ smaller subset that gives you a focused sampling of the major problem types. There are more problems on leetcode.com than a sane person has time for or need for, and there's a lot of overlap between many leetcode problems, so you want to avoid aimlessly meandering there and treating leetcode.com as the roadmap. * Start with easy problems only. * Gradually build up your toolkit of data structures so you learn when to apply certain data structures to which kinds of situations, and exposure to issues that can arise when writing code (off-by-one, index or boundary issues, logic errors, proper handling of numbers, concurrent modification issues, reference vs value, mutability issues, etc.)* Some \"easy\" problems may seem hard, and it may not be your fault * IIRC some leetcode problems were mislabeled, and may still be? Those sites that give you a more curated list might help avoid this issue? Anyway, I'd avoid picking random problems directly from leetcode.com itself.* Work on problems one at a time, give them a fair shot, but don't waste inordinate amounts of time being stuck. * Force yourself to think and use the tools you can recall. If you can't solve a problem in a reasonable time because you're simply missing the tools needed to solve it, then just look up and study well-written, non-code-golfed solutions, understand the key pieces, and move on. And plan to revisit those problems later on (put them at the back of your problem queue). Over time your recall of the problem -> solution mappings will strengthen.* Always be putting your solution (and test cases) in its own file that you can _run_ on your machine. * e.g. `node leetcode1-twosum.js`. You can also use a debugger, e.g. `node --inspect-brk leetcode1-twosum.js` when you run into problems.* Try not to see DSA as an isolated thing. * The main thing it boils down to is picking the right data structure(s) that suit the problem and help you meet the requirements, whatever they are. * A hard part is these problems can feel contrived and disconnected, which may be true, or may be an illusion - it depends. There's no one way to feel about it. I'm still deeply affected by having learned the \"text justification\" DP problem, and nobody can take from me. * Try to come to your own conclusions about the need/value of studying DSA problems based on the kinds of companies you're interested in. Feeling bad about this interview style is a common feeling, but not necessarily a useful feeling, depending on what you're after.* Timebox your DSA study so that you can make time for other things * Mostly to make sure you're spending time working on actual projects, so you're slowly getting exposure there. * Personal projects can give you freedom to try things that may be difficult to justify trying at work, and which can have very high learning/growth value. * Some experience solving DSA problems can benefit your implementations a bit, but won't help you learn how to design systems. So they can be complementary.For advice moving from a service-oriented to a product company...* if your current job has lots of greenfield projects with a short lifecycle, take advantage of that as a catalyst for growth, and as freedom to try slightly different approaches and to learn from past mistakes in code design. * Once you move to a product company, that can be less common. It can still happen, e.g. starting new products, or somewhat isolated subprojects or tools, etc. that serve the overall product in whatever way. But a lot of your time will be spent on things you may not be able to change easily.* Don't overly aggrandize product companies and don't belittle yourself and the time you're spending right now. * Have a mentality that your time right now is preparation for what's to come.* In your current job, try to be curious and thinking about your own growth. * If you have some decision-making power over which technologies or approaches are used, try to carve out a little space for yourself to grow, whatever that means. Try to keep it low-risk (don't put projects at risk due to making wild choices, but try to take whatever liberties you can that help you move in the direction of writing better code and making better overall system design choices that meet the requirements of the project). * If you don't have that power yet, then try to keep growing your skills and becoming so good that companies feel compelled to put you in that position and let you take the lead on things.* Prep for interviews, but don't wait too long to jump into the fray. * Usually interviews don't give good (or any) direct feedback, but ideally you have a rough sense of what you did well or not so well, and figure out what to work on. Dwelling on the asymmetry of the interview process won't help you, it is what it is.* Don't be too surprised when interviews don't go well * Just move right along to the next one, and don't get discouraged by the process. * Try to glean whatever you can, and cross-reference how you did with how others do, e.g. watch videos of mock interviews if useful. See what they do well and think about what you didn't do as well.* Ask your interviewers directly what you can do better!!! * Don't leave this up to HR to do (they won't). * Your fellow programmers _might_ be willing to say _something_ when asked directly at the very end. Don't be surprised if some cop out of this, but not all will. Either way, it's better than not asking and then getting absolutely 0 on the tail end.* Make sure to express interest in the company and product/problem domain. * When the interview ends with Q&A, be sure to have at least a couple questions about the team and/or company!! It can tip the scales in your favor a bit.* Don't automatically assume rejections are because you're bad. * Sometimes the company just has to pick between multiple people, and you may have been good but not _as_ good as somebody else. Well, what happens if that person gets hit by a bus, or quits, or whatever. Leave things on as good of a note as you can, you never know when a connection reaches out again, and luck may have it that you're still looking when they do.",

Interviews are not only about coding but about communication.If you are consistent 1.5–3 hours a day 5 months is plenty for most of entry to mid-level coding interviews.",

Vanilla HTML and CSS is going to be a headache long term so most developers use frameworks React or Vue to make that process easier, and it'll also help with organisation like you're finding hard now. Following [Odin Project's React course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-setting-up-a-react-environment) you'll see they use Vite to set up a react project. You then create your components in separate jsx files (which is like a mix of Javascript and HTML), then add those components to your App.jsx component. Should be easy enough. Of course it depends how far along you are now. If you're most of the way through your project, refactoring it to some framework may be more effort than it's worth.",

Here's the practical breakdown: If you want to stay close to hardware (embedded systems, robotics, IoT, firmware) - start with C. It maps directly to how you already think about registers, memory, and hardware. Arduino uses C++ technically, but in a very C-like way. The embedded industry still runs on C and will for decades. Companies like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and automotive firms want C + understanding of hardware, which is exactly your combo. If you want to pivot toward software engineering at a tech company - C++ is the better resume play. It's used heavily in game engines, high-frequency trading, operating systems, and performance-critical applications. But honestly? For most software engineering roles at tech companies, Python (which you already know) plus a web language would get you further than either C or C++. The real answer nobody's telling you: your EE degree + programming is a rare and valuable combination. Don't think of it as \"learning to code from scratch.\" Companies building physical products with software components (robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, consumer electronics) specifically seek people who understand both sides. That's a much less crowded job market than pure software dev. Start with C on Arduino since you're excited about it. Motivation beats optimization every time when you're learning. You can always add C++ later - it's literally a superset of C, so nothing is wasted.",

But if that’s “cheating” then this is what I would do. The trick here is to use memoization and working backwards(very common pattern). Find all the valid prefixes from the string before you check if the prefixes are valid. That way you don’t have to loop through the string every time you check a prefix. You only have to loop through it once.If string is “abc” then all valid prefixes are (“a”, “ab”). Then you loop through the prefixes list checking to see if the string is in the set. Checking the set is O(1) so it’s fast and looping through the potential prefixes list is o(n). Then you just append the valid prefixes to a results list and return it.",

Iterate from 1 instead.2. `findminlength` could be better renamed to `findShortestStringLength`.3. Use for loop in `findminlength`.4. Assuming that this is Java, don't concatenate a lot of small strings. Strings are immutable in Java, so you are creating a copy every time you do `string0 += string1`. Use a `StringBuilder` instead.5. Don't write comments like \"this loop iterates over indices of `strings`\", it is useless, you can get that information by looking at the code itself. But you can explain why you start at 1, not 0.6. In the else branch, you set `smallestLenght` to `zwischenergebniss.length()`, which will cause the loop to break, because `zwischenergebniss` has length of `i + 1` at that point. Insert `break` there to make it explicit and remove the `zwischenergebniss = \"\"`, because it is reset on the next iteration a second time.7. `zwischenergebniss` can be removed and replaced by `result`.8. You shouldn't modify the argument passed to the string. Nothing about the function indicates that the function has side effects, it should be pure. Save the first string in the array to a separate variable. Although, in this case it doesn't matter, since this it leetcode.9. Formatting is off. Put spaces between `)` and `{` on while loops and body of a function. Choose whether you want to put spaces after/before `=` or not. Stuff like thatIf I understand your solution correctly, the inner loop can be simplified by a lot. You need to count how many characters match and then replace `smallestLength` by that value. In the end, the `smallestLength` represents the longest prefix length, just return a substring of the first element in the string of that length. int prefix_length = 0; for (int i = 0; i < smallestlength; i++) { if (strs[0].charAt(i) == strs[s].charAt(i)) { prefix_length += 1; } else { break; } } smallestlength = prefix_length; // prefix_length is always <= smallestLength",

If the chance of a hash collision is one in 10^70, radiation bit flipping is a bigger problem.^1 A cryptographically strong hahs function allows to largely rule out attacks on that vector.**2. use hash for inequality** The hash guarantees that hashA != hashB ==> A != B. If the hashes are equal, compare the full data. If you store the hash along with the data, this allows to \"short cut\" many comparisons without accessing the actual data.That pattern is common in deduplication stores: even if you store many elements, only a few (if any) will have the same hash, and you have to compare the full data only against those.

So the contract with equals and hashCode is that 2 equal objects always return the same hash code.This does **not** mean that 2 unequal objects must return different hash codes. And there will often be such collisions. It's perfectly valid to have a hashCode that always returns a constant - this will just make your hash tables inefficient. If you want to use it for equality testing, this would only cover the negative case (unequal). But when both hash codes are equal you still need to properly compare the objects.And calculating hash codes is not trivial. A proper implementation will calculate the hash code over all fields, just like equals would compare all fields.Hash codes are used for hash tables to quickly find an index into an array.You can also use hashes that are unlikely to have collisions. This is often done for file-integrity. Here the hash is stored, so it doesn't need to be recomputed every time (one of the 2 hashes at least). And file I/O is also slower, making this more useful. Collision-resistant hashes are very useful, but still not cheap to calculate (not cheaper than testing equality), and hashCode* is definitely not collision-resistant.(* I'm assuming you're using Java?)",

        "body": "I don’t know about Dart, but in many languages it’s possible (or sometimes required) to override an object’s hash code function, so (contrary to some comments here) it’s important to understand how they work.No, hash collisions are possible. They’re even quite likely if a developer has written a bad hashing function on their object. Assuming everything else in the system is written correctly, these bad hashing functions will impact efficiency but not correctness.Comparing two objects for pointer equality is generally very cheap, and this is what `==` does in most languages. “Pointer equality” means that the objects are in identical memory locations (whether on the machine or on a VM; the details are complicated but not relevant right now.) This means the objects are really and truly “the same”; if you mutate one, the other will be mutated as well, because they’re the same object.Comparing two object’s hash codes is frequently cheap, but not as cheap as pointer equality, because hash codes are often highly optimized and frequently cacheable. If the compiler/runtime knows that the object hasn’t changed since the last time you’ve computed its hash, it can choose to reuse the result of the last hashing operation instead of running it again.Comparing two objects for value equality can be expensive. “Value equality” means that the objects are conceptually the same. For nested objects, this generally means walking the whole object graph and comparing each piece of data in both objects to each other. For small objects this is cheap, for big objects it might not be. Value equality is a conceptually stronger guarantee than pointer equality, because it tells you that two objects “mean” the same thing, even if they were constructed at different locations. However, this can be fragile in the presence of mutability, because if you mutate one of the objects they might stop being equal.If you want to check whether two objects have value equality, usually you do this:1. Check whether the objects have pointer equality. If they do, the objects are equal and you’re done. Pointer equality implies value equality. 2. Check whether the objects have hash code equality. If they don’t, then they are unequal, and you’re done. Hash code inequality implies value inequality. 3. As a last resort, check whether the objects have value equality. Hash codes are especially necessary as a performance optimization when using objects in collections which have limitations around item equality. `Set` and `Map`/`Dictionary` are the main ones which come to mind. In a set you don’t want there to be multiple copies of objects which are equal to each other, and in a dictionary you don’t want to add duplicate keys. In both of these situations you’re not just comparing two objects for equality, you’re comparing one object to a whole bunch of objects and seeing if it’s equal to any of them. In a big collection, this would get more expensive as the collection gets bigger. Without hash codes, adding N items to a set is an O(N^2) operation. So the way these data structures are usually implemented is by using “buckets” of items which have hash codes in a given range. When you want to add an object, the data structure computes its hash code, then finds the bucket which it belongs to (an `O(M)` operation, where `M` is the number of buckets, or in some cases `O(1)`, depending on the implementation). Then, if there’s already items in the bucket, the object being added is compared to every item in that bucket until an equal object is found. (`O(N)`, for a much smaller `N` than before). All in all this is asymptotically much, much faster.Of course, as I alluded to earlier, mutability messes this whole thing up. If you mutate an object in a way that would change its hash code then the algorithm used by the data structure will no longer perform correctly and it will be left in an invalid state.Hopefully this helps. If you have any further questions about this I’d be happy to answer them.",

By this, I mean that no one is paying to sit there and be able to replicate what you just saw in the tutorial by any sort of deadline, and you said yourself that you already have a job. Money isn’t an issue either, so that’s the two main things that should cause you that much stress out of the way!I’m a beginner in this field myself, and it’s an overwhelming ocean of knowledge - I constantly see acronyms that I have no idea what they mean, kinds of protocols or algorithms or terms that have no meaning to me. If I came at this with the attitude that everyone knows this and I don’t and that’s why I can’t get a job, by that logic I would never be able to get a job, and I’d freak out. But it’s ok. The thing I just said about everyone knowing it already isn’t true. You will get this - you only need to understand that this is not something you can just master in a matter of weeks. It will likely be years, especially if you work full time like I do too. But to get to a level where you are competent enough to have a few noteworthy projects and seem employable? Not so long. Whenever you learn any new skill, all the knowledge you pick up is fragmented at first. This field has millions of fragments so it’s very daunting. But you will find one fragment that starts to glue others together. And the panic you feel will subside. Trust me.",

Personally I'm reading what you wrote here (\"panic attack\") as hyperbole, a bit like saying \"Whoa man, I literally shat my pants when I saw how friggin' complicated the problem was\" -- amazingly, if you said that, I would not even dare to think that you in fact soiled your pants. Additionally, if you had the poor sense to use such an analogy whilst we were all eating or something like that, then I'd have to restrain myself from my intuition to scold you for such a poorly chosen metaphor in the circumstances.And notice that this linguistic evaluation (of whether you actually shat in your pants) would not change, regardless of your choice or not to include the word 'literally'. This is due to the word 'literally' being 'literally' abused for what appears to be at least hundreds of literal (or \"literary\") years of prose. Personally I think it's just a funny in-joke that keeps getting re-invented from generation to generation (e.g. you literally took that too literally).So, fellow thread-posters here suggesting therapy, methinks you dudes/dudettes are being way too literal.",

Whether your boss will accept the time estimate is a totally different question, but if it can be theoretically done, you must be convinced that you could do it given the time and resources.We need this because it will get you through the debugging marathons where you question your sanity, and the long stretches of coding until the product comes together in a form that someone can use. This is our thing that separates us from salesman who are used to failure on 90% of the cold calls they do.And this mindset can actually be trained, by solving enough simple to gradually more difficult problems that you become used to success.> whenever I exit the comfort zone by closing the tutorial videoThe tutorial zone is no comfort zone, it's a non-programming zone. The comfort zone should be problems you know how to solve without external information. Ultimately all of programming is applying techniques you've used before to new problems. Very few of us actually invent new structures or algorithms.",

Then the blank screen isn't blank anymore, I'm just filling in boxes.Also: break it way smaller than you think. Don't try to \"build a project\". Try to \"make one button that does one thing\".

Some \"official\" solutions are not optimal even with the learnt skills up to that point.You have to understand that in programming nothing is chiseled in stone. There usually are several paths that lead to the goal. Some are more efficient than others, some are better readable/maintainable than others, and some are good middle-grounds between efficiency and readability/maintainability - that's the ones a programmer should strive for. If your solution is super intelligent and efficient but you are the only one who understands it, it is useless in production, but may be nice for competitions, if your solution is super slow but extremely readable, you're on the other end of the scale and should work on your speed.It's all a matter of experience.

Courses like CS50, MOOC, Boot.dev, and so on, are amazing courses taught by the best; but they will always pale in comparison to any in-person multi-faceted learning environment. It's this reason I enrolled in a CS course at the local community college after having taken CS50x/p/w/g, completed most of boot.dev, and read a little more than half a dozen textbooks on Python, C++, HTML-CSS-JS, Design Patterns, and DS&A. Nothing beats listening, seeing, discussing, doing, and being critiqued all in a 2 hour block.Humans are social animals, and you're human. You should be around people learning like you and get involved in a learning community. You'll find you retain more, have far more fun, and ultimately are all around better off from it.",

        "body": "Generally learning a wider variety of tasks lets you grow stronger as a learner and problem solver. Long held general advice, theory of mutualism, et al. Being well-rounded makes is a good skill for connecting with people too.Plus being able to create art you want, even if only as a hobby, is just a good skill. I do programming, a little bit of traditional arts, and digital arts as hobbies and the intersection of them is damn fun. I enjoy being able to draw/create whatever workflow. I quite enjoy employing common algorithms in interesting ways \\[re: not LLM/AI stuff as that wasn't around!\\]; I get to pursue a much wider variety of workflows/techniques since I can draw on a wider skillset.Learning how to paint, the mixtures, pigments, etc \\[I got quite into paint this last year\\] has really taught me the details of finishing, coating, and protecting anything I may make - from furniture to housing. And a quick coat of paint can make a used, cheap piece look brand new!Plus I find learning both digital and traditional art reinforces the core skills one needs to make good art overall. Composition, colors, lighting, texture, detail density, etc - all necessary to practice regardless of the medium.What's the point of being a programmer if you don't also get a bit of time to pursue other topics that you enjoy? I think it's worthwhile to read history, but I can tell you it will not be getting me raises anytime soon!Lastly, when you learn things, it may open doors you previously would not have been aware of. The twists of life might open a door or two that would've been hidden otherwise.Finally, the AI stuff concerning \\*making\\* art is such a strong debate I think all the noise around it always misses the forest for the big tree. Thinking on it, however, one faces the same core issues with generative tools as you did with old school algorithmic/digital art!Say my 200x200 random pixel generator is able to theoretically produce any piece of art ever. (any piece in a 200x200 space of course) The problem is, statistically, most art produced is random noise. It's all \\*seems\\* the same - despite both pieces of noise being very different in terms of data - because both noises communicate the same exact thing to the audience. \"This is random noise\".IMO, to make impactful art, you've\\- You've got to understand why and which elements evoke what you want in the audience. \\- You've got to understand what is important, what isn't, and tightly control what is important. \\- And generate interesting ideas within the work of any sort.The first two require lots of practice and is a soft skill - much like cooking w/o a recipe. The last one, I find, is much easier when I pore over an artwork and let the creative process compound on itself. (And study lots of extraneous subjects or other artworks to pull more ideas from!)Much like you've got to learn how to draw your basics before you can start breaking the rules, I think the biggest problem AI presents is it can undercut the learning process, development of personal styles, & creative process. Much like if you only ever followed \"paint by numbers\" kits and never challenged yourself further.\\[Though once you've got your art down, and you find it has a useful part in your workflow, I figure it becomes a tool like any other -- IP issues not withstanding. Albeit I'm cantankerous and refuse to give up any control to blackboxes : P. And can't really see how'd I use it in a way that isn't covered by photobashing & art archives ha! But I've no need for productivity either, not working in a professional context.\\]",

So if you want to be an expert, you need to pick a field and master it. You can still have a good understanding of surrounding domains and basic knowledge of things further afield, but you need to focus on specific areas to become an expert.For example, lets say you want to become an expert in large data stores for corporations. That means being an expert in databases, accesses methods, scaling and many more things. But it is also useful to understand access methodologies such as Enterprise servers and how they operate. This can contribute to making decisions like performing processing in database (using complex SQL, procedures or maybe even UDFs) or do that processing in the server but requiring multiple fetches to the database. On the other hand, it is still useful, but far less so, to understand the front end technologies and their supporting services.So, what I am saying is pick something (or a small number of related things) and learn them well, but also identify the main things that surround them and be well aware of them. Then identify the next layer of things and be aware of them, but no need to know them as well as the things immediately surrounding your area(s) of focus.IMHO.",

I understood memory management very well at a conceptual level - specifically the heap and the stack. But I had never really had to delve deeply into actual memory allocations - I had once written an exception capture mechanism (i.e. I had to roll my own try/catch/throw mechanism for our C application) which required understanding the stack and call frames very well, but we hardly ever used dynamic memory allocation (i.e. the heap), so I never really needed to diagnose it.But, this failing application did and I had to learn the specifics of how the C runtime managed the heap.So, looping back, I learned the basics of C and the facilities like malloc (so breadth-first), but as I learned them I also delved under the surface. Then when I needed to I drilled down to whatever depth was needed for situations arising.Hopefully that makes sense.",

I have about 25 years experience and there are definitely still days where I hit a problem and I just go \"This is chaos.\" But if someone were to ask me to define thinking like a programmer, I think the most defining skills are 1. Being able to look at a small problem and imagine how you could represent it on a Von Neumann machine (read-writeable memory, processor, code, instructions run in sequence).2. Being able to take a problem too big for (1), break off a piece of it (without completely losing the original problem), and treat that problem in isolation. Over and over again, until you get a piece small enough to apply (1).Every problem solved with computers is, at some fundamental level, solved that way. Every game engine, for example, wasn't written by someone \"writing a game engine,\" it was written by someone writing a sound system, main coordination system, input handler, scene representation, rendering system, logic system, and so on.",

Work with whatever your favorite stack is, doesn't matter. If you need an idea, just copy some other business but put a little twist on it. Whatever you build, it has to be deployed and has to have a chance at making real money. At least enough to support yourself once it's established. Not a consultancy or something that teaches you to code, either. A real product. Have AI help you come up with an idea and business plan. But it should be something you're at least a little interested in. Building an actual product with real customers will teach you more than your boot camp and CS degree combined. And you can start it today. Might as well. Since you're looking for a job anyway, hire yourself and get started. The hours will be long and the pay will suck, but at least you'll be a professional developer. Good luck!",

Your final sentence alone says that you aren't learning programming because you want to make games, you are learning it because you want the game developer job and if it isn't handed to you quickly, you will quit.You haven't even learned the fundamentals of programming yet, nor have you really delved into what game development actually is. This raises my hackles and plants a giant red flag for me with you.Game Developer jobs are unstable and pretty overpopulated with individuals fighting for those positions. It is also the top underpaid and underappreciated markets for developers to be in. People get laid off all of the time because a game got cancelled, the company was absorbed by another company or the game is complete and they have no more work for you.I'm going to be real with you, I don't think you are cut out for game development based off your post and I don't think you are cut out to be a developer based off your post either. The reason for this is because you will need to practice and study for a minimum of 4 years, plus have a BA degree to even be considered for entry level jobs in the field.

This is basically what a coding bootcamp does.I recommend free code camp for fundamentals and learning basic coding principles/syntax.

My advice is use ChatGPT for now as a mentor really dig into details on the prompt like “you are now my mentor I don’t need you to give me code but advice and hints on the code and where to find the answer as well as detailed feedback, let’s keep it simple code and we can scale as well go” something like that.

The best part about Linux is that you have control over everything, which is also the most dangerous part about Linux lolSo you have this environment that lets you do anything, what do YOU want out of it? Do you want to browse the internet? OK, download Firefox. You google how to do that, and you learn that you have to type out ``` sudo dnf firefox```Do you know what that command means? If you don't you've just been given a guide on what to learn next. You research a bit and learn about privileges and using the sudo command. You research a bit more and you learn that dnf is your package manager and why it makes your life easier.Now tomorrow you decide you want to talk to friends on Discord, you already probably can guess how to do it, but just in case you can google how to download the Linux version. You arent surprised by the command they give, because you already learned what package manager youre using and what that entire command does. At first this simple process took a few steps and research, but now you know enough to do it quickly and confidently. This snowballing approach is how you learn Linux, you dont watch a 10 hour youtube video or take a class. You think \"it wish my computer did X\" then you research how to do X. It's like carving a statue in marble, you sand away the bits that annoy you or dont work until you've gotten down to what you want. Anytime you think \"thats annoying\", figure out how to stop it. Ever have something in your terminal spin forever or crash? Thats annoying, and many beginners just close the terminal and start over. That works... buts its kind of annoying. That should be an itch you scratch, and of you look around you'll discover that you can kill that process by hitting ctrl+c. Ever try to paste something in the terminal and it doesnt work? Thats annoying, if you research a bit you'll learn why it does that though. You'll also learn that you can paste directly into the terminal by using Shift+ctrl+v instead. Don't \"learn\" Linux. It's your computer, USE Linux, and if it seems like there should be a better way of doing something, find out what that better way is. Everyday you'll find something that pisses you off, which is great because that means you are being given something to learn on a silver platter.",

But now, with DevOps using cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP I do not think investing much time on Linux only will get a job in a company easily. I have worked with experienced DevOps who did not know how to configure NGINX, because for load balancers there is AWS ELB.Prioritize cloud platforms like AWS over Linux.For habits, I would stick with CLI tools when possible instead of using GUI for everything. For instance, use git in the terminal. It will help when configuring CI/CD pipelines.By the way, I am a software engineer. Still I think my points are valid. Cheers.",

Do a full curriculum like The Odin Project if you can. If you need a first book to read, try \"The Pragmatic Programmer.\" If you want to go deeper after TOP, first learn TypeScript or an OOP language, then read Head First Design Patterns, then Clean Code. Then go to Leet Code and work on data structures and algorithms. You don't have to go too crazy there. Answering easy and medium questions and understanding Big O is enough for most. Then focus on SQL. Being good with data and databases and knowing how to avoid things like N+1 queries is critical for production work. But, like I said, be patient. Don't fall into the trap of thinking you have to know all of this before you can build something real. Continuing to build projects *while you're learning* is the single most important thing to do. All the best coders I know started building projects before they were ready. Good luck!",

Is `buf` even an array? That increment might be UB. Is this code intentional or not? There's no way of knowing. The code only tells us what is, not what is supposed to be. There's no expressiveness here, no type safety. This is code that gets people killed, rockets exploding, or billions of dollars lost. There is no modern excuse for it.",

It's not 100% related to your end goal, but a cheap and easy starting point. Arduino Starter Kits (including the actual Arduino system) are in the range of $50 to $100 and you get lots of hardware (sensors, LEDs, motors, etc.) to play around with.Maybe, ask also in guitar or synthesizer related subreddits, or in the embedded ones, like /r/esp32, /r/arduino, /r/esp8266, /r/nodeMCU, and so on. /r/vsti and /r/synthesizers with their related subreddits could also be viable resources.Also, my general advice would be to focus on *learning programming* first, and there, since you will need C++ use https://learncpp.comWe normally don't suggest C++ as first language as it is a difficult language to get into. Normally, we recommend Python (with the MOOC [Python Programming 2026](https://programming-26.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki), but that would not get you in the direction you want. You'll most likely have to bite the bullet and go in the hard way.What you will also need are really solid mathematical foundations of higher concepts. You'll need to go into waveforms, maybe FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation), maybe DFT (Discrete Fourier Transformation), and a lot more. Synthesis and Signal Processing use higher mathematical concepts. You'll need to work with sampling intervals, ADC (Analog to Digital Converters), and DAC (Digital to Analog Converters) and much more. You'll also need to have some musical understanding about the frequencies, etc.",

Anecdote aside, thank you very much for the advice and the subreddits, I will definitely check those out and ask for more specific advice there. I already have a pretty solid basis in understanding sound and music on a physical level and in audio form as well, since my major is in Creative Music Technology and I've got some excellent lecturers that help me understand a lot of the electronic components and processes that make up sound and audio.You're right though, I shouldn't get too ahead of myself and I'll definitely focus on setting up a solid foundation in C++ first and foremost before trying to interface with hardware. It'll be a couple of years before my bandmate is skilled enough to make anything that requires my input anyway, so I'll just focus on that for as long as I can. Again, thank you very much for the advice, and I hope you have a good rest of your day!",

Whether that client code are other parts of your program, or whether you provide a library to third parties inside or outside your organization, this is important for maintenance.Getters/Setters are for the case where you want to allow access to a field, but want to be able to make them write-only or read-only, or later replace them by something that isn't a field at all.

If you use a public variable, you could just do something like 'vol = 200;' you want to limit volume between 0 and 100. You thus use a setter that has validation built in so you can't set it to whatever you like. Later you then prevent yourself (or someone else) from accidentally writing an incorrect or impossible value. 2. Keeping code lean:Sometimes variables might only be internally used in the class. I might not need to know specific information, in those cases just setting the variable private prevents it from showing up in your IDE and or documentation, keeping things leaner3. Magic numbers: Magic numbers (or magic strings) are plain numbers in your code. Say you want to give a spefic tag or ID to something, and you write 'var = 5;'. The '5' could be turned into a variable and made private. This to reduce magic numbers, and allow easier modification later. (hand in hand with #2) 4. Coding standards/consistency:The common pattern of private variable with a public getter/setter is used for lots of reasons (including above) Because of this sometimes it sorta makes sense to just apply this to variables that might not really benefit from the approach, just to keep your API consistent.",

This is actually very real use case in military/intelligence applications. Not all users have the same security clearance, so you might need to filter a list so they only see what their clearance allows them to see. You could create a helper function to do the filtering everywhere the Getter is used, but you run the chance of someone forgetting. The better solution is to handle it in the Getter itself. Then there are the more common use-cases where you need to handle not allowing null or uninitialized values. It's much better to handle data validation and filtering using mutators and accessors.",

Code all over your program can still effectively (but indirectly) cause reads/writes to the memory of instance data, but that indirection of external code having to go through member functions to do so means that you get to define those interactions, essentially providing an interface for mutating state over time, rather than possibly having many parts of the application make a grab for members. Where you need to guarantee things or you have invariants etc. this can matter a lot. C doesn't have protected/private struct (same as class in C++) members, and I don't know any C programmers who particularly care, myself included. Where it is needed in languages that don't have it, you see idioms like \"pimpl\" etc. to hide things, but they also introduce runtime overhead. It's nice to have compile-time enforcement without runtime cost. It can be very handy when refactoring not to have references to member data everywhere too.I've tried not to lecture on encapsulation because you can find that anywhere online.Side note: it's rarely useful to use private over protected. Protected will encapsulate whilst allowing you to derive without having to change code in the base (from private to protected).

Your requirements are specified by the professor and do not change. *At worst*, the professor will provide an additional assignment that requires you to build upon your existing work (and this is steadily becoming rarer because we continue to lower our standards in CS programs).2. Maintenance of the project lasts for approximately one term, at which point your code goes into a folder with all the other projects, never to be touched again.3. The only people who will use your code are yourself and maybe some groupmates.So - fixed requirements, short timeframes, with no customers. Let's change that.---People dispute exactly when the C++ standard library became \"the standard library,\" but cppreference says 1992, and that sounds pretty reasonable. This breaks all three of the above items:* Its requirements change over time because the platforms and operating systems that people use will change. * The maintenance time is indefinite (34 years and counting, and despite the hype over Rust on this site, extremely likely to be another 34 years and counting).* Billions of people depend on it, however indirectly (literally everyone with a web browser).If you read the code for, say, `std::istream`, you're going to find A Gigantic Mess. You care about none of that. You care about the [public methods specified by the standard](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream.html), which should not change. And, indeed, they generally have not changed for the 30+ years that this language has existed, and they probably won't change much in the next 30 years.At the same time, people are always looking to eke out more performance. If they find a tool to get more performance, they are going to use it. They might not care, despite their better judgment, that they are taking advantage of an implementation detail that could change at any time. This tendency is summed up as [Hyrum's Law](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/), which states> With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.Access specifiers establish boundaries. If you make something public, that **locks the maintainers** into preserving that thing for all time (30 years and counting. Choose wisely!) Making it private means that you can mess with it however you want. Change it every version if you want. All changes to `public` are breaking changes and will likely get you roundly cursed 30 years from now.",

I know it's supposed to help with productivity, but for me it's just an irritating distraction that breaks up my flow.Also, when I was learning to code, my professor specifically instructed us to use an IDE like JGrasp, which does not have or offer any of those hints or suggestion pop ups(at least it didn't back then).

Safety is multilayered, and has dimensions at compile time, runtime startup, and full runtime.The fact that you need five classes to add a unit feels like a tip-off for me. In many languages this problem is addressed much more simply with phantom types.Correctness-by-construction only stretches so far. It gets more expensive to maintain as you try to enforce more and more complex properties. At some point it becomes better to insert runtime checks and trust your test suite.I can’t help you with a misplaced sense of personal guilt (see a therapist if that’s a common theme in your life) but I can say that you’re taking the wrong approach here. Code’s correctness is multifaceted; complex code may feel safer, but it’s also more likely to contain bugs due to its complexity. A type system is indeed a static analysis tool, but static analysis is only one tool in the toolbox. Maybe focus on unit testing for a bit and explore property-based testing as a cheaper alternative to becoming overwhelmed with your own designs.",

It has a number of competing replacements. Apache Spark is one of the more popular replacements. Apache Spark (or often just \"spark\") is available for the programming languages \"scala\", \"java\", and \"python\". Python is the most popular recently. Java has better \"error checking\" and execution performance, and Scala is the language where Spark truly shines, but is a bit more work to learn.Considering current market trends, I'd recommend using Spark with Python, as that seems to be popular, even if it is not as nice as some options that might be better (from a strictly computer science point of view).",

Sometimes it'll be OOP, sometimes DOP, and sometimes something else completely. (Functional programming? Bringing in a new library or tool? Microservices? etc).Note that if you do this, it's likely you'll end up with a hybrid approach, using different techniques for different corners of your overall project.

Well i got a list that are my favorites. But every language has their pro's and con's and some have more pro's than con's.My advice. Learn how languages work under the hood.Why is X better? Why is Y faster? Etc learning this makes u able to answer the questions. Rather than making assumptions.Why would you use a saw to put a nail in the wood?Also its not so much about language syntax at all. Languages also evolve and drag a lot of bad design and bad patterns. Its also about structure and how do you attack a problem.How do you build software that is both fast, extensible and easy to read. Composition over inheritance.If u go deeper and deeper... U will more and more hate OOP and love the beauty of functional programming.Anyway a list of my favourites areOxCaml(close to the perfect language), Rust(most usable performance, but far from perfect), Python(most flexible and huge ecosystem)For example Python is a glue language. Fast prototyping and scripting. But u can easily make a program in rust. And use that inside Python. Nice practical combo. But these are just languages and it also depends what the market asks... U want to make money or really be a knowledge bomb and know how languages work inside.",

Javascript is the language that runs in your browser, and it is not even remotely the same thing as Java. Second, leave multi-player off the table entirely for the time being. That's a long term goal, don't even think about it yet. So choose a platform: web or desktop? You can do desktop apps with Java easily enough. If you're going web, Java isn't going to enter the picture unless you're designing something with a front end communicating with a back end, which, again, is probably too ambitious as a starting point. So choose a platform for your UI and figure out how to mock something up that looks vaguely like what you want the game to look like. It doesn't need to be pretty, you can always revisit and iterate as you learn. So your ui might just be a playing field and a row of cards at the bottom to start. Then define your game rules -- simple rules are fine for starters. \"Cards have a cost assigned to them and a player can only play cards they have the necessary resources to play\" for example. So implement the logic necessary to check player resources, subtract spent resources, generate new resources, whatever.",

Controlling the playback with an on-screen UI moght need more complex software but if no control is needed a simple script might work.The raspberry pi doesn't normally have power controls though so it will be continuously playing even when the TV is off. But as a \"dumb\" video player that your parents only need to switch to HDMI to watch,, it could work.",

You can follow code, but generating it from scratch uses a completely different part of your brain.Here's what actually helped me bridge that gap:1. After you finish a tutorial, close it. Wait a day. Then try to rebuild the same thing from scratch without looking. You'll fail the first time - that's the point. The struggle is where learning happens. Check only when you're truly stuck, then close it again and keep going.2. Don't try to write a full training loop from memory. Start with just the data loading. Then just the model architecture. Then just the loss calculation. Build up the muscle memory piece by piece.3. Once you're comfortable with basics, try implementing a simple paper (like the original ResNet or a basic transformer) using only the paper and PyTorch docs. No tutorials, no GitHub repos. This forces you to translate math - code yourself, which is exactly the skill you're trying to build.The LLM dependency isn't bad for learning concepts, but if you want to actually *think* in code, you need to struggle without it sometimes. Treat it like training wheels - useful, but you gotta take them off eventually.",

Watch beginner-friendly tutorials but also read code written by others, GitHub is great for this. Try to rewrite code snippets in your own words, and keep expanding your vocabulary, maybe even make it digital for easier searches.For the “what can I do with this info” side, building real things will help. Since you’re already working on a blog, I'd try adding new features as you learn them, like comment sections, dark mode, or simple animations. Each small feature will force you to research and apply new concepts :)Don’t overwhelm yourself by learning every language at once. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are a solid trio for web stuff. Once you’re comfortable, maybe try Python for its versatility, or even SQL if databases interest you. You could also use browser extensions like Gloss, which overlays instant explanations on YouTube videos, super helpful when you hit a wall with unfamiliar terms in tutorials, so you don’t have to keep pausing.Most importantly, take breaks and don’t be afraid to revisit basics. The “aha” moments pile up over time and patterns start to click. Keep going, and don’t hesitate to ask for advice along the way.",

So no, it’s not a game changer (yet)",

I've used it to great effect at debugging. I would paste in some logs from one service and that elevated qps of errors started showing up around this time and it would go digging (monorepo, so all dependencies are in the same codebase) and walk the the graph and find some subtle change in some shared library in some other part of the codebase our team doesn't own that's used by a dependency of our team's service.Distributed systems are hard. Debugging distributed systems is hard. Agents make that just slightly easier. Not in all cases. But in a lot of cases they can save time.In the hands of a good engineer, they're a force multiplier.> When pressed on the issue, our CTO admitted that on average, pre things like Claude, our engineers only spent about 1 hour per day on actually writing code. The rest was spent in meetings, writing RFCs, designing, etc. To me, this says that coding was never the actual issue.The thing is, even a staff engineer is still writing code. Yes, they might be spending a lot of time writing and review designs and directing high level roadmaps and in a lot of meetings and influencing at the strategic level, potentially cross org, cross-product, but coding is still a crucial aspect of their role.I used to be a skeptic, but agentic AI can seriously help with the coding aspect of one's job.",

        "body": "It's not like we've seen this before. Arguably COBOL was one of the more successful attempts to make programming less complex and more accessible to more people. It also allowed the problems computers could realistically be allowed to solve to become significantly more complex. Imagine going from getting the result from a three-day run of a computer program and manually copying it into a report, to having the computer just write the report for you. Of course, the new complexity enabled by the language also fueled demand for more people who could work with it. Many of the ones after that were pretty much just scams, designed to look good in the most trivial cases while being more complex to do any significant work on. With stuff like 4GLs and no-code, you could implement an app on the complexity level of \"hello world\", but those systems were very brittle and would require implementation level details to anything much more serious. Management would get excited about them and buy a bunch of servers for hundreds of thousands of dollars and saddle engineers to do a project with them. The results were always the same, the project would quietly fail after a few months and the the servers would quietly end up in a basement somewhere.By the end of the 90's companies were starting to get wise to that sort of thing and a new con was needed. Thus began the era of peddling outsourcing and process improvement as the silver bullets that would solve all your company's problems. Outsourcing had a couple of issues; it was always much more complex that originally anticipated and salaries in the remote country would start to skyrocket overnight to the point where any exchange-rate-based savings would not be worth the extra complexity of coordinating teams across multiple contents for most companies.To a degree a lot of that process would have worked given adequate buy in from both management and engineers. The process guys were pretty up-front that the process could end up with an overall slower but more predictably successful pace of development. Managers frequently just used the tools to flog engineers and set unrealistic deadlines. Corporate results were mixed, but the agile coaches made a lot of money and that one mediocre programmer on your team would end up as a mediocre scrum master.The AI companies have managed to secure billions of dollars from companies and investors. The problem is that to obtain predictable results, you have to spell your requirements out, in English, with such precision that you could have just handed those requirements off to a development team in the first place and easily had your product implemented. Where else have we seen writing requirements in English with machine-level precision? Oh yeah, the COBOL example I mentioned earlier. The AI industry has successfully invented COBOL. And so the cycle begins anew.Should the industry ever manage to produce a truly sentient AI and should that AI not be prohibitively expensive to run, they no doubt *could* replace all those skilled engineers out there. That AI would also replace all the managers, all the finance guys and pretty much every other skilled profession on the planet, overnight. Fortunately investors only care about the next quarter's results. The smart ones also know how to diversify their portfolios. They also know that the US government has a history of stepping in and saving companies that are \"too big to fail,\" when all those extra zeros eventually go poof.So the AI companies will either eventually stumble upon the formula for a sentient AI, though I have my doubts about the current models they're using, and the world will see an cultural revolution that will dwarf the industrial revolution, affecting much more of our society than engineering jobs. Either that or they'll collapse under the weight of their undelivered promises and the guys at the top will quietly take their golden parachutes and the billions of dollars they made and retire to some island estate somewhere where they don't have to look at the smelly peasants who haven't figured out how to run such a successful scam. Personally my money's always on a few people making a lot of money and a bunch of servers ending up gathering dust in a basement somewhere.",

No one will meet those promises over the period of a couple of quarters or years - depending on how much they overpromised 4. A bunch of leaders will get kicked to the curb. When you go on a 3-4 year journey where your CEO promised that AI would revolutionize everything and instead you revolutionized nothing, you spent a buttload of money, you laid a bunch of valuable people off, and now you're categorically worse off than you were 5 years ago. In the meantime, you will start seeing some approvals to start growing headcount again because all these companies that cut a bunch of people are going to find themselves not being able to do anything.For context: I am seeing a lot of companies that are already in steps 3 and 4, so this is not purely speculative - the speculative part is whether or not most/all companies will follow.I think some companies will be able to avoid 4 if they didn't overpromise or if they limited their AI investment to smaller subsets of the company. But I've been seeing most companies saying that AI is going to allow them to reduce headcount in the entire company.",

In my opinion, a lot of these managers also tend to be one-trick ponies. They really have no idea how to adapt to different and smaller companies. I worked at company that hired a bunch of former telecom folks and built up such a bureaucracy of middle managers that I was attending 2 hours of meetings a day just to provide status updates to 4 different middle managers. They only reason they did that is because they was just what they were used to, not because the depth and breadth of our org was doing needed it.

If you've been following the market, you're gonna notice a bunch of companies seeing their stock drop when they say they're investing in AI at this point. Wall street wants to see the profits now.Also, I don't see this being talked about a lot, but AI companies like OpenAI aren't even profitable. Remember Uber subsidizing rides with VC money? I bet at some point when the rubber meets the road, these companies are gonna have to jack up prices some 10x, and execs everywhere are gonna be faced with the fun prospect of having way understaffed eng teams and astronomically expensive operating costs from all the compute they need to keep the lights on for these GenAI automations.",

The C++ contractor got excited and when I asked him why he said ...I am going to get rich fixing their shit.The message here is the field may change (tools, patterns, ideologies, trends, etc), but for now, talented individuals will find a way to capitalize on the chaos.",

You do not want a team full of super ambitious rock stars. They will fight over projects and fucking nit pick through meetings so they can build their precious artifacts for promo, to the detriment of actually getting good quality work done and delivered.It is good for the team AND the business to have strong, reliable senior levels who are happy to put in good work at their level. Ideally you have a manager who understands this, but middle management is often worthless and full of people who couldn't make staff+ but wanted more money so switched into the management track.

Promo or not, it's still in everyone's interest for you to grow professionally rather than stagnating/regressing, even if it's not happening at promo-grinding pace.

I'm well into the architecture phase of my engineering career so the raw implementation details feel like grunt work to me. I've only kept that implementation work close to the vest before because I've learned the hard way \"If you want something done right, do it yourself\". But AI now lets me have my cake and eat it too; AI does the implementation grunt work 20x faster than I ever could, yet I get to stand over its shoulder for every line of code and mentor it in the right directions when it gets a case of the stupids. All without any of the drama from overly sensitive juniors who need me to tiptoe around their feelings just to explain why xyz is a bad professional practice.I have no idea how the next generations of senior+ engineers will get the experience they need to actually be senior+ quality engineers in a world where AI is eating the junior to mid engineering roles alive, but that's an industry and C-level problem not something I can solve. I'm only grateful I'm at the tail end of my career rather than the start of it...it's going to get a lot rougher for newer engineers before it gets any better.",

If all goes well, you’ll develop some prompts for things like coding standards, security, token, credentials storage etc, and you’ll work toward being able to do extended systems design work. It’s deeper storyboarding in collaboration with the product team. It’s more fine grained contracts between FE/BE/Devops. And then you start to build things and code review them and get multiple parts of a service build for horizontal scaling and personalization up and running so you can start to test how it scales. What’s happening is just another layer of abstraction on both sides of the engineering team that allows engineers to shift the engineering focus from how it connects to other services and third party apis and and towards how they interact in practice.",

If you look up the term you will find a two dimensional plot with autonomy capabilities on the X axis and trust in autonomy on the Y axis. Then plotted along the y=x line will be calibrated trust.The simple idea being that if you have a low amount of trust in autonomy in an area where it has high capabilities than you are under trusting it. Meaning you are not taking full advantage of the capabilities it has to offer. and on the other hand, if you trust it too much in areas that it doesn’t have much capabilities then you can be setting yourself up for failure.The reason this pneumonic is significant is because of the term calibration. It is important for companies and indeed individuals to constantly recalibrate, and reevaluate the level of trust they have in these tools. If you evaluated it a year ago and haven’t done so since, then you are very likely under trusting some of the capabilities the professional tools have now. In particular, the models that dropped late last year showed dramatic improvements in the ability to assist in early dev work and project scaffolding.I don’t mean to overhype the capabilities, but I see a lot of posts where people espouse, the limitations of a year ago, as if it were still true today. The reality is the situation is evolving quite quickly, and everyone should be reevaluating on a continuous basis.",

Especially employees outside your team?- when others start a new feature / project, are you pulled into all day meetings to help them design it even when you will not be involved in the implementation?- when nasty production issues arise, are you pulled in to figure out a path forward? If so, is it just for your team or is it across other teams as well?- do you help identify future work for your team or do you just wait for product to tell you what to do?- do you help management negotiate resourcing requirements for a new feature / project by doing things like creating POCs and then following up with your recommendations for an implementation plan and the amount of teams / engineers involved?The key difference between staff/principal and senior is this ability to navigate the landscape outside your team. You are seen as a technical expert that will influence the direction of your organization, not just your team. If you’re merely leading your team by helping them break down work and reviewing their PRs, that’s senior level work, not principal/staff.Spend the time focusing on the relationships with other teams and becoming invaluable outside your team and the promotion will eventually come.",

I don’t know what it is because I presumably never worked with you, but it’s something about you that makes leadership not trust you. One thing I can tell you from your post is, stop trying so hard to chase the next level. I have seen this trap from so many different people (my self included), from juniors to staff+. I have seen people get bitter and go “I’m doing the same work as this other person, why I’m I X and they’re X+1?” But almost always, there is something that is really holding them back. I worked with one mid level once who was extremely bitter that they were not promoted to sr yet (the left amazon as a sde1 or 2, applied as a sr to my current company under the impression that they’d get promoted to sr quickly, and then quit 3 years later as still a midlevel). They were extremely difficult to work with honestly, and mostly because of that bitterness. They couldn’t take an ambiguous piece of work and deliver it. You had to really hold their hands to get them to deliver code. And it wasn’t even because they didn’t know what they we were doing, they did. It’s because they were so focused on proving themselves as sr, they fought against every single plan and needed to fight every little suggestion. They wouldn’t take any feedback, seeing feedback as a ding against their capabilities. They’d write “clever code” that was hard to read and often had edge case bugs, and if you mentioned it during a PR, then they’d just complain to the manager that I’m holding up the review. They’d publicly call out their manager when there was a decision that was made that they disagreed with. These behaviours are what held this person back, and it’s the same kind of behaviour that I’ve seen over and over again. Often times, just focusing on what’s on your plate and delivering outstanding work there is all you need to do. And then you have a convo with your manager and say “I’ve been building great stuff here, and I want to make it to the next level, give me more work please.” Promos are often not done by just your manager, they are done by a committee. You need a manager who is both respected and willing to back you for promo, and other managers who know your name and not willing to fight against your manager to their people. If you piss of another team by being difficult, then you can be that manager is going to bring that up and it’s going to hurt you. You need to be open and collaborative with others. Work with your manager to line up work that aligns with your strengths and weaknesses and focus on knocking those out of the park with out the expectation of promotion.",

Most of the time you only have enough “social credit” to rate 1-2 team members with top marks, maybe an additional one if you start cashing in chips to go to bat for them.

This can be for many reasons, they could have targets they're trying to fit across the orgs, budget impacts, etc. It happens when ratings are the mechanism for budget forcasts as well as professional evaluations. It does stink when it feels like you have a non bias system of evaluation you've applied and then it's updated under you.What I do in this situation is try to keep the feedback details the same as much as possible, remove any references to the specific rating (like, Surpasses Expectations vs Meets) in the feedback. I give them all the factual situations and behaviors that lead me to rate them this way. I walk them through how the company evaluates performance (if it is documented by the company), how I apply those criteria in my own evaluations and aligns those evaluations across managers. This is good feedback for the employee, the things they are doing well keep doing, the things they may want to change, maybe they want to change them, and so on. Did they get peer feedback? Do you have impressions of their work? all great to share. It's hard when they people you manage are asking for specific feedback to get to the rating they want. \"What do I need to do to be rated as Exceeds expectations mr manager?\", but you don't have as much agency as you think.I don't lead with this, but like others have said, tell them the truth if the rating or discrepancy between the feedback and the rating comes up or they ask. Explain the macro conditions and the process for aligning on the ratings that can give them some prospective.For yourself, yes this is the conflict with the job. You could try to change companies, good luck, but these kinds of things come up in different ways at most companies I've found. Personally, I say this because I do it myself, you may be feeling inadequate or like a failure at justifying your ratings to your non-technical boss and retreating into stubbornness or rigid principle as a defense mechanism. Try to separate one from the other.I try to find value in the human relationships with my team and the coaching opportunities between me and them. If they flourish in this system, and the team flourishes I feel like I'm doing a good job.",

But all the jobs I'm getting are in series-B startups, and they are completely incompatible with being a parent to a child with high needs. I actually tried, but things are just so unstable now. I got fired from a job after about 10 months despite busting my ass on it, and then the next job I found, I got laid off in about 8 months.Tech careers are so all-consuming, and if you want to run a family while in one, it means you're spending a ton of money on daycare, babysitters, after-school programs, summer camps, cleaning, and meal services. You can't turn on and turn off these things at will. Like I get my kid into a pretty expensive daycare that's taking 30% of my take-home, and then I get laid off... I can't just pull her from the daycare because I currently don't have an income, and then put her back in when my income stabilises. I have significant savings, but this type of uncertainty and demands means I can't actually build enough savings while I work, and my savings get depleted fast when I'm between jobs. And I'm not actually able to be a good parent if I'm constantly worried about getting fired or laid off.And AI is cool, but it feels like I'm expected to be up to date on using AI in my job, and I have to spend time outside of work to explore AI and stuff. Which I really don't have the time for. So I'm going back to school to get a teaching credential. There's a huge shortage of math and science teachers. I need something stable that offers benefits, so I'm not constantly worried about the high cost of COBRA coverage when I'm between jobs. The biggest benefit is, even if the job isn't flexible, I'm just DONE at 5pm. Even if I have to grade papers at home, it's not as cognitively demanding as being on-call at 2am when the server goes down. There are a lot of bad things said about teaching as a profession, and I personally know lots of teachers who got sick of it and quit, just as I got sick of tech and quit. But at this point in my life, it feels like a better career choice. I still love programming, and in my spare time, I am constantly coding apps, helping friends with their startups, and consulting. I actually have the bandwidth and energy to do it because I'm not busting ass programming all day. This stuff is much easier with AI as well.",

Microsoft recruited me for distributed systems in C# which I'd never seen before, Amazon hired me for distributed systems in Java which I'd used once for a consulting customer without admitting that on my resume, and Box hired me for storage in Scala which was completely new to me.You'll need to be proficient at leetcode style and system design questions to pass the interview loop, although in my last search none of the 22 companies I interviewed with asked coding questions which couldn't be solved using first principles plus knowledge of your favorite programming language and its standard library.

        "body": "AI is changing software engineering, but “replacement” isn’t how technology disruption actually works. We don’t have fewer accountants after Excel, we have accountants doing different work. Code generation tools make certain tasks faster, which means engineers tackle bigger problems or more projects, not that companies need 80% fewer engineers.The skills that matter are shifting toward system design, understanding business problems, debugging AI-generated code, and knowing when the AI solution is wrong or suboptimal. Junior engineers who can use AI tools effectively while understanding fundamentals will outperform those who either reject AI or blindly trust it. The job becomes more about judgment and architecture than syntax.Focus on areas harder to automate: distributed systems, security, performance optimization, and domain expertise in complex fields like healthcare or finance. Build things AI can’t easily replicate yet, like deep understanding of legacy systems or cross-functional communication skills. The engineers who get displaced are those who only knew how to translate requirements into boilerplate code. Nobody can predict timelines accurately, but historically tech revolutions create more jobs than they eliminate, just different ones. The transition period is uncomfortable and some roles disappear, but demand for people who can build and maintain software systems keeps growing even as the nature of that work evolves.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I’d organize them better. A reader has to kind of figure things out. I thought you had GraphQL listed twice at first, and my first boomer instinct was “if this person can’t proofread their own resume, why would I bother interviewing them if they care so little?” You are dealing with people with short fuses when people are reviewing your resume. Organize/categorize it better, so someone can digest the info more easily. It’s similar to the snark on Reddit when people joke about paragraphs. - “Contributed” sounds extremely passive. It sounds like your team built a feature while you were working on something else. Work on that section to show more involvement. Even something like “Developed a highly scalable…” might work better. You can add “team” somewhere if you are that self-conscious about it. It’s a mix of passive word choice, and I have literally interviewed people who tried to take credit for the work of others. It just raises an eyebrow because it’s kind of an odd word choice. - Were these different projects or a single one? If they were different projects, you could list the tech stack of each. You could possibly say when you used bigger name tech for certain things like you did with the Solr example.Good luck, it’s a tough market.",

Hopefully these help you answer your own question.&nbsp;- I had a coworker go from a startup to Cap1 and the culture shock was massive. Are you prepared to tolerate corporate culture? Are you someone who needs to move fast without bureaucracy?- What LOB (if told) would you join? The cost centers at Capital One face more attrition than profit centers (like Card Tech). The PIPs fly faster in other LOBs.- Are you okay with mediocrity? Not sure about your offer, but some teams don’t do flashy work. The tech stacks are bloated and poorly written by contractors. Some may have modern stacks.- How long do you see yourself working there? The WLB is fairly good, but the performance culture grinds years off your life for a mediocre pay and no RDU.&nbsp;I’ll also note, SA while a shit pay, will offer more shelter from PIPs than for PAs. I was a PA and TL and the competition gets tighter the more up the chain you go.",

        "body": "Former C1 employee here. It’s the sketchiest company I’ve ever worked for. Left after I fulfilled my time requirement to not pay back the signing bonus & Relocation package. C1 tries to operate as if they’re AWS, the problem is that they’re not paying AWS money. They like to intentionally over-hire & rely on pip culture to incentivize employees to overwork themselves to be ranked appropriately. That leads me to my next thing, they do stack ranking for employees. This means that you’ll be ranked against employees at the same level as you & normally that would be fine, but a lot of orgs have company lifers. These people have been there their entire career or the majority of their career & they know the company inside & out so they’ll consistently set an incredibly high bar that new external hires have to adhere to within a few months of working at the company. With a company so reliant on internal systems that are poorly documented & long drawn-out (again, poorly documented) processes it’s hard to learn all of that while also navigating all the levels of bureaucracy & compliance that comes with fintech. Quite frankly unless you grossly overwork yourself on a regular basis for a year or two or you’re just an incredibly talented engineer it’s unlikely you’ll succeed there. Here are some additional things that you may find useful to know:- They reorg frequently, I’m talking every 6 months at least. So you’ll constantly be shifting teams or lose team members- Everything there is reliant on tons of internal tools & many basic things you’ll have to do will take significantly longer than expected because you have to ask many people who to contact about something then you have to fill out a form & then message someone to tell them you filled out the form then fill out the form again because you forgot to check a certain field on the form- The way the company operates with pip culture breeds a lot of toxic behavior between employees so you’ll encounter a lot of terrible behavior throughout your interactions. Plenty of good people there, but the amount of bad interactions you’ll encounter is relatively high.- as a woman you might find it relevant to know that there’s not many women working there in the engineering departments. I was there for a little over a year & I found out about 3 different serious scandals there involving harassment & encountered a lot of higher ups who are not very respectful towards women. All that being said, they do pay pretty decent, but in my opinion they do not pay nearly enough for how much it sucks to work there. If you’re up to date on your interview skills I highly recommend interviewing elsewhere. Many other companies pay equally well or even better that aren’t as terrible to work for.",

I also felt similar about the job market making such a move risky right now.I’m not saying don’t do it. But you still have time to investigate. If you get the offer, don’t say yes right away. A day later, tell your recruiter you have some concerns you want to clarify. They’ll likely ask if you want to meet with the hiring manager or anyone else to discuss them. If it’s a good group of people they’ll be happy to do so. Then you can prepare some questions that might help you understand the situation better. You can even bring up what you’ve seen online. This is exactly what I did for the offer I turned down and I was able to learn that the team wasn’t actually what they said it was and they basically confirmed their red flags to me even while trying to paint a better picture.Nothing you’ve said here makes me think you would be in that bottom 15% by the way. But it’s a valid concern that they could dock you for some innocuous reason you don’t have visibility into. So it’s probably worth investigating especially if you like your current job.",

I think at most I would go down to 5 hours, and even then I wouldn't claim I then worked for a full 8 hours.It's reasonable to not always be 100% engaged at all times. personally I aim for at least 6 hours of work a day and only occasionally go under that.So as I see it, yes it is normal, but there is a limit to how much is reasonable.",

It doesn't matter per the above statement, 3. AI can also be used to refactor and improve code and remove tech debt, whether it's AI or human created tech debt, and it's actually something that the AI excels at in particular over the human.In fact, even the standard of maintainability itself goes way down due to AI because humans no longer need to laboriously dig through the code base and try to understand every line, they can use AI for this, so AI becomes not just the writer but also the reading interface, and AI is very good at understanding bloated/repetitive/convoluted code.

If you have used Opus 4.5 (now 4.6) or Codex 5.2 (now 5.3) at all and remain convinced that they are \"glorified autocomplete\", then quite honestly that is a skill issue on your part or a pure unwillingness to put effort into learning how they work.Professionally, I work on everything from modern Go backends and Nextjs frontends to extreme legacy PHP apps, and these models handle all of that extremely well and write good code (even better code than currently exists in the codebase in the case of the legacy projects). Microservices, monorepos, etc - all handled extremely well. My teams are building internal skills and tools that have made our workflows even better. I've been able to knock out many of our highest-reported bugs on a legacy product that I would not have had the time to handle myself if it wasn't for these models being so good. Use plan mode. Give it guidelines for style and structure via an AGENTS.md or claude.md file. Outline a thorough plan for it yourself if you want. Tag in the files it should pay specific attention to, especially if you know the data flow or generally where the problems exist already. We even have several internal frameworks/libraries, and the AI has been able to use those perfectly fine due to how much usage examples there are in our codebases (or if it's not sure, it just goes into the npm modules or vendor files and checks things out itself). This sub and other SWE-related subs love to dog on AI and claim it's not useful or not good. That is simply not the case anymore.",

You should double check who your references are and whether it’s wise to continue with them as references.

After 5 days I stopped worrying that no one was watching critical component X and they're just gonna have to experience being the one to manage it - and I trusted I left enough instructions and trained my team well enough to cover it. I also kept in touch with them and still do in case they have questions.After 2 weeks, and a ton of sleep, I started making jokes again. My eyes are less puffy. My back hurts less. I smile more. I love that I get to be with my family more. I've begun to cook and find other ways to contribute.But I feel a sense of loss. 14 years on a single project that I loved and helped to build... It's a lot to let go all at once.I have started applying for some roles that I want to contribute to.

More spreadsheets, setting up processes to systemize work, holding IT people accountable for software changes.

The client hated me (they were actually an extremely petty person who burned through a lot of people, so it was not solely on me). But my boss/CEO started becoming a bully towards the end of my time there. I honestly start wondering if he was just trying to make it unpleasant enough I'd quit. I do believe he's done that (or at least tried) with other people. He would start changing requirements midway through development, constantly sending extremely harassing messages, etc. It was very stressful, and I had been worried about losing my job for a while.The company had a major issue, and suddenly, I didn't have a job any more. And it was such a great feeling. I didn't have to deal with any of their stupidity any longer. I was lucky because I had started speaking to another company casually, so I didn't have an extended period of unemployment. I did ask for a gap in start time, and I caught up a ton on sleep I had been missing out on. I make a little less now, but I'm soooo much happier. I'm working in a much healthier environment with people who just treat people decently. I did lose out money on the time I wasn't working. There's no way around that. And I know there are others who lost theirs jobs around the same time I did who I think are still looking. There's some luck in how things play out. If I hadn't found another job, on top of that one I really like, I'd probably feel very differently. There's risk, because what happens if your partner were to lose their job? If it takes you a long time to work again (either by choice or by market), do you run the risk of alienating them? What does recovering your mental and physical health look like, and how supportive will they be? If you're just playing video games on the couch, that could cause problems in the relationship. You need to make sure you're communicating with them, and not just that you're miserable, but understand how they'd feel about you quitting your job. What kind of position are you in to interview? Are you too slammed to interview? Are you not prepared? Or are you not getting any interest?",

The real world experience of coding was nothing like school; I enjoyed support a lot more so I moved into getting work doing on site technical support on contracts at oil extraction sites.It was relatively easy to hop from contract to contract, make a lot of connections, and eventually I moved to do on site IT support for a regional authority.Having the various experiences from the contracts and the programing experience really helped out with seeing problems in a different light and finding unique solutions.I rarely program now, mostly it's just problems that come my way that no one else can figure out because they don't know where to begin. Really it all comes down to being able to understand how to parse large datasets into useful information.I can understand it, I can explain it, most of my team can't comprehend it; so I rapid prototype the solution, meet with various teams, and we get a usable product that prevents us from having to do a RFP for 5 to 10 million dollars a year.I assume there are other roles that are related to computer science that exist in which you can still use your education, training, and knowledge; but it might be a pretty niche job market - regional company, not huge, but not tiny. Big enough to pay we'll, small enough that 5 million dollars a year on savings makes a difference, also in house IT. Contractors aren't going to care and are going to insist that you can be in 3 places at once doing 5 things because they can't read a map.",

I quickly got tired and discouraged, feeling like an imposter, so I stopped and kept working my meh job.I’m back on the grind now, though, and I told myself I would push until I got something. I’m about a month into getting back into Leetcode and it’s hard. I just did two easy’s that were similar to each other, yet I still needed hints on both. I also seem to really struggle with my memory on problems. I built an SRS app for the Leetcode problems I complete just so I can remember to go back to them lol. It’s a tough battle out there, but I believe in us. Just keep studying, keep learning, and keep applying. I’ve gotten responses back from some big tech companies and some smaller random companies so far. 3 upcoming OA’s and 2 recruiter calls coming up.Also, I think for your position and resume, you could try to pivot it as general “software engineer” or “frontend engineer”. Make sure you emphasize the languages you’re working with and try to minimize how much you mention Wordpress. I think if you can get some personal projects going that are more than just a super simple CRUD app, that would help, too. You got this!",

The engineering is up to us, not a bunch of corporate stooges and their worthless \"AI up-skilling\" powerpoints. I’ll give you a basic run down of everything important I've learned in the last year:1. Write an AGENTS.md file that gives a broad view of your repository with high level details like tech stack, folder structure, etc. Also point to which docs should be referenced if the agent needs to expand further for more details. This prompt will be injected in every conversation so keep the information broad/horizontal instead of deep/vertical.2. Learn how to sandbox your agent so you can run the agent in yolo mode and afk it. The 3 most popular options are: Claude code’s builtin sandbox mode, vscode’s dev containers, and docker’s new sandbox mode for running agents.3. Learn git worktrees so you can have agents work in the background without disrupting your normal workflow or if you want to parallelize work. (I recommend not trying to parallelize too much, most work is inter-dependent and it's usually easier to just work sequentially)4. Utilize skills and have a directory full of detailed instructions for each common task you do. For example, a frontend task that goes deep into detail on how you want your frontend code to be written. Unlike the AGENTS.md file, you want these docs to be deep and detailed. The agent will use progressive disclosure and only invoke those skills when its relevant so your context isn’t overloaded5. Learn about the ralph wiggum technique. This is essentially breaking extremely long tasks into subtasks and running the agent in a loop so that it can work on atomic tasks with a fresh context each time instead of trying to one-shot it and getting its context window trashed. This will involve: - A PRD doc explaining the feature and requirements in depth. - A tasks.json file with subtasks and acceptance criteria for each task. - A notes.md file so that it can jot down any information that might be relevant in between tasks. - And finally, a bash script to run your agent continuously. - There’s some good info [here](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) along with more stuff if you google ralph wiggum.6. Standard engineering practices apply. Tons of high quality tests, linters, formatters, and strict type checkers.7. Set up a way for your agent to test changes. Whether thats setting up staging environments for backend work or setting up browser automation for frontend.8. Avoid MCPs like the plague. 99.99% of them are useless and will clog your context with useless tool definitions that the agent isn’t even good at invoking. The only mcp I recommend is this for browser automation: https://github.com/remorses/playwriter (NOT THE OFFICIAL PLAYWRIGHT MCP. The official one is trash and not optimized to preserve your context window)9. Learn your agent’s plugin system and write scripts to automate tasks that should be run deterministically. Example: Writing a stop hook that executes code quality checks like I mentioned in bullet point 6.",

This is because trash schools do not prepare you to pass the interview. You are better off doing community college for first 2 years to get the required classes out of the way for cheap. Then you take a few basic computer science classes. Then in state tuition nearby for the last 2 years.Real computer science is hard and time consuming. If you can't handle that, you won't pass the interviews. WGU or any of the for profit trash does NOT prepare you to go to work or to PASS THE INTERVIEW.So basically there are 3 tiers of schoolsIvy league or equivalent. These will get you interviews you may not get else where. You have to pass the interview.All other not for profit colleges have similar material. Most of these will prepare you to pass the interviews.For profit trash that is useless diploma mill crap and you will fail the interviews.Bottom line: Do ivy league or do instate tuition. Id also argue that any other private college is a waste of money because its much more debt and won't prepare you for the interview. Id also argue that community college for first 2 years to save money is a good idea too. Most of the computer science classes will be at the regular college. You are basically saving money on required bullshit classes. Interviews are HARD and getting HARDER.",

        "body": "Okay so first I'll answer the general question, but then explain why this is less relevant for your specific case- Ivy League/high-prestige engineering schools- Specialty engineering schools (co-op programs, niche in-demand fields, etc)- the majority of schools (4-year mostly in person schools)- 100% online, shorter time period tracks, community college (for some employers)- non-accredited, non-standard degrees (e.g. I knew a private school that only did liberal arts degrees with \"focuses\") The perception of online schools is that they dont train you well for a work environment and they're easier to pass. This is about the same view as bootcamp-only people--its better than nothing, but it's just taken as nowhere near the same as the above.THAT SAID, for your specific case of already having a different degree **and teaching the subject**, I think WGU is a pretty good option. You already clearly have the interpersonal and project management skills needed to be functional in a workplace, and youre even more aligned since you have actually been doing some amount of programming already.I think you'll still struggle to get those first few jobs just because the career track is so railroaded towards the typical \"new grad with internships climbing up the ladder,\" but you absolutely can do it. I STRONGLY recommend freelancing to get your foot in the door, since it'll mean not needing to drop off of your teaching job. Tbh, if you can convince someone to let you build them a plugin for their website or make some open-source contributions, I think you could even end up with a \"typical eng job\" without a degree (though I don't recommend this).Anyways, my advice to you is1. Get the WGU degree2. While getting the degree, really really seek out a project or two from peers nearby. Maybe the school website could use some updating. Maybe your buddy wants clients to be able to schedule an appointment online rather than call him. These jobs will replace the typical \"internship\" experience companies want.3. Afterwards, seek out workplaces that can leverage your background. There is a TON of education tech being made by folk who have no idea what educators need.4. Be resilient. You're entering into a tumultuous field later than your competitors. There are going to be instances and people that make you feel small. Forget them, I really truly think youve got some great experience that'll be super rare and valuable for where you end up.You got this!",

They will lay you off with a two-sentence email or send you an auto-generated rejection, for instance. Just be aware that if you're being repped by a third-party recruiter for the opportunity you're declining, you're likely to get heavy pressure, potentially bordering on unprofessional, since they see their commission vanishing after getting you all the way to the finish line--but their opinion of you doesn't really matter.(A couple years ago, I had a third-party recruiter scream at me and cuss me out for backing out after the initial phone screen with the hiring manager; all because the recruiter didn't understand a condition that I gave him at the start and just reassured me that wouldn't happen [or he did understand and just lied to me, also a possibility]; I backed out because that condition did happen)",

Something to consider is why you chose one over the other. Was it purely money? If they really liked you, they may be willing to pay more. It's then your decision if that changes anything, if you want to notify the other company, etc. I would warn not to try extending it and make them keep bidding. That will get old quickly for them and may sour them on you. What you share really depends on why you chose one company over the other. You don't have to tell them anything, but it's good to keep the relationship professional, as you never know what can happen. There may be an opportunity to work for them again down the road. I've had some recruiters stay in touch and periodically check in to see if I was open to new opportunities.",

People on this sub don’t recommend getting a masters if you have to pay out of pocket but in your case, since your dead in the water anyway, I would so you can apply for internships. The structure of learning and coding might help with the issues you’re having with producing code. It’s a bit of a gamble but it depends on if you really want it or not.

The first 3 jobs within the first 5 years of my career made me feel so completely out of my depth (either cos the code base was so vast, or deliveries were too hurried, or me simply no understanding anything) that I used to break down into tears after some meetings. Sounds ridiculous writing that down.To this day its hard for me to describe what the hell I was feeling at the time. Why I felt so out of place. Why I felt like everyone looked down on me. I dont even know what I expected from myself to cause such a dissonance in contrast with the reality I was living. I still don't feel remotely competent in what I do. But I have never once been reprimanded for a weak performance.So after many years nd now over 30 I decided to no longer care. I have decided that until someone isn't pleased with what I do, i will embrace my mediocrity, embrace my stupidity, ask the stupid questions, learn to champion the colleagues that put in extra hours of work for fun (because they still live with their mums or girlfriends and have a very different time budget to their lives than me) to learn from them by proxy instead of feeling like I need to compete with them. This is how I'm surviving, because I learned that its in this mess that development happens. I am neither in social, embedded or health, so the stakes arent high anyway. This way I keep my sanity, my humility to keep learning from everything and everyone, and mental peace to grow outside of work and give my energy to my family.",

It doesn't help you in any ways (if you go the extreme route) and your boss might think you are worse than you are which can impact your end of year performance reviews. You have to at least show you are putting in a lot of the effort to catch up so your manager understands.>How do I stop feeling so dumb?Sponge up all the knowledge as much as possible. And emulate what your teammates are doing. Catch up ASAP.>How do I earn the respect of my coworkers?What I just said above + do your stuff well + make sure you are a team multiplier in some ways or another.>I also feel like an idiot sometimes in general because the product itself and the code is very complex. The product is for a niche field I’m not very familiar with.I know redditors hate to hear this but spend more hours (this means outside work hours) figuring out wtf is going on. And if there's little to no documentation on what you think is important knowledge, document it and share it to the team (this shows you are 'team multiplier' and will look good to your performance review). And if there's any documents regarding the product, just read through it even if you don't understand it multiple times here and there again and again (so your eyes at least get used to the technical jargon, etc).Type or screenshot everything in your note taking app or whatever per day. Every command you ran and so forth so you can look back. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I recommend it if you don't use a note taking app (it's very bare bones and light). And I have Calender plugin on it.If your company allows you to use AI on the codebase, abuse the heck out of AI and ask all sorts of questions on it.Schedule 1 on 1 meetings with your teammates and ask questions on topics you don't know much about. Don't schedule and just be like \"I don't know\". People don't like that. People like you put in SOME effort to try so show you put in the effort to try to make sense and are confused/lost. And screenshot every single step your teammate is doing so you don't forget or lose (so you can help organize later). Also, DM your teammates with help you need (do it to different team members a time so you don't overload one teammate). And make sure that DM (Slack setting or whatever is set to never delete). And again, screenshot/save any command, etc that comes out of it.Type more shit about your status and what you are doing in your team channel more. Last thing you want is to look invisible. Invisible == Looks like you aren't doing anything.I abuse the heck out of screenshotting in this field. Everything in every meeting when I see a screen is screenshot. I don't care how trivial. From the URL to what not I just screenshot.If this is in office, bribe your team members (and other close by office workers (from where you sit)) with occasional cookies/snacks or whatever. Look optimistic and happy and eager. It goes a long way and will help you with your performance reviews indirectly (welcome to life).Ah and the biggest thing. **When you are given a task, stop trying to focus on the task. Try to understand the bigger picture first (the REASON behind the task and so forth). Make sure you focus on that in 1on1 when asking your team members for help on a task.**If you focus on 'code logic' context, then you are f-ed. You need to focus on the business/overall reason for why this task was given. And from there form your own opinion and maybe you might come to conclusion \"why is this task needed?\" and so forth which you should be free to ask/voice out. That's critical thinking. That's what software engineering is.>I (26F) have been working at my job for exactly 1 year.Took me like over 4 years just to not feel this. And even then I always constantly worry I am not performing to my level. And I studied CS directly unlike you.Took me over 3 years alone to stop thinking in terms of 'code/task context' to the bigger picture. It's normal. Just put in the hours and your hours will not betray you in the longer run. Fortunately for me I was able to cover up for my incompetence in this side by being extremely proficient/fast at coding but if I didn't have that I probably was truly cooked.",

It was just \"here's a resume, interview this person, let us know what you think.\" No guidance, not much communication, etc. I've also worked at some companies where I did a pair interview with executives who would just say, \"I'll let you lead,\" because they didn't bother to look at the person's resume.

IMO hearing that a full feature request to be completed in one day is very strange given at the least it should've been assigned at the beginning of the sprint with some story point estimate?>Product says cut scope,>Engineering informs product that cutting scope won’t get it done in time,This feels like there was a breakdown in communication somewhere. Does this happen on the regular, or just this one time? As a PM, if I hear something's going to be delayed, my job is to try to figure out what levers can be pulled (if any) that will get things back on track, which often is reducing scope to sidestep complexity. >Product says it’s “straightforward” and it needs to be done by tomorrow no questions>Realistically this feature won’t be live for another two weeks.\"Straightforward\" is just not how you work collaboratively, which might point to deeper trust issues between Product and Engineering. When the feature needs to be \"done\" by tomorrow, is that code complete or feature complete? If it's code complete, I'd think you still need to leave time for testing and bug fixes before release.Also, where's your EM or Tech Lead in all of these convos? Finally, healthy friction between Product and Engineering is normal as you're working together from different angles to move the project forward. However, if you're constantly having communication breakdowns, then it might be a convo with your EM to see how you can improve relations and expectation setting.",

Mid-sized DoD company as my first, second was not FAANG but it's one that i personally would say is at the same level as FAANG (or mag7) and the third and current is big tech. I wouldnt consider it the same tier as FAANG but i would say it's a tier just under FAANG. To answer the question, i tdepends. I've never worked startup but i've heard startups have similar culture. But what i will say on each company i feel like it's general for each type of company.DoD- at DoD, this was super chill. The work felt meaningful but the work was also super chill. Like i could sit on a task for a month, work 8 hour days where half the day i twiddled my thumbs and still get good reviews at the end of 6 months. I remember getting to my project and it was a year away from being \"complete\" and it took us 3 years to complete it and nobody was mad or batted an eye. It was a poorly run project because everybody just wanted to do 8 hours and go home. Nobody was really trying to go all out for them. The pay wasnt the best but it was good. I would recommend DoD to anybody who likes CS but doesnt love it to want to learn new systems, new code, etc. Just wants to get their day done and go home and not htink about work. But it'sv ery easy to get behind the times and not move ahead in your career. You will get promoted pretty quickly but wont learn much really. Nobody even sends an email after 5 pm.FAANG level - when i left DoD i wanted more pay and to learn more. It was a huge culture shock. I went to cloud services. The company i worked for was known for having work life balance but I didnt ralize cloud is where that dies. It was super competitive. A SWE2, did twice as much work as a senior at DoD did. I made good money but god it sucked. Seniors and up were so booked they had no time to help juniors. Reviews were not based on what was expected it was based on how you compared ot your coworkers. I literally got in my review, \"his coworkers do more than him\" becaus ei didnt work 60 hour weeks like osme of them. That wasnt the reason but whne most are doing 60 and you are doing 40 it shows in the work. I got laid off and honestly didnt even miss it. If you werent sending emails or getting at calls at like 8pm you were behind. It felt like you always had to be available. Big tech - i got a job in big tech and was making more than i was at FAANG. Honestly it's been great because the work is meanigful, i work for a cloud service that's big but not as big as the faang one. But because it's not as big, nobody feels overworked. For the first ime iin years i had people say \"dude it's 6pm go home\". It's a good level of feeling like youa re doing meaningful work and not feeling like you have to work 60 hours to keep up. So i will say, even if the work isnt as meaningful or worldwide as FAANG, you can definetely work at places and do meaningful work. Every company to some degree is meaningful, just some more than others.",

I think most firms are flat so your title won’t change much and salary progression is usually pretty meritocratic. As far as what you do, for most engineering positions it’s working on internal libraries, tooling, execution, order routing systems. My role involving pulling market data off co-located switches/servers, so I often felt like a network engineer. We also maintained all of our own servers, so a lot of the work is around maintaining / migrating those. Not a whole lot of cloud being used due to obvious reasons for HFT. Did I enjoy it? It’s a job. I loved being surrounded by the smartest working on hard problems in a competitive industry. I enjoyed having to think about computers at a low-level, digging into OS internals to write the fastest C++ code. But it’s not incredibly meaningful if that matters to you and I felt like my skills were becoming highly specialized—a good thing if you want to stay in trading your whole life, but the longer you stay the harder it may be to jump into a different space. For example, you won’t have any experience creating a product for real users. I do think most of these places offer some of the best jobs you can find that balance pay and work/life. Also, it being so specialized may help you avoid the layoffs that plague other tech jobs. It’s more like finance than tech in that way.",

I know so many kids I graduated with who couldnt find a first SWE job so they picked up help desk jobs. They all just moved into different kinds of IT. One guy transitioned into iphone repair and a few got QA roles. The most successful guy I can think of became a \"cloud engineer\" or something like that, boasts about his engineering title, but once I saw he posted on his IG story a terminal just spamming logs, and he captioned it, \"doing some coding today\"... our mutual friend told me that he is basically just still doing IT and hates his job. But if you ask any of them, none of them afaik, actively continued to try to get a SWE job or tried to continue coding. They got their job, it paid the bills, but its just temporary and they'll start studying leetcode and coding again \\_tomorrow\\_ and tomorrow never comes.",

        "body": "tl;dr; keep looking, this is at best a lateral move if not a step down.Context: I have \\~20 YOE and currently am/have been in a senior US technology leadership role at small/medium-sized companies (40+ FTE reports in my area). I oversee software engineering, IT, DevOps, cybersec, and technical support/solutions teams which sounds very similar to what you're describing.>I’m a backend software engineer with about 2.5 years of experience>I’m currently at a service-based company and was promoted fairly early into a senior/lead-type roleFor starters, you are not market-competitive as a \"senior engineer\". Lots of differences in how titles are interpreted, but you are unlikely to place into a senior engineer position at a company with good engineering talent; you just haven't seen enough / could be trusted with important problems. I would be aiming for a mid-level position if I were you. I bet you *are* the most technical, talented person in your org, but this sounds like a \"big fish in a small pond\" situation; you will realize how impressive the talent out there is once you leave this pond.>I don’t feel great about where I am. The work is very project-driven, there isn’t much real product thinking, and there’s no meaningful senior mentorship above me. I’ve learned a lot by being pushed into responsibility early, but it also feels like I’m starting to plateau, and I’m not convinced staying longer actually improves my long-term trajectory.Good instincts; this is my read as well. You need to move on from this company or you *will* plateau.>The role is titled “Support Engineer,” which is what’s making me hesitate. On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes.This sounds identical to what my org calls \"Solutions\". A typical solutions specialist/engineer has a CS degree from a small school or comes from a nontraditional background (bootcamp, self-taught, etc.). Required to code and know SQL, but isn't trusted to build customer-facing products from scratch. Much of their work is being responsive to customer demands; support tickets, onboarding new customers, code changes that are often formulaic / pattern repetition, etc.>They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path....and this is exactly how I sell folks on doing the work, and getting paid less for it. I pitch the variety of tasks they have, how much they can learn technically and about our products. It's not *wrong* but it's also not saying the quiet part out loud: you aren't trusted to be a *full* software engineer, nor do we want to pay for that for this position.Have people successfully transferred to a full Software Engineer position from our Solutions org? Absolutely, and I love enabling that move. But due to classic company issues, it's very hard to pay them the same as their peers vs. an external direct hire.>What I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment. EDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.IMO if you're good at what you do, bet on yourself. Don't rely on a \"down the road\" transfer/promotion. Find a company that thinks you're good *now* and is willing to give you that responsibility and compensation. Even if they think you're ready in 6-12 months they might still delay on a move because you've proven yourself invaluable to their \"support\" organization and they don't have a backfill ready.>There’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.I would ask them to go directly into a SE role instead of the support role, or else walk and keep looking.>Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?Caveat to all of the above: if you are not in the US and you live in a country where employment opportunities are scarce, you might need to toss all of my advice and take the job anyway. For example, if you live in Pakistan and are having trouble finding *any* job that is technical and pays reasonably well, this might be your best angle to transition into something better. I can't speak to your personal job market situation; my advice is based around what I know best (US labor market and you have authorization to work).",

I then nearly doubled my salary by accepting a role at company B doing the kind of debug-level support you describe, and since I had significant software engineering knowledge from my first job, I excelled and was promoted to a lead and received numerous raises. Eventually while at company B I expressed my desire to move into product engineering and it was granted once they were able to find another lead to replace me. While working the debug support role (before being promoted to lead), I got an offer for a senior SWE role at a third company, but didn't accept the offer for various reasons. So it's not like I was locked out of the software engineering job market at senior level either.",

Good managers are often solid engineers who care about clarity, feedback, and helping others succeed. A good next step is to take on small leadership tasks where you are, mentoring, running meetings, owning a project end to end. That will tell you a lot before making a big jump.",

People don’t like it but it is the only way to see if someone can actually code or design a system.I’d also argue that just because we have AI it doesn’t mean people actually understand what they are building and are learning competency in new areas that they couldn’t before. How long have public libraries existed? How long has basic literacy and arithmetic been a requirement, yet the average person still reads between a 6th and 8th grade education and many college students continue to need remedial math.People might be doing more. They might have access to better resources, but it is naive to think that people are actually becoming more competent. If anything, we’re seeing the opposite is true. I think that at the end of the day you’ve got to see someone code in person. You’ve also got to speak to them. It’s the only way to have any chance of evaluating someone’s understanding of programming and software  engineering.I do think AI is going to reduce jobs though.

That said, not all of them are like that, companies like Anduril that pay big bucks definitely have much tougher interviews. These days, I think the harder part is actually finding a company that’s willing to sponsor your security clearance..",

Just build shit.Let me give you a little life advice tho.Just make sure you get that degree. I havent checked in a while but for actual cleared roles they are going to want you to have a degree. If you are serious about defense dont smoke weed or get into any trouble. Depending on your clearence level the job requires you to get they look at EVERYTHING in your life. Tax returns, speeding tickets, criminal record, drug use, income, where you lived, who you live with, where you've traveled abroad, who you talked to abroad, how often you talk to them All for the past 7 years of your life.As far as the web dev thing I literally never took any web dev classes in college. Required courses change per stste curriculum requirements but I don't know anyone in defense really doing web dev.",

It’s just focused to the exact problem that the client has - you’ll get a description of a desired end result or current problem and then it’s up to you to make bespoke solutions for it. Can be pretty interesting especially if you want to go into the startup space later. The main difference from devs is that you’ll probably be located where the client is and you’ll be working on software solutions specific to the client.For other companies like PWC it’s closer to consulting/sales.

For Forward Deployed Engineers, I've seen the range of:* A post-sales position, helping implementation. They usually want people with a variety of technical skills, as each client will have different needs. It's a mix of a technical consulting role and integration engineer. A lot depends on your company, and what kind of product they are selling.* I've seen some sales engineer roles just shift the title to copy Palantir and sound more hip.* Some solution architects, who are just kind of glorified technical sales positions, trying to get more work out of a client.I think you need to get clarification from any company you're interviewing with what they actually expect from people in the role. Ideally, you'd speak to/interview with people in the actual role and ask what type of work they've been doing. I'd personally be open to the first, although having gotten out of consulting, I don't think I'd want to go back. The latter two would hold no interest for me. It's like how some Engineering Managers are pure people managers, and other still write code some percentage of time.To clarify with \"technical consulting,\" I've seen some people who actually write code and have deliverables. And then there are people who are purely in an advisory position. Again, you need to find out what the specific company is looking for. It will vary.",

The one I’m at says that you’re essentially a front end SE just with a more client facing focus - think adapting models to the specific business needs or altering various views/queries/display layer stuff to match what clients are looking for. A lot of times you’re also just given a specific customer experience that a client wants, and your whole job is to figure out how to implement it - which could take you to all different parts of the code base.From speaking with other FDEs at other companies, it could go in the direction of something like tech sales or solutions architect or more client facing consulting (less SE and more PM like). The main thing I’d recommend is really trying to drill into what kind of work is expected at said company you’re looking at.",
