Then when you try to push back on a deadline the next time, they’ll say they want the MVP, it doesn’t have to be perfect, and you can refactor later.

It is very much a distant third place in the cloud provider market share competition, but it's not insignificant, and arguably has an edge in certain areas (e.g. many related to data).I may be extrapolating too far, but I wonder whether you've tended to work at larger, more established companies? AWS benefits greatly from being the first mover, while Azure has good synergy with companies using Microsoft products and puts a lot of effort into Enterprise relationships.Smaller organisations are more likely to use Google Workspace. Tech startups in particular tend to like Apple over Windows, and dont have some of the considerations big, established companies do. These are rough trends, but in my experience companies on GCP tend to lean more in this direction.",

Startup/techy companies and anyone who competes head on against Amazon (e-commerce) tend to have stronger footprints here.GCP isn't frowned upon, it's just not as ubiquitous as AWS or as ecosystem driven as Azure. They all offer really similar products so as data engineering practitioners the skills are pretty fungible, but you will still need to learn a couple of nuances.",

What I hate most is their new cost for GCS, the new cost for Bigquery kinda acceptable.\\- Their PostgreSQL (Cloud SQL) cannot be customized in any way or have any extensions added, and they are very expensive compared to other competitors. Their other PostgreSQL (AlloyDB) is even more expensive.And the list go on and on. But they have some highlight like Bigquery",

How complex the data is and how forward you go towards the insights/analytics layer? If the data is not complex and you insights to be extracted, delegate this to a modelling tool like dbt and use your pipelines to pull data only and trigger dbt to keep it simple. If data is complex requiring many normalisations or multiple sources that a simple sql cannot do, threat your pipelines like a library to process data in its context. But remember early optimisation is the evil. So its not a question of preference, is what you have to do at THIS time to keep it simple, readable and maintainable for your future self without over engineering. This rule is only yours (or maybe also for your team). Sometimes it is ok to over-bloat one or two flows because you will touch that once in a year and nobody else will or if it fails nobody will get hurt. I personally consider this and also I don't mind to have duplicated code 3x into 3 flows, so the 4th one will justify a refactor. It’s like watching how the stack will behaviour before trying to guess what are the optimisations.",

The main thing is just getting comfortable with how they fit together instead of treating them like three isolated tools.",

Focus on DataFrame API, partitioning, joins, window functions, and incremental processing. Practice reading from cloud storage and writing back to Snowflake via the connector. Watch for shuffles and skew; cache only when it actually saves time.Then Airflow: run it locally first. Create a simple DAG that fetches files, loads to Snowflake, kicks off a PySpark job, and runs data quality checks. Add retries, SLAs, and alerts; keep operators idempotent.Costs: you can do all this free or cheap with Snowflake’s trial + auto-suspend, local Spark, and local Airflow.

The bad:- There is at times a large desync when reading and writing to lakehouses and warehouses. PySpark operation will complete and show transformations applied within a session only for the data to not match at the endpoint for... A while. No hard numbers on this but seen others talking about it. Bottlenecks development and is really frustrating. - The low code solutions are terribly inefficient. My first time testing a basic Dataflow Gen2 operation ran for way too long and had a ridiculously large CU consumption, so if you want to handle ETL processes better get dug into Spark notebooks (I've been using PySpark which is considerably faster and more performant than the Dataflow seemed, not sure how other Spark modules behave) - Speaking of CU consumption, interrogation of compute is so... Opaque. Want to see how much CU your new code block uses? You're out of luck if you've ran it multiple times for debugging and testing - there's no way to get a granular report on costing. The documentation here isn't much better. - Managing a traditional Dev -> Prod pipeline feels harder than necessary. Currently I'm running a NonProd/Prod architecture where end users only have access to a workspace with models loaded into a warehouse because as far as I can tell there is no object level security available within a workspace. There's also no way that I've found to directly write across workspaces, so I'm shortcutting my endpoint data in the NonProd workspace to a lakehouse is the Prod workspace, then using cross warehouse T-SQL to create views for the end users.The good:- For an organisation with a large investment in PowerBI with multiple workspaces and satellite teams within the business, I can see how Fabric might be a good solution that slots in nicely. In it's current state I'm not sure that it pulls ahead of any other architecture solutions. - It's an interesting playground for less technical users to 'get their hands dirty'; I see the appeal. As mentioned before however, I discounted the low code options pretty quickly so it remains to be seen how this will progress. - There is native CoPilot integration in Fabric (when set up with the right licence option in workspaces). I haven't tested this out yet but I imagine this will be useful for people in the business to ask questions and interrogate data without requiring models to be built or a knowledge of SQL or PowerBI development. Overall it's not terrible and if you're already paying for a fabric capacity you're not incurring additional costs if your capacity has headroom. For users with a less technical background I'm not sure if the juice would be worth the squeeze as every end user I've spoken to has gravitated to Dataflows for ETL work as it's familiar to them (it works like an online PowerQuery interface). My background is in analytics and I have less experience with data engineering so my observations should be taken with a grain of salt.",

Don't forget to add in upload/download times too.)",

As part of the batch process, an environment variable representing the job number can be accessed via int(os.environ\\['AWS\\_BATCH\\_JOB\\_ARRAY\\_INDEX'\\]). Use this and your mapping from step 2 to get the list of files this job should process.5. Make sure all of your jobs succeed and/or check the results bucket to see if all is good.Maybe there's a more elegant solution that a more seasoned DE would suggest, but this is what I'd do.",

The aim is to stop people editing 'data storage' spreadsheets directly (each form should also be an easy thing to set up).So what have we achieved?- added some level of control over data entry- introduced BigQuery, allowing you to start defining transformations in SQL (e.g. Views, Scheduled Queries), and setting up the foundation for the future- decoupled data analysis from data storage. Data analysis with spreadsheets reading well-managed data from BigQuery is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight pattern- prepared everyone for a future where you have data entry methods write directly to BigQuery, without spooking the horses- oh, and for free your data is ready to analyse out of the box with 'Looker Studio' (free, not to be confused with Looker 'proper'), allowing you to set up reasonably nice dashboards",

Once the logic grows (sidebars, menus, validations, logs, error handling), you become the only person who can support the Scripts. That can be tough when you’re the lone “tech” person. Since you’re on Google Workspace, i suggest to look into Zenphi as an alternative to Apps Script. It covers pretty much everything people usually build in Apps Script—supplier/product workflows, validations, approvals, logging—but without writing code, which makes the system easier for others to understand and maintain.",

Split queues: platform/ingestion tickets separate from analytics asks, and require an impact brief with an accountable owner and an SLA before any net-new pipeline. Centralize definitions in a semantic layer (LookML, dbt metrics, or Cube) so “revenue” means one thing; DS shouldn’t redefine metrics in notebooks. Add cost/freshness SLOs and auto-archive unused tables after 30 days to keep the estate tidy.We run Snowflake with dbt, and DreamFactory lets us expose curated tables as secure REST APIs so product and apps teams ship without custom glue.You get closer to that 90% DS focus only when contracts, ownership, and pruning are non-negotiable.",

A snowpipe to Load into regular staging tables can be event triggered when a new file occurs in a container of a datalake, or, you use external tables with a scheduler, then do Load into staging tables. The rest after that is 99% identical to any previous Medallion / Kimball DW setup. Snowflake charges based on credits, a combo of IO ingest and CPU crunching. It’s decently priced. Security is by role and can be weird. Keep it very simple or you will be swamped. So it’s not fancy, just convenient. Everything can be done on a browser.

Here's a real example from a few days ago: from , select the most recent using the field. You could argue if I didn't use the LLM I would learn the syntax and not have to look it up all the time. You would be correct.3. Generating regex expressions from sample data. It's surprisingly good at this.4. I had a circular reference in a model a few days go. I knew how to resolve it, but wanted to see how the LLM would approach it. I gave it a screenshot of the UML data model and it actually did a really good, and accurate, job of explaining what the reference was, what caused it and gave a few ways of resolving it.5. OCR, but check the results VERY closely. It'll get you about 90% of the way, but I picked up a lot of small errors that on first glance looked ok.6. Basic debugging. I use the Agent in Databricks quite a lot. It's good at fixing missing brackets, forgotten imports, and basic stuff like that. More complex stuff is hit and miss so I'll usually debug those myself, but it saves me time looking for a stupid ).7. Advanced find and replace. Stuff like, 'In the attached csv, find all instances of x that are postfixed with \":2\" and replace that with :3 if the date in the valid\\_to column is over two months from today.'In all cases I check the output because I know they're just advanced statistical models, but I must say I've noticed the accuracy increase in the last year or so.I probably wouldn't consider this a 'next gen workflow', it's all stuff I can do without an LLM, but it really does save me a huge amount of time. Further, you still need someone who knows the work and what they're doing. There's no way my manager for instance would be able to use the same LLM to do my job without me.",

There are public health systems like syndromic surveillance, lots of care management, and accountable care organization work. The \"hospital\" related stuff is academic, or (say) a cancer center associated with a hospital system. Generally my work has fallen into two main categories: harmonize for a single holistic patient view (integrate 5 different EHRs and claims feeds to get a one-stop shop for the patient), and use health data to feed machine-learning models for a product. Sometimes I'll be involved with reviewing the model for clinical validation, sometimes I'll consult on model building (do repeated diagnoses matter?). Open to questions but I'm also not going to type out my whole job history.",

It does occasionally lead to frustration, especially when the data should absolutely be available in a structured format but instead is exclusively available in long PDF documents. The key to really excelling in the space in my humble opinion is to learn the broader systems that exist in healthcare; official drug product datasets from Health Canada or FDA make for great end-to-end beginner projects, and if executed well, can be of relevance to combine with data across the entire healthcare system, from EMRs to health insurance claims.",

After completing it, you'll have a solid foundation in data engineering, but there's always more to learn, of course.One downside is that they used AI voices for most of the videos, and when they do have real people in the videos, you can tell that most of them are reading from a script. Another thing is that it focuses on IBM's offerings in the data engineering space, when offerings from other companies are much more popular in the job market. It is an IBM cert, though. Why wouldn't they teach you IBM stuff? Fortunately, they made a lot of the IBM-specific parts of the courses optional.If you can get past the negatives, it's a pretty solid starting point for getting into data engineering.",

Unfortunately with Glue there is not so much you can do, but next things might help a little:1. If possible remove asterix, so you can use recursive lookup and listing won’t take place on driver. Do ‘s3://../parsed-data/us/‘ instead and .option(recursiveFileLookup\", \"true\")2. Increase number of workers3. Tune up a config a little bit for working with small filesspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes\", 64 * 1024 * 1024) spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes\", 4 * 1024 * 1024) 4. Use repartition instead of coalesce, because your bottleneck is read, not write. But really, that’s not Spark use case, there is nothing “analytical” about this kind of processing. So the only valid approach - stop producing tons of little files or switch to another technology. You just wasting lot of money by trying to use not suitable technology for a quite trivial job. Databricks have ‘cloudFiles’ functionality to handle such things and it works perfectly, but unfortunately there is nothing similar to it in pure Spark or Glue.",

The only thing that ever gets stressful to me sometimes is dealing with people who either don’t do their job or do their job very badly, and I end up compensating. Otherwise I love being a data engineer!",

Roles of DE’s vary quite a bit so it’s going to depend on the position you switch to… With that being said, in DE you don’t have to worry about the 1,000 ways an end user can misuse and crash your site, or covering every edge case for security vulnerabilities… you probably won’t need to learn 5+ languages and frameworks for one project. These are things I didn’t consider stress wise when making the switch to ‘SWE’, however I enjoy the struggle of this. With DE you’re extracting data, transforming and loading it into a space where DA’s and DS can easily retrieve accurate data. The way I think about it is the DB serves as your UI and this simplifies worrying about security and misuse. Not to say these concerns don’t exist, but I don’t feel like they’re as complex to resolve. The real complexity/stress comes in taking disparate data from various systems in various formats, that’s available in disjunct timeframes and making it fit into a cohesive/canonical model that represents how the business/analysts thinks about operations. Applying and understanding business rules can be very difficult/stressful. Inherently I don’t think one or the other is less stressful, it depends on the job and your interests… good luck :)",

Deadlines are everywhere. Hard-to-diagnose problems are probably everywhere, too, especially when you inherit things. Sometimes specific tools are worse for it (I've heard comments in this regard about Spark, for example).I've done this transition, albeit kind of unconsciously. It's been good. Having software background is definitely valuable, I think. It probably depends some on your stack, but I also think there is *a lot* of crossover. Especially if you consider that often it's the soft-skills that count, too.I started in general development, primarily working on an internal web-based system using .NET Core. That job started having more and more \"reporting\" work, using the same backend database, but SSRS was the frontend instead. From there, into an analyst type role, which rapidly became a catch-all ETL-developer-report-builder-platform-admin role. Last few years it has become more about \"engineering\", admin, and architecture. I'm very much enjoying it. Early on, I did miss working in code that wasn't primarily SQL (and especially wasn't DAX), and the ways in which we did it - like devops processes and dev tools. I've seen that shift where I am now, partly because team, partly because tool set with us jumping into Databricks. The inner software dev has much more cause to come back to the surface. I've been in a position to bring devops practices in. I'm thinking again about things like encapsulation and DRY. I was not the whizz-bang top-dog developer, but I picked up some good fundamentals and experience. It's helpful as a data-focused engineer. Is DE a good fit for you? Probably if you have an analytical mind, enjoy the problem-solving, and sometimes having to help discover what that problem really is. I would also say that it's all just input-to-output.",

Then you'll start to think \"what would I've done differently here?\", or answering questions like \"what would need to change if I change component/requirement X by component/requirement Y?\" (simple example: what would need to change if our requirement change from batch to streaming?)For the bonus: I was a researcher, then worked as data scientist and software developer for a few years, then as data engineer for a couple of years, and now I am a mix of data engineer and data architect.The architect part is really fun. It gave me the possibility to put into practice a lot of the theory I read before. It involves considerably less coding, but more about understanding business and systems (in my case, how the backend works on a high-level) and being able to come up with solutions that match the technical and business requirements. It is smart that you are thinking ahead, good luck!",

Engineers are also under no obligation to follow the architects suggestions or advice. Architect simply documents and discover major tech moves or implementations. Say the company is AWS based, they're gonna shift to Azure. Architect would be tasked with getting an edge on discovery in Azure. Generally, senior and staff+ engineers still hold primary weight and control over the products and tech stack they own. Especially anything technically detailed, architect would have 0 say. Like best practice for modeling, how to design some major ETL system and etc. All engineering decisions, not architect. Architect would be whats the tech for shifting from AWS to Azure, how do we follow Europes data privacy laws, how do we implement this org level data requirement from legal, how do we standup this technology that all of engineering will use?",

Ship a dbt template with tests, a Dagster/Prefect scaffold, and Terraform modules that create Snowflake roles/warehouses, storage, tags, and budgets by default. Define data contracts and schema versioning; require an RFC for breaking changes. Bake in observability: OpenLineage/Marquez, Great Expectations, freshness and cost SLOs to Slack. Standardize access with RBAC, masking, and secrets rotation; document the request flow and SLAs. Timebox thin slices ahead of demand (one CDC source, one model, one serving pattern) and track adoption, cost per query, and incident rate. Treat the platform like a product: backlog, office hours, and clear deprecations.We used AWS API Gateway and PostgREST, and DreamFactory to auto-generate REST APIs from Snowflake/SQL Server so app teams shipped without custom services.Bottom line: build products and policies that make the happy path easy and the risky path rare.",

These talk mostly to SREs and app engineers, not execs. You’ll still need some business context and incident comms, but you can gate it with written intake.Tactics: require ticket intake with the business question, SLA, and data owner; define data contracts and a schema change policy; set office hours; post async updates after deploys/incidents. Interview filters: Who writes requirements? Who prioritizes? Who handles stakeholder meetings? What’s the meeting-to-maker ratio? Do you have a PM or analytics engineer buffer? Is there a solutions team for external clients?Self-serve reduces chatter: clean schemas, lineage, a data catalog, and stable APIs. I’ve used Snowflake and dbt for curated marts, Confluent for event streams, and DreamFactory to expose read-only REST endpoints so product teams ship without ad-hoc asks.Pick platform-focused DE and enforce process and you’ll mostly talk tech.",

Things I can and do teach on the job are working on a specific cloud platform (GCP, Azure) or using specific pipeline tooling (airflow, databricks, azure data factory), etc. Databricks has a lot of nice tutorials and free cloud compute that you could take advantage of for a portfolio piece. If you aren’t aware, the founders of Databricks are the founders of Spark, and Databricks is pretty hot right now so it would give you relevant experience for the current job market.

If you must keep SSIS, point it to ADLS via the Azure Feature Pack; otherwise use ADF with a self-hosted IR from on-prem. Enable SQL Server CDC and push changes to ADLS (via ADF or Event Hubs) to avoid nightly fulls. Lock down with Private Link, Managed VNet IR, Key Vault–backed secrets, and service principals.Pitfalls I’ve seen:smiling_face_with_tear:modeling twice (MI then lakehouse), duplicate security policies, lineage gaps, and schema drift when multiple tools write to the same tables. Pick one orchestrator (ADF is fine), version pipelines, and test backfills early. A measured skip-to-DB approach works: run a 2-week spike for one domain using Autoloader + Photon and keep MI only for legacy apps.With Azure Data Factory and MuleSoft, DreamFactory helped us expose legacy SQL Server as secure REST endpoints so Databricks jobs could ingest without custom middleware.So, keep Phase 1, but aim everything at ADLS/Delta and Databricks from day one so almost nothing gets thrown away.",

Once everything clears all checks and is running properly in production, then make the official switch/decommission the old workflows once the source data itself is redirected to the same storage locations to bypass the SSIS packages.IMO, it's going to take just as long either way to do it, but if the team focuses mostly on building a great foundation for the new workflow, there's ultimately a lot less temporary overhead required.",

Set one changelog per DB, small ordered changesets, and enforce a mainline flow (feature branches rebase to avoid merge conflicts). Always dry-run and generate SQL for review; treat rollbacks as forward fixes, not “undo,” especially on prod.Bytebase shines when you want review workflows, SQL lint, environment pipelines, and permission guardrails without building your own. It also logs who approved what, which kept auditors off our backs. For near-zero downtime: MySQL via gh-ost/pt-osc; MSSQL with online index rebuilds, adding columns with defaults that are metadata-only, and pre/post scripts to backfill.Use a deploy service account per env with least privilege. Gate releases with tSQLt or SQLFluff, and wire CI in GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps. We used Redgate SQL Compare for drift checks and GitHub Actions for pipelines; DreamFactory gave us quick REST APIs over MSSQL/MySQL so app teams didn’t need direct DB perms.So I’d go Liquibase by default; choose Bytebase only if you need built-in approvals, SQL review, and audit trails your auditors will actually use.",

E.g: denormalized data are normalized to store quality data (center of star), then denormalized (dimensions) for reporting for example. 2. Generally, it's a combination of the data management stage where we decide sources to use (maybe reliable ones) and define \"rules\", and the data architecture stage where we structure data. For examples, from three sources S1, S2, and S3, maybe we keep only S1 and S3 because data from S2 are not reliable (bad quality). Then data shapes and values from S1 and S3 which may differ at multiple points but generally unique identifier is used (like email), here is where \"rules\" are applied, for example use the email as identifier, set data with no value to NULL, if two other addresses have different values, keep the one which match the phone number, ... 3. An example is where instead of creating dimensions which is a transformation, we directly serve the data, and then flexible queries will retrieve them on demand. I hope it helps :)",

Denormalized only means attributes are combined, not that the structure matches the grain or logic needed for reporting. If the current shape works, you can keep it. If it doesn’t, you transform it into whatever structure performs well-normalize first, remodel into facts/dims, or rebuild a wider table. The model itself isn’t the goal; usability and query performance are. So denormalized is different with ready for analytics. Adjust the structure when needed to make it clean, fast, and reliable.2. Multiple customer sources with different IDs and attributes usually lead to a conformed customer dimension. The goal is to unify identity across systems using a surrogate key, then merge records via deterministic or fuzzy matching rules. You track history using SCD when attributes change over time. From the conformed dimension, you can also generate shrunken dimensions when a specific process only needs a subset of attributes - reducing complexity and improving performance while keeping consistency. The key idea is: one enterprise-wide definition of customer, multiple shapes depending on analytical needs. For more details, you can read the chapter \"Integrate via conformed dimension\" of The Data Warehouse Toolkit.3. A star schema is part of dimensional modeling and works great for data warehousing because it’s simple, performant, and easy for business users to query. But it isn’t the only modeling approach. Data Vault focuses on flexibility and historical tracking when dealing with many changing data sources, while the Inmon approach builds a 3NF enterprise warehouse before data marts, or One Big Table stores data in wide-tables,... Each method has strengths and trade-offs, so the right choice depends on requirements - speed to deliver, data complexity, volume, regulatory needs.",

Reuse the same cleaned staging models so you’re not doing the work twice. Materialize dims/facts as tables and use incremental loads where it helps.2) For customer, create a surrogate-keyed dimcustomer and a customerxref (sourcesystem, sourceid, customersk, matchconfidence, matched\\_on, rule). Do deterministic matches first (tax ID, email+dob), then fuzzy for names/addresses. Store survivorship rules for attributes, run SCD2, and route low-confidence cases to a review queue so ops can merge/split and you can replay history. I’ve used Fivetran for ingestion and dbt for modeling, Great Expectations for tests, and DreamFactory to expose a lightweight approval API for those manual merges without giving warehouse write access.3) Skip strict star when you need event streams with nested arrays, high-card time series, graphy relationships, or an ODS/Data Vault layer feeding multiple marts.Main point: keep raw raw, standardize once into conformed models, denormalize only where it serves the queries, and treat customer identity as a first-class process :)",

        "body": "Your response for number 2 sounds a lot like thinking through the ERD for normalization: from the raw sources you develop a Kimball inspired normalized star schema using the higher quality inputs (which makes you wonder why you even bothered with ingesting and storing source 2 to begin with). In the case of primary keys, which join to the foreign keys of the desired tables, you have to figure out if each is a one-to-one, one-to-many, or a many-to-many relationship. If it's not one-to-one, are there any other tables that need to be joined? If so, you may find it more useful to create a set of compound keys (which could also be expressed in a singular column as a hashkey, which is my preference) - which contain all identifier columns that make each record unique. Then there's a question of data consistency - are we dealing with slowly changing dimensions or static facts? You don't want to create a key with nulls in it, but equally so you don't want to establish a new record each time a customer updates their info. So much of these considerations are determined by both the business logic at the point of collection (data source) and the desired update pattern for your tables.Getting this all diagrammed out alongside mapping out the business rules ahead of the engineering process will make everyone's work much easier, as at that point it's mostly plug-and-play to build your DDL and DML pieces.As much as I personally bristled at Medallion architecture when I was first introduced to it, I realized you can think of your raw sources as the bronze layer, the normalized star schema as the silver layer, and all downstream transformations as your gold layer. Alternatively, you can stick with the classic approach of a raw dataset, staging tables, production tables, and data marts for specific user groups if your governance plan allows for it/business needs require it. You can also mix and match with materialized views substituting for tables if they fit your needs and your platform supports them.This doesn't work for all types of data or use cases, but hopefully gives you something to work with and learn from.",

This simplifies migrations a lot.* Bruin supports start and end dates natively instead of requiring you to use custom variables.* dbt uses `ref` functions in Jinja, Bruin parses SQL directly and requires explicit dependencies.* Both supports different environments, Bruin also supports [developer environments](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/devenv.html#schema-based-environments) where it rewrites your queries transparently on the fly.* Bruin allows running Python transformations anywhere within the pipeline and runs it natively. This means you can run Python anywhere, and not limited by what Snowpark or similar platforms allow you to do with dbt Python models. * Bruin uses `uv` in the background, meaning that your pipelines will work even if you don't have Python installed, and each task runs separately in isolated environments.* Native column-level lineage in open-source and open-source [VSCode/Cursor extension](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/vscode-extension/overview.html).* Bruin allows [defining policies](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/policies.html) in code to apply your SQL statements, e.g. \"this SQL model must have an owner\" or \"it must follow these rules\". You can enforce these in your ci/cd pipelines.* `bruin validate` validates all your queries via dry-run to check if they are valid, this means invalid code never lands. * Bruin contains embedded sqlfluff for linting with your existing rules.* Bruin has an open-source MCP server to let agents build/help with your T layer.* dbt has \\`doc\\` macro, Bruin contains a built-in [glossary](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/glossary.html) instead.Both tools are useful in their own ways, and share different approaches, hope this comparison is helpful.",

Only when you’re forced to roll your own data platform from open source do you appreciate how much a paid, polished service is doing for you. So I think it’s actually good to start with something like Fabric/ADF/Synapse holding your hand and showing you how a platform should work before you attempt things like dbt, airflow etc. The only warning I’d give is to stay away from the low-code artefacts like Dataflows. They cost a fortune and will not help you learn transformations at all.",

In 2020 we hired a adabas specialist for an eye watering day rate, he was only there 6 weeks, pretty sure he earned enough to take the rest of the year off in that time though...

Plus, yes, there's a security comcern. Even with “no training” guarantees, you’re still pushing proprietary data outside your walls. RAG lets you keep data in-house and just make it searchable when the model needs it.The way I’d follow: start with a base model + RAG + prompt engineering. Only even think about fine-tuning after 100+ prompt iterations, and only if your metrics show a gap. If you can’t say clearly what fine-tuning fixes that prompting can’t, don’t do it yet.",

For Protobuf, if you have a descriptor set (.desc), protoc --decode or grpcurl (with reflection or -protoset) gets you readable output; with Confluent’s Protobuf support, the same schema‑id header flow applies. Redpanda Console or Conduktor are nice when you want a UI that decodes messages against the registry. Confluent Schema Registry and Redpanda Console do the heavy lifting day‑to‑day; DreamFactory has been handy when I need a quick REST shim around decoded records plus schema lookup.If you build a visual inspector, make it registry‑aware (Confluent/Karapace), handle Avro/Protobuf wire headers, accept .desc files, and show schema diffs; otherwise quick scripts will still win.",

OLTP databases have a lot more functionality than OLAP (more constraints, lower latency, faster updates/deletes, etc.) and will work as long as your data isn't huge, so go for something like Postgres for storage.Use custom python scripts to request data from the API, and minimally transform it before loading into Postgres. Then you can use dbt models to restructure the data into fact/dim tables. Power BI has a native connector for Postgres, so setting it up to read from the clean dimensional tables should be simple.At your data scale, everything downstream of the API requests will be very fast to update. The main bottleneck will be how fast the API is, how much data you can pull with each request, and the request quotas you currently have with your subscription.",

Since everything is staying inside GCP, there are no data egress costs either. When it comes to cost efficiency, you can't beat free, and you could even use this as a selling point for your clients.

If your data is small, you might be able to set everything up as views, but you'll still be limited by the frequency of your ingestion process.Instant updates are generally in the realm of transactional software, not analytical dashboards. When I've needed to set up real-time dashboards in the past, I found it to be much simpler to use OLTP as the backend, with queries that pull relatively small amounts of recent data from tables that have purpose-made indexes.",

If they do, it tells you when it's useful to use MV (in terms of query performance). There are two considerations for the cost - the cost of refreshing said MV and also the cost of the query. Unfortunately without more details, this can only be answered by testing it out. The use case you describe, barring any complexities, is actually one of the more common use cases for MV.

If I understood correctly, you read the entire source data going back last 12 months to make sure you are able to track changes, this seems ok3. After reading all records daily, have you considered using a schema friendly table format like iceberg or delta? I am thinking, yiu read last 365 days data and can do merge into your final target table for updated records. It also gives you time teavel as a side benefit if yiu want to go back to snapshot from before.What do you think?",

See my previous comment as well on why i struggle to get a grasp on snapshotting in my staging tables.We're considering multiple options as for destination system. As 99% of our users are BI specialist/analists etc that work with Office/Power BI, i believe we'll push it to a SQL datawarehouse in the gold layer/information layer. We're still open to suggestions on the rest of the architecture but as there's a growing demand for unstructured/semi-structured data and AI/machine learning appliances, i do believe to follow some kind of lakehouse architecture that is as much as we can based on python(pyspark)/Sql and open source formats like iceberg. We are considering something in the sphere of Azure. From what i have read so far, everybody basically hates all pipeline/low-code solutions (except for pulling data).",

Yep, this is the case for every table and also this one, we can identify the PK and normally store the hash as well with it in a new column as we use it to build our data vault/silver layer on it. In case a PK exists, we compare the hash of the concat of all columns except the PK.2. For this specific table we would do a initial load from 2015 to today if we would build the table now and then starting from tomorrow we would load a full year back every day. When loading, we would then compare only records going one year back as otherwise the query would close all records between 2015 and the 28th of November 2024. 3. Yeah, considering Iceberg here! Played with it and the \"timestamp\" function really makes it way easier to go back then playing with the valid from/ valid to date columns. The only thing i can't get my head around is. When we would use snapshots instead of SCD2, then i assume it would be something like:\\- Initial load - All rows ranging from 2015 - today with snapshot date today (\\~12 mln rows)\\- Every day after today - All rows for the last 365 days - snapshot date of that specific date (\\~1 mln rows)It adds 365 mln. rows in a year and when i want to know the last version of a PK on a specific date i would need to partition by and order by the PK to get the latest version. Thereby, if a record gets deleted in the source system there's no way to mark it in my append only db without making a SCD2 kind of script that fills in a valid\\_to or is\\_deleted flag. i'm probably wrong but the snapshot system seems to be best fit in cases you know your source system will never delete anything.",

If records are deleted in source ( in the last 366 days) and you want to remove it form snapshot, it is also possible via Iceberg.

Use Fabric’s data movement primitives plus an automated control loop, or avoid copying entirely and materialize only what you need.A practical pattern that works for me: (1) do an initial bulk load with a Copy job or Dataflow Gen2 that can target a Warehouse. (2) switch to incremental/CDC for ongoing sync. Fabric has a CDC/Copy job feature and you can also use Delta Change Data Feed in Lakehouse tables to capture row-level changes for reliable upserts. (3) automate discovery of new tables by keeping a metadata table or using the Fabric REST/metadata APIs in a pipeline to list Lakehouse tables and loop over them to create/update copy jobs. Community threads show people scripting this when they need to scale. About schema drift: Fabric’s copy tools can do mapping but they are not perfect at automatically absorbing arbitrary schema changes for all workloads. If you expect frequent schema churn, consider an ELT pattern: keep canonical data in the Lakehouse and run periodic MERGE queries from Lakehouse into Warehouse tables (or materialized views) using the Delta CDF or SQL MERGE so you have deterministic upserts. If you want a starting checklist: pick Copy job for initial load, enable incremental or CDC for high-change tables, build a pipeline that enumerates tables and triggers jobs for new ones, and use Delta CDF or MERGE for schema-safe upserts. If you want, I can sketch a simple pipeline loop (pseudo-SQL and pipeline steps) you could drop into Fabric.",

A ForEach runs per table: if new, run CTAS or create table + initial load; if columns added, emit ALTER TABLE ADD and backfill; if types/renames change, use expand-contract (new column, CAST backfill, view maps old->new, drop later).

This layer should also contain all the details necessary to build key metrics.

But I’ll try to keep this rooted in how things actually work in the industry.The difference you’re seeing between infra-heavy Zoomcamp projects and more “software-engineered” Python repos isn’t a real contradiction. They represent different layers of the stack. Zoomcamp is trying to give you a broad picture of what you *might* see in a real team. Not every company uses Terraform or Docker, but many do, so the course touches those pieces early. Later, the focus shifts more toward dbt/Bruin-style asset based work, which is how a lot of modern data pipelines are actually built and maintained.In practice, most companies mix both approaches. The orchestrator (Airflow, Dagster, Bruin, etc.) handles scheduling and execution. The actual transformation logic usually lives in asset definitions: SQL models or small Python transforms with clear dependencies. When that logic becomes more complex or gets reused, teams extract it into a proper Python package with a src/ layout, tests and versioning. So the “tool based” approach and the “modular Python project” approach are not alternatives; they stack on top of each other.The industry is moving toward asset based workflows because they offer a clearer dependency graph, builtin testing, ownership, lineage and easier debugging. That’s why tools like dbt, Dagster and Bruin are becoming common.For someone applying to an internship, the goal is not to master every tool. It’s enough to show that you can write clean Python, understand Docker at a basic level, have touched one orchestrator, and can describe your work as a data flow. A simple infra-driven project plus a small, well-structured Python module is already strong.If you can show that mix, you’re in very good shape for junior roles.",

        "body": "Incremental refresh for LDP materialized views only works on serverless because the incremental planner, state tracking, and cost model run as a managed service in the serverless control plane; classic clusters don’t have that service, so they fall back to a full recompute.What’s happening under the hood: serverless can keep refresh state and leverage Delta CDF and lineage to compute only the changes; it also decides per refresh whether incremental or full is cheaper. Classic compute doesn’t maintain that persistent MV state or the orchestration hooks, so Databricks can’t safely do partial updates there.If OP wants incremental: create the MV on a serverless SQL warehouse or Lakeflow serverless; keep base tables in Delta with change data feed enabled; avoid unsupported bits like non-deterministic UDFs, ORDER BY, or some complex windows. If stuck on classic, reframe it as a streaming table or a Structured Streaming job using CDF with MERGE into a target, or use dbt incremental on Databricks. If full recompute is unavoidable, partition on a time key, prune by recent horizon, and run refresh off-peak.We’ve paired Fivetran for CDC and dbt for transforms, and when app teams needed quick REST endpoints to Snowflake or SQL Server, DreamFactory auto-generated APIs so we didn’t build custom gateways.Bottom line: for true MV incremental behavior, move it to serverless or implement your own CDC-based incremental path.",

In a DG application like Collibra which I've used, you map the physical fields (say field \"customer\\_id\") to a Data Element, and that element can be Customer ID.A business term (used in a business glossary) should be agnostic to what is physically in the back-end. That is a logical concept, and a business glossary helps promote common language among business users. But I find it generally redundant if you already have a data dictionary which should provide a robust definition of what is physically in the field. But there are cases when business terms/business glossary can be useful. For example a CUSIP is a security identifier with its own logical definition, but the physical field \"cusip\\_id\" could have dummy identifiers in it, which would necessitate differentiating between the logical (CUSIP) and the physical (cusip\\_id).",

(But it's a great idea to keep a list of projects like this that you would be interested in doing!)By the way, this idea you're describing of transferring text isn't _really_ relevant to this sub. Data engineering certainly does involve transferring text, but it's a thing we just take for granted mainly - data engineering is mostly at a higher level of abstraction. It's like, driving a race car does involve petrochemical chemistry, but you don't need to think too hard about how petrol/gasoline gets converted to kinetic energy to be able to drive the car.Nonetheless, I do think the idea you have is a good coding project idea for a learner. It's just perhaps a bit beyond where you're at right now, and you need to choose a sensible language to invest effort in learning.",

Don’t wrap the Date column in functions (todate, cast, udf) or do math on it; put any casts on the literal side. Use range filters that align to partitions, e.g., date >= '2024-01-01' and date < '2024-02-01' instead of between on timestamps. Apply where on Date and select only needed columns immediately after loadas_spark; then trigger your action. Keep spark.sql.parquet.filterPushdown=true and spark.sql.optimizer.dynamicPartitionPruning.enabled=true. Avoid caching or collecting before filters. To confirm it’s server-side, watch the Spark UI: file count/bytes read should drop, and the sharing client logs should show fewer files listed.If your client supports predicateHints/limitHint, pass the Date range there so the server only returns matching files.We run pipelines on Databricks with Fivetran pulls; when some consumers need REST instead of sharing, DreamFactory auto-generates secured endpoints off Snowflake or SQL Server without us building a custom API.Bottom line: filter early on the Date partition with simple comparisons and verify fewer files are fetched.",

And ypu need to remember that the best and purest system is worthless if it doesn't have utility for its users.That said, I would store files in the cloud, or shared drive (if cost is a huge issue), and keep a catalog ofnthe files (and versions) in a relational database: postgres, mariadb, or even sqlite.The db can store paths, past version locations, owner, metadata, aliases who was granted access to data erc.Put a CRUD web interface on that and you have a basic data management system.Build it out in such a way that people adopt it because they want to (added value, solves problems, makes life easier), not because they have to.If you have aliases done well, the file itself can actuall be named anything. It could be a hash even. Users will use names in the system, not raw file a access.Think also of backups: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite. 3,2,1 rule.Test all parts of the system and threat scenarios early in development. It actually will speed you up, boosting your confidence.Work in thin slices: not I do all file uploads, then alias them, then catalog in database.Rather: upload 2 files, set up db, catalog, alias, maybe build basic upload mechanism in the crud ui.Add more files, test, iron out bugs, rinse, repeat.You will have a workable solution sooner and get beta testers who will find really subtle bugs sooner, but in lower quantities, because there will be smaller scale, so the bugs will be more manageable.Good ideas:Zero bugs! Policy. This does not mean know the future. It means don't leave known bugs for later. They will compund difficulty of next bugs and you will grind to a halt.Use Kanban board and visualize all work i one place. This lets you see how.much work there is, how fast it is coming in and how fast you are able to do it.It is a great tool to prioritize work and to show when someone thinks their problem is the most important right now.Think of design often. Refactor continuously.Code (sql and config files are code also) is debt.Function is value. So don't pity old unused code. Delete instead of commenting.Use version control (e.g. git) especially for config files.Do not let your passwords and keys near the version control.",

Let’s assume you want to stay at this company for the long term, go learn the business processes, network with the business analysts and leadership. Find those people that are wasting countless hours manually moving data around and show them how you can automate it for them with technology. It might surprise you, but often times people in the business who are data monkeys actually want to be something different. Often times these people have a title of “analyst” but complain that they never get time to analyze anything. After you do this, and show some success, you’ll get some visibility. Maybe you can do a second group, or maybe you’ll start to lead others to do this. Worst case scenario, you build a lot of leadership soft skills to complement your technical ones. Or you can make a decision that, for reasons, nothing will change. If so, then you should seriously consider moving on. I’ve seen many people who get into these situations as juniors and wind up 20 years later in essentially the same role - just making a lot more money. When the budget starts to tighten these people get eliminated - why pay someone that much money simply because they have been at the company for 20 years when we can hire someone much cheaper to do the same job? Or another common scenario is these people use the same technology for 20 years - same tech stack they learned when they joined the company. Then what happens is 20 years later the company makes an abrupt change to modernize and these people are hopelessly left behind. If they stay at the company they get siloed on the team that supports the old obsolete tech that couldn’t be migrated/updated. Or they hit the job market and find they are hopelessly behind the technology curve. Essentially, my point here is about empowering yourself. Your post seems to read like “they don’t want to use technology” and “they don’t let you see the real data”, etc. That’s not the right attitude. You need to empower yourself here. You can either use your skill sets to change (an area of) the company - which means you need to empower yourself to access and learn the data - or you need to empower yourself to move on. But what you wouldn’t do is just sit there and point fingers at a “them” who are responsible for you not living up to your full potential as a data engineer.",

A job doesn't need to be something you're passionate about, a job needs to be something you can tolerate doing every day, even on days you're feeling uninspired, even on days you kinda feel like shit. Having at least mild interest in the job helps with that, but it's not the focus. Interest and passion is something that better comes from your *life*. A job is how you pay for it.My direction after art school was getting a phd in math and working in machine learning, and that's something I never would have thought I would find fun until I did it. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone else, it was just something I resonated with when exploring, and my interest in it is unique to me. What I would recommend is not being afraid to change direction if you realize the path you're on is making you miserable. If you really can't stand compsci, don't power through the degree, all that does is set you up to do something every day that you hate. But if you pivot, don't look for passion, look for stability, for contentment with the day to day. A good sign is if something seems *kinda fun*. Not amazing, not cool, not noble, not virtuous. Kinda fun. Kinda fun is where it's at.",

It's disappointing but usually the point of degrees is to get a good source of income, what the current state of degrees in your country's economy is matters too. Edit; but take my advice with a grain of salt. Because if you are ready to face any economic hardship, or living in shitty apartments or not having any stable career, if you have enough passion (not just interest eg '\" I really like this but I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it either but true burning passion & dedication)) you know what you want with it and if you're ready to face anything for it, who knows there is always a possibility it'll work out",

        "body": "My background:I graduated with a master's in CS about a year ago. I'm still looking for work, but part of this was my own doing for not doing a technical internship while I was in school and not doing more personal projects (I want to teach as a 2nd career, so I tutored/did teaching jobs for CS during my summers. At the time tech was still stable, so I did not think I had to do a technical internship. You live, make choices, and you learn). I'd think about first why you hate CS and why you have negative feelings about it. For people I've tutored, usually their hatred for CS was resentment for not pursuing their passions, feelings of frustration for not understanding the material (often trying to do the work alone), math phobias, not connecting with the material, or a mixture of those reasons. All extremely valid reasons and reasons often reliant on your environment (bad profs, depression, lack of community, etc). Before you decide to jump ship from CS, be extremely honest with yourself. Did you give CS your full effort? This means if you had the time, did you attend Office hours, talk to your professors, try to talk to peers, go to tutoring (if you could afford/uni offered it), join CS clubs, etc? If the answer is no, then something was holding you back from giving it a full shot, so you need to figure out what that is and if it's within your control to get past it. Some people, even with the best tutors, need more time to learn STEM subjects than the 4 years expected out of uni- this is completely normal, but may not be a financial option for all students (which is an unfortunate position to be during later years of uni and will require some tough decisions).If you have managed to stay in your CS program this far without acidemic probation, then you likely understand *some* aspects of code, but too many knowledge gaps are there to make you see the big picture (which in CS is important, its when everything begins to click). With enough hustle, I think you can salvage the rest of your degree and make it through- but this will require complete humility to get there. You making this reddit post in full honesty about your knowledge gaps makes me think you might be able to do it. Next steps would be scheduling meetings with your profs, get a tutor if possible, talk to your GTAs, joining study groups, etc. The key part of wanting anyone to support you in your success is to take the initiative (with humility) and be consistent (show up, do the work). I've had students reach out to me with failing grades halfway through the course with humility, and it was that act of bravery that lead to them passing the class (if they put the work in).My best advice is to find a prof you like/trust in your CS department and have an honest convo with them. I'd also schedule an appointment with career services and talk to them too (you pay a ton of money to be in uni- use your resources!!!). Ask them if there is a realistic way for you to finish your degree with the knowledge gaps or if it's for the best you switch. I know plenty of people that made CS a minor and switched to business with a technical component- there could be options you aren't aware of, but you need to have those conversations with people who have that knowledge.Even if you do switch- get that internship! It's extremely important in this job market, and the easiest way to get and prove you have experience.Good Luck! Always happy to chat further. I have personally supported many CS students to find the acidemic path right for them (even if it meant a different major) and also helped many find the fun in CS to get through it (a lot actually went from hating to loving CS). I will say in learning anything, community is extremely important to help you get over hurdles and where you need to go, so don't take any resources you have for granted :)",

As a ux focused developer, thinking about human factors of coding is a favorite topic of mine. You can avoid getting stuck on time wasting tiny screw ups by making them impossible or less likely:* No clever code. Compilers understand crap like nesting ternary-? but you don't. Not without stopping to think and look at each character. You will screw up when you don't write things in steps using variable and function names that describe what is being done. * No single letter variable names or names that look almost the same. For example, difference between pairs i, j and dFoo, gFoo is only a few pixels. You will not see it when you mix them up.* Do not try to save yourself from the hassle of passing parameters. No global variables. No object properties that are not state that needs to be kept between calls to public methods. No local variables that are defined before they are needed. All of those just cause you to use a wrong variable or one that is in the wrong state.* No state checks all over that try to silently recover from state being messed up. Deliberately code in a way that crashes asap if something is in the wrong state.",

Just like it is really, really easy to keep a language active, while mainly using another. If you are really worried to loose progress in C++, start a side project. It only needs to be 2-3 hours a month to be enough, just to remind yourself of the language once in a while. All in all, I don't think it's worth fighting the college over language choice. It's always easier and less friction to just use what they want you to, because all the help you can get from TAs and material is made for that language. And you are either learning a non-language-specific skill, or it's reasily transferrable anyways.",

But I don't think teaching Python in uni is to get amazing at Python, I think it's for two reasons: 1. You get to focus on the concepts they're teaching you rather than waste time on the C++ syntax and errors, and 2. It's easier for those who come into uni with little to no experience in programming. If I were you, I'd learn Python as part of my courses, and do projects with C++ in personal projects. Personal projects are amazing when you lack experience by the way, employers always asked me about the personal projects I have in my resume in interviews when I was a student. Also, being good at more languages is ALWAYS a plus, it increases opportunities you can apply for AND makes it so much easier to learn other languages cuz you'd see a pattern of common things between languages. It's true that Python is getting more and more popular, some of my projects would have been brutal without the Python libraries, but there's always jobs that require C++. Finally, remember, you're not cheating on C++ if you learn Python (no judgement, I felt like I was too).Good luck and enjoy programming!",

I am currently going into my last year for a bachelor's in Information Technology and I took classes in python, java, html & css, SQL, c++ along with all the scripting languages u can think of. Am I going to be using ALL those languages in my day-to-day once I graduate maybe, most likely or most likely not; but having the knowledge is beneficial. I lean more towards networking and sysadmin in what I want to do later down the line, so c++ isn't beneficial for ME other than the exposure. If we are talking about 1-2 classes and they fit into your program take the classes you won't be wasting your time. If the decision is dependent on your major take a step back to think about why you're in college. Also python and c++ are kinda in different realms so again what are YOU planning to do? (Pls don't come at me like I have 10+ years in the industry I am a college student with 3 years of IT experience, just trying to help someone who is in the same point I was in at one point.)",

Part of the inspiration comes from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) which is just structured markdown files. So yes, apps that don't use databases do exist! But for starting out I definitely recommend a database, even locally with SQLite. Not using one was a challenge based on over 25 years experience and a desire to put privacy first. I'll also say for learning having the \"easy\" thing taken from you can really help you learn something deeper, so I definitely appreciate the pedagogical approach you're under. When learning programming, oftentimes the \"easy\" way is not the way to gain skills. If it were, then programming wouldn't be valuable. :)",

I designed a security library for a backend system I was working on where I consulted a senior dev for opinions on what the tokens should look like, etc, but the implementation was all up to me, and the deadline for it was loose to give me the time to hash through things that worked and things that didn't work and try out different ways of writing the thing. I had no experience at all in this domain, but once I got it to finally start working, I felt like I could do *anything*, and that mentality has carried me forward to where I am now.

I also buy lower spec systems because it performs faster even with lower end hardware. Windows 10 broke something with my PC almost every time I updated it, I have less issues even with Arch. Tiling windows managers and the actually functional virtual desktops have optimized my workflow better than it was in windows.

Linux is much more flexible in part because it’s designed by many people over time and in part because it was always meant to be, it’s open source meaning if you need a smaller or faster version you could just build one (which people have done eg Alpine which is a minimum computer with none of the fluff perfect for a server that isn’t designed for anything else — no need for mouse support on a machine that doesn’t even physically exist on its own). It’s also habit and preference. I can switch back to using Windows (and actually have to for some older software at work) but it’s annoying.

Write it in a form that you understand. I'm not suggesting you write this for the entire codebase, just the areas of focus for your task in small chunks.In between all of this take plenty of notes on things you don't understand.Finally, when you approach senior devs, explain to them what you have learned and then ask your questions. It will go over a lot smoother if you've done some legwork before asking. My rule for new devs is don't spend more than 2 hours being stuck. Ask for help.

Tech is arguably one of the most community oriented STEM fields out there, especially evident in it's history. Lean into this strength!I guarentee you have at least 5 classmates who feel exactly like you. Next time you go to class, talk to a few classmates and ask them if they are doing any side projects, how they feel about leetcode, etc. Do not feel discouraged if you hear a few people talk about their side projects/ease with leetcode- find comfort in being aware of people more knowledgeable than you in your community- you can learn a lot from them! Once you got enough feelers, start figuring out what you want to do with that info. Is someone working on a side project that sounds interesting? Then see if you can do something similar or ask if there is any way you can join in on it. Are a lot of students struggling too? Then form a study group together and collectively figure out what projects you can work on either together (get that github practice in) or independently. Even if you are surrounded by many people who \"have it together\", ask them what got them there and how you can be more involved. Whatever you do with the feelers, make sure it's rooted in community and doing work consistently. Personal projects have really frustrating hurdles, so you need that support system to get you to keep going.Your professors are also goldmines of knowledge too, so ask them what types of personal projects you can work on or some general guidance- literally email them to schedule a meeting.If there is one thing college gives you, it's the opportunity to connect with people (your first network). One of the best lessons I took away from college is it only takes one person to get the momentum to build a community- so if you can't find community that will help you grow, then that is a sign you need to put in the work to build it. The other big lesson I learned in college is that people really admire someone who openly wears humility and accountability on their sleeve- it builds trust and leaves room for stronger connections to grow.Whenever I have feelings of imposter syndrome kicking in with thoughts like \"I could never achieve x\", I pause and ask myself \"But why not me?\". And I keep asking why until I have measurable steps I can take to improve.Hope that helps! Even with the stuff we are passionate about, it's easy to feel lost or overwhelmed when we try to tackle it alone. Most of the time, a bunch of people feel the same as you and are waiting for *anyone* to say the frustrations/insecurities no one else is saying outloud.",

The real metric of general knowledge/skill is what projects you have made. Since you say you haven't made anything, the best time to start making a project is right now, whenever you have some free time to spare. Pick something you find interesting and just start making it. The hardest thing is looking at a blank editor, but once you write the first few lines (even if it's just a bunch of comments outlining the general program flow you are going to implement), you'll naturally fall into a pipe-line of problems you have to solve, allowing you to iteratively reach a solution over time. There's no shame in using google or any other forms of documentation, everyone does it, and if they don't then they're either lying or making something trivial. The only thing I'd avoid, or at least use with extreme caution, is any form of generative A.I. Ideally, you'd use it as a tool or a tutor, asking it to explain concepts or answer some questions you might have. However, in reality most people (especially beginners/learners!) fall into the trap of having the A.I. do everything for them, and essentially \"outsource\" their thinking to the machine. By that point, you may as well not waste your time, since you will learn nothing.You should also avoid falling into the trap of \"collecting\" languages as if they are Pokemon. You should be focusing on language-agnostic concepts, which can be implemented in a variety of languages (some of which will be better suited than others to whatever you're making). Of course, it's ideal to have a basic grasp of the language you are going to use, but if you're firm in your language-agnostic concepts, it will be easy to just pick up the syntax along the way.As an answer to your question, it's definitely not over. You just need to change your approach to education. And you need to ask yourself if you really enjoy Computer Science, because if you do, then everything you do will feel a lot less arduous.",

When you look at something like mathematics, or really most subjects you take in school, you can see this level like structure where most things you learn earlier support nearly everything you learn later. Eventually you have to specialize and your field will have knowledge that is specific to it, and not applicable to other experts.I’ve found that with programming, it doesn’t really neatly fit into a nice sequence, because it’s far less sequential, and far more parallel. You learn *out* rather than you learn *up* if that makes any sense. And you advance in terms of your general maturity, rather than specific knowledge building on each other as theorems imply further theorems. The other thing is that programming sits in this place between academia and a trade, where there’s a ton of “craft” and professional knowledge that exists in the form of essentially folk wisdom transmitted via forums and blogs, not books. All that is to say, it’s harder to curate a list like you imagine, and there’s going to be way more disagreement about it when they do.Here is a list of articles about software which I think are all excellent, but decidedly mostly on the advanced side.

It’s the kind of book that starts with stuff where you’re like “Yeah, obviously” and then a couple chapters later you’re going “WHAT?!” People tend to have strong opinions about it one way or the other; I think it’s brilliant and should be on pretty much every programmer’s to-read list, but plenty of people think it’s overrated. Given that it’s free, it’s worth a try.* [*Concrete Mathematics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics) is, as the title suggests, focused on the math side of CS, but since this is where most programmers are weakest, it’s worth mentioning. One of its authors, Donald Knuth, is more famous for his advanced work, but *CM* is suitable for pretty much anyone who is confident about the bare bones of programming but wants to understand it more deeply.",

He wrote a compiler that only outputs MOV instructions but is still Turing complete. He wrote a thing that when you reverse engineer it, it displays pictures from your own hard drive, as a deterrent to reveng further. He hacked into ring -2 on an x86 processor - you don’t know what ring -2 is? Neither did anyone else until he hacked it. He wrote Cantor Dust to suggest what the next gen of reveng tools should look like. Man is a legend. So, while other recommendations make perfect sense, these magazines/books will expand your mind in ways they never could. And the PDFs are free. Did I mention they are free? And awesome?

Martin:** A classic on writing readable, maintainable code. It teaches craftsmanship: naming, structure, clarity, and how to think about code quality in any language.2. **Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler:** One of the most important books if you want to write and improve maintainable code. You will learn patterns, code smells, and how to gradually improve structure without breaking things.3. **Design Patterns (Gang of Four):** The foundational book on object-oriented design patterns. It’s dense, but once you get the concepts, you’ll start seeing these patterns everywhere in real projects.These aren’t low-level, but they’re the kind of books that make you a better programmer overall, they improve how you think about code, structure, and long-term maintainability, regardless of whether you’re writing Python, C, Java, or anything else.",

You’re receiving formatted text that your host binds to a handing method which in turn returns formatted text. Taking the long view, Rest is simply a point of view that “the http verb in the formatted text header should dictate the operation” which replaced the previous opinion which more or less said “just use post or get for that mandatory verb header and name your operation in the relative path and the name should usually match the handling method so you can find things”. Neither is wrong. People just have strong opinions about formatted text. Bonus: If you really want to annoy people, go take the position that soap with xsd-defined payloads is more precise, more extensible, and can be more secure than rest with json (it is) and that devs were simply too lazy to learn the spec. It’s a bit better now that swagger (open api) is more mainstream, but for a while rest was a real pain to consume.The next thing to remember is that your reaction is valid and you’re often going to have more tailored controller services for web front ends. These aren’t enterprise APIs. They’re part of the same logical application and are only services because the halves run on two different computers. Otherwise they would just be helper or data layer methods. We do this because chattiness and sequential service call latency is the death of web pages. So if a commonly used page needs a getMyStuff composite method that returns a splittable json payload in one hit, that’s not crazy. If you need that to be available generically, you can expose a graphql or composite endpoint that allows you to specify an object and specific children and fields. Try not to make something that creates security or sql injection problems.",

Find methods that don't follow this and extract into simpler methods.4. Once you have a set of methods that appear to be focused on a particular variable(s) or piece of state, consider grouping these methods and variables into a class. Think about how these methods/properties might represent some entity. That said, don't get bogged down by focusing too much on OOP. Learn programming first. As a beginner, you should be focused on getting your code to work and that's it. With smaller scale apps/beginner projects, OOP often introduces unnecessary complexity",

You use it to create an object which looks like the class. Then you call the methods on that object. The reason you would want to do this is because you have multiple objects which are essentially the same, or similar. For example, take the ghosts in Pac-Man. You could write this by declaring X and Y co-ordinate variables for each ghost, but then you'd have a bunch of variables like ghost1x and ghost3y and ghost4x and so on. Think about how writing collision detection would work. You'd have to check if ghost1x==playerx && ghost1y==playery || ghost2x==playerx && ghost2y==playery.... nightmare.Instead, define a ghost class, and instantiate it four times, once for each ghost. The ghost class could include a collision detection function, to check if its *instantiation* hit the player. Now you can just write something like: if greenGhost.hitPlayer() player.gotCaught()You don't have to worry about how the calculation of the collision detection works any more -- at least, that is the theory.Have you searched for beginner-friendly OOP tutorials outside of video sites?

The real way you learn OOP isn’t by studying diagrams, it’s by modeling small real systems, giving each class a clear responsibility, and avoiding the “giant class with 20 methods” trap. That shifts your thinking from: the procedural way: “What steps do I need to do?” to the OOP way: “What objects exist in this world, and what responsibilities do they have?”2. Tutorials don’t teach design, books do. If you want actual design and not just syntax, these beginner-friendly resources are gold: **\"Head First Design Patterns\"**: the best intro to OOP thinking, **\"Practical Object-Oriented Design\"**: very readable and extremely practical, and **\"Refactoring improving design of existing code\"**: not OOP-specific, but teaches you to *see* structure and smell bad design3. Another underrated tip: read good OOP code. Python libraries, open source github repositories, or even frameworks.4. On the language choice: Python can teach you OOP, but it’s a multi-paradigm language, so beginners often get mixed signals. If you want the concepts to crystallize faster, something more “pure OOP” like Java, C#, or Ruby tends to make the underlying principles way clearer. Once it clicks, you can apply it in any language.And honestly, everyone writes procedural code inside classes at first. Keep going. The moment it clicks, it really clicks.",

That being said I'm not sure if there are any FP units that do 64 bit faster than 32 bit.As for your programs, you should always ask why you need more precision. IEEE supports FP32, FP64 and FP128 as for what you are calling shorts I suspect that is language dependent and is not a floating point type. Often we are talking about \"floats\" as 32 bits and \"doubles\" as 64 bits (C++). There is also a potential for long doubles. Again in the context of C++, shorts are integer types, so shorts would almost always be faster than the floating point unit. The big but is that this can be execution unit dependent. I can't help with C# as i know zip about it, but if shorts are integers there then you might want to look into your understanding of the language. Integers and floats have two different use cases. it is important to understand that floats are approximations.So when you ask which is faster, you need to ask what hardware is it running on. GPU's can really muck things up because of special types and optimizations. One of those optimizations is what can be done in parallel. For example if the GPU (for example) 128 16 bit integer operations per cycle as opposed to say 32 doubles per cycle which is faster? What I'm trying to say here is that it depends on the specifics of language and hardware the code runs on. In the made up numbers above the processor would complete 4x more operations per cycle.Caches are a wholly different discussion. Generally shorter types means more data in cache but you also need to consider cache line length and other behaviors. If you have truly time critical code you may need to optimize for cache behavior on a specific processor. It is completely possible to arrange things (floating point operations) such that cache might not be a problem compared to integer.",

The FPU converts all floating point type to a large type with excess bits to help reduce errors, so those floats get a double (pun?!) conversion from their 32 bit value to a 80 or 120 or whatever it is now bit value, the computations are done, and it gets converted back again to the smaller value. Integers don't suffer as much of this on some hardware, it just depends. X86 type chips for example has overlapped registers for 1, 2, 4, and 8 byte integers all in the same physical circuits, so it does not have to promote a 32 bit int to a 64 bit and back to do the computations. Also, integer circuitry \\*in general\\* is simpler than floating point, due to how it has to handle the exponent and base for floats while integers are pretty much simple math. I mean a multiply in binary is either a copy of the value (multiplied by 1) or all zeros (by zero) so a multiply is just steps that shift and add. A multiply in floating point is notably more complicated.I don't know the modern timings. FPUs are VERY fast. Integer math circuits are also VERY fast. But all things being equal, the extra work for floating point makes me feel pretty confident that its probably at least microscopically slower than integer math if you can actually do the same work using both types. It may take a billion plus repeated operations to show a meaningful difference when timing it, though. And repeated operations MAY skip the double conversion stuff, if you are working with the same entity over and over that would be optimized to have far less impact, so the actual task being tested matters a lot too.cache and bus stuff outside the CPU has an impact, and THERE, bigger is not better. Its a totally different conversation.Language does matter, at least somewhat. Or the compiler, and how good it is. Some less popular languages may not have the A team working on the compilers the way we have for big languages like c++ and so on, as one issue. Others stuff like interpret vs compiled can make a big difference.",

        "body": "I wouldn’t stress about this — it’s the most extreme case of premature optimization. But the AI isn’t entirely wrong, it’s just answering a question that doesn’t matter for you.Modern CPUs are optimized for 32/64-bit operations, and short arithmetic can require extra sign-extension instructions. Float SIMD (SSE/AVX) is also absurdly well-optimized compared to integer SIMD. So in a tight loop doing pure math on individual values, floats can genuinely be faster per-operation.But that’s not what data-oriented design is about. The win from smaller types is memory bandwidth and cache — if you’re iterating over millions of values, smaller types mean more fit in a cache line, fewer misses, faster overall. The AI conflated ALU throughput with memory access patterns, which are completely different concerns.None of this matters unless you’re in a game engine’s hot path or crunching massive datasets. In normal application code, you’ll burn way more time on the code smells: constant casts when APIs expect int, subtle bugs from implicit narrowing, maintaining mental overhead about which precise type lives where.Constrained types absolutely make sense for semantic clarity though — using sbyte for a deck index or ushort for a port number communicates intent and gives you some compile-time bounds enforcement. That’s a readability and correctness win, just not a performance one",

Don't try to come up with \"the perfect\" project. Just choose something you have at least some interest in, ideally something you can use yourself. It should also be relatively small, so that you don't feel frustrated about not being able to finish it.A couple of suggestions off the top of my head:1. Just a simple intro page about yourself. Later you can introduce your other hobby projects there2. Habit tracker. You can use it to track whether you work on hobby projects every day :)3. Language learning toolOver time, you will have a much better idea of what and how you want to build.This simple habit accomplishes many things at the same time:1. Gives a lot of learning opportunity. You need to think what tools you need to use, how to use them, etc.2. Similar to 1, but it's more about some domain knowledge. e.g. if you decide to build a language learning tool, you'd probably research some established tools and will either copy their UI/UX or even improve them. You'd understand what challenges users have while using these kinds of apps, etc3. Builds confidence. Once you have a couple of very small projects under your belt, you can gradually move to more and more complex ones. Over time, you will feel more and more confident in your skills4. Builds your portfolio that you can show to your potential employer. Trust me, most employers(at least the ones I'd like to work for) would love to see you build stuff in your free time without anybody's direction.IMO AI is only scary for junior devs who can only follow simple directions of their employers and don't show any initiative. By building your own things, you will inevitably learn how to be more proactive which I don't think AI will be able to replicate in foreseeable future.",

Figuring out what it is he actually likes would likely show his real aptitude and can help you figure out actually get his attention. If you just want to teach “coding” principles to a 9 year old the best bet are probably puzzle or strategy games that they find engaging. It teaches them the basics of problem solving and following procedures. I think of games like Portal, Zelda, Tomb Raider, Uncharted… Games where you do You do A and B to then be able to do C. Actual coding, might as well be teaching him French or Chinese. If he’s not into language, it’s kinda school-like. Remember what we do is solve problems by writing repeatable procedures. What motivates us to actually code? Somebody with money will pay us to solve their problems, while maybe personal problems motivate us for personal projects. What motivates a 9 year old, or what personal problems could they solve through coding? If you can figure that out, you may have a better chance to get his attention earlier to more “practical” applications.",

If you're not being challenged and pushing through large resistance when learning, then you're leaving a ton of knowledge and skill on the table. That knowledge and skill will make all the difference in your professional career.",

That isn't to say getting a certification would definitely be worthless, but in my mind, if your goal is to be able to show a potential employer \"Hey, I can do X thing,\" it's actually probably more effective to just focus on talking about interesting projects you've done (don't need to be external to school, can just be school assignments or final projects) at a level that shows that you have a good conceptual grasp of what you were doing, along with some experience with the tools that are common to the industry you're interested in. Tools that you might get asked about are ones related to version control (e.g., git), debugging (e.g., gdb), and unit testing (lots of options, and you may not use anything formal for this purpose, which is also OK). It is not necessary to fully master any one tool, you're just trying to signal \"Hey, I have used these tools as part of my process, and I can fairly quickly pick up different ones that do the same job.\"As for questions 3 and 4 about what else you should be doing right now and how to stand out, I will first say that I admire your willingness to think ahead. On the other hand, I will also say that you should not feel compelled to do extra work beyond what is already being assigned to you at school. This is because, imo, the amount of hard work and effort it takes to stand out is not worth the payoff *if* your only goal with that effort is to stand out a little more. Your driving motivator should just be what you're interested in, especially because what you're interested in may change, which can lead to you going into a different field than the one you're currently considering, at which point any past hyper-specific work done for the purpose of standing out may not be very useful to you.That being said, projects are a good place to start. A project can be anything you're interested in: a website, a game, a tool, an extension of a school project. The important thing is just that there's some overlap between your project and the field you're interested in. For example, if you think you might want to work in embedded systems, then building a web app won't help you very much (it may still help a little, though). However, you want to be willing to devote some proper time to it -- probably at least 50 hours in total, spread out over the course of a summer or school year.",

Just grinding won't get you further. Your brain will just get overloaded and shut down.A little story from my experience: when Java came out, I was already programming for over a decade and was proficient in multiple procedural languages. Then, I tried Java and OOP. This was a humbling experience. I could not make heads or tails at all. The *language* was easy enough to understand, but switching from procedural to OOP didn't click at all. I tried many times and failed many times until at one point, it suddenly started to make sense. Can't even say what really did it for me.Now, my advice is to program something with it and here, I deviate from the common examples: build a *library* for card games, like Blackjack, Poker, Uno, etc. Start with modeling a single `Card`. It has a suit, a rank, a numeric value, a face, a back, it can be face up or down - the fields. The card can report its data - provided it is face up, it can draw itself (in a loose sense), it can be flipped - toggle face up/down.Then, go further: make a `Deck` that can hold a full set of cards, that can be shuffled, that can deal cards, that can tell if it is empty or not, etc.Next, a `Hand` that takes cards.And so on.Build it in such a way that you can create different `Card` types, e.g. PokerCard, UnoCard, etc. All these can use the `Deck` without modification.With such an exercise, you'll cover abstract classes, inheritance, composition, polymorphism. The benefit is that you can draw a relation between a real world object and its digital representation.",

I am not sure what university you go to or how they teach it there, but in general I don't think they teach it very well and you certainly have not had enough classes to be this hard on yourself.OOP is not just a Java thing either. You can think of it as real life and that is why it is supposed to make sense once you understand that. Classes are just descriptions of things. Objects are instances of that description.Use animals as an example. Mammals are a class that describes things with hair. So, hasHair == true. Some mammals are land animals and some are sea animals. So, where == \"land | sea\". A lion (subclass) \"Inherits\" the attributes of a mammal and adds a few more attributes like sharp teeth. So, hasTeeth == true && hasBigTeeth == true && isDangerous == true :). A pig is a mammal too and it \"inherits\" from mammal too. Some of the attributes it shares with a lion has different values. If we were to control a lion or a pig we call the \"run\" function, the lion will have a faster run implementation than the pig. \"Polymorphism\". We typically hide the implementation and field access to make code less brittle. We would not want someone binding directly to something we want to be able to change later. We make these attributes and internal functions private. \"Encapsulation\". There should be a subclass of mammal that lion inherits from named \"LandAnimal\". Now this part gets tricky because Java does not support multiple inheritance so we want to use hasA vs isA implementation. When we access the base class LandAnimal which actually has the \"run\" method which is slower in pigs than in lions \"polymorphism\" again. LandAnimal is an \"abstraction\" (or base class) of Lion (isA LandAnimal). Or we can use interfaces for this \"abstraction\" (hasA LandAnimal) interface (composition).I just wrote this from the top of my head so I hope it makes sense and is correct.I hope this helps. Relax a little, go easy, and don't give up. You will get it.",

When you sleep, all that learning and information that seems a bit of a jumble is going to be reorganized in your mind and memory. And it only happens when you are sleeping. You also need to take some time off to exercise and get some fresh air because your brain won't work at its best if it is overwhelmed with stress. You have to let some of it out.

For example, the last thing I wrote was about doing an analysis of European versus U.S. stock valuations because I saw a post about the difference in market cap, and I want to see if I can tease out what causes it (e.g. is it mostly due to difference in profit growth, price/earnings ratios, dominant companies, dominant sectors, etc.). Most of the things in my journal never get made, but sometimes I will get the motivation to actually start one of them, and I have a big list of projects. Other ideas: an Alexa skill to get the menu of a local restaurant, KSP mod for animal payloads, open play court booking app for local courts, etc. I haven't done any of these, and some of them I don't even have the basic knowledge to do (I have never made an Alexa skill or KSP mod).",

Deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning. Develop a taste for finding flaws in your own thinking, sometimes it’s easier to practice by finding flaws in other people’s thinking. But always return to your own. Debate people. Be able to debate their side of an argument better than they can. When you come back to programming, you’ll be able to drill into problems better. You’ll be better able to take ownership of the concepts and will feel at more liberty to play with them. Philosophy will teach you to not take your understanding for granted, and how to dig into the details. Also if possible, dialogue with yourself as if you are two people. So like“What is a variable?”“Well, I don’t know, what do you think a variable is?”“A variable is some piece of data assigned to a name”“And what do you mean by assigned to a name?”“Well, I take a word and I set it equal to something, could be a number a string of characters”“When you say set it equal, do you mean like 1+1=2 ““Well no, the variable is a placeholder for whatever value ive assigned to it”“Oh, so you use it instead of the value ““Yes”Etc…Most programmers will say slow your thinking down, dialoging like this is a way of doing that.

I prefer to start with strongly opinionated design so you can focus on learning, and then as your understanding deepens you can start to experiment more.There's no wrong answers. Java has a massive market share, if you learn Java you already know a massive chunk of C#. Go is very easy to pick up. There's also Ruby on Rails, Python, node. You can work in C++/Rust as well, or venture out further.

With your own local install, you'll be well set up for all your future coding projects regardless of what course or other method you end up choosing. If you don't like watching the lectures, you could just skip the video and read the lecture notes instead. Then jump into the problem sets. It's a great introductory course that does set you up well to expand your learning in different directions. Just reading documentation would be an unnecessarily hard road considering the multitudes of resources available these days. Docs aren't really a learning resource for new programmers. They're written expecting the reader to have a certain level of knowledge already. But I'm sure a quick search would bring up loads of free and paid courses, and other resources. Any source recommending CS50 will likely recommend others too. My tip as an educator, is to pick whatever you want. It doesn't really matter as long as you're making forward progress.

Is able to reproduce his error and describe it. Is willing to ask for help. Has some idea where the issue is NOT. etc. He is proactive as much as he can. Yes, he struggles and is stuck. But he communicated with his team mates. Perhaps he has some ideas but does not know how to put these ideas into a code. But has a theoretical solution.Another one takes his task. During standups he says \"I'm working on it.\" Then \"I still need some more time.\" When being asked if he needs some help he goes with \"No. It is okay. I will figure it out.\" and so on. Or, if there are no morning standups but just some meeting in the end of the sprint (2 weeks or so) he just disappears for these days/weeks. In the end he has not progressed nowhere.With these two juniors it is clear that the first one is willing to learn. He is a team player and seeks help when he has done his part but still being stuck. He listens to the advice of his team mates. But the second one is a lost case. He does not function in a team and is unable to work on his tasks. He requires a constant handholding and even with handholding is unable to pick up any new knowledge. Eventually he either quits or is let go.Coding interviews are not just there to see if you can write code. How do you approach a problem. How do you analyze it. What you are trying and what you are not trying. How do you react to a stressful situation. How do you communicate with your \"team\" (your interviewers and such). etc.Either you succeeded or you failed. No point to worry over something that is out of your control. If you succeeded then well done. If you failed then ask them for a feedback in what was lacking and what you can improve in yourself before you start applying to jobs again.",

You’re getting stuck conceptually, even if you know the basics of programming.What you need to do for your C# project is use whatever resources were given to you during the class to make a working entry point into the project. If you can run the project and get the UI to pop up on screen then the first hurdle is over.

But each time you build something new, try and apply the things you’ve read about. Read a design pattern and then pick something at random and build it with applying that pattern as the main focus. It doesn’t have to be anything complex, keep it simple. Then improve it. I felt the same way after developing in React for 2 years. I never felt like my skills were where I wanted them to be. One day I stumbled across a video from Brian Vaughn on virtualization, a design that allows data grids to “infinite scroll” as you only render what is coming into the viewport and immediately unmount those elements when they are out of view. I had used well known libraries for this prior, but watching his presentation gave me an insight into “how” he implemented this idea in his library react-virtualized.I went off and tried to build my own little library that could do the same. I dropped the “I’m not gonna re-invent the wheel” mindset, and instead just said I’m gonna sit here and get something working if it takes me all month. Instead of querying GPT for answers, I just broke it down into small bites. “How do I unmount something when it goes out of view? How do I detect when something is coming into view?” Etc.” In the end, my little library worked well enough for me to be super proud that I figured this out, and the amount I learned during the process was pretty wild. I use this example because it was the first of what would become many of these little “let me see if I can make a basic version of this” exercises. This has helped me far far more than than tutorials, countless hours reading and such. Hope this helps! TLDR; BUILD",

Your ability the land the job is more than likely going to be because you did well in a technical interview. Your ability to get a technical interview is NOT going to be because you did a coding boot camp or some other program. Now, don't get me wrong. They can be great for building beginner level coding skills, but I don't see a world where it makes a difference in landing the job. What might help you pad your resume are actual industry accepted certifications. Heck, I would even think the Microsoft FreeCodeCamp Foundational C# Certification would be better, although not by much. An actual 4 year CS degree is going to beat you out almost every time.",

All it will do at best is get you an interview, it's up to you to prove yourself.Think of it more like auditioning to be in a play. Graduating from a good theater school will get you an interview. Knowing someone on the cast will work just as well. But if you don't impress them with your audition, none of it will matter.So your primary focus should be to learn the skills, don't worry about the credential because it's the least important thing.The good news is that there are tons of completely free resources to learn to code online.My suggestion is rather than worrying about which one is the most likely to lead to a career, focus on which one is the best fit for you. The first course you pick won't determine your career trajectory, the goal is simply to get you from zero to coding. Once you get the hang of coding, you can pivot to different languages depending on your interests and goals.Here are three suggestions for very high-quality free courses. All three of them are a fantastic way to go from zero to coding, even though they teach very different things. They have very different styles and teach different languages, but all are valid first steps. Pick one that works for you.[https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)[https://programming-25.mooc.fi](https://programming-25.mooc.fi)[https://www.theodinproject.com](https://www.theodinproject.com)",

It's the only way you'll stay motivated to write code outside of class, build new things, and deal with the rapidly-changing landscape and job market (AI, new libraries, new tools, new approaches, refactors, \"breaking changes\", debugging, so on and so forth); at least that's how it is for me. I thought I hated programming, refused to even try it until I was 30, then I found out I'm good at it and I love it (I'm a little obsessive when it comes to programming now). Almost all of my friends who went to school for software engineering, thinking it'd land them a high-paying job (who never programmed outside of class) are all working in a different fields now. In a tight market, employers aren't interested in programmers who aren't interested in code.You've basically answered your own question. There's no reason to specialize in something you hate, nor in going to college if you hate it, for a degree you'll hate working in. Look into audio production and audio engineering (that's somewhat different from straight \"music technology\"). However, you're kind of giving mixed signals. If you're into music and music software, what don't you like about the music technology you were introduced to (which, presumably, uses said software)? I tried being a musician a long while back, and I loved messing with MIDI devices and all the music MIDI and editing software. I liked messing with soundboards, and I think it'd be fun to be the sound mixer/tech at concerts (for example).If the idea is: You hate college, you hate all the degrees, but you're going to get one anyways. Pick something ***you can stand***. Something adjacent to what you want to do. For example, I got a business degree with an emphasis in entrepreneurship, because I've always wanted to start a small business (and as of now, I'm building out my presence as independent contractor for full stack software engineering). Yes, the degree is kind of worthless, and no it didn't ***really*** teach me much about building and sustaining a small business, but it all starts to add up.In my mind, it'd make way more sense for you to go to a technical school for audio production. It'll be cheaper, faster, and you might actually develop a stronger interest for it. Then, if it turns out you hate it, at least you didn't waste 4 years and $30,000 getting a degree you hate.",

Allow yourself to be interrupted with ideas, make notes and try them out.Second, try boiling down the problem to a minimal program that eliminates everything else except the one thing you're struggling with. This often reveals some factor that you previously overlooked. Use a separate copy or some sort of version control so you can switch between the minimal example and the full version with minimal effort.Edit: Oh, and by the way, this is what programming is actually all about, and the main reason why LLMs are not going to \"take over\" any time soon.",

You talk to someone - explain the problem to them in a calm and relaxed way, tell them what you have been trying, and ask if they have any suggestions.

Even if you don't get the exact answer, perhaps you'll get some input you can work with.Remember, the expected outcome is never the actual solution, the final product, the running code. When learning, the expected outcome is always that you try something, that you experiment with, work with the theory covered in the course. Sometimes problems do require a sudden insight that you shouldn't be expected to get, but more often they actually just require you to apply the material from the latest class.Most importantly, don't sit alone with your docs and LLM machines - talk to actual people, maybe those you are studying with, maybe someone completely unrelated.",

        "body": "I’ve been there — juggling a full-time job and school makes it feel like you’re always behind. One thing that helps is treating programming like a hobby in small chunks. Even 30–60 minutes a night on tiny projects can make a big difference. For example, I once “built” a tiny text-based inventory tracker just for fun. It was messy and far from perfect, but it forced me to practice loops, conditionals, and structs without the pressure of grades. By the time I got to a bigger class, I already had a toolkit of small wins to rely on. For you, over break, I’d suggest small Rust or C++ exercises — calculators, mini games, anything you find fun. Focus on comfort with syntax and problem-solving, not perfection. That consistency and experimentation is what makes Programming 2 feel way more manageable.",

It was pain to switch between them during a single semester, but I was young and I was hungry to learn just everything. Now I am glad that I has this experience, I have enough basic knowledge to be able to learn any new language in short termIn my career I switched over dozen of main languages - delphi, c#, all kinds of sql dialects with stored procedures, almost all of jvm, erlang, python, shellLearning languages is mostly easy, exceptions are very developed and complicated languages like scala. It takes much longer to learn frameworks, tech stacks, ecosystems coming with languages",

Like, why did I get an engineering degree? I was tired of making $12 as a security guard. Why am I now in a second degree program for data science? Turns out I don't like factory work. Oddly enough, in relation to one part of your post, my intro to data structures course was the first time I actually enjoyed coding because I found machine learning to be really fun when I did that as extra credit on an assignment. I'm not here to be crude or rude to you. The reality is you're in the same situation as a lot of us, and even more difficult because of your location. My main suggestion is to find your \"why\" and grab onto it. A lot of self help books emphasize that as well. The fact that you actually enjoy coding puts you ahead of where I was for a long time lol. Don't give up. Keep learning, trying, honing your skills.

Backend work is a perfectly solid direction, and the fact that you enjoyed wiring APIs to databases is a good sign. You do not need to be great at front end to have a career. You also do not need to master data structures in one pass. Most people only internalize that stuff once they use it in real projects.

I use Warp, which has command suggestions and explanations, so half the time I am learning new commands just by asking it to show me what to run and then reading what it did.",

I only include new STL headers as I need them, but I've worked my way up to 35 different C++ headers, along with a big chunk of the Windows API. I don't use any 3rd party libraries. A clean build of the entire solution - which builds a single static library and a half-dozen tests apps - takes 5-6 *seconds* on my Dell laptop. My builds are so fast I haven't even bothered to enable pre-compiled headers.My laptop is moderately high-end, but it seems crazy to me that a personal project of a beginner programmer can be so slow that it affects workflow. But I've seen multiple questions along these lines, so it must be a common problem. Does anyone know where do these C++ build speed problems come from? Are 3rd party libraries killing people? Or is there some memory size threshold where compilation suddenly start thrashing? Or are beginners falling into some bad practice traps?",

We’d kick off a build and go to dinner and come back and hope it was done. But that was compiling Ada on a single CPU 200 MHz processor.",

College does not teach you mastery, only YOU can do that over time.The best way to get good at software engineering is to build projects as others have suggested. You have a great base somewhere in your head :) to pull from. Start with something small and definitely do it full stack. If you focus on frontend only you will miss backend context. Same thing the other way around. To me, those two things go together.Start small and keep it simple. Let the project guide what you need to learn next. I almost always suggest the often dismissed TODO exercise to start with since you already have some base knowledge.Start small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, and the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. An address book, an small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from take TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skill you need to build any of these.Also, I have been doing this for over 30+ years and I pretty much only know (often remember) basic syntax. Things I have done before are familiar, but I still need to look almost everything up.Best wishes. You can do this.",

If you are interested in these kinds of things you could even look into better raspberries, that are much better at handling heavy tasks and you can even do robotics projects with them. The most expensive one is around 130 bucks but there is a full range between the 15 and 130 bucks ones so you'll probably be able to find one that accommodates your budget while doing what you need it to do, for example the pi400 has an integrated keyboard and sells for around 60 bucks, found one second hand for 35 a while back and that was pretty nice. You could definitely look into second hand ones into your area, or maybe ask for it as a Christmas present if that's an option, it won't run any games but for second hand stuff you can get that, a monitor and keyboard and mouse for under 100 bucks and have a fully functional setup for programming and browsing he internet and your parents could use it as a computer too if they need it (might be a good selling point for them idk).",

This is great advice , I am seeing that it's going to solve a bunch of readability and maintainability issues for me. I will be going to follow this for all kinds of updates going forward. But now suppose there are more factors involved instead of just these three things. Which might not make sense in all the cases. For example when a user is updating data, we might even need his ip address to validate things, whereas in the case of admin we don't have this requirement. Many other possibilities could arrive. What approach Will you suggest in those situations. We might end up preparing and passing a lot of data that is not needed for processing the request and this, data has to be passed a lot from parent to child functions, this reminds me about the prop drilling hell of react, I don't want this problem in my backend.

The `given $role` conditional is happening too late and so has to know more about the system than it should, and that knowledge is then reified as function signatures.I obviously don't have access to your code, but I think a lot of these should be either parameterized or factorified. The former turns roles into bundles of permissions that are then used to filter out unwanted changes, whereas the latter hands off the responsibility for deciding how to perform updates to another system.

Are you asking if the win rate is too low to be fun, or are you asking if the program is behaving incorrectly?It's straightforward to calculate the exact probability of each possible outcome of a spin, and thereby calculate the probability of a win. One way to do this is by brute force: there are 116^3 = 1560896 possible outcomes, all equally probable, and you can write a program to count them up *without* randomness.With a little work, you can calculate the same win probability more efficiently, by avoiding repeatedly considering all the duplicate ways to get the same outcome.Of course, even if the probability of a win is 1/100, that doesn't guarantee that there will be exactly one win every 100 plays. The actual outcome is very likely to be higher or lower due to random variation. If you want to check your program for correct behavior, you can do a large number of runs (say, 10000) and then use an appropriate statistical test (such as a chi-squared test) to see where the observed number of wins falls, in comparison to the statistically likely range.I'm not a gambling expert, but I believe real slot machines don't *only* pay out if all of the symbols on a line match. They have additional lower-value payouts that are more frequent, designed to keep the player engaged and addicted in hopes of a jackpot.",

At the end of the day, a commercial slot machine need only be consistent with the odds; how it gets there shouldn't matter.>My biggest concern is that for every 100 spins, I win 1-2 times.You work the math to fit your criteria. That's actually absurdly low. Or, rather, wins tend to be ranked, the goal being constant little dopamine hits with the promise of something bigger. Gotta keep the addicts addicted.From [N.J. Admin. Code § 13:69E-1.28A - Standards for the approval of a slot machine game](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-jersey/N-J-A-C-13-69E-1-28A): \"each slot machine game which requires a wager shall have a theoretical return to player (RTP) equal to or greater than 83 percent.\"Start with the [Wikipedia Slot Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_machine) entry. I found this an intriguing design requirement: \"It is important to make a machine that is perceived to present greater chances of payoff than it actually has within the legal limitations that games of chance must operate.\"",

Just treat it as gobbledygook that *has* to be written for a program to work.However, it's great that you are curious. The `main` method is what the Java runtime invokes when you run a Java program. It has the specific signature you described, and here are the reasons for the questions you asked about the method signature:1. All methods are supposed to either return a value, or indicate that they do NOT return a value using the keyword `void`. Java does not expect the `main` method to return a value, which is why we use the keyword `void`.2. `main(String[] args)`: This is just the name of the method that takes a string array as an argument. This does not directly result in any user input. The Java runtime receives the user input arguments from the OS, and then passes them into `main` when it invokes the `main` method.3. The method is marked public because it has to be invoked by the Java runtime. It needs to be accessible to the outside world, it wouldn't make sense for it to be private.Honestly, I don't know if any of this explanation would make sense to a beginner. When I was learning Java, I just accepted that these are lines that have to be there. It made sense only after I had learned a lot more about data types, arguments, return values, classes, etc.",

Having a project idea can motivate you to learn what you need to make your project work.I find talking to an AI helpful, too. You can even ask an AI to give you a skeleton for your programming idea. It might give you more than you want, but if it does, trying to figure out the code it generated can also be a way to get into the learning process (provided the code isn't too complicated).",

Sure, you would never solve Leetcode problems in a real job but you would use the problem solving muscle all the time. Think of it like going to the gym and working out this muscle.

Whilst the math requirements and the performance (time, space) requirements differ greatly between projects, your understanding of DSA underpins basically everything. It's the difference between being able to put together scripts that automate things and generally glue other people's code together without knowing (or perhaps caring) how good it is (or could be), and being able to write whatever you need to, from scratch if necessary (given other time/resource/knowledge requirements are met, of course).[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33AZBnRHks) is a mostly-applicable example of the above.

All of these would be used in literally any scientific field due to their tendency to involve large amounts of information to keep track of and model.If you mean \"science\" in an academic sort of way, well universities typically stick to R for data related programming so it would be worthwhile to get some exposure there. R and Python are pretty similar in their syntax so learning both could emphasize the programming side of learning the language. Just remember to learn about data types, variables, functions, conditional statements, loops (for, while, etc.), libraries, and how to nest them into one another to combine their uses. [DataCamp.com](http://DataCamp.com) is great for learning both R and Python although it is a bit expensive.",

Bolted-on type systems, like TypeScript or whatever Python has, do help, but can't compete with a language built with typing from the ground up.That said, you should check job offers in your area and make a decision based on that if pay is your deciding factor. Both are widely used, and both will have a varied pay.I find, however, the language doesn't matter as much, unless it's something obscure. What matters is the type of projects or the company itself. I've seen backend developers being paid better for PHP than Java, or TS over C#, or also other ways around, but it's all backend developers and the pay differences are generally no that great just based on language itself.",

Predominantly for Civil, Structural, Geotechnical and Mechanical.

I think sites like Upwork still have people looking for this kind of work getting done. I have no idea how lucrative it really is, though.

Don't do it to get a side job as a programmer (unless you really want a job in that field), do it because it helps you do what you want. As a civil engineer you can use it for simulations, calculations, data extraction etc. You will most likely get a job where you don't have time for programming, so having an agent on the side helping you to build tools that speed up your other work is probably where you will end up using this. That is not very useful if you don't already know how to write python. This whole AI train requires so much more of people in order to get useful outputs.You are in college right now. Start automating your homework assignments. Make python scripts that do the calculations for you. Generate reports for you.

Seriously, easiest way to do it is to move within the organisation that you current work in. Depending on the company this can be either going up to one of the devs and saying, \"Hey, you know what, i'd like to move into dev here, what do you think and what should I be focusing on learning?\". Answer to that, pretty much always, is the companies codebase, which I assume is the one you opened, and go overwhelmed by so start by getting some help with that. Or, if you have a bit of a tougher gatekeep to deal with, move more towards the test automation side, do more coding day to day and again start to learn the code bases the devs are working on. For even the best recruiters, hiring from the market always has uncertainty, if I am looking for a dev, i'd pick somebody I know, who knows the codebase, the company and the people 11 times out of 10. Just put yourself in that position. Easy from there.",

I often try to find a string in the output that I can search for as a starting point (error messages if they are unique are great for this). I do a full project search and hope my string only shows up once. Then hopefully you have an IDE with \"go to definition\" and \"go to reference\" follow different function call and definitions to try to find where the logic for your bug is. If you don't have \"go to reference\" and \"go to definition\" you are stuck doing searches for function names and will be much slower. Trying to understand a .net project from the launch through all the routing is going through the hardest part with lots of magic Microsoft functions first which is really painful.

I'm not looking for 10 pages explaining the basics; I just want to know whether I use `\\d` or `[[:digit:]]` to represent a digit.I agree with you that the reference doc doesn't do a good job of linking to tutorial doc. Official tutorial doc usually exists (e.g. [regex](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/) and [records](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/language/records.html)), but it's not centralized in one place and not necessarily even well SEO'd.

Add facets (module, package, abstract/interface, annotation, sealed) and a size cutoff.- Visualize: precompute layout with sfdp or OpenOrd, render in Cytoscape.js or Sigma.js, and wire a fuzzy search index (Lucene/Elasticsearch) that highlights paths between two nodes. Click-through to the Javadoc.- Scale: store the graph in Neo4j so you can serve “subgraph by query” (e.g., everything that implements List within java.base).I’ve used Sourcegraph for code intel and Neo4j for subgraph queries; DreamFactory let me expose the graph as a quick REST API without hand-rolling a backend.If you ship a filtered, searchable graph, folks will actually use it.",

You need to practice using the tools in your toolbox to solve issues instead of acquiring more tools or sharpening the tools you have already. That’s basically what you’re 3 month proposal is: you’re not applying any skills you’re just reviewing what you’ve learned. Lastly, don’t use AI to help you practice. It’s not necessary. In fact, for someone like you, it’s probably more beneficial to struggle through the concepts and application of them than to turn to AI for help. I’d highly suggest you stay away from AI for anything and solve your issues the old school way with Google and StackOverflow.You feel like you suck at less things when you become more confident in your ability to solve “unsolvable” problems or “really hard” problems handed down to you without any direction other than “please help me”",

Focus on playing and interacting with concepts rather than learning them through rote memorization.>If anyone has ideas for super beginner-friendly projects that only use loops + if-statementThis seems like you want to do a project with things you already know, which is pointless. Most learning in programming is done by working with things you don't know and need to research. You really need to get comfortable with working outside of your comfort zone in this field, as you will very rarely be interacting with things that you know already. You should instead choose something that you're interested in and motivated to learn more about. You'll probably struggle a lot first and write terrible code, but it will be insanely educational.",

It usually just means you have not repeated the skills enough for them to stick. Everyone goes through this stage, even people who seem confident.The thing that actually helps is building one small project from start to finish. Not bouncing between tutorials, not switching languages, not grinding random concepts. Just pick a very small idea and force yourself to work through the awkward middle part when nothing works the way you expect. That part is where your brain finally starts connecting things.Also try not to avoid the discomfort. The areas you think you are bad at are usually the areas you simply have not spent enough hands-on time with. Once you use them for something real, they stop feeling scary very quickly.Pick one idea, keep it tiny, finish it, and you will feel the difference fast. You got this.",

People who go that track have to work a lot harder to prove they know what they are talking about to even get their foot in the door.That said, keep up with the programming.

Look up the pareto principle and lean six sigma. You can find ways to adjust your life so that you can fit all the things you want to do into the time that you have. From your description, it sounds like you're talking about a school like WGU that's self-paced. If you can't manage to stick with your personal coding projects now, you're going to have trouble following a self-paced study regimen. Academic tracks are slower, but they offer structure. Also, they offer far more opportunities to network, which is 50-70% of the importance of going to uni. So, choose whichever path seems best for you, but know that you have to get your schedule under control either way--especially with an accelerated, self-paced program. The Third option is getting a job first and either waiting a little bit or doing school simultaneously. This is tough, but also an excellent way to gain experience and get a feel for the job market and which degree program would suit you best. If you do the job first, put as much of your paycheck as you can into a roth 401k and pretend it doesn't exist. If you do the schooling first, avoid loans or work concurrently so you can pay them off before the interest becomes overwhelming. Even a 10k loan at 5% means you're paying $500 bucks a year for the privilege of owing other people money. A 30k loan at 7% means you're paying $2,100 just to hold the debt, and that is on top of payments to principle and loan origination fees. And this compounds year over year. You might want to think about working for a company that will pay for your school so that you don't have to face this kind of debilitating debt. The armed forces also are a good option in this regard. And if you have a high IQ and decent technical knowledge, they'll be able to place you somewhere where you can learn on the job and get hands-on experience. Plus the GI bill, medical, and housing assistance when you've finished. Anyway, lots of stuff to think about. Good luck!",

Adding an api to support some new feature, along with implementing the front end is pretty easy. Previously those tasks were like 15% planning, 70% coding and 15% QA. Now it is almost entirely QA. It is legit boring but requires a smart human to make sure it works as expected and the code is maintainable. Rarely does claude code one shot things. Although I still do feature development, I have been shifting to harder problems. Finding slow memory leaks, building dev tools to address some inefficiencies, analyzing and addressing performance issues, optimizing our horrendously slow CI, devop stuff, etc. I still use ai for these harder problems but it involves a lot more human coding and intervention. These things felt a bit overwhelming before but now feel doable.... and they are fun. Learning a lot going outside of my comfort zone",

If you have a professional network / connections, they are your best resource for getting past all the noise created by AI resumes and all the tactics that HR / recruiting departments are using to thin them out.A friend at another company said they just fired an offshore guy who they later found out had 6 jobs at the same time. That's what you're competing against, the noise of professional job applicants using every tool at their disposal.>Also, does anyone have experience applying for a TPM or manager position after being a software engineer? Thinking of pivoting.You need to pivot in place at your next employer, rather than try to pivot between jobs. It won't work, you have no experience in the role you're applying for. My advice would be to try to be your next team's Scrum Master, if they don't have one. Get the certs for that, get some experience, then look at pivoting again to Product Owner or TPM based on your preference.FYI these \\^\\^\\^ roles are getting even worse for cold applications because all the offshore that can't code (or get their cousin who can code to do the interview for them) get scrum / PM certs instead. Every cert class I teach / attend has a disproportionate number of offshore attendees, most of whom couldn't create a dashboard in Jira to save their lives.Not to be irrationally negative about offshore but there's so much noise in the system right now that it's hard to match US workers to US jobs. I can't even get callbacks on ITAR / DoD jobs that get relisted 2-3 times, and these people were throwing all the money at me 3 years ago. The whole system is broken. Rely on your network.Edit: TPM, PO, Scrum Master, Agile Coach etc are all excellent places for former devs to go. Moving to coaching was the best thing for my career, as most of your competition won't even be close to your technical skillset. You need to like people more than the average dev does, and you'll need to learn how to navigate some of the politics. I'm paid at a Sr Mgr / Director grade (Fortune 100 tech company you've heard of), have frequent access to organizational leaders, and am basically the wizard who has the data and the dev background to tell them where their orgs are running right and where they aren't. Get a good leader or five who like you and know what you can do, and they'll take you everywhere they go.",

I will often then try and type it from memory again, but that's not super important. The great thing is you're essentially being paid to learn, and you are picking up the knowledge that will come in handy once you brush up against the limits (context windows, reasoning, product understanding).LLMs are an S-curve (where we've basically hit the diminishing return) and they aren't coming for your job in any meaningful sense.",

And to be fair i would not be the dev i am if claude helped me.... I was a maniac going from forums to forums reading difference in lib implementation, about middleware optimisation, even reducing stuff from custom middleware where certain parts were not required so it could save cpu cycles etc.....Mate people can still implement redis , and if possible even write code for redis cleanup and all... But not everyone would be able to optimise or know how things are implemented under the hood, anyhow..... If you are doing things fast, you are skipping the time which would be better utilised if you were manually doing something and searching forums, seeing different architectural codes of diff people made me get better...

Asked AI and it came up with a few good suggestions including what I did with some more improvements which works even better. This is good and we'll put it to good use. (If this doesn't work as needed we probably will do it in the backend on Azure In C#)The second one failed epically. It's a bit more complicated, it's tracking dynamic row dependencies via good ole parent and children rows. Also SQL. Classic case of hallucinations as it kept giving reasonably looking suggestions that didn't work. Oh well. That's too deep in the code to change. I ended up optimizing it by using precalculated dependencies rather than calculating them dynamically. There's good potential but to paraphrase the TV person, \"know when to say when\".",

Solving leetcose style question is very different than doing software engineering. Companies use it because it’s a filter for problem solving and prepping. Using AI to solve problem more similar to system design, which is more important than DSA the more senior you get.",

I was just the teenager that was \"good at computers\", so I naturally thought, great, I'll just do something in computers. Turns out, my family was just super tech illiterate and im just a typical late millennial. And now that im in industry the imposter syndrome hasn't left me since day one. Which is both good and bad. I constantly feel like I should be seeking new knowledge while also feeling like I have no idea what im doing, because honestly sometimes I don't and that stress does get to me at times. Google is my friend. Everyone else seems to be doing side hustles, and side projects, blogging, reading tech news and getting caught up on the latest framework, and this and that, I just wanna go home or log off, have a few beers and play some dang Helldivers. I just don't see software dev as this romantic craft like a lot of people seem to. At the end of the day. The pay check is good, the benefits are nice, we still kind of have remote work, the bills are paid, and I have disposable income at the end of the week for fun. I wouldn't say the work is incredibly taxing but it has its ups and downs.Most jobs suck, most people hate going to work, I am where I am and I'll try and make the best of it until whatever happens happens on the global stage or I get fired and cant get/don't want another tech job.",

No live coding challenge, no technical questions outside of “do you know how to use this particular tool” and no roleplay. I had the impression, due to them mentioning modern tooling, they cared more if I fit in with the workplace rather than my capacity given the barrier to entry/capability has been lowered across the industry with Claude ect.",

There's also the distinct possibility that many tools/companies will fail/enshittify, and waiting to pick the winning/remaining tooling is generally a smart decision.Additionally, many (probably most) senior devs have been an early adopter of some piece of tech and had it fail, often catastrophically. For example, I know several crypto devs who have to fuzz their resumes because their crypto experience is seen as a red flag when applying for new roles.Given that AI is ***very visibly*** a bubble, waiting to see the situation when it pops in the near future is a pretty wise position.",

I’m in a okayish pay for my area location doing IoT cloud work (~90k, infra, middleware, application level), but I was recently given an offer for nearly a 50% bump to work at a major corporation. I would have to move to Dallas, and I think it would be less coding, more PowerBI type stuff with some elements of making new tools using other tools, sans actual coding. I would be going from 4/1 hybrid to 3/2 hybrid with 1 day per quarter requiring work on a Saturday (made up with a day off during that next week), but the cost of living (currently in Louisiana) and travel time (45-50 minutes on average vs Dallas daily shitshow of who knows how long) may make the salary difference moot. Hardest part in it is that it’s my best friend making the offer, and who would also end up being my boss. I’ve worked with him before at a peer-peer level, but idk.",

But I wasn’t exactly looking hard. Wife eventually said I needed to get back in the saddle. I questioned who would hire a 35 year old who hadn’t worked in 4 years, but I’m a confident white male with all the privilege that comes with that, so I somehow immediately got work as a tech VP on Wall Street for a top-5 bank.

Just make sure your application is actually making it to the employer. Apply directly through the company’s career page so that you are more likely to find active postings rather than ghost and auto-reposted listings you see on LinkedIn and Indeed. If anything use LinkedIn and Indeed as a search engine and straight to the company’s website to ensure the job is there and apply there!I would also apply to recent listings as much as possible, favoring hours ago listings rather than days ago. ATS systems sort applicants in chronological order so once recruiters go through the first 50-100 applications they’ll probably have a good handful to push to the interview stage and that’s it they’re moving on. The back half never gets checked! So apply as soon as you see that job. Get creative, I even made my own alert system that alerts me when my scrapers sees a new job was posted to an ATS system and send me a notification on discord. Let me know if you’d like to try it out, completely free!Anyways, I wish you luck! It will be long and there’s no guarantee even all of this ends up working",

My coding speed grew by 3x to 5x in my first 3 years on the job, as did my ability to learn and comprehend repos with 2000 to 10,000 lines of code.I want to emphasize this. I was a super star in the classroom but when I hit the real job, I was a total beginner. The first day, my manager yelled at me to stop committing every 30 minutes since each commit took 40 minutes to build, run unit tests and deploy to DEV and blocked everyone's else changes from going through. I didn't know, there was no training. Better integration was to have the build run automatically once an hour that picks up all the changes.I had never seen so much shittily written and undocumented code and the project was already 6 months late. Sometimes I write code that could have been cleaner but you won't able to do everything you want if you don't marry your job. Some people do. I say don't.",

This matters. Ask yourself whether you worked on interesting projects, did you learn some tech on your own and whether you can see yourself doing that kind of work full time. If not, maybe computer science is not the right fitDo not consider only swe roles, data analyst, data science, AI engineer, data engineer, tech consulting, and product manager positions are all paths you can exploreLC does not matter as much in the UAE. Startups care more about your backend, frontend, systems skills than your lc grind (only companies ik who are crazy about lc are dytedanxe, noon, talabat). i could be wrong hereThe market is tough for CS majors everywhere.

I've talked to a bunch of recruiters out there and they all say the same thing - companies want people with 3-5 years minimum because they're competing globally for talent and can afford to be picky. It's not you, it's legitimately the market structure there.The masters pivot might not be the worst idea but... business degrees after CS can be weird. You'll be competing with people who did business undergrad and have that foundation already. Plus you'd be starting over in a new field while still carrying student debt (assuming you're not getting it funded). Have you thought about maybe doing a technical masters instead? Something like data science or specialized AI programs? At least then you're building on what you already know instead of completely starting fresh.One thing - that gap on your resume isn't as bad as you think. I see people come back from 2-3 year breaks all the time. The story matters more than the gap itself. \"I graduated into a terrible market and kept grinding while exploring options\" is way better than most explanations i hear. Also those unpaid internships you're applying to? Skip them. They know you're desperate and will treat you accordingly. Focus on contract work, freelance projects, or even contributing to open source stuff. At least then you're building real portfolio pieces instead of fetching coffee for free.",

I have a good friend who has his masters and teaches regular and advanced history / social studies for highschool students, and he's had some uncomfortable insights about AIFor the first time since we've really been recording this information, my friend has been seeing an inverse bell curve; meaning the average score is no longer in the middle ~70%, there are two polar opposites: students that care and are trying, scoring 90%+ and those who just don't give a shit at all. So to give the younger generation some credit, there is a big group of students that see what tik tok and AI are doing to their attention span and are determined to succeed in spite of that. But there just as big of a cohort that are straight up turning off their critical thinking and letting AI take the wheel.Because critical thinking, making decisions really is the skill AI threatens to take away the most. Most of these failing students just refuse to put in any effort that requires them to think beyond a surface level.So to reiterate, this is genuinely new. This is different. Previous technologies like the Internet certainly changed education, but a huge emphasis was placed on digging beyond surface level Wikipedia details. Today AI can (appear to anyway) do that digging beyond for you in a few prompts, and the skill to research and analyze information just gets thrown away by a startling number of people",

Many people apply for few jobs, only the better ones get the jobs that are available. Some people will lose out.There is some fudging by plain luck, and \"better\" or \"worse\" isn't a single, scalar value - but at the end of the day, this is how it works out.>I’m currently interning at a semiconductor startup in the bay area, and I’m fortunate that my internship doesn’t have a fixed end date. But I’ve been trying to transition into a full-time role, and I’m struggling because there just aren’t many listings to apply to.I can't tell how and where you're looking, or whether that could be improved - but be that as it may - you can only apply to the jobs that are there, and that you find. Networking means you'll try to find jobs that aren't advertised; but I am not sure how much of a dent that can make. What does your current employer have to say about transitioning you to full time? Does anyone at that company has outside contacts?>I’ve tried strategies like applying only to jobs posted within the last 5 days, but the available roles dry up almost immediately. I’m open to opportunities both in the Bay Area and elsewhere, yet I still can’t find much that’s actually hiring.So.... there aren't many jobs, and your strategy is to filter that list down further? If anything at all, you should work on a process that makes you find all these jobs within the first 5 or 2 days.You cannot change the market; you cannot change how hiring works. You can adjust your own processes to make the most of the given circumstances, and see that the work you put into it has the highest ROI that's possible for you to achieve.>What are the best resources for finding real job postings from companies that are genuinely looking to hire? Any advice would help.Not from the US, but when I am looking for work, I see which job boards have good results for what I have to offer, I scan those regularly ,and apply quickly. If that ends up in too few results, I'll have to start looking at places where the good matches are less dense. (Assuming that I am happy with my CV, my application process, etc. Those I can change, I cannot change who posts how many jobs where.)",

Don't ask HR or in interviews, most people aren't going to shit talk their own companies while representing their company, Linkedin chats are more likely to get honest answers. Glassdoor reviews are also a good sign, Pretty sure I heard they will at times remove the really bad reviews, but still it gives a pretty good overview of the company.

It's pretty vague.In general, I'd say mature companies that are profitable and where the majority of employees are over 30.Greenflag if on Linkedin, you find developers on the team/adjacent to the team with graduation dates before like 2008 who have been with the company for more than like 5 years. People who are over halfway through their career usually aren't trying to prove anything, and they just want to live their life and coast in stability until retirement. The lack of this doesn't mean it's not chill, but if you see people like this there, then it probably is.People work hard because the moment you truly relax is the moment you stagnate in your career. So you'd want to look for people who are probably satisfied with where they're at in their career. Which also kinda lines up with Google being chill. If you're at Google, you're close to the peak of software engineering. Of course, you do have to do occasional overtime for deadlines, but from what I've heard from people, it's not so bad. Generally like only 40-50 hours per week. My friend usually only works late at Google if they are compensating for overpromising, or if they took an extended lunch to play board games with coworkers.",

Can't imagine doing something like that now.I shopped around and prioritized work life balance. Landed Government (not federal). It's very chill. Coworkers are great.

        "body": "I’m just a SWE 1, but I like to think I have a healthy relationship with AI coding right now. I use it for work daily, but I originally learned and got to where I am without AI.I mentor for lots of college hackathons and I see so many students like you, who are completely reliant on AI to code, and fail spectacularly. It is an **insane power move** (HAHA) when I pull up to a mentee, immediately close ChatGPT or ask them “how do you close cursor?”, skip over all the Google AI overview when I google stuff, and debug their thing “raw” old school and fix it either in 1 glance or in half the time they’ve been stuck in an LLM prompting circle.My advice? Learn without AI. AI is a force multiplier imo, it turns say a level 1 engineer into a level 2, and a level 10 into a level 20. The moment you let things go, you stop leveling up. There is a significant difference in quality and speed between “code me an api for an app” vs “implement an API with these exact 5 routes, implementation steps, pagination, specific auth middleware, database, other layers, and other architectural and security concerns/requirements.”TLDR: better you are, the more effective it will be.“Learning without ai??? That’s impossible.”Yeah yeah, I hear you. You want to be spoon fed everything relevant now. You want it fast and customized. You’ll be better reading and learning without AI, but yeah yeah, it will take longer. Remember that programming is supposed to engage your brain. But if you really want to learn with AI, which I totally get the temptation, here’s what I’ve been advising my mentees at least.It about aligns with how I learned without AI, but adapted to this new day and age:## Use AI as a guide, not as your driver.> in the past, I learned through documentation and stack overflow. I would try copy and pasting code, but it would rarely work without me understanding how it works and modifying it to work with my code.1. Let the AI guide you, not drive for you. Get off cursor or whatever. Do not auto approve changes. Review everything it proposes. Stop copy pasting ChatGPT code. Instead, read each line it proposes, understand what it does and why it does what it does. Never ever put the code in until you know what each line does. Research the documentation, the patterns, everything OUTSIDE of asking an LLM. Too many times, I’ve been burned by incredibly convincing hallucinations I blindly trust.**My company gives me Claude 4.5. I have coded with Gemini 3 in my spare time. Even then, a near top-of-the-line coding LLM isn’t perfect enough to fully vibe-trust for work and for mildly complex projects.**## Ask AI to cite its sources or give it the sources.> I learned everything by reading documentation2. If you ever let an LLM drive (rather, think) for you, ask it for QUOTED sources and links, OR plug in the relevant documentation yourself and then ask for direct quotes that inform its implementation. Then, go back and read that relevant section yourself. Only then, can you hit yes on the code. You’ll learn something, at least, while keeping some momentum and enhancing accuracy. Still—better to learn yourself and feed it what it needs rather than trust it.## Debug without an LLM> Debugging and making effective hypothesis and knowing how to test them is the best skill I’ve learned, and it’s helped me both with and without AI. Trial and error have helped build my intuition and propose ideas on why things aren’t working, and that’s built on a solid debugging strategy, tons of experience, and exploration. 3. Learn effective debugging skills. I’ve had so many situations where students debug via LLM by saying “it doesn’t work, fix it” or “it’s not smooth, fix it”. Instead, when you tell it “I identify a race condition, I’d like to refactor the code by XYZ” the LLM works actually pretty well. But to figure this out, you gotta know how to debug outside of an LLM. Sometimes, it may involve a big or novel switch in approach that an AI in its little rabbit hole cannot suggest. Also, being a code detective is the best part of programming imo, why would you offload the best part to an AI?TLDR: don’t turn off your brain and don’t trust anything the LLM says. Pretend it’s a con artist or scammer and double check everything yourself OUTSIDE of the LLM “scammer ring” scheme.",

Every single one of them was very resistant to the idea that the project might need to be cancelled. One of them pitched to me \"let's just juke the stats and get a good project in, and figure this out in the next review period\". Another one, after the exec made the decision to re-allocate us, presented a plan to keep the project going. He just didn't get that \"move to keep the lights on in two weeks (ktlo)\" meant that we are moving on.I just see a massive amount of resistance to change, even at a big tech company where our execs tell us: \"we need you to be world class engineers\". I definitely get it, people want to keep things the way they are, but the moment you realize something isn't going to work, you need to pivot quickly.

Of the many questions I ask, I like to ask engineering managers / directors: \"What was the hardest conversation you've ever had with a stakeholder\". What I'm listening for in the manager's/director's response is:1. Have they ever told a stakeholder \"no\" or \"[yes, and](https://galenemanuele.com/blog/power-of-yes-and)\" (which is really just fancy \"no\"). Unless they've been in leadership like ... 2-3 years ... an answer of \"huh, nothing comes to mind\" is a red flag for me. My read on that is they're very likely avoiding difficult conversations to the detriment of their team, because leadership is almost never sunshine and butterflies for everyone. Business is hard.2. What inputs lead to that difficult conversation? The team? A Jira board? An existential threat? Customer feedback? Data? Hopefully something more tangible than intuition alone.3. How did they tailor the conversation to this specific stakeholder's behaviors, values, and goals?And I often ask clarifying questions, or for them to elaborate, if I don't get 1, 2, and 3 covered in their initial response. Covering all 3 in the initial response is a big old green flag for me. I need to work with leaders who know how to \"go to bat\" for their people and advocate for what they believe is best for the business -- maybe that isn't as important to you. A big, big part of having a healthy engineering practice is telling important people \"no\" sometimes, even if they might fire you or advocate for your firing because you said \"no\". But they probably won't fire me, because I've already established through a different line of questioning that this leader values [psychological safety](https://psychsafety.com/psychological-safety-72-personal-user-manuals/).",

I've had the best times working for people who were empathetic (treated you like a human and adult), showed attention to detail (cared and understood about the work, could ask intelligent questions and talk to other teams about it), and could say \"no\" to people (external stakeholders and the internal team), including, \"we are not releasing this in its current state.\" I've worked for people who thought they were better than me, and their time was more valuable. Those people are awful to work for. There are people who don't take responsibility, try to blame others. \"Hey, I screwed this up, can you work extra to fix it all?\" It might be a weird thing to say, but having a mix of professional pride, caring about the work, and respecting the people doing the work. Oh, and I always appreciated people who were honest. I've worked with people who intentionally hold information from you. In some cases, it might be a good thing. Shielding the team, maybe hiding that we have some ways to extend a deadline, but pushing the team. Those can suck, but I liked that manager. I worked for someone else who would intentionally withhold information from the team. I got the impression they did this to always feels smarter than everyone. It was a very irritating experience and extremely hard to work with someone like that.",

The project was obviously just a training exercise and clearly was not going to be useed in their actual code base. If it was something that looked like it was actually going to be used, I probably wouldn't have done it. The job itself was fine.I think the red flags to watch out for are:is the unpaid project kind of generic? Or is it incredibly specific and seems like it is new functionallity for an existing app?If the project they are asking for is very generic, IE: heres a user login and password, create a page to authenticate to our app services then build a page to accept a userID and submit it to retrieve user details and display it tto the screen and allow someone to edit. Thats fine with me. Its just shhowing I understand how auth / REST works and that I can build a web app that communicates with a backend.If instead they ask me to create a hyper specific page that requires multiple rest calls and data analysis maybe with business logic, thats when the red line is crossed IMO. To get an idea if you can do the job shouldnt require you to understand their business logic when coding, that stuff should be taught on the job. In the interview rounds the project assigned needs to be generic and just demonstrating you have the skills you say you do.",

Crucially though, both parties have to be disagreeing in a spirit of honest inquiry. They have to be listening to what the other person is saying and understanding why they have said it. In a properly functioning disagreement you will be asking as many questions as you will be giving answers.Eventually, you might get to a point where you both fully understand each other, but do just fundamentally disagree. At this point, you will typically involve a 3rd party (another colleague, a team lead) to give a fresh perspective, and to act as a tie-breaker. If you still can't come to a consensus after that, then your only option is to disagree and commit. A senior decision maker (e.g. a team lead) will pick one of the options, and you will all agree that, even if it's not your preferred option, you will commit to getting it done on the basis that doing the wrong thing well is often better than not doing anything at all.Key rules when disagreeing:1. Authority is irrelevant. If you can't explain and justify your view, your job title of Fancypants Principal Senior Architect is meaningless.2. Listen. Listen and understand what the other person is saying. Ask clarifying questions or suggest concrete examples if you don't.3. Go for a beer afterwards. This is the importance of relationships. I can have (sometimes quite forceful) disagreements with colleagues, but it is fine because we are also friendly with each other. Grab a beer, or a coffee, or have a game of pool, or whatever, but just build that relationship so it can easily survive disagreements.Finally, YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) is a common approach in software development, and it has it's place, but when it comes to security concerns you _are_ going to need it!",

By comparison, startups and consultancies scale their team sizes very rapidly (both up and down). So, unless you thrive in that kind of fast-paced environment, startups can be really challenging workplaces.And because the organizational structure changes so rapidly, a lot of decisionmaking is informal and workplace politics are more nuanced/difficult. For people who struggle with soft-skills, startups are a *very* demanding environment trying to juggle all the subtle politicking and the unclear/changing requirements.Obviously, there's great startups out there. But they aren't the ones hiring every quarter to compensate for rapid turnover or sudden changes in venture capital.",

Over the course of your career, there are things that will die off, and there are things that live longer than you expect. When I started working, Java was consider the new sexy thing. People joked about COBOL developers. COBOL is still around, and now people make fun of Java for being boring (personally think there are plenty of jobs and opportunity for Java). Times when I've had to learn new languages, I haven't necessarily changed my thought process too much. I know how to do something in one language, so I how can I do something similar in this new language. There are obviously some languages that are different, but logic and optimizations/algorithms will always be somewhat consistent. You're also noting one reason why people go into management or leave the field. They get sick of having to keep learning things. I've had interviews with people where we discussed AI, and some people have a nuanced opinion on it. Not everyone thinks it will take over the world. And not everyone thinks it's garbage. There are people trying to understand how it can improve their jobs/careers. One thing you have to realize is no one can predict the future, and no one knows things for sure. You'll get things wrong in your career and life. What can you learn from it? How can you grow? How will you respond?",

Microcontrollers and FPGAs are essential for embedded programming, and maybe some PLCs if you'd like to program industrial machinery.AI will not take over any of these jobs and is swiftly hitting diminishing returns on the hardware and infrastructure investments. However, it is going to remain in some form as a tool for handling large volume communications; it does acceptably at auto-responding to messages, though it still needs considerable supervision for anything. So it's good to have *some* familiarity with using it. But in my opinion you'll still do best learning the basics and doing most things manually, maybe querying the AI for quick summaries of a topic so you can find relevant search terms for further, non-AI study.This field is pretty volatile while you're getting started, so make sure you have some full-time work to pay your bills when you first begin your jobseeking.",

Literally every CS undergrad of the thousands I've interviewed has done at least one, and was required to do one before graduating. So yeah, if you didn't have a capstone with meaningful group work, you're going to look like a less desirable candidate compared to CS undergrads who did have a capstone and did do meaningful group work. Figure out how to offset that. No, I don't have suggestions as to how -- ask me 8 months ago -- but that is what I would focus on. What do your peers have, that you don't, and how will you address or offset it during interviews.

Since you're already working, let's say you do this for the next 6 months and interview 15 times. By that point you would have narrowed down what are the topics that you need to improve on and it really honed your skills with interviewing. The best part is that those interviews that you practice with won't be held against you because you'll be applying to completely different jobs in the next 6 months. Even if the job is at the same company that you apply to before it will be in a new position, because if a position still open after 6 months the problem is with the company not the applicant pool.",

By the hours, the masters gave me an extra year of work, all of which is geared towards personal development.As for getting into AI/ML labs, that's probably much harder, unless you do specific research that has industry overlap.

There is an additional interview round for MLE jobs where they ask you ML trivia like \"what it is the difference between L1 and L2 normalization\" or \"Explain K-fold cross validation\". You may or may not get to do model development in an MLE job. But you will be involved in productionalizing an already developed model.For applied scientists type of a role though. I have seen a few of my batch mates get those type of roles with just a master's degree. There are a few caveats though.1. These roles were in Amazon. In Amazon Applied scientist role is more of a SWE role than an AS role from what I observed. Most of the Amazon Applied Scientist roles are not the same as Microsoft research Applied Scientist role or Google Brain Research scientist or even Facebook AI research applied scientist roles. A lot of Amazon AS people get to churn out research papers every year. But I have seen even MLEs churn out research papers as well.2. You need to have at least 1 publication even for the Amazon AS role, when applying from outside. A thesis in the Master's program helps with that.3. The school I attended was a top 20 school for CS back when I was applying. And a few of my Batchmates are now working as Applied scientists in Facebook and Amazon without a Ph.D with just a master's degree. And these were people on H1b. Not even US citizens. Your experience might not be the same however.Also applied scientist interviews are far more mathematical in nature than SWE/MLE interviews. You go into an interview and they might ask you to derive the expected value of a normal distribution or something on a whiteboard. A math heavy master's program from a top US university definitely helps with cracking that type of an interview.",

Without AI having more foresight into what could go wrong, metacognition into what it doesn’t know, the ability to absorb deep context, and the ability to reach out and have open conversations with humans, AI is not able to take over on call. The metacognition part is the most problematic part because no LLM model is able to accurately identify when it genuinely doesn’t know something. The output layers only give probabilities for the next token, but those probabilities don’t mean anything real about the outside world. A token having 90% probability to the model doesn’t mean there’s a 90% chance that’s the right answer.",

The biggest thing for most people comes down to, how comfortable are you building products for the police?Axon basically has leveraged its monopoly selling stun guns (“tasers”) to police departments into selling them police body cameras and SaaS products. Those started as software for evidence management, but it’s evolving into selling police [AI](https://www.govtech.com/biz/aclu-slams-ai-police-reports-and-axon-in-particular) tools. When I visited their office, there were stun gun parts just lying around. Someone actually got accidentally shocked by one while I there. It didn’t seem like they took workplace safety seriously. That said, it seemed to be a very mission driven company. I mean, their motto is to “make the bullet obsolete” in that nobody should be shot to death again, but rather incapacitated. It’s certainly not your average software company motto like “Work Hard, Have Fun, Make History” (Amazon) or “to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more” (Microsoft).

When (not if) you start interviewing, don't be so desperate to leave your current situation you ignore red flags at a new place. That can get you stuck in a spiral of bad jobs. I've ignored red flags before, and it always came back to bite me. I was once desperate to leave some place, and another time, the jump in comp made me ignore some red flags (a bunch of the people I interviewed with were less than impressive).",

The certs are slightly more difficult as it’s just the one exam. So if you look at it that way, it’s basically one semester of college IT that’s required to get a job. It’s not much, but it is a step above “knowing how to use task manager”.”",

Gate risky flows behind feature flags and do a canary so any blast radius stays small. Add basics now: structured logs with request IDs, Sentry for errors, and a small Datadog dashboard. Freeze schema churn and add a thin adapter (views/functions or a tiny service) so the UI stops touching bad tables. Split the monster PR into small slices with contract tests; pair each with a Flyway/Liquibase migration and rollback.I’ve used Hasura for fast read models on Postgres, Kong to centralize auth/rate limits on legacy endpoints, and DreamFactory to auto‑generate REST on ugly SQL so the frontend stops hand‑rolled queries.If leadership won’t allow flags, canary, and sign‑offs, start interviewing.Bottom line: document and gate the risks, ship behind flags with observability, and make incremental fixes instead of another big hack.",

My goal usually to leave the code base in better shape than I found it, but a lot of those systems were so tightly coupled that making any significant improvements was nearly impossible. I had one C project where my goal turned into \"I won't introduce another global variable in the code base unless it's to remove two or more others.\" There were more than 400 global variables in their code and multiple variables mirrored the same values because they'd lost track of where it was safe to change the one that was already in use.",

You'll learn a lot.Be careful with your money, though. Ensure part of your paycheck is going to a high-yield (but still relatively liquid) savings account, like Ally. Only live off of what's going to your checking and budget aggressively. You're taking a less stable and likely less paying job now to secure better ones later. But this is exactly the time in your life that you SHOULD be doing things to set up your career for later, not trying to stay and get comfy.Also, to clarify, do you mean that in 3 months you'll be a full-time employee if they keep you on?",

Since you have DS experience you can absolutely get a job in Cali, but it would not be because of your penn degree. Also yeah it is true that a lot of the courses will probably have overlap with your undergrad, and look at [mymcit.org](http://mymcit.org) and look at the DS reviews - they aren't great. If I were to go back, I would have applied to a West Coast school as I want to move to Cali too. This would be the optimal choice, but hey completing the MSE-DS is still going to move you forward and is not a bad decision, but just that there may be a better decision for the 3 years that you would put into completing the degree.My humble opinion: apply to an MSCS instead. Your DS undergrad combined with CS masters will make you unstoppable. It does not have to be brand name either. For example, SJSU is heavily recruited by big tech companies. So I would apply to all brand-name and non-brand name schools on west coast and see where you get in. After all, tech is not *as* elitist(unless you get into berkeley/stanford which will give you a massive advantage) as top finance/consulting. So, being on the west coast even at an average school will give you a higher chance of being hired in Cali than MSE-DS.",

Consistently the people I hire are able to confidently tackle a problem I put in front of them, whether they know how to or not. The last two people I hired immediately started collaborating with me on a simple real world coding challenge that they had zero exposure to before the interview. A good software engineer knows how to break tasks down into manageable pieces, ask questions, and systematically work through a problem I know that I'm relatively unusual in my interview approach because Leetcode is still out there, but all the best jobs I've had have had similar practical problem solving interviews.So, my primary advice is to work on those problem solving and communication skills. When you're approached for an interview, you should be able to reflexively start diving into how you'll tackle the problem they put in front of you.I think Azure is an excellent choice for boosting your desirability in the market. Despite spending most of my career as an individual contributor programmer, DevOps knowledge has been the thing that has helped me the most. Also, don't forget about Python's use as a back end language for building APIs. Back end developers might not be as cool as ML or AI engineers, but there's still a huge need for them. It will be far easier to find a job and demonstrate your competence as a dev. The fact that you've already worked on practical projects in school is a big boon here.",

        "body": "Recent hiring manager for software positions here.Hiring is a time consuming process. One of the things that sometimes gets forgotten is that hiring manager isn't a role. It's a temporary assignment on top of all of your regular duties until you find someone for the positions you have open. Let's just say that I'm already busy, and everything to do with hiring someone has to get fit in somehow but i still need to do the business activities that need doing.Let's start with resume review. I posted a job a month ago. I got somewhere in the neighbourhood of 30 new applicants per day and that was after the initial deluge of resumes. If you do a lot of resume screening, you can start to see whether a candidate has or doesn't have what you're looking for, but it still takes time. I started with a block of 10 resumes that looked good enough to book for a screening call. I booked all 10 in the next week. Nothing too onerous, but that's ten 30-minute calls to add to my schedule. that's 5 additional hours plus prep time, plus arranging said calls and answering the occasional questions from candidates while still screening even more resumes.Then perhaps i find someone that i want to talk to in person. That means finding basically a whole morning or afternoon to block off to interview them. Maybe i find a couple people. Maybe i don't. I fill up my hiring basket with about 10 hours of hiring activities our of my 40-hour week because again, i still have an actual job to do and there is only so much that can be done. The more in-person interviews i do, the less screening i can do. The more screening i can do, the less resume review i can do. Things get backed up to the point where some people you eventually get around to reviewing aren't available anymore.I'm not saying anything about a particular company or companies. You asked a general question, I'm giving you a general look behind likely many managers' calendars. It takes time and there are more applicants than there is time to process them. It would be swell if that weren't the case, but for me at least, it is.It's nice to think that it's simple: if someone doesn't get back to you within two weeks then to heck with them. That probably could be true for a lot of people for different reasons, but it doesn't mean it's out of malice. Someone like you could have been #78 on my list and I'm still in the 50's. Sorry.",

I applied directly on the website of a pharmaceutical company. I had done some consulting work for them before (but very few people would know be by name, just the people I worked with directly). A recruiter took about 3 weeks to reach out to me, and their email responses always took a couple days. It wasn't a great experience, but it did give some food for thought. Then there are companies that move at lightning quick speeds. I've also had cases or heard of cases where a recruiter is on vacation themselves, and they didn't bother to set an automatic email response. That's not to say the lack of response isn't a bad sign. It could still be. But it's not a guarantee.",

Use it to super charge your learning, when things click, you can really put your agent through paces to increase your output.

You may have customers who have never touched copilot, cursor, etc. and only have basic requirements. You will be able to deliver value super quickly to them, and likely for minimum effort.You may also have customers who already prompted the same tools and got stuck somewhere, and will need an actual professional to fix their mess or find another solution.So AI will be an integral part of the job, but you still need to know what you're doing.

Tinkering with the design and component sizes, altering the functionality by a little bit, having very specific things or complicated things done, those all require more or less manual effort unless you want to spend many hours asking AI and repeatedly testing what AI writes, which will usually be off if the ask is super specific with little wiggle room.",

        "body": "Am I delusional or is OP asking about AI engineering VS web dev but literally everyone in the comments is talking about simply using AI tools?If I understood correctly, and OP is talking about AI engineering (building solutions that use AI and not just using AI to build solutions), then I don't think it's a different skill. It's still a subset of software engineering. Most of the modern \"AI engineering\" is just calling OpenAI API, which is like web dev 101.I'm primarily a backend engineer. Never cared for those AI frameworks before getting assigned to lead an \"AI-centric\" project. Learned the ropes in a few days. Still treat it as normal backend development, with just a few caveats here and there.1. Yes, a lot of modern web apps are expected to have \"AI features\", but those are usually super basic and almost the same everywhere. 99% of the time it's just some basic chatbot, usually with RAG. But that's it. No matter what they want you to think.2. Unless you're developing new AI models, this mostly is the same skill as classic web dev. You'll probably need to learn one or two new frameworks for Agentic AI but this can easily be done in less than a week. I believe people with good foundations have an advantage because it's easier to understand a large picture. Courses about AI agents only teach the specifics of those frameworks and APIs, but you won't ship a Jupyter Notebook to a client and call it a working agent. That'll still have to be incorporated somewhere, and 99% of the time it's going to be some form of API or a web app. There will probably be some mindset shift between normal deterministic systems and the new probabilistic ones, but it shouldn't be too difficult with a good foundation.3. Build a solid foundation in classic web dev first, and then learn AI engineering. I genuinely believe it's pretty much impossible to create anything meaningful with only the knowledge of some agentic AI frameworks. If you want to be a freelancer, incorporate AI into a few of your projects to show that you can do it and market off of that.",

Both of these types of tasks can be considered AI, but the AI is automation designed for a very specific task. LLM based AI tools such as ChatGPT and Github Copilot are corporate scams that won't help you. A web app presents a user interface, and the ideal interface is dependent on the preferences of users. User preferences are a subjective thing that cannot be fully represented by data that AI understands. Agentic AI is in a very early tech, and the technology is likely to change significantly over the next few years. As a result, things you learn about agentic AI now are likely going to become obsolete. Currently, a typical agentic AI tool is also powered by an LLM instead of a legitimate AI technology.",
