Just being able to express frustrations with myself and occasionally with coworkers (data analysts).On top of designing the ingestion and bringing in new data sources, I'm also the only account administrator for our CDW.Literally nobody else on my team, even IT, understands the work I do. They wouldn't even know I am doing it unless I straight up explain it to them.It does force me to communicate and document like a mad dog. Force my team to make decisions together with me so they stay involved and in the knowledge loop.But going from access control, onboarding & training new users, coming up with a strategy for ongoing development, and also switching back to discussing whether to bring in , peppering in these smaller data sources, it's a fucking lot. ISometimes I think the ADHD helps lol But my therapist is my fucking hero.Based on the text vomit I just dumped here, I would recommend you find a therapist you click with if you are struggling.

Insurance is especially heavy on this. Some teams do manage to streamline it with better self-service, platform teams, or looser controls in non-prod, but 60 to 70% overhead isn’t unusual.

Before AI was being used widely it was ghost interviewers and people whispering answers or at least typing answers in a screen the interviewee could read. I've had catfishers interview then a different person onboards. It happens, we just need to be better at detecting and stopping it. There will always be people who lie their way into jobs though. Just last week I interviewed a guy who seemed to be using AI to craft his answers. Although some answers were obviously not scripted, and he seemed to know what he was talking about, he still seemed like he was using an AI interview tool. After talking to some of the recruiters familiar with his region of the world it was apparent that this was VERY common and candidates felt they had to do it to stay competitive. We had a follow-up interview where we told him that we all use AI tools in out jobs and that we can't fault anyone for using them, but we wanted to hear his answers unassisted. We made it clear that it was OK to say \"I don't know\" or \"I don't understand the question\". The interview went much better. There was some language barrier and he didn't understand all the questions as asked, but when clarified he was fine and gave good answers. When he didn't know something he said so. It turns out his resume was real, he did know what he was talking about. I think going forward we will address the use of AI, let them know it's ok for some aspects of their job and even for helping them interview. We also need to get good at asking the right questions. Not to \"trick\" the AI, or to somehow catch them in a lie, but to help us understand if they have the basic knowledge we're looking for.",

This is things like \"what sales actions should I take with this customer over the next 3 months to improve my chances of a win?\" Or \"what data should I use to answer this question?\" These are solved by different kinds of data, usually qualitative in nature - metadata, documents, runbooks, applications, code, vector searches, RAG, and graphs. \"Context graph\" is a buzzword - it's just a graph database, the same ones we've had for 40+ years. The \"context\" just describes its purpose - a tool for providing context to AI models and agents.Offloading context, just like offloading data catalogs and other tools, help AI agents by preventing them from hallucinating, drifting, or getting context overload.Just like we don't expect an airline pilot to handle all measurement, observation, and emergency procedures themselves, we give them accurate dashboards, runbooks, and a support crew to help them achieve their tasks.Data engineering obviously has a role in both problems in terms of investing, transforming, and managing data into data warehouses and graph databases.",

        "body": "The meta for llms changes every week, so don't get two freaked out about it. Business context is usually captured with either RAG or graphs. RAG uses a vector similarity search algorithm to look up related information and graphs rely on nodes and edges to connect relationships in your data. Basically look at how Neo4j works. They have been talking about the graph approach for a while, but barriers are how your data is organized/tagged as it's less effective the fewer relationships you have. That's not easy to establish depending on what your metadata looks like. Also massive graph dbs tend to not be that performant. You can still get pretty good results with them, especially for document search use cases or something like that. But there are also people talking about how tensor based LLMs are limited and not going to get us to the promised land and the next step might be difusion models or something else. AWS also was talking about how they are maxing out what they can do with generic LLMs in training and how they could be more effective if they had access to actual business data to train on (not going to happen). Agentic systems are the current hot thing where you can create \"tools\" for the LLM to use based on the context. Like if a user asks an accounting question, the LLM can call an accounting agent that might have textual, RAG or graph resources to answer the call. It's interesting but also infuriating that there are so many approaches and the \"best\" approach changes almost weekly. It's still very early in AI development so I guess I would say don't freak out about learning one thing as it will likely change, but definitely do get into working with AI is future work will depending on it. It's not going away.",

I have bad news for you if you need production-level code....On a more serious note, if you use an IDE like VScode, you can incrementally build code logic with interactive code execution like in a notebook and also become familiar with how to use the debugger for your programming language. Once you have an initial chunk of code that does what you want, parameterise it and stick it in a function. Then write some tests for it, ideally. A parameterised notebook is not all that different from a very lengthy function. You just want to separate the code in your notebook into functions so that each function is doing a single thing and returning/producing a single thing.It will be slower at first because you're rewiring your brain to use a new process and interface, but you'll get faster and the benefits can be great if you're doing anything that's a deliverable and you want some quality assurance. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Once you get to this level there is a whole world of code design best practices you can venture into to make your job easier while giving you more confidence in the correctness of your code and its artifacts.",

Although i will add Red Panda is an increasing an option that I would keep on the table.The problem with the managed solution is they become expensive and slow if you are working with any volume of data or any high update frequency. If you have small data or don't have real-time requirements the managed solution are all great. Currently we run Kafka connect and Open Source Airbyte.

Instead .replace operations you use assignement. Strings and datetime gets some changes as well as categorical types. Some changes with pd.read_excel as well. Slicing and a lot of your operations need to be explicit now instead of implicit. Whats going to bite you the most is numpy rather than pandas here.Second Answer:Use polars + pandas, especially once you get everything setup in arrow types, its a seamless transfer of the dfs; while working with my team I use polars for the heavy stuff like merges, concats and stuff. ANd pandas for anything that needs to be verbose and redeable, like mathemtical operations or column based functions. Polars sucks at the whole thing because their approach of map_elements is inconsistent and expects something everytime. Polars also breaks their apis and their intended behavior quite a lot.Just 1.0 to 3.0 from numpy to arrow should be about 4x boost in perf, polars + pandas can be 5-20x and pure polars can be 10-30x.The main thing I love about polars are sinks and lazyframes. And the streaming engine, I had some pandas code which took 64gb of ram, mixed it with some polars and sink and now its down to 10gb of ram",

For me, reason alone to use it over pandas 2 is how it handles data types, which works much better with delta lake & parquet typing.YMMV of course.",

The trick is not trying to learn “everything.” You don’t need mastery of every tool you need a solid mental model of how data flows end to end. Once that clicks, new tech becomes variations on the same ideas, not brand new worlds. Your PM/BA background is actually a plus. Understanding requirements, tradeoffs, and why pipelines exist is something a lot of younger DEs struggle with. Focus on building a couple of boring, real pipelines and ignore the noise.

As long as everything was simple with a single region and incoming product, and a few people had been working on it and had direct experience with how everything was done, then the 'quirks' were kept to a minimum and everyone knew them.Then as new team members got onboarded things got harder. People had to be taught all the quirks of which role to use when creating a glue job vs an interactive notebook, they had to be shown the magic command boilerplate to get glue catalog and iceberg tables working, they needed to know the bucket that was set up for output for Athena queries. With more people working not everyone could be across everyone else's work, so people weren't familiar with how various custom jobs and scripts had been made, and because each job was its own mini vertical stack there was a lot of repeated components in infrastructure, policies, ci/cd scripts.As new use cases came on that didn't fit the mould new ways of doing things had to be added. Kinesis and firehose come in, airflow orchestration gets tasked for some small transforms while others go to glue jobs. Someone wants a warehouse/database to query, so redshift is added. Exports to third party processors are needed as are imports, so more buckets, more permissions. API ingestions are needed so in come lambda functions, with each one coded and deployed differently because nobody can see what everyone else is doing.Then finally users need access to data, and the team just isn't set up for it. There is no central catalog with everything, it is spread out across half a dozen services, and the only way to know where anything is or goes is to dig through the code. That 'worked' for the DE team, since they were the ones doing the digging, but there was no effective way to give access to everything. Every request for data took days or weeks to finalise, and often required more pipelines to move it to where it could be accessed.We're moving to Databricks soon. It gives a unified UI for DE and other teams to access the data, you get sql endpoints, you can run basic compute on single-node 'clusters', it has orchestration built in, it gives you a somewhat easier way to manage permissions, and it works for both running your own compute and giving data access. Instead of a mishmash of technologies that don't make a unified platform, you get a consistent experience.You'll just have to pay extra since it is doing a good portion of that unification work for you.If you had a hundred DE type roles it might be more cost effective to stick with base aws services, and have a dedicated team focused on dx, standards, and productivity, to cut out the managed compute cost. But if you're just 3 people, you're probably not there.",

I’m part of a company where we chose to build our Lakehouse 5 years ago on AWS.We have an amazing solution with around 10 platform engineers, 50 engineers working on the platform and 20k end users.We recently did a full analysis of total cost (cloud costs and payroll) of using Databricks vs our Platform and we are definitely much much more cost effective.That said, it required great leadership and product vision and it works because we’re a big company with specific needs that were not answered by Databricks at the time - for example when Iceberg was first out we went all in meanwhile Databricks kept saying it wasn’t their priority and pushed delta lake.Now I would say Databricks is so easy to get into and has improved so much over the years… if we had to start now I think Databricks would be the go to",

        "body": "I am in the Data Science/MLOps, but tend to work with Data Engineers. Take my opinion with some level of salt. I work on the Databricks platform full time. I have experience with spark, orchestration, A.I. Agents, etc. Databricks can do everything you listed. It is not the best in each category. Airflow is a superior orchestration tool than Databricks Workflows, for example. However Databricks provides tools in all categories that are more than good enough.I find myself surprised how easy most things are. I usually do a POC with a G.U.I. first. Then reimplement with code, checking against the G.U.I. POC as I go. There is a G.U I. for Databricks Workflows and A.I. Agents. In general, everything seems to be as easy as possible, with good default settings. The advantage of having good enough tools in broad categories that all integrate well with each other makes life easy.Measured against AWS, Databricks is more expensive. Your company can either pay more for compute ( go with Databricks) or pay more to expand the team with specialized people (AWS). Expensive compute is cheaper than expensive specialists.Plus Databricks is moving to everything runs on serverless. In practice, I would say 80% to 90% of prod code runs on serverless. I see this improving with time.Closing remark. Databricks is a thought leader. They have made many open source software that everything else is compared to. (Spark, MLflow, DeltaLake,...). Databricks competitors run Databricks open source software. Agent bricks hosts 20+ LLMs out of the box. I don't know what the future holds, but I bet Databricks drives it.",

We used all of the technologies you listed except data tone and only a bit of lake formation. Then we wanted to have a business facing data catalogue with lineage and there wasn’t much available in AWS. As of 2026 I would argue that is still the case. For data catalogue we used OpenMetadata. For hosting we used EKS btw.Long story short it takes a lot of development effort to put all of these technologies together and to maintain it. It works well once done and it is scalable. But if I would do it again I would use Databricks in 2026. Gets you started quickly. Downside will be cost as you have to pay for DBUs on top off AWS cost. Arguably you would need less data developers which could pay for the additional cost. I know this is a bit off a sticking point nobody wants to think about. But if you plan to use your devs to build the AWS solution then you already covered the dev cost. If you go with Databricks you may need less data devs, assuming that some part of their time is currently used for infrastructure work. If the new AWS architecture would need more devs than the argument would be that Databricks would allow you to operate with the current number of devs.If you decide to go with databricks use an open source table format like iceberg to reduce vendor locking. Also bear in mind, databricks can support all of the requirements you listed, but is not best in class for all of them like BI, orchestration, gen ai etc. the core is around spark and related services.",

For the cloud, again, learn fundamentals, pass a certification but have a go using the free trials. In azure for example, but this will translate to other cloud providers, just under different names; learn about storage (blob storage), setting up of linux based VMs, serverless compute like Azure Function App, deployment using Docker (you can have Python, or JS only Function Apps) or generic where you drive the dependencies using docker. Then either data factory or airflow or other orchestration tools, data warehousing ie oltp vs olap concepts in the cloud and ultimately some basic networking so that you can for example make data factory actually be able to read from a VM hosted SQL Server. so tl;dr - SQL -> Python -> Cloud, but obviously for Python/Cloud, learn only the concepts that are relevant to data analytics/engineering. I’m saying this as an analytics consultant with 3 yrs of experience in analytics specifically, and research experience prior to that.",

I've built houses, boxes, fences and doors. I know how to frame, tile roof, and even straighten a car bumper with it. What tool should I learn next? Im eyeing a skilsaw, nail gun, and even power drill.\"Instead, focus on the meta. That is: engineering for solving business problems. The tool you use to build systems doesnt matter as much as successful execution and bringing value to the business. Can you model processes? If someone gave you a process model, can you translate that into technological implementation? Can you translate a process model into a data model?If you wanna get better at python, do leetcode exercises and learn data structures and algorithms. By accident, you will learn how to program in general— in any language. The real value is in learn how to think abstractly and creating an algorithm that will solve the business need efficiently and correctly. The brand of language or server is a political opinion or strategic decision (eg: python has the best tooling for DS).If you want to learn system design, build a python app from zero, no framework. It'll teach you how to organize code, how to build mental models around your code, separation of concerns, IO, dataflow, system orchestration, deployments, etc. Learn what tools exist within your ecosystem of choice. This will give you what you need to think abstractly— macro decision making, not micro. Focus on big picture like a tech lead (not like a CEO or CTO, thats too big picture).You know how to use a hammer very well already. Time to become an architect, too.",

My path away from Microsoft started with an EdX free course on learning Linux. I learned that Shell scripting could do way more than I had realised. Powershell was in its early years so this increased my interest in Powershell too.Because of the deadly duos rabid hatred of Microsoft I had to learn a lot in a short space of time on an alien OS and with a lot of alien tech. One of the system admits taught me some basic Docker skills. This let me build a small set of images for the tech we were migrating to. As a Dockerfile is a very small I could reproduce it at home to build the images I wanted.I'd say basic Docker skills are essential even if all you do is build your own learning labs. Look for courses by Nigel Poulton.For Python, make sure you get comfortable with virtual environments. Again, ring fenced learning but you will need this in a Python environment.Learn about PyTest and Behave for testing your Python code. There are some specific data testing libraries out there. Once you build learning labs and are comfortable with testing approaches, life becomes a lot easier.I built an ETL framework using an early version of Spark. It was effective, what the CTO insisted on, but was overkill for the barely TB data we had at the time. I'm amazed its so widely used given that few companies genuinely have Big Data problems. Databricks has Spark at its heart.Learn for the job you want and to keep the job you have.",

The major warehouses are shipping with CDC tools to replicate data from your Postgres/MySQL/etc so that you don't have to build that anymore. And more and more SaaS vendors will export data directly to your warehouse, so that you don't really have to build those either. AI will be able to do a lot in terms of glueing that together. Where I think data engineers will spend much more of their time in the future is on something much more valuable, actually building data products (internal and external) that derive value from the data. Every org I've worked at wants to be data driven, but the people in the business domains have really weak \"data reasoning skills\". I don't think AI fixes that because it won't help you if you don't know the right questions to ask. So my bet is that you'll have data engineers/scientists/analysts converging more and more into a role where they need to bridge that gap to make all this data we've collected valuable.",

Could just be my lack of use in that area but I don’t remember seeing a lot of these in the modern tech stacks when applying for jobs over the years and researching what skills are best to have. IMO whenever you’re job searching you really need to have your resume(s) pointed towards what you want to work with. Most companies have only a few tools for data engineering, orchestration layer and logic layer. Airflow and databricks for example. Pick a cloud provider, orchestration tool, data lakehouse/warehouse platform and start doing little projects. Like airflow orchestrates databricks notebook that pulls a dataset from azure datalake storage and then run a databricks notebook to convert the file to a delta table. Or durable function pulls API data and writes to bronze layer of databricks. You can pick whatever tech you decide I just mentioned those because it’s the route I decided to go down but I also incorporated snowflake just for a more overarching reach. Python can be learned along the way but it seems a little aimless to just sit down and “learn Python” for something that is as specific as data.engineering",

They isolate DAGs per batch, manage lineage, and prevent silent exits due to metadata growth. If you stick with batch loops, you need a mechanism to restart the Spark context periodically and checkpoint and clear lineage aggressively, but that is more fragile. Tools like dataflint can also help flag where your plan or metadata is growing across iterations so you can catch it before it silently exits. Structured streaming gives predictable long running behavior and scales better on YARN for production workloads.",

Unless it's highly critical and you are allowed to maintain a live copy of production in test environment, the test data is inevitably less complete. The smart and efficient solution is to have a proper analysis of the different cases existing in production, and use them to build your test data, ideally by the upstream team that is responsible for this data. Consider that it cannot be complete, try to make it good enough. Don't think you can predict all future use cases, the solution for those is proper error logging, monitoring and alerting, so you can react fast when they will happen.> In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing.Teams should be free to have their team-only development environment were they can break everything, but there should be another test environment that is relatively stable to allow downstream usage of data like you need. I think you need to talk about having such a stable test environment with the engineering management, in my experience it was mostly called \"staging\". It's not supposed to be a copy of \"production\", and it's better if it is not for information security, but it should be a good simulation of production cases to test the code edge cases (as I described above).In our case, our dev environment is our local laptops. We have hand crafted test files crafted to represent the different cases, and we are able to run full flows locally with either our tools running locally or mocking. Local allows to iterate much faster than if you have to deploy and rely on non-local tools. The unit tests and full flow tests are automated to be able to run in CICD or on request on PRs if they are too slow for systematic run. Then there is the company's staging environment that is fed by upstream teams with simulated data representative of production, and the same code and tools as production. There we can run our code in the same tool environment as production. > Upstream tables aren’t versionedWhat does this mean? If the code that creates/alter these tables is not versioned, that's pretty bad. The process needs to go through a proper CICD. Or do you mean there's no number you can track to know if the table schema changed?> schema changes aren’t always communicated. When that happens, our pipelines either silently miss new fields or break outright. Is this common? What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?Upstream table changes need to be communicated. This is not negotiable for platform stability and needs to be taken to engineering management. They need to establish a proper channel, for example: ticket (with PR links), documentation page, announcement in dedicated channel, regular meetings to plan changes and exceptional meetings for emergencies. A team should only be allowed to deploy such change once the communication process has been respected and the reception by downstream teams has been confirmed. This also means the upstream team is responsible for updating staging so it matches the change and you can properly test it in staging.",

There are some rare scenarios where it doesn't happen all the time - like the upstream system *never* changes, or is run by the exact same team doing the ETL work. But in almost all other cases it's a complete mess.Plus there's other bad cases like where the upstream system adds a new column, you're using a solution that provides some schema evolution capabilities like Fivetran, so your ETL process just silently ingests the new column - but that new column isn't actually used by anything - and it now has 50% of your costs allocated to it from a different column everyone is using.> What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?Data contracts & publishing domain objects: * Upstream system publishes a \"domain object\" any time any field within the domain changes. A domain is a higher-level abstraction like user, customer, invoice, supplier, etc. And the domain object is typically a denormalized collection of related info. * The domain object could be published to a messaging system, which could get ingested directly, or simply redirect messages into a file on say s3. Or maybe the upstream system just writes all pending domain objects to s3 every 5-15 minutes. * And the domain object is locked down with a data contract. This contract is kept in version control, and both the source & target teams can use it to validate all data being sent & received. I prefer jsonschema for this, and use it to identify columns, their types, as well as info like min/max values, min/max string length, null rules, enumerated values, regex formats, etc, etc, etc.",

Are you querying a subset of staging and/or production data (possibly sanitized) to cover edge cases, or is it a fully manufactured dev dataset/table that you run queries against?It's a small file included in the Git repo, something like 3 to 10 records. We use either JSON (easy to edit manually) or AVRO (Kafka source), depending on the source of the flow we are testing. If the test flow's source is a table, the source file is turned into the table format we use first by the test logic. Usually, data comes from staging since we already have representative but fake data there that is safe to keep in Git. It is potentially manually modified to add some cases that we need to test.> Also, just to confirm my understanding around environments: staging is what you always reference in test (and possibly dev, depending on your answer above), correct? 1. When a team member submits a PR, it is required for them to prove that their change works in staging, typically sharing a successful flow run with the different run modes (normal scheduled run, backfill, or whatever specific parameter). That's really the minimum that should be expected for any change affecting flows. 2. For any function that does not rely on integration with external tools, we require the very classic unit tests. Those take a few ms each, so they are always triggered in our CI tool whenever a commit is pushed.3. A bit more recently, we have been adding \"local flow tests\" that can be run locally on our laptop and in the CI tool. This means we can validate that the flow logic works locally, and we are able to use a local debugger, which is pretty amazing for ETL work. We can also run it on request with a comment during the PR review; the results are written in the commit status on Github. We don't run those automatically at every commit push because they have quite some overhead to set up a local flow environment (especially Spark's overhead); they take something like 30 to 90 s for each flow. This was a lot of work to create, but it is now extremely valuable. > If that’s the case, then in theory our “test” environment should fail, and alert us, whenever there’s a schema change that isn’t properly communicated. Is that the right way to think about it?For the tests to fail due to a schema change, the test data needs to have changed accordingly. For local tests, your team controls the test data, so it cannot have changed if you didn't know. Where it should fail is during the staging run, if the upstream team has correctly updated the data they are responsible for in staging and actually ran their change in staging. So, it still relies on the upstream team doing its job properly, which requires engineering management to enforce it if they are not doing it by themselves.If it failed in staging, you can check how the data changed and modify your local test data to cover the new situation. But, you shouldn't have to find it by yourself like this; the chances to miss the changes even if it is in staging are still too high, for example, if it only affects a small subset of records.So again, the most important solution is that there should be a mandatory communication channel for them to announce the change and collect the confirmation of the downstream teams. At minimum, something like a Slack message where downstream teams are pinged. With this information you can at minimum make sure your staging run goes through the change. If you have a local test, you can then directly modify your local test data and comfortably check on your laptop with a debugger what the consequence is for your flow. Ideally, there is the data contract system mentioned by others. Every schema is versioned in Git; it serves as the reference for every dependent project, and any change needs to be approved by the downstream teams in the PR. But I think very few companies have this level of maturity; even in my current company, where it is already very high considering the quality of testing I have described above, it is only partially implemented.> - Upstream Staging -> Our Dev/Test> - Upstream Prod -> Our ProdThe staging environment is supposed to be shared by all teams that have dependencies, so the integration of the different projects can be tested just like in production, except the data is a simulation. The only difference in terms of code is that staging may have the newer version of the code that is being tested. So it should be like this:- Staging environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects- Production environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projectsLocal testing is a separate environment that is defined in your Git repositories, so you wouldn't expect the upstream team to modify it, just like you wouldn't expect them to change the code you own. - Local test environment (only your teams): your test data (possibly based on staging upstream data) -> Your project -> your data- Staging environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects- Production environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projectsYour company could have another shared testing environment before staging. I can imagine a \"testing\" environment being for unstable testing; expect things to break regularly because teams will test early versions, and \"staging\" for stable testing; things should not break too much so you can test in production-like conditions. In our case, our local/staging/production is covering what we need, so I wouldn't see the point of having a 4th environment.",

ETL Pipeline: Ingest data from public APIs (maybe weather, finance, or social media), clean and transform it, and store it in a cloud database. Visualize results or build a simple dashboard to display insights.2. Data Warehouse Project: Set up a mini data warehouse using open source tools (like PostgreSQL, DuckDB, or even cloud warehouses if allowed by your school). Populate it with multiple sources and practice schema design, partitioning, and basic analytics queries.3. Batch vs Stream: Compare batch ETL (e.g., with Airflow or Prefect) and simple streaming (Kafka or just a basic pub/sub) on a dataset. Even if you use sample scripts, explaining the trade-offs is valuable.4. End-to-End Analytics: Choose a topic (like campus resource usage or student performance if you can get anonymized data), gather, clean, and enrich the data, and display it in a lightweight front-end. This gives you a taste of the full stack.Don’t worry about building something massive; depth of understanding matters more than shiny complexity. If your team isn’t super technical, you might look into tools that let you build simple frontends for your data without writing a whole web app from scratch; it’s a nice touch to showcase your processed data to non-technical folks.Best of luck on your capstone!",

Pick a real data source (API or public dataset), ingest it, clean/transform it, store it properly, and make it usable for analysis. For example try build a small pipeline that pulls data daily, handles schema changes or bad records, and loads into a warehouse. Add some basic data quality checks and maybe a simple dashboard or query layer on top so people can actually use it. What matters more than fancy tech is showing you understand core DE ideas ingestion, transformations, data modeling, reliability, and documentation. If you can clearly explain why you designed it the way you did, that’s already strong signal for junior DE roles",

It will feel very familiar.- Very structured data mart/semantics layer.- Close to mature in terms of features but I would say Sigma is more mature.Sigma- I would say this is the closest to Tableau in terms of maturity of features.- Usage logs is more convenient to use than Tableau.- Actions allow great flexibility in both changing visuals or filtering or more.- Input tables are cool and it could be really cool as a way to create “data apps” and use Sigma dashboards as data collection tools in the same UX).Evidence- Haven’t heard of this one yet.",

I felt like I didn't understand the new data model because I was pushed to NOT use facts/dimensions, basically just create a bunch of clean datasets. My current position didn't help with this either because my boss had the debate with the consultants and he basically told them to screw off and we got offshored instead of getting trained.

At I can hear you know Python good enough to start working with it. If you like Data Engineering - go for it. Learn Databricks, play around and you should be fine. If you got options to work with cloud in current role, by any means do it. Google a lot, understand what's under the hood and don't be afraid of it.

I learned a ton through that process and then went on to take the Data Engineering specialization through Deeplearning.ai to learn some more about what data engineering entails and some of the tools I might expect to use in a data engineering role. After completing the course, I worked on a personal project that involved creating an ETL pipeline with some public financial data I was interested in and a dashboard. I used some of the tools I learned about in the course to complete the project. It took me a while to find a job, but eventually managed to find an entry-level role that’s a mix of data engineering and analytics engineering.",

Focus on the DE principles you learned, not the tool.In my mind, a modern DE knows git and source control. Last I worked with SAS (base.. in 2012) it didn't support git. If you know it great, otherwise learn it. Im migrating people from oracle to Databricks and git / branching is a big big change for them.I am a DE for about 10 years now.  I only know Azure. Whatever tool you learn, chances are that a company you apply to uses something else. Don't worry too much, Id say either AWS or Azure is best, but GCP is not terrible.Where are you located?",

For actual looping use either (1) do the loop in a driver notebook or (2) keep ADF as the orchestrator and just trigger Databricks jobs. So no, you don’t have to write everything in notebooks, but the foreach part is usually code or external orchestration.If you redesign, the main win is fewer tiny jobs and fewer cluster spin-ups. One job run that reads the control table and processes a batch is usually cheaper and faster than 200 little runs. Also, if you are ingesting lots of files, people often go auto loader or DLT to cut orchestration overhead.Also lol at being told six hours ago, classic.",

I whipped up a quick POC and established a similar architecture as mentioned in 1)One Orchestration Notebook and a child folder in the same directory which has the child notebooks. Orchestration gets the metaData from DB and does a foreach on the dataSet to call relevant notebooks to pull/stage/replenish/stamp watermarks respectively.Wrote couple of functions runOnServerless, runOnCluster to accordingly run a certain notebook on relevant compute. I should build a utility so it can be used for other implementations as well.Each notebook does a notebook.exit on success or failure and returns a json with relevant pieces of information for audit and easier debugging.From a cost perspective, the batch approach (which I am using right now) should be cheaper than DLT or Autoloader, right ? I am right now going through the DLT and autoloader documentation to see how these can be used to ease up migration.Again, really appreciate taking time out to share your experience.",

In most setups I’ve seen, ingestion is kept dumb, pull raw data from AWS, Oracle, SharePoint, etc. straight into ADLS and do all the SQL/transform logic downstream in Azure. Athena adds another engine, catalog, and permission model to maintain. So yes landing the data first and querying it later is usually the cleaner pattern.

Ticket based work tends to plateau quickly, which isn’t a reflection of your ability. Your PL/SQL experience is actually relevant for data engineering procedures, debugging, and understanding data flows all transfer. The main gap is modern tooling and owning pipelines end to end. Given the market, I wouldn’t rush a hard switch. A safer move is to upskill alongside your current role learn Python properly, build a small DE style project, and try for an internal move if possible. If it’s impacting your health, that’s a real signal just make the transition planned, not impulsive",

Think of Lakehouse as the overall architecture, data lake + warehouse behavior on top of Delta tables (not a traditional warehouse, but it fills that role). Lakebase is newer and more OLTP oriented. It’s meant for serving low-latency app workloads while still integrating with the lakehouse for analytics. You dont need it for most DE use cases unless you’re mixing transactional apps and analytics tightly. Lakeflow is basically Databricks opinionated pipeline layer. It wraps ingestion, transformations, orchestration, and governance together (Delta Live Tables, auto ingest, quality checks, lineage). It’s not a new storage layer, it’s about how data moves and is managed. Rough mental model would go like this, Lakehouse = where data lives Lakeflow = how data gets there (and stays clean) Lakebase = optional transactional sidecar Once you see it that way, the pieces line up a bit better",

The big mindset shift is that schemas tell you how tables relate, but they don’t tell you how data changes. Streams only show what Snowflake sees as new or updated rows since the last run, so if the source system quietly edits an old record, you’ll never see that unless you deliberately go back and reprocess it. That’s why a lot of pipelines use a lookback window (reloading the last N days every run) or just full refresh smaller tables. If the source doesn’t give you a reliable “last updated” field or CDC feed, you kind of have to assume old data can change and design around that. For tables without dates, truncating by time doesn’t really make sense. Those usually get merged by a stable business key, or fully rebuilt if they’re small enough. The “forked” tables usually follow the lifecycle of the parent record, not the ingestion date. In general, when you’re trying to understand ingestion, I’d ask “how does this data change in the source system?” rather than “how do these tables join.” Once you answer that, the truncate vs merge decisions start to feel a lot more obvious",

Don’t go too deep because there’s a lot of technical stuff once you get deep in the docs, but understanding at a basic level the different functionalities is useful. For example, when just writing to a database and you KNOW you’re using a PostgreSQL database, it might be better to use psycopg2 directly instead of calling SQLAlchemy so you have more direct access instead of going through an intermediary. You might also consider adding in some basic orchestration to this project just to demonstrate you’re able and to understand how orchestration is handled. I would also look into how you would want to transform the data. I always recommend Polars over Pandas if you’re going with Python. The new Pandas update to 3.0 provides solid benefits, but the syntax is still very unpythonic and painful for beginners.",

        "body": "Short answer: yes, but not with a built-in “copy workflow” button.AWS Glue workflows can be migrated without recreating everything in the console, but it takes either an API based export or infrastructure as code.One option is to pull the workflow definition from the source account using the Glue API. `GetWorkflow` with `IncludeGraph=true` gives you the workflow structure and dependencies. From there you also need to export each referenced job, crawler, and trigger using `GetJob`, `GetCrawler`, and `GetTrigger`. In the target account, you recreate the workflow with `CreateWorkflow`, then recreate jobs, crawlers, and triggers so the DAG lines back up. This works well for a one-time move, but you still have to fix account specific things like IAM role ARNs, KMS keys, S3 bucket names, connections, and any hard coded account IDs in job arguments.The cleaner long-term approach is to turn the workflow into infrastructure as code. Glue workflows and triggers are supported in both CloudFormation and Terraform. Once modeled, you can deploy the same definition to another account with only variable changes for account specific resources. This avoids ever doing a manual rebuild again and is what most teams settle on after the first migration.In practice, if this is a one-off accident recovery, scripting against the Glue APIs is usually fastest. If you expect multiple environments or future moves, converting the workflow to CloudFormation or Terraform is the better investment.",

Almost every interview now requires very deep knowledge across many technologies, some ask for “LeetCode” stats and want to see code for projects you’ve been working on, or they’ll make you code on the spot, and unless you’ve been doing this for years, you’re going to get absolutely dunked on. I’m still hanging on by a thread where I currently work, but they’ve cut down our department by at least 70% and we no longer hire juniors for any position (not something I agree with, but just the reality, at least where I work).Furthermore, since there have been so many layoffs that means competition for positions is incredibly high, so you’re going to compete against people like me who are industry vets, as well as younger people with advanced degrees, etc.It might be worth diving into if it’s something you’re truly interested in, and hell, maybe it will end up working out for you, but I’d definitely have a backup plan.I wish you luck no matter what you choose,",

Honestly, I do not understand your point about an API being \"easier\" or \"harder\" than another - because REST APIs are all kinda the sameish (GET requests, at least) - but my only thought after having looked at it is: \"why would you want to learn APIs with something as dull as a payment provider?\"How about trying Space Traders? [https://spacetraders.io/](https://spacetraders.io/) It's an game you play online through API calls.",

Payment processing is not trivial, and is a terrible way to learn about APIs from a base of nothing.Go here: [https://free-apis.github.io/#/browse](https://free-apis.github.io/#/browse) \\- pick one that has no auth, make a page for each GET endpoint the API has, and display data that you have fetched from the API. Then move on to one with API key auth and do the same, then move on to one that has OAuth and do it again. Once you've done that go to [https://restful-api.dev/](https://restful-api.dev/) \\- try creating a record with a POST method, take the ID from the response and GET it. Once you can GET it, try to PATCH and PUT it, then ultimately DELETE it. You can practice this loop.REST API docs will make much more sense to you at this point when you actually understand auth and what the verbs are for. This knowledge is directly translatable to GraphQL queries and mutations, there are many guides, this is a decent one to see the difference between RESTful GET requests and GraphQL queries [https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/migrating-from-rest-to-graphql](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/migrating-from-rest-to-graphql) APIs are typically intuitive because we have common conventions, but you have to actually understand those conventions first. If it puts your mind at ease, well established APIs (like Stripe) are rarely a point of friction when you actually know what you're doing, but you're trying to build a house starting at the roof tiles.",

That’s where you run into real debugging, learn how tools work together, and build confidence in production-like thinking.Also, sharing your work (like you did) is itself observability practice , it makes your progress visible to others and invites useful feedback.

        "body": "> it demoralizes meFirst up, school has misled you on how easy it is to learn new things. They didn't mean to do it, but they did. What do I mean by that? You spend years slowly spiralling your knowledge and understanding of a topic over years, probably for 12 or 13 years at the minimum. As such, when you are introduced to a 'new topic', it's 98% old knowledge. It is built on structures where a lot of the new thinking is given to you and slowly removed bit by bit until you are doing it yourself. This teaches you are taught that learning isn't really too hard, and you should be succeeding almost immediately before moving to the next topic. When you learn something novel it's not a slow progression over years, it's probably a logistics function of logistic functions for each topic. That is, the initial concept is pretty easy, then it becomes hard as fuff where you feel like an idiot for ages, but you eventually learn the concept and it gets easy. But, because you are constantly learning, at no point do you ever feel like a master, or even competent. I firmly believe that 'good' programmers are people who accept that they will always struggle stuff that they are just learning and can realise exactly how much they've learned. So, what's the lesson for you?- Accept that you might need to take smaller steps, and that's okay. - After you learn something, make your own version of the questions/problems, and solve them as well. If you can't do that, go back to their questions and just change one small thing (like a variable) and write down what you think will change when you run it and then run it. Document if it runs the way you thought, and if it doesn't, keep playing until you get it. Then move to two things, then as many things as you can. - Think back to other things you've learned and ask yourself if you can incorporate those things as well, if so (and you probably can), make your own versions of those problems. You'll likely find that giving yourself that space to learn how to solve those problems will mean that the next step will be easier.",

And once you have gone through the basics, anything more advanced you want to know will be applicable to your specific project, and you can always find either articles or videos, or most of the time, just look at example projects.What I think is the hardest part of learning React is not writing all the syntax, or memorizing all the different hooks, but simply getting an idea of WHY you create variables with useState rather than plain variables, WHY you use props or contexts, WHY you need routes, etc. And Codecademy, Freecodecamp and all the rest suck at explaining the WHYs, even when they are excellent at demonstrating the HOWs.So I wouldn't have expected much better than your experience, but thank you for sharing anyways, as it might encourage others to skip those kind of courses!",

The best way is to do both Jonas course and Odin project side by side else you'll get stuck in tutorial hell.If you think your teacher is using old way(it is always going to happen) just start building with latest way and navigate through errors. For eg- In react course Jonas intentionally uses \"create-react-app\" which is deprecated now but at that point if you've gone through js+odin you should be comfortable enough in this world to look up and use vite.",

How? They experimented. They tried. They failed. They tried something different and eventually, they succeeded.Most tutorials don't actually \"teach\". They pre-chew and serve. They don't make the learner do the work and *think*. You won't learn much if the entire code is presented to you. You will only learn if someone *guides* you but you have to do the thinking and work. This distinguishes a top quality *course* from just another *\"how to create X\"* *tutorial*.Once one has the foundation laid, e.g. through some proper *course*, it is time to throw away the training wheels and to start trying, doing things on their own. Use the documentation, use specific targeted articles, blogs, or even tutorials - but not the \"how to create X\" ones, rather some short, narrow, targeted tutorials that only cover some aspect of your project, e.g. if you want to do something with a SQLite database in Python, check for a quick tutorial (there are excellent ones) that teach you exactly that - how to connect to a database, how to create tables, how to query fields, etc.Changing your way how you approach tutorials also can help: When a concept, part is introduced, try to do it on your own first. Do not look at the presented code. Write it yourself. Play around, experiment. Once you have done it and it works or if all else fails, look at the code. Work at *predicting* what the presented code will be.",

I would honestly recommend trying your best to not look at the tutorial or its code, and try to figure out the logic and reasoning yourself. Doing pseudo code really helps with this. If I need a variable of function explained further, I would type it into chat gpt and ask it to explain it to me like I’m a first grader. When I’m struggling with creating something, I’d first search up as much as I can on the web, and if I still can’t get it then ask chat gpt to give me hints but don’t give me the code/answer.

It just doesn't come naturally to me even though my brain basically thinks like code is written. You're not a natural & neither am I.Also, feeling like banging your head on the wall is very common when learning to code, especially when asking for help (traditionally). That's why utilizing AI can be an incredible tool if you use it to learn. For example, I learn coding well by seeing correct code & dissecting it to reverse engineer it since I learn best by understanding what each part does & why it does it.

I don’t ask AI to build me the thing, I ask it what boiler plate examples look like, then why each thing is needed, and how each is supposed to work together. Then once I think understand that, I implement it myself and see if I can get it to work. You just have to avoid using code from AI you don’t understand how it works. Thats the part thats not learning.For some people though (it depends on your learning style), the quick answers can make retention harder, which is important to be aware of. You may have to work extra hard to recall the information you just learned to retain it in your brain. On that note, your should look at what your own personal learning style is. Do notes help you, or flashcards? Does reading it make you understand or do you need to do the thing to learn it?Personally for me, I can’t learn a lot from a lecture or a reading i’m a tactile learner.

It can be done, but the end results always cost more, are never finished, and often don't have any targets (requirements) to meet, except for the ones that come from the fires you need to put out today.The idea in the past was that this was a good approach, when one took the initial efforts and retroactively fit a design onto it that represented the solution. Then one would refactor the stuff into the design, and keep the design intact going forward. The problem is that design has been so maligned that few people even study it anymore, and after you study it you need to gain skill in it by doing a few projects, and projects that actually involve designing as any step (before or after) are so few and far between that you get \"shooting from the hip\" designs that are often inconsistent and difficult to use, if you get them at all.APIs are supposed to be the most stable portions of integration.

This week I was told to start using 'auto claude' to start completing 6 tickets at once.I've been told to focus on architecture and treat the ai as my junior to complete tasks for me. I responded 'but there are many areas of architecture I don't know, I'm not sure how to guide the AI on architecture that I need to read up on?' The response was 'ask the ai about the architecture'.I'm not having a great time.",

Well, it is clear that the person used an AI (everything has a comment on it) but part of the point of a review is to educate the person who wrote the code. He has to understand that what the AI generate is a nonense. Besides merge requests, one himself has to know when to not trust the output of the AI. When to doubt in its answers, when to reject its code. One has to expect the AI to generate nonsense.And for juniors, they struggle with relying too much on the AI. Their own skills and ability drops. They actually do not LEARN. They are unable to function without the AI. And they trust the output of the AI. The quality of their tasks drops.

It is such a dope idea, as it allows you to test out everything beforehand as a miniature version of what you are trying to accomplish. Give it a go, build a minimal version of the project you want, try using only the core features, for example, and create a product that allows you to see what you are trying to accomplish.As a game developer, when building games, I focus on only building 1 file at a time. Therefore, if I can stick the whole game in 1 file, then that's all it will take, and I organize the classes and methods based on what gets called first in the render method. I remove all need for fancy features, such as special effects, game-ending scripts, and features that don't add to the product's goal, such as cosmetics, unless they unlock the exact feature or mechanic I am trying to highlight. Hope this makes sense. So I will end up with a game that just plays, and that's all. No fancy features, lol. No finishing the game yet, either. Just a fully featured game without any effects, or a game that just plays your core-gameplay loop. Amen and selah.Hope this helps. Good luck with all your endeavors. Peace and love.",

Here’s what I’d try if I were you:GDevelop – super beginner-friendly, works right in your browser, drag-and-drop, great for 2D games. PlayCanvas – browser-based 3D engine, no install needed, has a visual editor. Phaser – a JS framework, good if you’re okay coding in JavaScript/HTML5 (you already know some HTML/CSS so this will click). Godot – powerful and free, can run on Chromebook using Linux or the web version, a bit harder to set up but worth learning. Scratch – if you just want to start experimenting with logic and visuals.Basically, start small, make simple games, and build up. You *don’t* need a powerful PC or expensive software to learn these free tools are perfect for getting started.",

That way, we didn't have to deal with re-pointing nameservers, changing billing, or other nonsense (usually, biggest issue was stuck caches).The clients that didn't have an existing host service I would recommend use the host I had been using who - at the time - had good rates, solid customer service team. I...don't think I'd recommend them as enthusiastically today.How they want to pay is up to them; usually yearly got a discount, 3 years even further, 5 years a crazy discount. They set up the payments, I didn't want to get involved with that.When working on sites my contract broke the project estimate into a series of phases. Work on each phase wouldn't begin until a down payment was received, and I wouldn't start on a subsequent phase until the previous phase had been paid in full. That always seemed to be the safest - breaking a site into, say, 3 phases, with incremental payments. Better than working for 2 months on a $15k job only to find out the client never intended to pay me.",

Python's standard library is 1000x better.2: There tends to be a lot of asynchronous activity, which is a can of worms and makes subtle bugs.3: Some of the syntax is just weird, like ===.My advice is to work on programs that you will actually want to use, and keep trying to have fun with it. Think of programming as a creative medium, and don't be afraid to write small and/or weird programs. Not everything needs to be a showcase project. Don't be afraid to tackle concepts that confuse you. Getting a *good* book and reading it always helps.Remember that for every \"good\" program you have used, the person who made it had written hundreds of crappy programs before it.

It has state (variables), flow (code execution order), branching, looping, and much more. These are completely new things if you transition from markup/styling to actual programming.Now, you're battling two fronts: JavaScript as a language with its vocabulary and grammar and *programming* - which is like learning a new spoken language while learning to write a meaningful, comprehensive, fully developed novel in that language. So, it is absolutely natural that you struggle.JavaScript being one of the most anarchic languages around doesn't make it easier. Well structured, pragmatic languages make it somewhat easier, but can't be directly used for web pages.",

You could add an intermediate step with the *PyGame* library in Python with [Making Games with Python and PyGame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame).All resources are 100% free.If you go the Unity route, C# should be your starting point. There, Microsoft has some great, also free courses.If you go for the Unreal Engine, it's C++ but I wouldn't recommend to directly start with it.Keep a lookout on Humblebundle for GameDev bundles.

If programming just feels like doing homework or meaningless exercises (like Path C sometimes can), I think sometimes people lose motivation before they've really gotten into it.I would say, be cautious about Unity or Godot since those are generally more 'intermediate' than beginner level. Your intuition to start with something like Ren'Py is a good idea. I'd also recommend Game Maker since it's even easier to get started with something fun/playable (though it uses a slightly weird programming language that's not useful anywhere else). Pygame and Love2D are also popular although maybe a little outdated at this point.",

Instead I would go for a program that has to redraws everything 30-60 times a second and reacts to input while doing that. A good project could be something like [Sketchpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad), one of the origins of CAD programs and vector drawing programs. Even with a very simple scope, it'll force you to deal with points, lines, shapes, constrains between them and so on. Dive into [Entity Component Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglU107_DA4) and see how much you can accomplish and document how this architecture affects your ability to add new stuff, change old stuff, etc..It will be very insightful for you and you will benefit a lot from that in your entire career.",

I don't know what exactly is not clear to you. Maybe the problem is that you try to \"translate\" your code. It's probably better to not just translate it line by line but to think about what objects there will be and how they communicate. Calling a method is how that works in OOP. And they can have side effects. There are books. Some of them are bad many are outdated. The problem is mostly that they spend a lot of time on inheritance of state because it's so problematic. That chapter has to be in the book, but it should just be about what you prevent as much as possible. And beginners think because there's so much about it in the book it must be important. You probably need a type for each expression in your syntax tree. You could use an abstract class as a base that has a field for the token(s) from the tokenizer. But you really don't need this. Just design each class as a final class and it's a lot simpler. Use \"record\" instead of \"class\" for immutable types. \"permits\" on your types when you know the subtypes.",

Then whenever you want to add, you pass the integer in the array to the function pointed to in the array. *This is called a field and a method*.This is an oversimplification. There's lots of details around how objects are actually laid out, and inheritance adds run time resolution of jump tables, but at the end of the day, it really is just packaging data, function pointers, and jump tables together in some data structure.",

You need to know html, css for basic pages that aren’t interactive. For interactive pages you add JavaScript/Svelte. For user data you’ve got to store it somewhere so Databases etc. Id follow the Odin project which will cover the basic html/css JavaScript etc before looking at the rest - bootstrap and tailwind etc are additional frameworks that help implement styling but you should know the underlying stuff first. Realising how much there is to learn is a good point it shows your learning and taking note - learn the fundamentals then expand slowly but don’t jump around from one area to another - learn it inside out.

Since you already like Python, do something like Flask + SQLite + plain HTML forms. No Bootstrap, no APIs, no frontend frameworks, no auth, no deployment. Just one page to list items, one to add, one to edit, one to delete. That’s enough to learn routing, templates, forms, validation, and a simple database loop.Also, flip the ratio back to mostly coding. You only need enough reading to unblock the next tiny step.

Now before this I was fine learning PythonSorry, but you haven't really started *learning*. 2 months is nothing in terms of learning programming (in fact, in learning anything).You will need to have way more patience and stop jumping subjects.With 2 months in, you barely scratched the surface of Python and moved on to web dev already. Way too fast. You suffer \"shiny object syndrome\" - jump from one thing to the next without actually learning anything *in depth*. With this approach you will get nowhere.Yes, there is a lot to learn and the learning never ends in programming, no matter what domain you take.The way to go is to not look at the vast amount that is there, but to look at what is next, just like when climbing a mountain, you don't look at the summit but at the next step, at the path ahead.Take a *solid course*, not random youtube videos.For web dev:+ [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org)+ [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)and later [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)For Python, we commonly recommend the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki.> The barrier to entry level is very high for a beginner like me. No, it actually isn't. *You* made it high because of jumping around. As I've said already: stick to one thing and learn it in depth.Learning anything is not a sprint. It is a marathon where slow and steady wins the race. You cannot speedrun learning.For Python alone it takes upward of 6 months to become somewhat proficient yet far from competent, experienced, and good.For web dev, you can learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS in about one or two months and then it takes another good 6 months with JavaScript and to puzzle everything together. Give 2 years and you become somewhat competent.> I've spent 80% of my time basically studying on paper everything, and 20% actually coding anythingThat's the reverse ratio to what you should be doing: 70 to 80% practice, 20 to 30% theory.You can only learn through active practice, not through reading.",

In those days we wrote out the entire program on paper, ran through it (still on paper) assigning numbers to variables, etc, to do the best we could to simulate its operation. Why? Because the program had to be typed onto punch cards and fed into a card reader, then run usually overnight. You'd get a printout with a mass of compiler errors the next day, look at the various other reports, mark up the printout, and repeat until it ran correctly. The point of telling you this is that it took such a long time to get computer output that we did everything we could to ensure that our logic and syntax were succinct and correct before submitting a job. So we used flow charts, pseudo code, walk-through discussions, and anything else we could think of. This mental exercise made writing code in different languages relatively easy. As you know, that's mostly syntax and punctuation.So I would recommend that you try programming without a computer. Say, with a book of algorithms (Maybe Cormen? I haven't read it.), or [a book on threaded interpretive language](https://archive.org/details/R.G.LoeligerThreadedInterpretiveLanguagesTheirDesignAndImplementationByteBooks1981)s -- build yourself a FORTH-like compiler -- or join a number of folks from the 80's and build a C compiler.

You don’t need to become a full engineer, just enough to read and debug.If your main goal is to ship the project, then fighting AI-generated code as a beginner is usually the worst of both worlds. You didn’t write it, you don’t fully understand it, and small issues become blockers. In that case, using a simpler, opinionated tool that stays out of your way is often smarter. Some people switch to more constrained builders like durable for this reason. You trade flexibility for momentum and avoid the deployment rabbit hole.",

Then add a few div, deal with row and column, under how content is showing in a page. 2-Css: you know how the page looks, now how to make it sexier. Right? Apply css by id, fonts, style, padding… etc. then at this point, you got an idea about front end. 3-JavaScript: you can’t skip this. You need to understand how to apply a function to an element, Id… then, use JavaScript to get some sample data. 4- data: instead of static content, now thing about dynamic content. Questions like, how is data look like, what i want to show in the html? At this stage, don’t need to have a backend yet, you can just have a fake raw json file. 5- backend.

But it's not the only way! You could also hard code every ability into your character and have a series of boolean flags for if you have that ability or not. Big name games from developers like Nintendo still do this today. This strategy can be easier and faster to write and perfectly adequate for your needs.Basically if you catch yourself writing code that seems like 3000 line crazy spaghetti functions, consider how you could redesign it to use classes. If you're writing a million types of classes, each with almost no logic inside of them, consider how you might write this without classes or with fewer classes.",

Devs are more concerned with how manageable, scalable, and flexible the code is.For example, if you were to add a new feature later down the road (which is not uncommon), how easy would you be able to implement it without having to rewrite everything? There is where things like SOLID principles come in, such that applying those principles in your code design would generally make your code more robust.For example, suppose you wanted to implement abilities.You can certainly create every skill as its own class for example. An AttackSkill, a GuardSkill, a FireballSkill, and so on, such that when you execute a skill, your code can handle them uniformly and if certain skills have some unique properties, you could just override some parent logic and it probably just works.Or perhaps you might decide you only need a Skill class which takes an ID that references a table that describes the properties of the skill itself (eg: damage formula, animation, use conditions, etc).Both approaches are valid, and certainly allow you to add new skills to your game without too much extra work.If your game has complex skill interactions, it may be necessary to implement every skill defined by its own subclass because you have special logic for all of them. Perhaps you might come up with a custom \"skill effect\" syntax where you write them out in a text file and the game simply interprets it as you go.There is no particular right answer. Try different approaches and compare the pros and cons of each of them. Maybe you'll get some insight that you can use for future code design.",

Linux without a display server is still capable of drawing on a screen. Just try installing raspberry pi os lite and then plugging it into a monitor, you will still get output.- So I want to learn how to make linux system calls and learn C by working through two advanced books, culminating in a project where I make a simple game that only uses direct system calls and writes directly to the screens frame buffer, pixel by pixel, for output.",

That said, I still stand by my comment that if you think you are \"up for it\", then \"go for it\".This is more of a \"being on the same page\" when we are talking about system calls.Back in the day, when I did assembler programming on MS-DOS systems, system calls was pretty much the only option available. I also had to do this on some proprietary operating systems such as TMX (which was an NCR proprietary OS running on M68K CPUs).It was a PIA. Back then, in MS-DOS, the interface was pretty straightforward, but tedious.System calls are pretty basic as you are directly invoking functions that the underlying operating system supports - for example, openning, reading, writing and other file operations. Or, forking the current process and replacing the image with a new image (fork and execute). Terminate this process and other \"basic\" operations.In DOS, you setup the parameters in various CPU registers and invoked a software interrupt (INT 0x21 if memory serves).Linux is very similar.If running on Intel hardware, there is a special instruction `syscall` (added in Pentium class CPUs I believe) that is used in place of the INT 0x21, but you still have to set up the CPU registers.Perhaps have a look at this: https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/linux-constants/syscalls/#x86_64-64-bitThe CPU registers that need to be set are listed at the head of the table,Note that there are no \"graphics\" system calls - I don't know how this would work, I imagine it is some sort of IPC between your process and a kernel driver which manages the display hardware. IPC could include any combination of:* Shared memory (shmget, shmat ...).* Semaphores (semget, semop, semctl),* Message Queues (msgget, msgsnd, msgrcv...).* Pipes (pipe, mkfifo, open, read, write...)* Signals which operate like interrupts (kill, signal, sigaction...)and possibly others. But the same thing would apply, there would be some mechanism (defined by the driver) that defines how parameters are supplied and functions invoked.If you want to learn system calls (and the above is what you are talking about), you might try doing some basic File I/O using the system calls, perhaps some IPC between two processes that you create (and thus know the protocol being used for them talk to each other) - perhaps a simple command interpreter that can accept commands, fork and exec a sub process.",

For that you usually pick Unity or Unreal, so that means C# or C++.As far as C++ being difficult to learn, that's somewhat true, but Unreal Engine does simplify it a bit by being opinionated. They have a way of doing things. And it has libraries that handle the hard stuff like memory management for you.Take a look at Unity if C# is more your speed. It's a lot \"cleaner\" than C++ IMO.

But you have to write server code that uses the database.If you’re looking to get experience that could make you useful to a company using the web for business, I suggest PostgreSQL or possibly MariaDb/MySQL, the free open source database server packages. MariaDb has the advantage that a gazillion budget web hosting vendors offer it as part of their standard package.You might consider using a content management system to publish your artwork. Many of those use databases. Wordpress.org, Drupal, Joomla, Wikimedia, there are many decent open-source offerings that will get you on the web. Follow their installation instructions.",

That's not to say that you won't find places that use them, but they are definitely loss common.Java, C# and Node are much more commonly used for backend work.Most roles are full-stack to some degree, but if you want to prioritise backend, the best suggestion is to look at the job adverts in your nearby area. Tech stacks are not spread evenly and you might find that there are lot more Java roles in your nearby area, or you might find more C# roles etc etc..",

You would want to use C++ through the part of a program that leads to understanding and the creation of data structures such as link lists and more advanced features.The idea is to understand the underlying concepts from simple things like loops, data types and other beginner ideas. At this point you are using C++ to investigate the concepts. Actually learning C++ well and becoming conversant in the language is an entirely different issue and frankly takes years of study and practice. At some point in your Computer Science study you should also be starting in on a second language. Python is a good option here, but if platform specified programming is in your future, the common language for the platform. For example Swift for Apple's products. Don't stop with C++ for now.",

Understand how to download, setup, and use 3rd party libraries within your project. This can indeed be non-trivial, especially given the relative immaturity/messiness of C++'s packaging ecosystem compared to other programming languages. (Installing libraries can be tricky in C/C++; newer and more modern languages took note and added in better built-in support for it.) But if you plan on writing C++ professionally, it's something you must become familiar with, for better or for worse.Note that:1. Pretty much no employer will let you use an online IDE. It's pretty questionable from a security standpoint (if you use a free editor) or a cost standpoint (if the company pays for it). The overwhelming expectation is that you use a local editor of some sort.2. Most employers (and open-source projects) will already have the project set up, and have a recommended workflow. In practice, this _can_ save you the hassle of figuring out how to wire everything up from scratch.3. That said, employers will still expect you to be familiar with how to use the toolchain of your primary programming language, especially to complete basic tasks such as setting up and using a new library.

My code creates two variables - one an unnamed temporary, but it's entirely reasonable that they would be register values and never even see L1 cache.I'd look at the results in Compiler Explorer; if one is better, stick with that. If the two are equal, I'd error on the side of convention. Your loop takes a lot of thinking to figure out, and that's not good. Even the comment is a mile long, which is also a code smell. Novel solutions are good - clever solutions are bad. You have to be clever to write a clever solution, and you have to be MORE clever to debug a clever solution. That is to say, you are not clever enough to debug your own clever solutions. None of us are good for it.Your comment suggests an error. To read past the bounds of an array is Undefined Behavior. Even for a multi-dimensional array that is guaranteed to be contiguous, an array is a higher order type than raw machine memory, with semantics that are enforced by the COMPILER, not the machine. You violate bounds and aliasing rules, which the compiler doesn't check for you - because it correctly ASSUMES you're writing well defined behavior and you wouldn't intentionally violate the language rules you're personally responsible for. The compiler is going to optimize assuming correct code, and access past the bounds can blow up in your face in interesting ways.UB is no joke, it's how Zelda and Pokemon are famous for bricking the Nintendo DS when glitch-hacking.

It's often used, mist notably in K&R.This construct isn't what I'd call *good*, though.* Others are pointing out that the loop condition doesn't need to reference A because it's superfluous in a mathematical sense. It also asks for an unnecessary addition on every loop iteration. The compiler will probably optimize that out, but textually you're expressing something different from what you actually mean. Your loop should EITHER go until the pointer reaches some limiting address value, OR until some count is reached. For what you're doing, choose the count by comparing N to zero.* The variable names are unhelpful. What is N? By convention it looks like the array size, but it only means that at the start of the loop. It's actually the number of items remaining to be visited. And what is A? It's not the address of an array A, it's the address of an element of that array.* The empty initialization of the for loop means you're expressly designing this code to leave artifacts available for the rest of the block. Sometimes that's useful, but not here. Those artifacts are A, pointing just past the last element of the array, and N, which will by definition be zero. Neither has any useful meaning, so it would be better to make them local to the For loop.",

        "body": "TLDR: The reality is most starting out heavily lack basic DSA or basic language functionality like stacks, heaps, and virtual space. There are countless things to learn but overall I recommend advancing in DSA and don't feel rushed to know everything. Take your time deeply understanding the simple stuff. Ask questions where things are assumed and seem obvious. If you can really feel what's going on it will stick better. If you're going to Leetcode try to stay in a particular topic for a while and avoid spreading your learning too thin across many different challenges back to back.I was in and out of university for a while and in between completed Coding Dojo Full Stack Development (don't recommend), made a bunch of projects and eventually a successful app on iOS and Android. You might already know many of these topics but this is what I find useful.What I learned is that anything.js (edit I mean most .js solutions, not literally a project called anything.js lol) React, Angular, etc. these full stack web frameworks are constantly changing and new trendy APIs are always coming. Many new APIs are made when someone has some slight problem with the existing options. The right way to use them imo is to know the good general fundamentals like CRUD, validations, DB servers and back end controllers for them, MVC structures, dynamic pages and templates and when you come across some new API you must use that's the only time to get into the specifics and spend time on it - when you need to.Leetcode is good with the right mindset. You can spend too much time on topics that don't improve your skills that much or focusing on the difficulty more than what you're actually learning. Every programmer should strive to be solid in DSA. Focus on things like arrays, binary trees, string modification and linked lists. Take your time to know the little things well. Ask AI for small learning project ideas and when you don't know something syntax or language specific don't ask AI but check the documentation because there you will be surprised at when else you come across or multiple examples of using a function. Try to solve the Skyline problem. The skill level rating shouldn't get in the way of what you want to learn. If knowing how to solve that problem advances you then just take your time on it and try to have solid knowledge in the small steps. If you learn how every little part of a single problem takes all day when you could've done a bunch of random ones to feel more comfortable in the language, it's fine because the former will stick with you.Maybe do a simple learning project in hash maps, or make a multi multi level index database with JSON files and JS and see how you can optimize it. Take a JSON file with test data and make a function that splits it to 3 files where the first is an index, and the next two is part A and B. See how you can modify the function to take number of files/splits and how to split them. For learning I try to keep my attention in the same realm for a while so don't jump around too much or do a project that spreads your attention thin.Those skills will follow you everywhere you go but a new JS API probably won't help you with much else.Know the topics that are needed but programmers starting out struggle with or are frequently missed either by curriculum or not needing it in a specific language:\\- What is a stack and heap?\\- What is a virtualized address?\\- Asymmetric vs symmetric encryption, passkey generation, basic structure of encrypting and decrypting data and how to ensure you're doing it safely.\\- When to use structured SQL data or NoSQL. What are the pros and cons? You can use both in an app so what do you want strict and what should be flexible?\\- Allocation for data types.Relating to networking I don't know what fundamental work is needed I haven't dealt with that much yet, but less low level topics are solutions that reduce data redundancy, but also latency which can fight redundancy, and the size of transfers all while keeping security which can also fight latency for users. We are producing and sharing data in a rapidly growing rate as the corporate world wants everything cloud based and as AI does what it do. Any little changes to make an app function just as fast and secure but with less data being transferred or stored is very valuable. AI companies will be considering things like Azure Cosmos DB or something equivalent/better. I won't comment much on AI I don't know where that is going.",

Contact him if the conflict is too difficult, to understand reasoning behind his changes.If you did any changes in fixing merge conflict then commit these. Don't push.

        "body": "Yes and no.There's several layers to this question and your intuition to be sceptical is correct, but there's some small things in between.First: on the entity level, there are no ids. On the entity level, you only talk about relations between entities, not how you model that in Java or in the database. This distinction is important precisely because the materialisation may end up completely different than the logical view.Next, ownership. Ownership is a special case relationship that usually isn't really fully expressed in ER lingo. What we mean is: the owned object must not exist without exactly one owner. The owner controls the lifetime of the owned entity and must delete it or move it to a different owner if the owner is deleted. The reverse relationship may be of a weaker kind. Most many-to-one relationships are just to look something up in the parent, but in many cases you can throw those out by not having the logic on the child element.For real teams and tournaments you wouldn't have an ownership here because teams can outlive the tournament. Both would be full business objects that can exist independently.Now, that's the logical entity view, but you still have to materialise that in Java and the database. And that's where the trouble starts. If you simply give both Tournament and Team a slot of the respective other type, you can not handle them atomically any more. You need to create both and then link them. You need to break up the links before you delete them. This gives you all manner of nasty chicken-and-egg problems when dealing with constraints and temporal integrity of your data, so we usually avoid it where possible. It's even worse in the database, because now you can't but referential constraints on your data any more - again, because it needs to be in an inconsistent state for a very short time.It's even worse in languages with a ref-counted garbage collector. There, the GC will simply count how many times an object is referenced by others and so these circular references will leak memory if not broken up manually. Luckily Java's GC is not ref-counted, so that's one problem less.What you usually do for your specific problem is to move logic away from dependent entities. If teams cannot exist independently and you need information of the tournament, then the logic that acts on them should take the tournament and the team and sit outside of your entities as some sort of service actor.That of course would mean that any api endpoint working on players would need all three ids, which is stupid. Luckily that's where the separation of entity and database model helps us. Because one-to-many relations are usually stored inverted in the database anyway, in the database each team knows its tournament directly. In the entity view it does not. So instead of calling an accessor in Java to let JPA fetch the relation, you take a tiny detour and ask the database to look up the tournament (likely through a native SQL or similar query method anyway, but the thought counts!). That way your entity model can model ownership unidirectionally while the database can do what it does best.",

        "body": "At the moment, it's hard to give solid recommendations on how to best structure your data. We don't know what operations you want your program to support (what 'verbs' you want). This in turn makes it challenging to figure out the best way of representing your data (what 'nouns' you need).I think this is a common trap for beginners: you start with nouns, trying to create a 'model' of some real-world scenario you're looking at. But instead, you should start with the 'verbs' you need and work backwards to figure out what you need to build to support those actions.Anyways, without further context, in this scenario I'd probably set up a SQL database to be the source of truth for your teams/players/etc -- maybe sqlite to start, to keep things simple? I would then run sql queries to perform steps like 'grab a list of all players belonging to team X during tournament Y'. There are two advantages to this:1. This side-steps your problem, since you can grab data in exactly the shape you need for each distinct operation, instead of being locked into one specific one. (In this case, your `tournament -> {teams, players}` shape)2. More generally, it gives us maximal flexibility in cases where my verbs are unknown.If you want to stick with your current structure, I would perhaps consider changing Tournament no longer store 'Player' objects and instead have those be stored under 'Teams'. The 'Tournament' class can then implement helper methods that iterate over teams to return an iterator or list of all players.Though granted, this is not perfect either, since a team could potentially belong to multiple tournaments, and a player could belong to multiple teams over time... To support this in full generality, you would most likely end up creating your own 'querier' abstraction -- basically a database, or something conceptually similar to it. So, we're back at square 1.> Is avoiding bidirectional relationships between domain entities generally considered best practice in this case?Bidirectional dependencies are usually suspect, yeah. It's not always a problem, but it's usually a sign that some common functionality could be refactored out, or that the 'shape' of the data is not quite clean. Having to keep both directions in sync is a bit cumbersome and potentially error-prone, and it's better to design our code to avoid having to do it if possible.> Is it more idiomatic to allow Team to hold direct Player references and rely on invariants to maintain consistency, or to keep entities decoupled and move cross-entity logic into a service/manager layer?If the data is fully immutable -- never changing after it's first created -- I'd probably be ok with allowing both Team and Tournaments to hold player references. To make this work, you'd want your 'Tournament' object to be a fixed snapshot of a specific point in time instead of the source of truth and handle updates separately.But if it's mutable, then I would prefer to avoid having duplicate references to reduce the odds of human error, where you accidentally break some invariant. (After all, the best invariant is no invariant.)That said, it's sometimes useful to have duplicate references in cases where it would materially simplify your algorithms or improve performance. But we would need to understand the desired verbs of your program first before exploring this path.",

If a player can play in multiple tournaments, it would seem that you would need to duplicate player state, which isn't what you want.2. If a team holds a reference to a tournament, does that mean a team can only play in one tournament? Or does the reference mean the \"current tournament that the team is playing in\"? If so, what does it mean to get player ratings with respect to the current tournament? Is a player's ratings dependent on which tournament the team is currently playing in?I feel that based on these two observations, there might be an issue with the overall design.",

Universities teach a lot of stuff that's not programming as a requirement for you to get your degree. They aren't comparable. A College / University will also study more theory, and less on practical skills. Both are valuable, but one is harder to get, which is why it's seen as more desirable.",

That's fine if it's still a work-in-progress (assuming you actually have a plan to make it work correctly), but I think it's really a bad idea for you to recommend it to beginners in its current state, because it will just frustrate them and lead them astray. The idea is good, but it means nothing without proper implementation. A learning tool that shows wrong information is worse than no tool at all.For your reference, I tested with the following very simple code snippet: std::vector vec; int *foo; int *bar; vec.push_back(1); vec.push_back(2); vec.push_back(3); foo = &vec[0]; bar = &vec[1];For one thing, the parser seems extremely limited. I had to split up the declarations of `foo` and `bar` because it failed to recognize `int *foo, *bar;` as a valid declaration. And it totally fails to parse and execute the last two lines at all. It also failed to properly handle simple control flow structures when I tested them, such as for loops.Also, the memory map for this example is very wrong. It shows that `vec` is on the stack at address 0x1000, `foo` is on the stack at 0x1010, `bar` is on the stack at 0x1018, and `vec` \"points to\" an array of 24 bytes on the heap at 0x1008. This is of course nonsensical, because it has the heap and stack overlapping! I don't know how you're generating this memory map but it seems to bear little resemblance to what actually happens when the program is executed.The information about what `vec` \"points to\" is also very wrong. First of all, it doesn't correctly show that `vec` is a *structure*, not a simple pointer. (The internal details are implementation-dependent, but typically it would contain a pointer to an array, *plus* variables to store the array's capacity and how much of that capacity is used.) Secondly, it incorrectly says that the pointed-to value on the heap is \"leaked\", which is wrong; it gets freed by the `std::vector::~vector()` destructor when the vector goes out of scope.Also, the assignments to `foo` and `bar` are never executed by your tool, but their values are instead displayed as `nullptr`. This is bad because it incorrectly suggests to beginners that pointers are automatically initialized to null, instead of containing uninitialized garbage.",

You can also check out pygame, which is a python library for gamedev which teaches you a lot about development as you get to do a lot of the work yourself.Plenty of other courses out there online but these are some pretty good ones.",

If you want to get started with web dev, html, CSS and Js, maybe check out coddy, like the Duolingo of programming but it introduces new concepts in hands on ways that you can test and see why it works, some lessons are veryyyy basic so you can skip them but once it gets more complicated, it could become beneficial?.

These will be needed in different paths. Later on, if you are going by \"I want to hack stuff\" then you can look into web application development from a security perspective. OWASP and stuff like this.Oh, and you should learn networking as well. Not networking as socializing but networking as ISO/OSI model , network protocols. and everything related to it.Oh, and DO NOT try to hack stuff you have no permission to.

Look at your initial state, look at your goal state, make a plan about what you need to be able to do to get to your goal state, and then apply the tools in your toolbox to transform the initial state into a solution.If the answer to all of those is \"No\" then it isn't a programming problem. It is probably an attention span problem and a lack of mental endurance to work through a problem and think hard about it. I find having solutions always just an internet search away make this problem much worse - you train your brain to never think too hard about a problem because it always knows you'll find the solution and you won't have to work at it.Often it seems people think that they should be able to just look at a problem and instantly recall a solution, and if they can't it is too hard - without every putting serious mental work into solving it.Anyways, if you're in that boat you probably need to focus more on building your attention span and mental endurance first and foremost.

You can start now. Target companies that automatically give OAs, start-ups, and small local ones. It might help if you speak in person, reach out to them somehow, or curate quick projects related to them. Continue your learning as you dedicate that time. If you don't want to learn for free, attempt to build things that can generate revenue, freelance, get a contracting gig, make the jump to open source, or offer your services to spruce up small local company sites. Otherwise, get used to building for fun as your skills improve. Carpenters don't get better by simply working for cash. They build a lot of things. You're a builder/maintainer now. Target skills related to the job type you're looking for. You might want to search for \"essential skills for getting a fullstack job\" and see how you size up. What you suggested as a learning path isn't what I see hiring managers focus on. Your easiest path might be from actual connections, so don't be afraid of tech meetups and stuff. Be enthusiastic about what you build and learn instead of handing a resume and begging for a job.",

Yes, some interviews ask from you Leetcode problems but other than that, you won't need Leetcode in the real life.I'd say that have a decent portfolio with projects that either you, your family, your friends or somebody else is using in their daily life. That will give you an advantage. Yes, you having a degree is already a good sign. Not going to ignore that. Now, you are competing with other degree holders. And that is where you have to figure out how will you stand out.And Typescript is based on Javascript. When you are developing stuff with Typescript you are using Javascript. When you are writing stuff in Typescript then during the compilation process it compiles to a regular Javascript. You can't say that nobody is using Javascript.Now, should you stick to a MERN stack or you should pick something else? Decide it based on your local job market. Are the companies using Node.js? If most companies require Java or PHP then already your MERN stack starts falling apart. What about using Oracle instead of MongoDB? Or using Angular instead of React?

There are people who genuinely care about you doing well, and there are people who just want to tell someone what to do, under the disguise of \"I want to help you, but do it my way\". Seniors have great advice when it comes to protecting against risk, and many people in this thread are not wrong. But the biggest risk here is that you get so caught up in following other people's advice that you might lose interest if it doesn't work for you; worse you stop coding because you are trying to follow the advice of 100 people, and never end up developing the skills.The simple test you will have to do would be to see if you can create something without AI.

They do try, and they do insist that they do it well, but a lot of the time they hallucinate ways of writing code that have only been invented in later years.And when it comes to low level assembly they absolutely do more harm than good - I haven't seen a single example of working code, or even being able to explain assembly code delivered to them. Doesn't matter if it is for x86, ia64, arm, 6502, 680n0 or any other CPU, they simply don't understand that kind of code.I have had quite some succes with getting help for fairly advanced C programming with complicated pointers though - maybe because there are so many college-courses with hand in exercises on exactly that :D",

Even front desk staff can usually answer that without needing manager approval. If getting access to a real hotel is hard, some people survey multiple sources (small local hotels, internships, or even detailed hotel websites + booking flows) and document it as “observational survey data.” The key is showing your entities came from real processes, not whether the dataset is perfect. Your lecturer mainly wants to see that your schema reflects how a hotel actually operates, not a fantasy system. good luck brother",

Always have it \"working\".The alternative - what you should not do - is spend a long time writing code for different pieces of your system without putting them together. That will likely lead to huge gaps in knowledge and dead ends.So for example start by making your homepage. Then make it load items from a database. Then add an \"add to cart\" feature. Then add search. Then add a recommendation system but where the recommendation is pregenerated. Then make the recommendation smarter.And so on. Don't bite off too much at a time. Each new feature should only take a day or two.If it takes longer, stop and break it down into smaller pieces. If you can't make a shopping cart in a day or two, break it down. First make a shopping cart icon on your app. Then make it so that clicking Add to Cart increments the count. And so on.",

There are literally thousands of sub systems at larger places that need coordination at human scale.The pool of engineers who can navigate this tends to be limited to a smaller circle, since lots of folks can code a system from scratch but many companies don't have such a scale. I see a lot of folks who join into this type of scale and either leave or take a few years to \"get it\" then some more years to really be valuable contributor.",

DoD clearance, strong dev background, broad industry experience, I once had a year where 7 interviews led to 6 job offers.I've been applying for jobs for the last 12 months and have gotten zero callbacks. Not one. Every job I apply for has 100+ applicants in less than 24 hours. Even the ones at 40-50% of the average salary range, which I apply for just to see if they'll call back. Some of them stop accepting resumes, then reopen a month later because they didn't find a qualified candidate the first time. Then they get spammed again. Then reopen a month later.A friend of mine had a guy on his team (offshore) who never turned his camera on. Would be told in meetings turn your camera on, \"I can't figure out how, it doesn't work\". Sent a new laptop where they verified that the camera worked, wouldn't turn it on. 1:1's with the boss, no camera. They terminated him because his job with them was one of 6 jobs he was working at the same time.AI has broken the ability of companies to match talented people to roles, by filling the intake process with incomprehensible amounts of noise. I'm 27 YOE and have a huge network, the correct certs, a recent DoD clearance. I don't know how you just-starting-out guys do it with no network to rely on.Obviously this \\^\\^\\^ only applies to the jobs that are there, I think the industry is figuring out how many people they really need and what skillsets those people need so there may be less jobs available as well.

Harder to borrow + less revenue means they have to shrink their budget. Cutting headcount is always the easiest thing to do, even compared to making your infra spend more efficient. This has further effects as well to non-tech companies that also can't borrow money as easily. They'll do RIFs which also means fewer seats for SaaS products which is another way revenue drops.

I also messaged my outgoing manager and he said he gave me a strong (although maybe not exceptional) rating before he left, so it seemed weird that my new manager randomly chose me to put on focus. My new manager told me in our 1:1 that he had to choose someone to put in Focus or he would be the one getting rated poorly (lol).After I found out I was put on Focus, I really put in the effort to work hard and finish my project on time and deliver. This was back around 2023 when the market was very uncertain. For my new manager’s credit, he told me about halfway through my focus that he saw how hard I was working and he was pulling me out no matter what. “I’m telling leadership we need to take [my_name] out no matter what”. Our relationship was much better by then and we actually became pretty good friends after. He actually did yank me out of focus and I got strong ratings every time after that.So… no, focus is not a death sentence. Sometimes your manager’s hands are tied and you have to work with them. But it is definitely possible to make it out!",

There is no actual succeeding with a PIP anymore because its sole purpose is to build an airtight case to fire you for poor performance. Once it has gotten to PIP HR is already preparing your termination documents, you are essentially just being given notice you are about to be fired.The Focus plan is the actual warning to get better or you are getting fired. If you are given a PIP after Focus just consider yourself fired and dont bother doing any further work just start interviewing",

Those three together put you ahead of the majority of people complaining on this sub. Layoffs in this climate are also not frowned upon so I wouldn't worry about your 5 month stint too much.The market is not great but it's also q1 and nearing the beginning of some companies fiscal year so you're in a better spot now hiring wise than if this happened in November.That being said as someone (now 8-9 yoe) also in the nyc area that was laid off at the beginning of 2025 and in 2023 and had 3-5 offers each time in <3 months for solid comp (no prior faang or really big name experience), I would say your situation is definitely not insurmountable.If you need a little time for your mental health take it now, imo no longer than a week and I wouldn't travel or go on vacation unless it's to visit family. You don't want to distract yourself you want to decompress emotionally and let your new reality settle in, low stimulus time.Once you're ready to start hunting then you update your linkedin and get your resume together. Take your time but don't take too long, you can always update it more as you apply. Start sending out apps, I would aim for at least 50 a week. Personally I never did the tailor the resume per application and fuck that cover letter shit, but at the same time apply for places where you're a reasonable fit. Apply for startups, big tech, and everything in between. At this point you just want to pump the numbers, get your feet wet, and collect data.Track all your job apps in a spreadsheet listing out what platform you applied, what version of your resume you applied with (if you modify it), and if you were rejected or not. This will help you tailor your strategy and give you success rates to A/B test approaches against. I had about a 5-10% callback rate on cold apps and a 20% callback rate on recruiter DMs/inmail (moved past the screening round). This is a pretty solid ratio to have in today's climate.Also start connecting with a ton of tech recruiters and if you see a job with a good fit DM the recruiter directly with a short message, the job link, and your resume.Aim to spend half your day doing leetcode /system design and the other half on job apps. Always be interview ready and at the beginning take every interview you can get even if it's something you would never accept just to build your confidence.The big thing is to always rethink your approach and try tweaking different strategies to see what gets better results. It's a shitty position to be in but it's one that you can turn into a positive growth experience if you handle it well.Keep your head up and work hard! Also stay the fuck off of reddit, you do not need this negative shit filling up your head! Good luck!",

Apply to the MTA or other municipal agencies because they are actually hiring (somewhat), and its as far from the horrible dogshit startup culture as you can get.

When I brought up (nicely) some of these points and wrote them with my human brain and human thoughts (as he requested me to do), he replied with some generic GPT answer. It was clear it was GPT because I copied my comment into GPT with the prompt: \"Write a response to this\" and it spit out some of the exact same sentences and bizarre words. So yes, AI has affected my job in the sense that now I am a slop reviewer, and it is showing me who the braindead people are who rely on slop generators to get their work done. I shouldn't be surprised becuase he has only been a professional dev for a few years, so I'm sure he has leaned heavily on AI and probably lost the ability to think for himself.",

Not looking yet (if ever), started a startup with a friend and we'll try that, it's promising, but of course very uncertain. But we've got enough money to survive for years (or maybe even for good - FIRE would be very doable outside of the US and I do have EU citizenship). Wife who was stay at home mom went back to work after 5 years, she makes enough to pay bills, food, etc. I'm now the primary caregiver and shuttle my son to/from school, etc. and work of my startup. One idea - if you have some savings and are at least little bit business savvy (or willing to learn), buying a working physical business seems like a great option. US at least is extremely business friendly and if you buy the right business this can make you a very good living and if you are able to improve it/expand you may be able. to sell it in the future for a lot more as well. A friend who was in tech as well did just that with his wife and they are doing very, very well, I'm sure their incomes are several times of when they worked as well-paid professionals. Obviously, there is risk involved, and it's probably not for everyone, but it's potentially a viable way to make very good living.",

        "body": "Preface: I'm currently a remote SDE at Netflix, but I'm only one opinion, others might have different views obviously.First let me point out two facts:1. Getting a call != getting the job. You are getting the cart in front of the horse a bit, so I'd highly recommend you not get too excited. It is very hard to get an offer from Netflix, I've seen jobs stay open for 6+ months waiting for the perfect candidate to come through. Also, if anyone is ahead of you in the pipeline and they accept an offer, Netflix will immediately cancel all interviews with anyone currently in the hiring pipeline. I'm not telling you this to get you down, I've just seen too many folks surprised and disappointed by this.2. Lets be honest, if you get an offer you are going to take the job. It doesn't really matter what I say after this.To answer your actual questions:>What's the catch?There's no catch. Its a good company to work for, but the keeper test is a real thing. You need to do good work to stay employed. There are people who definitely coast, but that's not common.>Are remote workers more likely to get laid off or get plateaued on their salary growth compared to the ones who go to the office every day?No. I suppose if you were the type of person who wants to go from Engineering Manager to Senior Director or something I'm betting it's a journey only to be successfully traveled with a lot of in-office ass kissing.>How’s the pay growth like in general on the base salary every year as there’s no bonus?I would say to get the idea of \"pay growth\" out of your mind. First of all, based on you saying you were at a financial company, I'm guessing that your pay will probably double when coming to Netflix. Given that, if it doesn't grow from there, would that be terrible? Netflix has terms/acronyms for how they do or don't increase pay, I won't bother spelling them all out. The TL;DR is if pay in the industry goes up across the board, then Netflix pay will go up. If it doesn't go up or it goes down (like it has for the past 3 years), Netflix pay will stay the same. You will never get a pay cut at least, but you also won't get a pay raise. In the 2018-2021 timeline people were getting huge raises each year. For the past 3 years, pay has been flat.>How well do they honor the unlimited paid time off policy? How many vacation days do y’all take every year?They honor it. I don't take a lot of time off, but that's a personal choice, but there are people on my team taking 30 days off per year easily. We don't really keep track honestly, there's no place to click some button to take time off. I just tell my manager my plans and then set my self as out-of-office on my google calendar and slack and that's about it.>How’s the parental leave policy and do they honor it wellAFAIK they do. There was someone in my greater org gone for nearly a year after their baby was born.>What do you think about the health insurance they offer?It's fine, pretty standard. The HSA plan is usually the clear winner.>Are there any signs of remote roles becoming fully in-person anytime soon?No, not at all. My org is almost entirely remote. The only rumor I've heard was from the Ads org requiring in-office, but that team is almost all ex-Meta and ex-Amazon, so who knows what those nerds are up to.",

It seems to be like they don’t want to invest in engineers learning the tech stack, they want them to hit the ground running.Also, leetcode is still a big part of the process.

He corrected some misconceptions that I had and explained that their primary business model was to compete with banks. Banks are also pretty predatory to their low-income customers, but that's a couple steps above things like predatory payday and title loans. The meeting convinced me that the company's business was above my own personal ethical line. I ended up working there almost a decade.I now work for a fintech that facilitates money movement for the customers of our clients. Most of the payments that we facilitate have very high fees, but our clients are crypto companies and legal gambling. I consider their customers' desire to transfer money into and out of those accounts to be discretionary spending, and the customers of those companies choose to pay the high fees for very quick transfer of funds. So, I that also falls above my personal ethical line.",

I believe it was a type of alopecia.Fast forward to this year, her work life has been particularly stressful again and some bald spots have been popping up. Currently going back to the dermatologist, but the injections aren't working as well so she started on some medicine by mouth.I'd say first see a dermatologist, and then work with a therapist and your manager to figure out why work has been so stressful. Dermatologist first though, so you can remove one point of stress",

Costs too much. They want someone good enough to grind hard without pay, and not ask questions.TLDR; the software market is declining hard (from interest rates and incompetent corporate leadership) and you might have to wait til 2027 when all this schizophrenic AI hype implodes for good.

It could be a number of things, but from what I've heard from some people who burnt out and similar to you, they just slowly stopped caring anymore. It's usually 1 of 2 things, either you had clear goals in life and are finding yourself not getting closer to them, or you were constantly under some ethereal pressure to always deliver and been told what you were doing mattered -- but it really didn't.In the first case, it usually manifests in the form of a midlife crisis i.e. realizing you're not where you want to be and your life's almost over, which you sound young enough and are on a decent trajectory (gf + social circle/gym) to not be applicable to.The second case is clear overworking, I'm talking like 70-100 hours a week for years which doesn't seem like your case.Then lastly, there's also a sort of mix of the two in high-achieving younger folk I've noticed in recent years. Those who were mostly successful in life and then landed great gigs out of uni, constantly being told they're delivering mission critical things and are a part of something bigger. After a few years, you start to realize, if you took some PTO, missed some deliverables or just straight stopped working for more than 1 hour a day like yourself, nothing really bad happens. Work moves on, your company and coworkers move on, and really nothing you do is that critical to the business. For most, this is OK, but if you made it a part of your personality for the past 5-20 years of your life, then it could cause this divergence/burnout you're experiencing.Personally speaking, I was never really an early overachiever but knew a few in the Bay Area who skyrocketed their schooling/careers really fast and burnt out hard. I don't really have advice but it seemed like those who went through it had to soul search for a long time to get out of it (some became NEETs or worked in unrelated jobs for a few years), or just switched and coasted at a smaller company until they shifted their perspective or found something they cared about.",

Consider discussing your responsibilities, expectations, or a potential transfer to a less demanding team with your manager. Prioritize the preservation of your energy, not solely your time. Additionally, therapy can be highly beneficial in addressing this type of burnout.It is perfectly acceptable to desire a less demanding lifestyle.

The \"complexity\" is often infrastructure and ops stuff that's abstracted away by cloud services anyway. So you get devs whose work is \"write SQL query, wrap in endpoint, return JSON\"Meanwhile, frontend is dealing with:* An execution environment you don't control (browsers, devices, network conditions)* User unpredictability* State management that rivals distributed systems in complexity* Performance optimization with hard real-time requirements* i18n, responsive design, etc* The absolute chaos of the JS ecosystemBut sure, the guy writing `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?` and wrapping it in Express is the \"real engineer.\"",

Anyone who says the job market is fine is smoking something, but there are still some companies hiring, and I'd wager that new year new budgets new headcount is a thing.Where I've seen hiring is in the startup world. Big companies are all up their own ass about AI this and that, but the startup world still needs actual people.I'd say the same is true for some defense companies because their pockets are typically so deep that they will still hire people to build stuff.As for answers to your questions, I don't have any specifics, sorry. As for projects, I've put together some projects that had practical use and would be worth talking about. One idea was a file conversion script that could take medical imaging files (from ultrasounds, MRI, CT scans, etc.) and convert them into something actually usable by a normal person like a jpg/png. That took some thinking, but it's a good learning experience. Motivation for this one was personal experience in how godawful most of those systems are and how inconvenient it is for you, the patient, to see your own images.Another idea, albeit small, was to implement some of the common file compression algorithms and essentially make my own version of WinZip. There are a few \"easy\" ways to do it, but there are some way fancier methods out there that I found worth exploring.",

Maybe build something that showcases streaming data processing with Pub/Sub and Dataflow - like a real-time analytics dashboard for crypto prices or weather data, something you can demo live during interviews. 8-12 weeks is tight but doable if you split time between leetcode (maybe 30%), system design focused on data pipelines (40%), and building that one solid project (30%).

Doing some tinkering with AWS and getting familiar with their primitives would probably be one of the most impactful things you can do to increase your value in the job market, since it'll naturally open you up to lots more companies/stacks.Some thoughts inline for your other questions:> If you took a break or had a gap, what helped you come back and get hired?Get your story straight. Ideally, both your internal story (for yourself, what you wanted out of it, what you ended up getting) as well as your public story.But if you can only do one, get the public story *concise* and have the elevator pitch ready to deliver when the inevitable question comes up in the interview. You want 1-2 polished sentences about why you took the time off, what you accomplished, and how you're thinking about your return to full-time work.Practice telling the story, over and over, until it sounds natural.> Should I focus on DE roles again or pivot to backend/SWE?Remember that you also need to like the job you end up getting. ;) It's okay to focus, especially initially.If you do end up going for general backend/SWE roles, make sure to have different version(s) of your resume for those roles.> What’s a realistic plan for the next 8–12 weeks that actually improves interview outcomes?One underrated tool is mock interviews. Hire paid, experienced mock interviewers that actually have work and interview experience at the kinds of companies you want to join.Schedule at least one mock interview every couple weeks. That way, you're getting *real* feedback every couple weeks with specific guidance on what to work on.For me, right before my real interview, I also then loaded up one last wave of mock interviews to get in a bunch more practice.It gets expensive, but you should be able to make back everything (and more) with your signing bonus.> What do recruiters/hiring managers in India care about most when they see a 6 month gap?Oops... my advice is from experience in the US. Adjust accordingly. :)> Any suggestions for 1–2 “resume-worthy” projects that are actually useful (not a toy) and can be finished quickly?Paying for a training or a course certificate *from an actual credible source* can be a nice bullet point. It shows you're willing to invest in yourself, literally, and it shows you can learn on your own.Good luck! And don't beat yourself up about taking a break. It's *very* common. Professional athletes prioritize their rest days and rest weeks. It's totally okay for you to take care of yourself and prioritize rest in the same way.",

I made a bad choice.I remember being alone in my apartment after college missing the chaos of my roommates and crying because I was so bored and lonely and nothing felt right. The girl I loved was still in school and she cheated one me, I had a lot of decision paralysis on what I could even do on my free time. Nothing felt good.So I researched \"Best cities to live in your 20s\" (this was 2015 mind you) and Denver popped up. I love outdoor activites, and wanted a city center where I could make friends. I wanted a fresh start. Most importantly, I did have an uncle who lived in a suburb there, and 1 single friend I could hangout with. It wasn't much, but it was enough of a safety net for me to take the leap.I changed my linkedin and resume address to say Denver.I got picked up by a recruiter, and they flew me out to a job in Denver for an interview. The culture was warm and chill, in a cool place, laid back, not overly corporate. It had plenty of other fresh grads, I could hangout with them. Beers in the fridge. End at 3:30 on friday and have some beers with my coworkers on other teams. I took a pay hit. Man I miss those days of pre-covid.Office cultures vary dramatically from office to office. Sounds like you have a shitty one.And it was so chill I'm still there today, even though I did switch teams. I also found my wife in this city.Everyone has different needs. Hopefully my story helps.Sadly it's a lot harder to land new jobs than it was in 2015. I'm currently shocked by this. But maybe you can investigate a similar approach that I took.EDITED a bit to add more context",

At this point in your journey the most valuable thing to you is experience on a resume. If you can work on personal projects, building stuff for friends and family, that’s clutch. But almost as important is applying to anywhere and everywhere. Take a look at Glassdoor to find places that pay low wages (reviews will mention this), are constantly hiring (because people leave), and work there long enough to find your next job. That worked for me 8 years ago when I entered the industry. First job was as a Web Designer, making 43k, less than my wife earned working at a Church in the DC area. 8 years later, I’m making almost 4x that amount.",

For example, they could have been a Data Analyst that took on more software engineering adjacent responsibilities in their role. I've seen Product Managers and Business Analysts do similar things. In short, they took on responsibilities in their current role that reduced the gap between their work and software engineering.They also tried to switch in their own company as the goodwill of already working there and knowing people, processes, and the business can offset some of the lack of Software Engineering fundamentals.",

However, I was barely ready to be a junior engineer. 2015 was wild. Don't get me wrong, I had the curiosity, decent academic signalling, and could program math, but I was hired on potential. 10 years later I'd like to think I proved that out, but it was a totally different scene.These days, instead of looking for people with academic experience to find curious and smart people, you might get a similar caliber candidate from a CS program with enough fundamentals to get them to Senior with the right experience.. Maybe not with the same upside as someone who willingly walks away from a PhD program, but good enough to do what you need them to.",

It ended up being over a year - late-2021 to the end of 2022.Going into that hiatus I had no idea how long I'd stay jobless, and really it was more luck and timing that brought me back to the field more than anything else.> And how did you spend that time?Some of the bigger stuff...* Getting much more into cooking - I stopped dining out as much (somewhat for financial reasons, but also health reasons), and started focusing a lot more on actually cooking most of my food, and learning how to make a lot of different things* Started running - The pandemic and transition to WFH really did a number on me, health-wise. During my year off I ran nearly every day - I ran about 2000 miles in 2022. This is one of the lifestyle changes that really stuck with me even after returning to work.* Some trips - went camping, went on a few domestic and international trips* Seriously learn Japanese - I had been learning Japanese off and on for years, but toward the end of my hiatus I lived a few months in Tokyo and attended a Japanese language school. Massively improved my skills.* A lot of reading - normal literature, not tech/business books.* Getting _more_ cats - Through an unexpected confluence of events, I adopted a third cat.I basically did not touch a computer for the entire time I was off. I did do some light coding on some open source projects, and built a tiny service for a friend's workplace, but I'd say ~95% of the hiatus my computer stayed closed.> Did the time off change your definition of success, or your relationship with work?Not really. It instead changed my relationship with my finances.> Would you say it was worth it?In hindsight, yes. I really enjoyed my time off, though the biggest things I had to face were...* Actually needing to dip into money rather than have an income - My entire year-plus was funded by savings and dipping into investments. For reference, I'm married and at the time I left my job, I made 25x what my wife made (she was launching a business). I had no plan for any of this, the mental hump was huge after an entire career of never having to touch savings or investments.* Health insurance is fucking expensive - I live in a decent state when it comes to healthcare and insurance, and I had to buy marketplace insurance for the entire time I was unemployed. $1200/month for two people, for a medium-level plan. This, after spending years of paying $0 to a pittance for top-tier insurance from any employer I had.* Having a lot of unstructured time - the first couple weeks were almost surreal, waking up and having literally nothing to do.* Getting back into a \"I should probably work again\" mindset - I could have gone on for longer, though by the 12-month mark I was like \"yeahhh, I think my tech ennui has passed.\"But in terms of just having all that time to myself and thinking about how it got me to where I am today, yeah, worth it.",

He basically travels a lot during those years and got to work on a few projects/hobbies he always wanted. He said while those times were enjoyable, having essentially end date looming really dampened things. Savings going down, bad job market, AI boom, and grueling interview process was weighing heavily on him in the second year so much so that he became a bit depressed towards the end. It took him closer to a year to find a job and get back to work and by then he has begun to dip into his retirement and moved back to his parents for a short stint. Nowadays, he seems to be doing a bit better but since the job is essentially the same he’s afraid of getting burnt out again sooner this time. Its getting to a point that hes thinking about switching career.Overall your mileage may varies as I have also heard of more positive case but one thing he did stress to keep in mind is that unless you gain some clarity or switch career you will most likely be getting back to the same type of job that burn you out in the first place.",

New Customers tell us what they use currently, And what they want from our software. Sometimes we already have a solution and I can change designs on the fly to meet their expectations or even create new dashboards while with them. But most of the time I specify new features with them. Then I also have to estimate how long it would take and cost. Back home we then create tickets. Plan them, put them in a sprint. Develop it, test it. If everything works out. I will call the customer again. And ask when they want to update. And if they need training on site. For the first 10 years I did this alone. Since we had only 4 developers in total (company was rather small with ~20 people)Since the company got bigger, we are now our own small team. 2 developers (including me). 1 sale. 3 consultants. While we all work in our corresponding department with others. We 6 have separate meetings where just the 6 of us plan customer requests, bugs new dashboard layouts or trainings for internal and external users. That whole experience changed the way I develop, since I do learn a lot how our customers actually use the product. And what is important to them. Most of them just want to see red or green numbers. They don't really care about how fast the filter is in the background. As long as it works and isn't \"slow\" they accept it.",

I might've had a task like \"make bulk purchase orders from sales orders\" or something like that, and before I could even *begin* to think about creating a button to automate that, I'd be thinking \"what was a purchase order again? Who receives that and who gives that? Does that go from vendor to company? Or company to customer? What's the significance of this in the business process?\"The loops, conditional statements, SQL and variable fields were the easier parts of the job. But understanding why I'm doing what I'm doing was hard, and it made completing a task a much more monumental task than for the average business-knowledgeable person. And part of the job was scoping business requirements of clients, and providing advice for how to improve how they do things to have better utilization of the software product. :skull: So you can imagine how tough that was, when I have a surface-level \"i just Googled this term\" knowledge base. I remember my manager training me on how to set up a customer portal or a web form and in my head I'm thinking \"what are these? What is the point of these?\" My manager wouldn't cover that preliminary background knowledge, but would be covering how to implement it. I'd be too afraid to ask \"why?\" directly because I didn't want my manager to think negatively of me. I'd try to broach the topic by dancing around it with tangential questions, but I think my manager picked up on it and gave me feedback that I was asking too many common sense questions. :crying_face:>I've been an engineer for over 10 years from minimum wage at start-ups to $400k at big tech. I don't know what those things are either. Oh wow, so I guess it isn't necessary as a software engineer? My mom has been telling me to avoid client-facing jobs and do software jobs that are just me talking with people *within* the company. Maybe that's the move for me... but maybe one day I'd like to try being in a client-facing technical role (like Solutions Engineer) one day. Out of curiosity have you worked for a company that was in a business-related industry? Like Stripe, Paypal, Shopify, Salesforce etc? Does it hold you back there? I thought you'd need to know more about the business concepts to create new features or product changes for those kinds of companies.",

I was getting ready to switch careers a few years ago and then decided not to after the market turned for the worst. I still lurk this sub sometimes in case things change.Right now my teaching career is actually peak. I’m so experienced that nothing phases me anymore. I know my curriculum like the back of my hand. I don’t even need to plan anymore and can just walk into the classroom with nothing but a topic I’m supposed to teach and I can instantly deliver an engaging lecture on it. I have a huge arsenal of assignments that I can use to match my lessons. Most of the assignments are auto graded and my workflow allows me to not take any grading home at all. The kids are good, never give me any trouble, and generally speak highly of my class. I make 115k doing roughly 1300 hours a year and will get a fat pension when I’m done so I don’t have to really save for retirement at all.HOWEVER.The first 7 years were absolutely brutal. That’s the period of every teacher’s career regardless of how smart or talented you are that you just have to grind out 9-10 hour work days 6 days a week during the school year just to keep your head above water. There’s no way to avoid it. Nobody tells you what to do, which is a good thing until it isn’t. Your main motivator to actually work this hard is that if you don’t actually deliver a good lesson, your classroom management goes to shit. No matter how good the kids are, if you start disengaging them or showing up unprepared, kids will eat you alive. They lose respect for you very quickly so you’re putting in the hellish hours just to make sure that you’ve timed everything out to perfection and that every moment is interesting (don’t forget your competing with TikTok brains these days).Oh and you likely won’t be able to teach all AP CS or whatever you’re interested in. You’ll likely have to teach 2 or 3 separate courses over the 5 classes you’re given, which means you double/triple the amount of planning you need to do for no extra pay.It’s an absolutely exhausting job that turns into a still exhausting but easy job after you’ve put in the first few years of hell.",

I think that gives a slightly misleading impression ie developing iOS itself vs developing iOS apps. Secondly, like those skills feel nothing-y to me. How is a language a skill, then you list all the rest of it and I can’t tell if you’ve just copied a list of buzzwords online. How skilled are you at using any of that? What’s your level of exposure and proficiency in all of that? finally, it’s best practice where I am to put your most recent job first then old jobs afterwards. So you’re supposed to lead with your most current experience which should obviously be your strongest experience ie they can see a sense of progression from where you are now vs before. Instead I’m not seeing any progression on your CV, you’ve actually added more bullets on your oldest job than your newest job? That makes me think your newest job is a downgrade as you’re not working on things worth writing about. Plus you’re listing a bunch of tasks but I can’t see where you added value or what you did well or anything that makes you better than another candidate. Even in your education you’ve given no context as to what you actually studied- not all degree programs cover the same content. What did u study that specifically is relevant to the job? Highlight that.",

You should think of college as your part time job and what you do outside of it as your main job to really bolster your chances to get a job once you graduate.If it sounds like a lot it's because it is, but it's a lot easier than being unemployed for 2+ years after graduating which is what's starting to become standard.

It’s definitely harder than getting a regular job but honestly just requires a lot of preparation. The more experience you have the easier it becomes as well.My current company only really hires interns and new grads from top 10 schools, and in the case of new grads you need 1+ FAANG or similar internship as well.For intermediates and seniors though, we hire anyone who we think is experienced enough and can pass our interview.My advice to you is spend the next 3-4 years excelling at your current job as much as you possibly can, and take on as much responsibility and difficult projects as you can.When you’re ready to hop, spend about 4-6 months slowly preparing for interviews. I did 1 hour of leetcode per workday and 8 hours of system design and behavioural prep on the weekends for about 4-6 months and was able to get multiple offers.",

From what I've seen, there's a good number of senior level people from the linkedins and instacarts of the world applying for those roles, so that's your competition.Ideally, you'll have gone through at least one project end-to-end (from design to maintenance) to be able to speak about it coherently, and there's specific interview structure formulas that you'd normally want to practice.If you're planning to boomerang, then you don't necessarily need to target the high end jobs in SF, a lot of regular roles in US pay more just from currency exchange, but also not all of them are necessarily open to dealing w/ the legalities of TN visa expiration.",

As for the interview specific purpose, the problem with a monolith is you can draw a single box and say it does everything you need, so it won't highlight your ability to break down complex domains, create reusable functionality, or address scaling concerns. If the use case justifies a monolithic architecture, I would focus on the inner modules and the boundaries/interactions between them.",

If you're in an environment without pre-established best practices, you may have to be the one to bring-your-own-best-practices.As far as a masters vs resume scanning goes, people typically only scan the recent work experience section because a) nobody's going to be able to guess what the contents of your masters were from looking at a typical resume, b) even if you did list your course load, I'd much rather spend my limited resume scanning time reading about actual work experience (not to mention, it looks amateurish to list course loads).\"Free\" is nice, but isn't really free, given that it presumably takes a time commitment, and may or may not be overly stressful, considering the ROI (or lack thereof) for job search prospects I mentioned above.",

I bartended previously, and tripled my income when I accepted my first job. fwiw I graduated in 2022 when the job market was more favorable - it still wasn't easy back then, and it is *much* more competitive now and it is actually very hard to enter the industry.That said, there is opportunity in this field, but you should know that it is extremely competitive and difficult to enter, and the work can be very demanding. When job hunting for my first role, being a mid-life career changer played to my advantage because I was up against 22 year olds with no attention span and no adult workforce experience, so I was an easy choice against them. Being in school was actually fun, I made great relationships with my professors. But the job itself? Not at all what I expected it to be. I love computers and I love building things, I like writing code and I like problem solving, I taught myself PHP when I was in high school and I got a 4.0 when I got my CS degree. The reality? This job is mostly meetings and paperwork and politics and all of that corporate doldrum, paired with high expectations for intellectual output from deep task work that you are expected to somehow find time for between all those meetings (or do at home after hours). You know that feeling when you were in school and it was exam day and your brain felt like jelly at the end? I arrive home every day feeling like that. This is only my experience, and I am only 4 years in at this point and this is anecdotal, but honestly I am actually considering switching careers again. Others surely have had better experiences. But for me- the job is insanely stressful, the constant pressure to meet a perpetually raising bar and always learn new things, the horrendous demoralizing job search process, the on-call expectations and non-existent work life balance boundaries, the corporate politics hunger games, the cognitive dissonance of contributing to immoral corporations, the inability to escape AI, the constant anxiety of pip or layoff and the stack-ranking... the list goes on. My financial life has improved considerably, but my health in literally every other way has gotten considerably worse. I would love to take a more relaxed lower-paying job, but can't find one. I know that people love to say that engineers don't know how good they have it unless they've done manual labor or been in other industries, and I do think that is true in many ways. The money is insane if you can land a job at big tech and can be life changing, and it is true that many engineers seem to have no clue that they are rich and that this salary is not normal. But also, I was a service industry worker for over a decade, so I have perspective on being at a low income person and, well, I actually think I was healthier and happier and had it better back then. This is not sustainable but I feel like I cant leave because I don't think I'll have opportunity to make this kind of money again. I look around and most people at the office don't seem happy, they all seem stressed out.",

Remote work also means you're competing with the entire country or world.People who are only in it for the money, or very average, are going to have a hard time finding work even if they have experience or a CS degree.If you really enjoy technology, have a knack for computers, and like building things, then it might still be worth a shot.

There's SO little in this niche to compare to. I've talked to another founder that had been in business for two years with 32% churn, but they also had a free trial AND they're dying now so IDK lol.Most churners give price or lack of features as the reason. My pricing is pretty standard compared to the closest popular equivalent services and may even be a little low (multiple MBAs have suggested charging more) so I'm guessing the best play is just to hammer out more features.I feel great about the numbers but at the same time there's a lot of signals that would traditionally be red flags, but may not necessarily be for this endeavor specifically.

Worth checking out since you're already in spam mode anyway but need better targeting and customization. Beyond tools tho, get someone to review your resume.No-name school doesn't matter as much as you think if your projects are solid and your resume isn't getting filtered out by ATS for dumb formatting reasons.

And in your spare time, keep applying and keep interviewing. Once you have an offer in hand, then you can start weighing your options. Especially right now with the market being as volatile as it is. You might find a new job next week. You also might not find one until July. When you actually find a new job, you’ll have a clearer picture about how things are progressing in your current role. Plus you’ll have a better idea of your TC, so you can weigh it against what you’re currently making. Step 1 is finding the other option, step 2 is weighing them. You can’t skip steps",

On the one hand, failed side hustles are all too common, but on the other hand, compound interest eventually becomes a runaway train in terms of effort-to-reward ratios.If you're looking to scratch the hustler lifestyle itch, then sure, keep at something until income grows to some ramen profitable range and beyond, that takes time and commitment through possibly years worth of rough patches.Time is the one thing that you can spend that you will never get back.

Average in Serbia is like 1k a year so I'm not that ahead but still you can buy things without worrying about the price. And I agree what you said with the guys faking success, the thing with these guys I'm thinking of they're relatively small with private insta accounts (< 1-2k followers) and I can see them reposting reels that say like \"I say we 'only' made $600 today but then I remember that's a doctors salary\" and stuff like that, posting nice cars, their results (one of them does design, other has a clothing brand), etc. It just pisses me off and makes me realize it's definitely possible, that's where I'm trying to get. Thanks for the comment though, greatly appreciated!",
