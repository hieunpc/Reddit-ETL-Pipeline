If nothing broke you would still be doing work but it shifts to boring preventative stuff. Data contracts. Upstream alignment. Cost control. Schema evolution. Access rules. Quality checks before anyone screams. That work is harder to explain to managers so it gets undervalued. Mature teams stop celebrating hero fixes and start measuring how quiet things are. Some teams make that visible with domo dashboards. Others track it through snowflake usage or monte carlo alerts. Same idea. Prevention not firefighting.",

It will definitely take some dedicated time, but at your scale would also be insane to have a full time engineer manage.I second one of the other comments suggesting some managed service. Even sns+sqs.I think Kafka could be fine, but it sounds like you're not confident in your orgs infrastructure capabilities.Edit: followup thought after re-reading the post. Maybe a simple always on RPC service is a better fit here. Extremely simple, totally reasonable for thousands of requests per day. Sprinkle some request retry policy in there and you have a highly reliable system.",

        "body": "I choose for Data Engineering pretty early in my career and I'm very happy I did so.When you're a Data Scientist, one of your key goals is to extract meaning from data. You run models and try to get insights. It is very often the case though that the data either doesn't show what you would like, or it kind of does, but with pretty low certainty. Even more often the data is so bad that you couldn't really draw any conclusions from it.This puts you in a bind. You have to go explain your conclusions to the sales guys and they can't work with 'it sort of shows X, but also kind of Y'. They need to sell a product and they will. So they'll massage your conclusions in ways that you might even not agree with. Or you'll be pressured to massage the data, which I've been asked to do. I always covered my ass with emails although I luckily never needed them.As a Data Engineer on the other hand, there is no discussion. Either the data is in the required spot in the required form or it isn't. At the end of the day, your product is finished and whether or not someone can actually do anything with it downstream is not your concern. It's a very liberating feeling and it means I have barely any stress related to work.I'm not the only person I've encountered who feels similarly and I've even met a few Data Scientists who made a similar switch later in their career for similar reasons.Another saving grace is that Data Scientists are a dime in a dozen nowadays. With the AI boom everyone and their cat tried to get some certification somewhere and the quality varies wildly. Data engineering isn't as sexy and there's much fewer people in the field I have the impression. I started before the AI boom, so having seniority at this point in time is very helpful as well.",

I naturally gravitated towards technical specifications and engineering solutions. I was interested in maths, but having done some statistics courses, it wasn’t a mountain I wanted to climb.Personally I wouldn’t over think it. People swap between DS and DE all the time. A large company will probably help you transition, pay for training etc because they know there is a great deal of synergy between these teams. ie. DE’s will productionise DS models so knowing both sides isn’t a waste of time.Where I currently work, DS is seen as a ‘luxury’. They will increase headcount when times are good, and conversely, DS’s are the first people out the door when times are bad. This is because they generally work on ‘optimisations’, I guess just like how you would pause remodelling your house if you lost your job and didn’t have income coming in. DE on the other hand is much more stable. They need people to keep existing pipelines running, even if new things aren’t being built. It was how I ended up in DE, I was made redundant as a DS but told I could stay on if I switched teams. I thought I’d do this while I searched for a new DS position, but I found my proclivities more suited to DE, so never left and never thought about switching back.Generally the people who make the best DE’s have done Computer Science or Engineering degrees that involve data transfers like Telecoms. The people who make the best DS’s have done Science or Mathematics degrees. Maybe start out in the field where your degree gives you the best foundations? Otherwise it will be an uphill struggle to get timely promotions. Make a start and see how you go.",

Lot of A/B tests to see what works and what does not. Something could sound efficient on paper but not as much in business. Experimentation is important in data science.- Less focus on infrastructure as a data scientist. ML ops or data ops takes care of it most times.- Accuracy is important in data engineering. Data needs to be ingested and modelled accurately otherwise the data is doubted. Data quality and data sanity are important.

It's open source so I can still keep using it.But because it's arguably a dead end platform (until we see real evidence otherwise, which will take a year or two of observation), nobody will want to learn it, and so it will be difficult to ever hand off to a successor. I imagine whoever it is would probably want to rewrite it in something else with a more definitive future. Maybe dbt (I don't have any experience in it so don't know how much work that is). Maybe Fabric, but Fabric was not baked when I started earlier this year, and still seems to have major issues and is tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars expensive versus zero dollars in a random VM. So I don't totally regret it. I made the best decision I could at the time and filled a business need. Still, if I knew, I'd probably have gone in another direction. I just don't know how.",

I’m assuming by mid-level you mean a title like senior data engineer in my response.This is the arguably the hardest point in your career to progress. As many point out you can go IC or PL route. PL route tends to make a higher bonus but you can still make very good money as IC so both are viable paths. I know many engineers who have stayed at the level you are at their entire career. Only a few percent move up from here. This is because a new set of skills are required. You are no longer just coding 8 hours per day. This looks different depending on the company size but these roles are responsible for architecting solutions and leading others in the solution implementation. I do both in my role on a smaller team but often these are split into a Principal Architect and a Manager role.So to move into these roles you need to demonstrate you can architect solutions and lead others via your work experience. Unfortunately almost no one will tell you that simply doing great work in your role doesn’t make you eligible for a promotion to the next one. Unless you demonstrate the skills required for the next level you will not even be viewed as a viable candidate by others. In practice this usually looks like partnering with business stakeholders to define a problem or need, designing a solution that addresses that problem or need, and organizing a team of engineers to deliver this solution. As a manager I could complete all the work which I delegate myself but instead I focus on turning business requirements into tasks, delegating those tasks to our engineers, and filling knowledge gaps so the engineers can complete the work.I could keep going here but I think I’ve made the main point. You must proactively make the choice to stop spending 100% of your time implementing and spend some of it addressing these other requirements. Then you will get noticed for promotions or for external job openings.",

I'm also a humanities graduate who did the same pivot about 6 years ago.The major problem really is having zero reliability on upstream data which makes all analytics really difficult to do well. And cultural transformation is as important as technical in that scenario so you need to ask yourself if that's something you're willing to engage in - personally I feel the payoff is too uncertain versus the effort. On the generalist vs specialist question: you could stay a generalist if you want to go down one of 2 paths: 1) moving into management as quickly as possible or 2) carving out a niche as the 'first data hire'. In the second case, companies with no data team want a full stack data engineer / analyst / scientist who can do a bit of everything without investing in a whole team.If neither of those appeal, I would figure out what you enjoy most and focus on that. At least that's what I'm doing at my current place:1) building pipelines to move data around - focus on data engineering2) transforming data into usable, analytics ready data sets - analytics engineering3) speaking to stakeholders, answering business questions and building end user visualisation and analysis - data analyst4) building statistical / predictive models - data scientist6) strategy, leadership, management - project management, productI'm figuring out what I like most about the job, focusing efforts for the next 6 months on building stuff for that role specifically. Then I'm job hunting. This can be quite difficult given the demands of your firm might not align with what you want to do - e.g. if you want to be a data engineer and learn how to set up airflow on AWS but you've already got a vaguely usable set up using different tech, saying 'I want to learn this' might not cut it as a business case. You might have to figure out a way to be creative with the truth to get your way in that scenario, but honestly that's where your humanities background kicks in lol.So my personal take with these kinds of roles is that they rarely make sense long term. Use it to get the experience you want and feel you need and then move on to something else.You mentioned you like the architecture and design piece of the job - that's a good starting point and probably puts you more in the data engineering camp of the 6 roles above. Unfortunately 'architect' roles tend to be quite senior and you need to have some grunt work under your belt before unlocking those, but I imagine data engineering is the right place for that.Your tech stack is already a great starting point and tbh a good team will see python and SQL experience as enough - anything else is just learning tooling and reading the docs. I also think hiring someone who has stood up a serviceable stack on a shoestring budget with some creativity should be a more interesting profile than someone who just sets up Fivetran and Snowflake and calls it a day. But it might be worth just thinking through a simple pipeline and making sure you can talk credibly about all components of it - e.g. an orchestrator like airflow, a warehouse like BQ or Snowflake, etc. I think a good resource could be something like the Zoomcamp data engineering course - you could take a look at their materials and see if you can implement some of it at work.",

I'd say that's true of pretty much any role that's not the 'prototypical' FAANG data engineering role. It sounds to me like you're doing quite a good job given the situation. > Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?This is just my opinion, and there are many opinions on this topic. I personally have always leaned a bit more toward being a generalist, and it has served me well. I also pivoted from a humanities background (linguistics), and whether this is true or not, I've internalized that I'm never going to be the whiz kid of hard coding skills and deep mathematical and algorithmic knowledge. I do think a humanities background tends to help with communication, asking questions, and defining a problem, especially compared to many of the pure CS grads I've worked with. On some level the tools don't *really* matter too much, you're solving a similar set of problems and you'll have to use whatever tools the company you work for has available. I lean on my ability to learn when I've had to pick up new tools, workflows, and programming languages - so far so good.Obviously it's good to have a few areas where you build deep expertise, but I think this happens as a matter of course for most people anyway. I think there's probably some trade off where deeply specializing early on can net you higher pay sooner, with a somewhat higher risk of getting really good at something that doesn't exist in a few years. All of that being said, we're really talking about two extreme ends of a spectrum. Most people are going to end up de facto specialists in little sub niches over the course of a career, even if they are relative generalists in data tech.",

Humanities to Data is a tough jump, but your ideation mindset is exactly what's missing in people who only know how to code.In the market, you're basically a Founding Data Engineer or a One-person Data Team. You’re doing the heavy lifting—cleaning up the Excel Wild West and acting as a Data Janitor to make sure the business doesn't collapse under its own messy data.My advice? Don't worry about choosing a lane just yet. Being a generalist in a zero data culture environment is a superpower. However, stop the band-aid fixes as soon as you can. If you want to scale, look into dbt first. It’ll help you turn those fragmented Python scripts into a SSOT. You're building the foundation of a skyscraper; make sure the cement is solid.",

Current setup might be unsustainable for you long term, you sound very hard working person that’s able to make things happen quickly. Might also have the unfortunate negative impact of “that one person is enough”.Anyways just my thoughts working in the same field and seeing how internal advertising can do :) best of luck!",

Edit: This is maybe a useless or incorrect comment; I honestly don't know what a recruiter or hiring manager would stop and look at more when faced with a stack of CVs/resumes...I've been in a similar space for the 7 years I've been in a data-focused role - my team has been a team of 2 ICs the entire time. We have a business-oriented manager now. For a little while we had a data architect. But, in a lot of ways it has been me wearing hats for platform admin/architect/engineer/modeller/analyst/visualiser. For a bit over a year I've been titled Lead Data Engineer.It's absolutely tough being at the end of the chain as some sort of generalist mid-to-senior. Apart from the year or so I worked with the architect who'd been around a while, I've had to learn a lot on my own, and from the internet, and from paid-for consultants.Whether you want to generalise or specialise depends on your goals, I think. I like the variety of experience and work that can come from being a generalist. I think I am just that way inclined, though, jack-of-all-trades kind of thing. But, in my career, I don't think I've been a proper specialist, so :man_shrugging: Another way to look at it is breadth rather than depth of expertise. On this point, I like what u/Psychological-Suit-5 said. One more edit for silliness. Could you set your own title as Data Gandalf?",

Data infra is so easy with lots of tooling.So the real job is ingesting data, building the data model & observing business people's questions and AI answers, and fixing the data model & enriching documentation to get the right answer from AI.At least for smaller companies, that's how it works right now around me. Data people are being Data&AI Engineers or full-stack data people.I also see, most of the companies are removing lots of their dashboards, keeping only the very fundamental ones. For the rest, you should build your data model & semantic layer. AI is doing the rest.Edit: Also, I forgot to say, maybe you should hire a data consultant for 1 day a week to check your data models & give you recommendations on architecture. By this way, you'll get better at these things as well.",

If you start at the flashy end-user part of the work, yes you are always going to be stuck doing really expensive rework down the track, while completely destroying confidence and enthusiasm from your business users.You can easily have the data definition argument before you've delivered the dashboard by getting the data in front of the people who use it (who generally aren't the people asking for the dashboard). The first thing I prototype is the semantic model with a few top level KPIs and whatever is the minimum that allows them to engage with that. Usually connecting the semantic model to Excel does the trick, otherwise a bare-bones dashboard that displays just an auditable view of the KPI.It's tempting to skip the data work and go straight to the dashboarding because it feels more agile to get the bells and whistles delivered, but ultimately it costs more in rework and burned credibility and clarity that it saves. It might feel heavy and unrealistic to do the modelling early, but that's because you're caught in the sugar rush of delivering good-looking, quick, but ultimately poor solutions.",

        "body": "Yep, so this is a pattern dbt uses regularly. I am fairly new as well (been reading/learning for what seems like years, but work doesn’t want to go down this route).Basically, the idea is you bring each referenced source table in to the model you’re working on as their own cte. By doing this pattern you have a clear reference to every parent model you are using at the top of your model.You then perform the transformation steps, including the joining of those referenced tables as the next cte (or several ctes depending on complexity).Then you read directly out of your last cte - preferably with little transformation in the final step.All of this is to make things as readable and organised as possible.If you were to start transforming each source in the initial cte, you wouldnt be reading a simple, single line bringing it in to the current model, but reading more complex transformations that you would need to spend more time figuring out what that piece was doing and where it began and ended.Edit to add: this way you can tell at a glance at the top of your model all the referenced sources. Each of them as a single line cte with no complexity thrown in. After you have brought in each source as its own cte, then you start a new one with a name indicating the source and transformation step, etc.By bringing in your sources, transforming each, joining, performing joined transformations, aggregating, etc, each in a little code block cte, you are mimicking how programmers would use methods in code to logically break code into chunks.If you also read up about layering data models (medallion architecture), you’ll see how dbt likes to break it down further into separate models. This allows you to perform the simple single-model transformations, such as renaming, casting, etc at a ”silver” stage, and more complex transformations such as joining or calculating the values in two tables, aggregating, etc in a later, “gold” model. This takes the organising and simplifying of models from within a single model/step, to a process.——- /* Model header and configuration */ // bring in referenced models and sources WITH orders AS ( SELECT * FROM source_orders ), customers AS ( SELECT * FROM source_customers ) // transform table transform_orders AS ( SELECT col1 AS col1_rename, col2 AS cast(col2 AS string), .....

        "body": "Hey I was a CS and DS major too. I am a DE now for about 2 years and I learned most things on the job. I started off with software developer and statistical programmer, then pivoted over to the DE space.Some helpful things from college are definitely the programming courses, SQL courses, and algebra courses. Specifically what helped me the most was knowing1. Some basic statistics like: * Mean, median, mode * Variance and standard deviation * Probability distributions * Confidence interval2. Some linear algebra like: * Vectors and matrices * Matrix multiplication * Eigenvalues and eigenvectors * Dot product and cross product3. Some basic calculus * Derivatives and gradients * Integrals * Chain rule4. Some discrete math like: * Sets and set operations * Logic and Boolean algebra * Functions and relations * Trees and traversalsNow these are the things that I need to perform my job at my organization but the most important skill is SQL. Our organization uses Google Cloud so infrastructure building with Terraform was also a skill I had to pick up while working.Hope this helps :)",

        "body": "For DE, most of the value comes from going deeper on a few fundamentals rather than adding more theory. Databases and operating systems matter a lot more than they sound at first, especially how storage, indexing, transactions, and concurrency actually work. Algorithms are useful, but mostly at a practical level like understanding tradeoffs in joins, streaming, and partitioning rather than textbook proofs.If I had to bias extra effort outside class, it would be SQL beyond basics, data modeling, distributed systems concepts, and hands on work with pipelines. Things like building an end to end ETL, handling bad data, and thinking about reliability and cost teach more than most lectures. DE interviews and jobs care less about ML theory and more about whether you can move and transform data safely at scale.",

And the retrieval side. Spark or SQL have no built in functions to do anything with the image data directly, so it will always be a two step process to do something with the images after retrieving with an sql or spark statement. For example ocr the content of an image. You retrieve the image data from iceberg and then need some eg Python code to load it into an image object and then use libraries to ocr the image. Same process if you would store the URL to the image in the db, step 1 retrieve the url step 2 load the image and ocr with Python.I would think the performance and infrastructure compute would be more favorable with images in blob storage. You just need a much smaller spark cluster to process the iceberg files and faster retrieval of the URL and image due to much less data volumes to process.",

Don't run your ETL with PythonOperators, because that runs on the airflow instance, which doesn't scale2. Don't write one giant DAG that handles everything. make small, simple DAGs that are easy to understand and debug3.

As a Data Engineering manager, I value somebody with direct experience as a data engineer over a consultant who sets it up, and doesn’t have to deal with the ramifications of when it breaks. Your ability to be a good junior engineer isn’t pinned on a specific technology, so I wouldn’t worry too much about that. A company focused on Snowflake today could switch to Fabric or Databricks tomorrow. Now as you get more senior, you’re going to want to specialize in something which does narrow your focus but it’s way too early to worry about that now. So net/net…I would go with your internal role and learn everything you can. Focus on your skills being transferable and you will open quite a few doors in a couple years.",

There are plenty of rich learning opportunities with Fabric. Yes, it has paper cuts. Yes, sometimes picking the right tool feels like deciding whether to eat your meal with a grapefruit spoon, a butter knife, or a plastic spork. But I am learning and growing, no regrets at all in that regard. I'm writing PySpark every week (with lots of help from ChatGPT Plus :grinning_face_with_sweat:) and learning more about delta tables than I ever wanted to.And if I wasn't a massive, massive Microsoft shill, I'm confident that after this project is done I could hard pivot my career to Databricks if I wanted to. Snowflake slightly less so. So, I can't give you a neutral opinion, but I'm happy to answer any questions.",

Fabric is as popular as a fart in a spacesuit in this sub, but it is data engineering. The technologies you mention, Python, SQL, pipelines etc are all transferable to other \"real\" platforms. There are a lot of opportunities just now with people migrating from Power BI and Synapse to Fabric, so it could also be a good career move financially.And with AI, the ability to write pipelines and code in Databricks or Fabric (or anything else) isn't going to matter so much. I'd concentrate on really getting to understand your data and building relationships with your user base, translating requirements into actual deliverables. That's what's going to add value to your career rather than being able to use tool X, Y or Z.Edit: typos",

And if there's no one who knows how to design/build/manage a BI layer, it's also bound to get messy over time.The thing is, if you only have bad reports, that's what the business will make decisions on. That and whatever they can come up with on their spreadsheets and side/shadow controls. I have no way to say I'd this is a minor issue or a huge risk, it may well be that the BI Eng who was laid off got enough working that the core operation is covered, and you'd only miss some opportunities. There are so many ways that BI can generate value, and so many ways it can be useless that it's impossible to say what your case is.You do have the right gut feeling, but there's little hope of fixing the issue(s) without proper ownership and knowledge. From what you described, it looks like you don't even have someone who knows how to get BI requirements right. For example, if someone comes asking for a report on how many cars and how much spaghetti, you don't throw it as a ticket into the backlog - you ask about the decisions they're making, how the relationships between these things work, what's the desired outcome, how they'll use the information, along with frequency, level of detail, quality and possibly what other questions (at least what data domains) we're talking about. After that, you have to determine where this data is (and it might not be anywhere), how to source it, how to structure it for the specific kind(s) of analysis and decision they want to make, and then you have to figure out how that relates to the rest of the data model you already have. And then you may be able to build something.Even skipping half of what I described, you can't escape some of it, and you need to know what you're doing. You also need ownership from the business, because this will need to be operated and maintained, and that comes with a cost. If there's no ownership, maybe on one wants that cost.Basically, start by finding someone who can explain why this matters, and then see if they can put enough value on it to justify the DE position. Just remember that, if you start asking questions, people may assume you're taking ownership. If you think that's a career move or a problem, I also don't know for sure.",

        "body": "thanks for your question!running `curl -sSL` [`https://getdango.dev/install.sh`](https://getdango.dev/install.sh) `| bash` (mac/linux) in terminal does:* checks prerequisites (Python 3.10+, Docker)* creates a venv and installs getdango + all dependencies (dlt, dbt, DuckDB, etc.)* asks for a project name and creates that directory with project structure* auto-generates config files connecting everything (dbt profiles → DuckDB, Metabase → DuckDB, dlt → DuckDB)(dango is a CLI tool you run from terminal, not a library you import - more like docker-compose or jupyter)you can also install manually (creates venv, `pip install getdango`, `dango init`) if you prefer that workflow. the script just combines those steps with prompts.after install, you add sources via the wizard (`dango source add`) or config files directly - CSV files, or 30+ API sources via dlt (Stripe, Google Sheets, GA4, Facebook/Google Ads, etc.), then run `dango start`. this pulls Docker images (Metabase, etc.) and starts the web UI at localhost:8800 where you can upload/sync data, access pre-configured dbt docs and Metabase, and monitor everything.so yes, it creates a complete data project skeleton with ingestion (dlt), transformation (dbt), database (DuckDB), and visualization (Metabase) all pre-wired together. you can drop CSV files in a folder, configure API sources, write SQL transformations, and build dashboards.to answer your original question: it's both - creates files (like Flutter skeleton), then you start services and use localhost. the value is having the full stack already integrated rather than as separate pieces you wire together.",

Move data through them with ETL (or ELT).-I had to model my data using the Kimble method for my curated version (dimensions and facts). It definitely helps with Power BI reporting. There are lots of resources for this online.- Consider how your API works. When you call it, what does it give you back? Is it a full data set, or do you pass it a date and it just gives you back a smaller set of data? Which columns in that API call do you need and which are definitely not useful to your business (don't get rid of them in raw in case the business wants them in future, but think about if they are needed in cleansed). I was able to use watermarks to record when the pipeline last ran. I can pass that watermark to my API so it only gives me the data that has been inserted or updated since then. That's handy because you process a much smaller data set.-Think about what happens if your pipeline fails at each stage. Draw it out on paper if you have to, think about why parts could fail and how you would fix them or deal with the next pipeline run.- Spend some time thinking how your pipeline will handle deleted data. If someone deleted a record from November in your CRM, how does it need to be handled in your reporting? Does the business still expect to see it in the reporting or are they happy it should be removed. I use MERGE to handle these in SparkSQL.- How often does the business want your pipeline to run, and at what time?",

As you mentioned schema changes are common, but relatively easy to detect. Most often I experienced renaming of columns, which manifests as a missing column in your expected schema and a new column at the same time. The pipeline cannot resolve this issue and will most likely fail if the missing column is used in transformations. You can detect schema changes with DBT-tests with dbt-expectations package or you can use great expectations package or dlt (data load tool) when using Python. Those tools also allow for detecting other type of problems, e.g. for categorical fields additional values that are not expected. You can also define simple tests or expectations that a column shouldn’t have NULL values, or fields need to be of a specific types and and and …Anything you can envision will happen eventually. And most often it requires human intervention to be fixed because most likely you need to talk to other people to either fix it at the source or you need to adjust the data pipeline to handle the new case. Your time is best spend in investing in detection and observability so you can spot the reason for the failure quickly.One way to minimize your disruption (and this is used in more mature organisations) is to create data contracts with your source system owners. In this document you describe what tables are you pulling, schema information, frequency, expected values, date time boundaries …. Then you can create a test data set that you can use to test your data pipeline when you make changes.",

Downstream of all of this, of course, when processing the load of cleansed data to production systems, the many pitfalls you might run in to there and need to report alongside the original raw picture of data to clients and internally. My favorite is a client we have who has a massive hierarchy for their enterprise that is sent to us via web services so that we can marry it up to our hierarchy for them in our system, all sent as this massive multi megabyte json beast. Most of the issues with them are mapping them to the right corresponding place within the hierarchy, and it’s a lot of reporting what isn’t set up by our enterprise so we can successfully consume the data at a later date.

Yes it might be technically correct to run everything through 100% CICD with completely metadata-driven abstract code but usually it ends up being too complicated and it starts to break down immediately when the first dev uses a shortcut to create something quickly for the customer.Imo Data Vault 2.0 is the pinnacle of over-engineering when it comes to data modeling. It has some good design patterns but if you do it by the book, you are basically preparing all kinds of scenarios that come up so rarely that it is not worth it.I've been on this field for 20 years and I've seen lots of shit like basically Power BI being recreated as some kind of metadata-driven monstrosity.",

If your Glue pipeline breaks it needs to rely on a unified source of truth to run it back again.

Partition by Day should be good. It would be roughly \\~25mb or so per hour. Iceberg can use hidden partitions so you can literally pass the timestamps or hourly based timestamps in your query. In short users don't have to know the partition column well in advance and you can modify it. Maybe have another column which has timestamp it is getting written to silver ( the timestamp of the micro batch. Say 200 files per 60mins is roughly 15-20 files every 2-3 minutes) Handle you duplicates, idempotency , business logic etc in this silver pipeline. If anything fails always read the bronze and retrigger the pipeline. 3. Once you write to your silver you ask your client what is the latest timestamp it has and see if you silver has anything new and if yes send >= that timestamp from client ( rough idea). Keep in mind about backfills. If your mini jobs fail multiple times you should be effectively able to delete those partitions and run the pipeline again and retrigger data to your other service. When you decouple like this you would ensure that if ever Silver or REST API service breaks the bronze still holds true. You can always read from the latest offset if your bronze break.

Then you need machinery to feed all these tables unnecessarily, and pay for all that compute work. It is just not a framework that is optimized for the cloud native tech. It is pointless in that sense. Also, lots of data engineers you hire will ask to leave the project after 6 months for the amount of endless work that the framework demands. All that under the escuse of it being very robust and adaptable to business logic. Well lots argue that is rather preferable having work maintaining simple models that need to be adapted a bit here and there once in a while than having work on a weekly basis for creating tables all in the same way.

In this API call, you can define your input and get an output that you want. It could be prediction, forecasting, classification. It could also be classification of an image or completion of a sentence. And yes, suggestion can also be one of the outputs. This applies to ML pipeline in general, not only Databricks.2. It really depends on your problem statement. If you are classifying images, usually the inputs are unstructured data like images.

In my experience, most of the really high paying DE jobs in the UK are usually in London and quanty style stuff which were in the £90k region for standard roles. Other positions in that realm were closer to leads.",

The salary I'm on at the moment is good, I get that but I'm mid 30s, I probably have 30 years left in work, it makes sense to consider what my future look like. When I think about progression there's a lot of stress and long hours that come for positions of more seniority as a DBA. Depending on the company, as a Head of/ Manager you can almost always be on call if that makes sense and I'm not sure the value is really there for me.I should clarify there are no plans to immediately transition, I'm on a good salary, it's remote and there's low demand, but when I think of 30+ years of working, I need to consider my options. I realise if I looked to move tomorrow I'd need to take a pay cut. I was thinking I'd be looking somewhere between £50-£65k though I think with my role changing I should be able to do a bit more of a hybrid role for a couple of years.",

As a DBA a call might look like an emergency call at 3 am that a critical server / db was down. In a worst case situation you might work 24 hours straight to bring systems back online and still would need to be back in the office on time the next day. As a DE, depending on industry itnis much more common to get a pipeline failure alert and deal with itnfirst thing in the morning. Fixing a production pipeline is alsonalmost always easier than something like an emergency server migration / DR rebuild. The actual easiest way to make the switch is find a hybrid role as a DBA. Find a role whwre you have to do both jobs. Half 6our day is spent doing the normal DBA tasks. Other half is sepnt writing pipelines, architecting solutions, database design, ci/cd, etc. Then look for a role that is almost exclusively DE work. That said you will still be used and leveraged as a DBA in a pinch because very few pure DE's have enough SQL / server knowledge to help out at the same level you can.",

        "body": "I didnt actively intend to make the switch until I was pretty far along down the path. Biggest driver is DE comes with higher pay than being a DBA. In my current role I still wear both hats fairly regurlarly. In fact I was hired more for my DBA skills than my DE skills.That said I found all the following skills very helpful in making the switch. 1. Expert level Powershell knowledge. This comes in handy both on prem and in thr cloud if you regurlarly work with Microsoft stacks. If not Bash would be more useful. 2. Intermediate Python skills. I learned python after powershell and the knowledge transfers easily between them. Somethings when you know both get hard just from do pythonism or powershellism in the other language. In Python focus on learning the common DE packages like pandas, polars, SqlAlchemy, pyodbc, requests these will get used constantly when writing pipelines for rest api endpoints. Dont worry too much about getting into the weeds with oop as most pipelines are not written that way. 3. If you want to go one step further learn Pyspark which is hugely useful in cloud pipelines and datalakes. Azure data factory, Databricks, etc is just spark underneath the sheets. 4. As a DBA for 10 years before making the switch. I was very familiar with On Prem / runnung SQL on VMs. A big switch for me was learning PaaS offerings like snowflake, databricks, Azure SQL, Azure data factory. So spending time learning the basics on these helped. I got lucky and was dealing with vendors / clients using these services so got paid to learn on thr job as it were. 5. Many older DBAs still have yet to embrace source control. If you are in this boat learn source control, ci/cd, and managing databases as code. If you get these under you belt it will make life better as a DBA and a DE. 6. Communication skills. I have to communicate with non technical and business staff more frequently as a DE than as a pure DBA. As a DBA we are kept locked up and kept away from business / non technical / dats analyst types. We are a bit like wizards who only send ravens when you have really fucked up. Being a DE is more meetings and requirement gathering.",

Is DP-700 a good certification to start with?DP-700 is a solid certification, but it’s slightly more valuable if you already understand the basics of:* Data modeling* Spark* Azure Data Factory* Synapse* Delta LakeFor a complete beginner, it can feel heavy. It helps, but it won’t magically land a job unless you pair it with hands-on practice.3. What should you actually start with?Here’s the order I recommend (I use this path for mentees transitioning from non-tech backgrounds):1. SQL basics → intermediate → analytical SQL2. Python for data tasks (Pandas, scripting, file handling)3. Cloud fundamentals (Azure AZ-900 is a good starter)4. Data engineering concepts (batch vs streaming, data lakes, warehousing)5. Spark (Databricks or Azure Synapse)6. Then consider DP-700.By the time you reach DP-700, you will understand why you are learning each topic instead of memorizing answers.4. Other certifications worth considering* AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals): great starting point* DP-900 (Azure Data Fundamentals): perfect for beginners* Later: DP-203 : this is the most recognized DE certification on AzureYour background isn’t a limitation. Your willingness to learn is your biggest advantage.If you take it step by step instead of trying to \"jump to the end\", the transition becomes not just possible, but achievable.You have already taken the most important step: asking the right questions!",

I don't have access directly to source_A and source_B, so I need to read from combined_source and use the respective lists of item_ids - list_A and list_B, which I possess - to distinguish between them.",

I have played arround with the tools available in Snowflake, seen marketing materials, and spoken to several vendors in this space.My assessment of the current state of the art is I would trust it (more or less) on anything where a semantic layer was present. Similar to how Snowflake and the other major vendors in this space work currently.But I don't know how valuable this is, because at least for us if something is in our semantic layer it means that we have it in a dashboard or a report. These items tend to be our easiest most basic questions and things no one asks about anymore, because of how easy we have already made it for folks to find the answers.I mean most time our analysts spend on questions is spent trying to figure out what the heck our users are asking for. If the users knew the words for how to ask for what they were looking for chances are they would have known how to find the report or dashboard that answers their question.But I do think the current vendors can provide reasonably reliable text to sql on well modeled data with a complete semantic layer. And that is how plan to approach this problem when some executive decides we need text to SQL. Other engineers at my company have played arround with an MCP server based approach to provide limited data access an LLM and have gotten reasonable results that way as well, but for general text to sql I would stick to the semantic layer approach.Then this stuff is moving pretty quickly so it would not surprise me if this take is out of date in a few months.Edit as for security, I also lead our company's FGA solution and we have high security requirements. And this doesn't bother me too much. We would not give this type of llm access to our sensitive data only access to meta data and semantic models. Any queries would be run in the context of the user asking the question.",

I should have spent more time reading the correctness of it and applying standards to it. My style was that if the code worked I didn't really give a second thought to how it was written. I'm not saying I let errors go by or wrote unoptimized code, but rather I wrote a lot of code in a lot of different ways.I got what I wanted from that blindness - it was cool to be able to read and write any language I was interested in, and I hopped around a lot on college writing basic programs in dozens of languages just to see how they work and if I could learn it quickly with my style. Unfortunately this is a useless skill once you have been in the work force for a few years. There are niches where it's useful, but the professional world wants your code to look like it's been written by one person. You also want the code repository to adhere to consistent styles and patterns and whatnot decided by the team.I'm bad at code reviews because it's harder for me to find fault in working code. I'm getting a little better at it thanks to ai tools being forced on us so I'm reading a lot more.",

But even then, after you have your prototype running, you should build a relational database based on your MongoDB database.I was led astray. I was one of those naive newbies. I chose MongoDB for my project. At first, I liked it: when I needed to add a field to an object, I add it in my code and it just worked. It felt like magic at first.But after a while, I found out any query more complex than a basic join is a nightmare. Unreadable mess. Absolute degeneracy. My code was full of 100+ lines long unreadable queries decorated with comments like // no way in hell this is the correct way to write this, but it works so DON'T TOUCH ITI thought \"surely I am missing something. Surely there's a way to write the queries more nicely. Surely with more practice, it will get more readable\". But after a while, I realized this was not happening.And the indexing. If you don't have properly set up indexes, the costs skyrocket. And you don't get any sort of warning that the database is manually searching through the millions of entries, checking them one by one for a match, multiple times per query. And even if you have indexes that by all means should have been used, sometimes they just don't get used, without any apparent reason. Optimizing queries is hell.At one point, I had to bite the bullet. I knew I could not keep it at this state much longer. It took me 2 months of tedious work, rewriting everything to Postgres, migrating all the data that accumulated over time. It sucked. But the relief of finally deleting the wasteland that my MongoDB has become was like getting that really bad tooth that has been decaying for 5 years finally pulled. It was awesome.Just use Postgres. If you are working with data of undefined structure, just use JSONB.And to show you a concrete example, here's a query from my codebase back when it used MongoDB (yes, all this is a single query). Don't try to understand it. Just marvel at it. // sorry.

Somebody else controls it. Example is a web scraper - you’re not in charge of the website you are scraping. Schema-less is a big thing here because it lets you store “anything” in the DB. Also, NoSQL is much more beginner-friendly, which is why you see it so much in courses and tutorials.Of course, it has some great horizontal scalability features and a lot of other stuff, but that's not important for beginners in this field (at least, not yet).2. If I have complete control over my object model, I would always use a relationship database since I’m already familiar with SQL. Also, if I have a lot of data to process (like GBs or TBs), I’ll avoid MongoDB or any NoSQL database.3. It's usually a great choice. It lets you shift your focus to the app and its logic, spending less time on data structures, schemas, etc. In real life, at some point, you'll need to learn SQL because it’s much more common than NoSQL, but for personal projects and learning Mongo, it's a great start.

If you are running a multi billion dollar corp, it doesn't matter either, because you can have a small priesthood building patch after patch on top of whatever DB to provide a useful abstraction hiding the cruft. Problems only happen in the middle: Where you can't afford to hire the specialists to, in practice, invent a data layer for you, yet you cannot just run everything from, say, even a small sqlite file.There was a time I'd have told you to run Mongo whenever you were tempted to use Dynamo, because Dynamo's costs were an absolute nightmare to deal with, especially if you didn't have absolutely perfect primary keys with unform usage patterns.

I will say that it scales very well; a cluster of Mongo instances is very malleable, instances can be added, removed and scaled at will without any downtime. Also, since it's schemaless, there's hardly ever any downtime for anything like schema migrations or the like.This comes at quite a cost though. You need to _really_ understand its eventually-consistent model to write code that may be prone to race conditions, where you'd just use locks and/or transactions in other databases. You'll also need to understand its failure modes in edge cases; for example how _exactly_ the retry behaviour of the driver is in case a server instance happens to disappear mid-transaction, and when the application needs to catch that and retry itself.Even if it's schemaless, for most regular applications, you still need a schema. If the database doesn't enforce it, your app layer needs to enforce it. If you don't, you'll end up with _a lot_ of uncertain code all over the place and a lot of `if..else` trying to compensate for vague schemas. Ask me how I know, it's hardly maintainable after a while.For most regular apps which need a relational data store, I would not recommend Mongo. At least not as the primary database. It can be useful for storing a large pool of unrelated, fairly unstructured data which is mostly accessed individually instead of serving aggregate queries. Spontaneously I could imagine YouTube storing data about its videos in Mongo; they're mostly accessed individually, each document can sprout various metadata, most documents are accessed fairly infrequently, and there's _loads_ of them.",

They get copied because we may not want to modify the original argument, so it saves us a line of copying, separates areas of concern, and it's a bit faster.2. We **can** pass large values (complex structs, arrays, etc...) as function arguments. But they will be copied. That can be a lot of copying, especially if we can't anticipate the size of arguments `my_func(int arg[12])` vs `my_func(int arg[9999])`. 3. Since function arguments get copied, and large copies are expensive, it's cheaper and faster to pass the address (pointer) of the data as a function argument.1. Very low level programming can involve jumping forward and backward to memory addresses. We can do math on the pointer itself to get to different addresses. You may never do this yourself, but pointers gives us access to this capability.Why are you experiencing this in C++ when C++ is supposed to be modern? Because C++ was designed to be compatible with C and the preexisting C libraries. C was designed like this because it was one of the first successful abstractions above assembly and written in an era when compute, storage, and memory was very expensive (cost and compute cycles).Edit: I mostly mentioned functions + pointers and not pointers in general, but my goal is to justify the utility of pointers and mentioning their benefits with functions is good enough.",

If you need to load a picture into memory, you don't know where in memory that picture is going to end up, so it isn't given an address until it is made. The pointer stores where that memory is after it is allocated.The next question as to why this is a thing where it isn't in other languages is because C++ is code that is running much closer to the processor than in other languages. Other languages abstract away this issue for you, but in environments where C++ is commonly used, such as 3D engines, operating system kernels, or embedded devices like arduino, we can't trust any other tooling to handle this efficiently enough for us, we need direct control. And using pointers to manage memory allocation and passing around information is how it all works under the hood.Beyond that, pointers are also the mechanism that your program uses to point to functions in other programs such as system API's, etc.",

In C, you have to do a lot of things explicitly that are handled implicitly by Python's stdlib classes.* A lot of resource handling (files, sockets, etc) can be done with context managers.* Loops can usually be handled as iterator algebra problems rather than by fiddling with indices. Nested loops can often be turned into non-nested loops with `itertools`.* More broadly, unless you have a really good reason not to do it, stateful manipulation can often be replaced with list comprehensions and some basic functional programming concepts.On the other extreme, just because you can code-golf some problem into a deranged one-liner list comprehension expression does not mean that you should.

Similar issues where I felt everyone knew more than me, constantly felt like tickets weren't fully scoped or properly defined, anxiety about my work, etc. I'm 7 years in and now I actually feel confident to know when to push back when my manager or more senior devs say things I disagree with (and allow them the opportunity to change my mind), or know when I have valuable input to provide. The amount of times I had a \"stupid question\" about design or architecture, and 4 out of the 5 people on my team had the same question are countless.I don't know your specific background, but I didn't go to college and get a degree. So what I know, is that I very much prefer working as a software engineer than going back to unload trucks at walmart, cashiering at kmart, or working as a barista.Ask yourself, if you knew more, if you felt more confident, would you still be asking whether you're cut out for SWE? If it's just a skill and confidence issue then that's where your focus should be. If however, you know being the most competent dev on the team wouldn't change a thing about how you feel, then consider if there's another area within tech that you may be more suited for.",

One of the best pieces of advice I got from my first manager was something along the lines of “I don’t care about dev. We have it for a reason and no one depends on that data. Go break it. That’s how you find out how it’s working and how you find issues. We can always redeploy dev “. And that changed my learning perspective. Instead of feeling like I need to understand the docs cover to cover, I now feel empowered to take a look at the architecture and app dependencies and then just go fuck with it. For example, the past 3 years I’ve worked almost exclusively with serverless architecture in AWS using python. But I just joined a new team and we are shifting the application to EKS using a Java library. No fucking clue but I spend the last 2 days reviewing architecture, in the console, and googling/gpt every step of the way when I run into something I don’t know. Now I have a tool belt of knowledge to aid the team in solving some of their problems. I still have a ton to learn, but after 2 days, I know what questions I need to ask.",

Small companies, especially non-tech companies, pick a very mainstream language and then hire programmers who already know that language. They hyper-focus on knowing the right language because they want to hire people who can do the job now. These companies almost never pick obscure languages, they're more likely to be using an aging language like PHP.2. The most cutting-edge tech companies don't care what language you know now. They hire really great people and then teach them the language they use, or ask them to pick the right language for each new project. To get a job there, knowing the \"right\" language doesn't help, being really good at building and problem-solving is what they care about.",

Keeping with the house analogy, you can try learning a lot of deep stuff to build a house made out of bricks, or you can try making a house out of sticks first and learn the overall architecture.",

Research papers are way more focused on theory, algorithms, and stats than the actual implementation. Basically, universities have little incentive in teaching specific tools and programs. Thus, you don't really learn that many \"products\".Then you get to the \"real world\". A lot of the theory heavy material from academia has in some ways materialised as products, such as Docker, React, Terraform, Bun ...IMO the most useful things of going through college is learning how to learn. Also, since you learn a lot of theory, you are in a much better position to figure out how things work underneath, which maybe allows you to do more advanced debugging, developing and usage of the things you do.",

        "body": "Well it appears that your head isn't screwed on right. So settle down and reboot your mind. Here are some suggestions.1. At this point I consider it to be absolutely stupid to introduce CS to students with IDE's. To much basic material gets glossed over that often results in students not understanding what is happening underneath.2. Frankly this applies to trying to write any software as a GUI application, there is too much to learn to be distracted by GUI's.3. So what we need to do is to get back to basics.4. This means building software with command line tools and maybe a simple GUI text editor. 5. I'd suggest following a CS program that uses C++. You already supposedly have some CS under your belt but I'm really wondering if you learned anything. But the point here is that as each point is explored in class you just write code that leverages that technique in as many ways as possible. The usual first program is to write your name to the screen, often followed by simple looping. Explore looping for hours then continue with every other concept discussed in the program. the idea is to totally understand the ins and outs of every concept and be able to use with muscle memory. 6. Then start writing simple command line programs that solve things you understand well. Try to tie in these programs with hobby's or other thigns you know well. The point is you understand the the technology so you know what is right and you know the end result you want to see. An example would be writing a program that takes resistor band colors and returns the actually resistance value. Another example would be to display your favorite Chili receipt on screen. The idea is to start out dirt simple and grow from there.7. Once you fell comfortable building command line programs from abstract requirements then start building GUI apps. At this point you will likely want to shift away from C++ to a common platform programming language. For example on Apples systems that would be Swift. In some ways you will be starting over as Hello World is a common first GUI program. You will also need to become familiar with more advanced data structures and methods.8. Once you get past the introductory step you need to start crafting your own apps while you follow a platform specific program. Again the idea here is to take something you understand well, a hobby or something other and create programs that solve a problem within that domain. You can even start over with a receipt program but this time one that stores multiple receipts and allows more interaction. The idea is to get more and more complex. As you learn more and more you will realize just how bad the first receipt program was and can refactor it as much as possible. You really should have several programs under various states of construction.",

A lot of enterprise environments work with java (or related: kotlin, something shiny?). Still, my hobby projects start with either python or bash and once it's growing and needs revision/refactoring, I tend to go with java again for maintainability, testability, monitoring/observability and dependency management. Again, that's very subjective :) Separate from the language discussion, it's always good to stay alert on what you want to accomplish. Do you really need spring (boot) for your java projects?

A Native app (Swift/Kotlin) outpaces Cross-platform (React/Flutter) or WebView because it has direct hardware access. Performance suffers when developers clog the Main Thread with heavy tasks (like parsing JSON) instead of offloading them to Background Threads, causing UI stutters. Finally, optimized apps use Local Caching to show content instantly, whereas laggy apps force the UI to wait for the network and re-render everything from scratch, draining both battery and data. I usually see a big difference between a native application and a Cross-platform, and even more so I see how poorly WebView works.",

From there you can do that again with something else. Soon you will be able to come up with your own ideas and you will know where to start. You just keep doing the same thing and all of that stuff will come. Design patterns, algorithms, OOP, and the other stuff you will use to solve problems and you may or may not recognize that you are using them.

Look, there's no way to just leap from tutorials to building complex software in one bound. So, start small. First, choose a project with a tight scope, like a Todo app with user accounts. Then, get a Trello account and start writing out individual tasks. You want to make these tasks super simple at first. One might be \"create a webpage with Ultimate Todo List as the title.\" Your next task might be \"Create a CSS Page and make sure it's linked to the webpage.\" Then do the same with JavaScript.If you run into something you don't know how to do, make a card for learning how to do it. You do not need or want to fully master new technologies at this stage. You want to learn the bare minimum to incorporate it into your project.If you get stuck, try to look up the specific thing you want to do. For example, if you're trying to make a checkbox the user can click, look up that specific thing. If you're unsure how to store your list of items, look that up, but not until you're working on that task.And then you just keep going. Try to complete one or two cards per day. This is almost exactly how professional software is built, btw. Only we break the cards into batches we can complete in two weeks and call it a sprint. Remember, the cards aren't complete features, they are small tasks. If you know Git (and you should) make a repo for your project and get in the habit of making a branch for each card. Once you complete a card, merge your branch into main and start the process again. Your Main branch should always be a working app with whatever features you've added so far. Start small, complete one or two small tasks every day, rinse, repeat.It's not just a way, it's the only way. Software is built one small step at a time.",

And that learning process never stops, no matter how long you've been doing it for. Programming is much more about learning to systematically decompose big problems into small problems, then solve those small problems in isolation, one at a time, to get to a desired end-point, and that's what separates good programmers from bad programmers. I've known people who have been programming for a few years who are great at approaching problems systematically, and they're great programmers even if they don't know every language feature or design pattern and sometimes do goofy stuff that's not exactly the cleanest or most efficient way to solve that particular problem.

If your goal is to build better mental models, that pain is useful.The main downside is cognitive load, you can end up spending a lot of time fighting the borrow checker before you have a feel for what \"good\" looks like. Some people get more mileage by doing a short pass in C first to see the sharp edges directly, then Rust feels like a structured way to avoid them. Others prefer Go for fundamentals around concurrency and simplicity, but it will not push you as hard on memory and invariants.Scope wise, I would pick tiny programs with one learning objective each and a hard ceiling on features. Stuff like a simple log parser with a strict state machine, a tiny key value store in memory, a CLI that does one thing well, or a toy HTTP server. If you catch yourself designing frameworks, stop and write tests for behavior instead. That is usually the point where \"learning\" quietly turns into \"architecture as procrastination.\"",

        "body": "If your goal is fundamentals and not speed or résumé optics, your instinct is solid. Small, constrained programs are exactly where those concepts stop being abstract.Rust is good for this, but only if you treat the friction as the lesson and not something to fight. Ownership, borrowing, and error handling will slow you down, and that’s the point. It forces you to think about state, lifetimes, and failure modes up front instead of papering over them. That maps well to how real systems break.That said, Rust is not the only way to get there. If you ever feel like you’re spending more time appeasing the compiler than reasoning about the problem, stepping sideways into something like Go or even plain C for a bit can help. Different languages surface the same fundamentals from different angles. There’s value in contrast.The biggest trap to avoid is “exploration creep.” Pick problems that are almost boring. A tiny file indexer. A toy key value store. A CLI that parses input, mutates state, and fails in predictable ways. Stop the moment it works. Do not add features. The learning comes from finishing and reflecting, not from polishing.You’re already thinking about this the right way. If you keep the scope tight and finish things, the language choice matters far less than the discipline you’re building.",

Once you know one good enough to write and debug some 1,000 lines of code, it is not so hard to do the same with another one.If your goal was different , like developing your own application my recommendation would be different.I have used many different different languages, even developed my own, written compilers, schedulers , garbage processors and more Do not hesitate to ask me more questions if you want , l will be happy to help.And, finally, if anyone tells you this xx language is the best, run away from him!",

I got laid off a couple years ago and did a backend bootcamp which introduced me to web dev with Python, then I got a new non-coding job which is giving me the financial security to get back to coding + writing. What I’d like to do is eventually shift to an SWE or web dev job and write on the side, but for now I’m content in my current job working on the skills I need both in coding and writing. I actually haven’t coded for a while because my computer broke a few months back but I finally got a new one and I’ve been brushing up on the fundamentals with some CLI projects. One thing I do think people don’t talk about much is how well such creative pursuits complement each other. I tried to learn do comp sci when I was 19 or so and got in my head telling myself I wasn’t cut out for it, not good at math, disciplined enough, etc. A decade or so later having spent years working on my writing I have the experience to know those voices are false. Writing a novel involves a lot of problem solving, and if I can write and edit a novel, I can work my way through coding problems.",

Three things helped me quite a bit: First : I attempted to learn a few times, but didn’t make great progress until I got really consistent about learning. At one point I had a pretty long commute on the bus, so I got a laptop and started working every day. That’s when my skills went from “I sort of understand” to “I can actually make things that are helpful”.Second : There are lots of different options for learning: books, coding websites, YouTube, paid tutorials. They all have their pros and cons, but ultimately none of them will teach you.. you have to teach yourself. I wouldn’t worry about finding the perfect resources. The goal should be to learn enough to take the training wheels off and start building things on your own.Third : It sounds like you have tried a bunch of things already. Different languages, web, etc.. I started out in a similar way. I just wanted to “learn programming”.. I was making progres, but it was a bit scattered. I eventually started creating some workflow helper tools in Maya for a particular project. They ended up being used by the whole team, and I started spending a lot of my time adding features and improvements. This focus on one language (python) and one purpose made a big difference.I’m sure there are lots of ways to do it, this is just what helped me. Good luck!",

The goal of program will typically starting from some state/value and process till you get the done state/value. So basically they are the same with some syntax different.Another group is call functional programming, this group is different since there is no time flow in the language. Only expressions and value.Modern languages will very likely have feature of both camps.There are some language outside both camps but they are not well know, like logic programming and one that use other model of computation.If you want to get dizzy, check out Prolog, Haskell, APL or LISP language.[https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Man\\_or\\_boy\\_test](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Man_or_boy_test)",

Some instructions also let you jump around in the sequence of instructions (if/else statements, loops, function calls,...). These languages are built on theory of RAM machines and Turing machines.Functional languages (ML, OcaML, Lisp, Haskel,...). They conceptualize programs as a sequence of symbols, that gets transformed via pattern matching based on rules defined by the program. They are based on theory of Lambda Calculus.These families are equivalent, in the sense that you can simulate a functional language in imperative language and vice versa (this is called Church-Turing thesis).Most modern programming languages contain features that are a mix of both.",

Old 8bit standbys are PIC and AtmelAVR that can be important depending on your notion of \"embedded\" (not every toaster and microwave is running Linux-ARMs yet),. There are also 16bit processors that are optimized for motor controllers if you are into that sort of thing.Once you get the hang of any one of those then the others follow pretty easily so look at the market you hope to enter. Anything with wifi or ethernet will probably want ARM or newer. Motors will be the 16bit DSP engines or specialized ARM devices (often slightly more than the typical assembly instruction set). Light bulbs and toasters and hand-held appliances will probably continue with 8bit which is easily mastered.The important point is having something to practice on until you are comfortable with how it works.

The mnemonics and their meanings are entirely dependent on the machine instruction sets of the target processor. So, if you know PDP-11 assembler language, you don’t really know ARM-64 or x86 or MIPS or whatever. If you find an embedded job, you’ll be using the processor your employer chose. If you start a company to make an embedded project, you’ll choose the processor. So your core skill will be getting your coding process up and running quickly on whatever instruction set.If your time is worth anything, you’ll hammer out most of the embedded code in C. Both GCC and LLVM have really good facilities for turning C code into astonishingly well optimized machine code for your processor of choice. It can prolly generate smaller and faster code than 99.9% of programmers ever will be able to. I’ve worked with a couple of the 0.1%, those folks are amazing. But they still use a lot of C.Assembly comes into its own for small chunks of an application that are time- or power- critical. And often the assembly code is embedded in some sort of pragma directive inside .c source code files.There’s still a lot to learn by programming machine instructions directly. Learning how registers, stack pointers, program counters, and other machine concepts work is helpful. You may as well do it for whatever machine you have readily at hand. C compilers generally have options that make them generate “listings” with the generated machine instructions displayed. That, combined with the instruction architecture document for your processor, will teach you a lot. Especially, compare the generated code with optimization turned off (-g) and on (-O).",

Hell, I didn't even start a votech until 25.One thing I can suggest to you is to take a step back from programing, and use something like [draw.io](http://draw.io) to map everything out. It doesn't have to be perfect, but you can get a good idea of what's where. Then the implementation is going to be easier, and you can see right off the bat what you can trim. It's also a good exercise in mapping out your edge cases. When you are building something that moves and interacts with the world your primary focus is on not missing a single edge case because people can be hurt and property can be destroyed. Ya dig? Your project isn't likely there yet.I keep several things. A note book, my phone, a couple docs. Then when I'm going through stuff, I make sure I didn't miss these edge cases I noted down everywhere. I generally deal with industrial systems, particularly utilities like ammonia refrigeration, steam boilers, large electrical power systems, large pump systems, etc. So it's not as important for you.Once you have a solid map and the data laid out, what you can/can't do will make more sense I'm sure. Just the fact that you say \"I'm not sure if I'm good enough to do that\" is the first step - you are making sure you are working within your limits, but not afraid to push them. That's wise.

Just do one ROOM (with all the furniture and people). When you got the room working, THEN work on the whole floor. I've worked at Waymo and Zoox as a safety driver. And I have basic knowledge of their hardware. You have the right idea, but keep in mind that Waymo AND Zoox already have the entire map of the city already loaded into their system, plus information that's not on the map, like updated lane markers, where are the pullover zones, and so on. Mapping is only used to \"validate\" areas of the map that doesn't match what they already \"knew\" about the area. They do NOT do autonomous mapping. In a new city, they have safety drivers go down each block to do the initial mapping. They also have GPS as backup, and for Google, Streetview as another backup for 3D AR mapping. Your little bot does NOT have any of these secondary / tertiary locator means in the school interior. So you can be inspired by Google / Waymo, but you cannot copy their approach because you don't have their hardware nor their secondary / tertiary nav data. (You may be able to code workarounds by adding QR codes or RFID beacons to door frames or fixed distances, and use those to help your bot locate itself, but that's up to you)",

If you do, it is possible to write performance critical parts in C. I have never really bought the idea that somehow you need to learn things the hard way in C. Python also has the basic structures of C and then some, and gets you solving actual problems faster. Stuff like pointer arithmetic is not as magical as it's made to be.",

You can learn C after you learn Python, and the same knowledge will end up in your head as if you did it the other way round. A good programmer is in any case flexible and can adapt to new paradigms and new idioms. The importance of \"habits\" and what language is your first is way overestimated. You'll be fine either way.> The formatting of Python also seems to be a cheat that isn't as healthy as having your base reference in C/C++'s symbolic referencing over indentation.What does \"symbolic referencing\" mean here, like, braces? They don't matter. You can learn and get used to both syntaxes, this idea that you're permanently fixing one way as your \"base reference\" (???) by doing it first and that one is more \"healthy\" than the other is again pure nonsense, worse than before.

C will take longer to create a useful non-trivial software. After you are comfortable with Python you can learn C to learn the details of memory management and compilers.

        "body": "You have to understand some programming history to understand why C and C++ exist.Lets roll back the clock to 1990 or so. Personal computers are just starting to become practical. For $3000 in todays money you can get a home desktop computer about as powerful as a super Nintendo is (286 or 386 PC running windows 3.1) At the time this is considered cutting edge, way faster than those atari and apple 2 computers people are using before. You can get real work done with these!Your options for programming languages really boil down to something like assembler, BASIC, or C / C++. Lets compare each.\\- Anyone programming in 1980 to 1990 or so to do real work was likely using assembler. This is as close as you can get to actual processor instructions. Read value from memory address one into register 1, read value into memory address 2, compare the values with binary math, if they are equal then JMP to subroutine that outputs string from memory address 3, etc. This is literal processor instructions - it doesn't get any more raw and fast than that.\\- You could learn BASIC, but BASIC is an interpreted language. Rather than the code being compiled into processor instructions BASIC is a program itself that reads the program you are running and figures out what it should be doing in real time. This makes it about 10 times slower. But good god, is it easier to write a program in BASIC than Assembler - you can just define an array, you can just write a function, you can just define subroutines that take actual arguments - its so much more clean. If you can write your program in BASIC it will be much easier to maintain and simpler to comprehend - but its going to run soooo much slower. In a world where making a FPS like wolfenstein 3D work stretches the limit of what is possible on the hardware, a 10x speed loss is just too much when your program relies on speed.\\- Then comes C and C++. The idea behind these languages is that you can write your code kind of like interpreted languages instead of assembler - defining functions, data structures, complicated mathematical algorithms - but instead of the computer interpreting the program in real time, it can convert it all to bytecode - basically the same thing as assembler - and run it almost as fast as an assembler program as a result. C/C++ is written like a processor actually acts. But as nice as this is, there are still significant shortcomings. Dynamic memory allocation which is something that just happens like magic in an interpreted language, is not automatic in C++ - stuff like creating an array, creating a variable length string, or defining a variable, or converting one variable type to another - this is not actually provided in C, you have to manage it on your own. Which you most defiantly can - and doing so is easier than doing so in assembler. So now you have all the advantages of assembler and the complexity is significantly reduced.But its not 1990 anymore, its 35 years later. Computers are hundreds if not thousands of times faster, have multiple cores, usually have 32,000 MB of RAM instead of like, 4 MB, etc. There is enough extra speed in a computer that you don't really need that extreme optimization anymore. And the way computers operate with all this extra resources have also changed - with multi core systems you can have some of the cores or the GPU handling the graphics pipeline in your program, which is like 95% of the processing time - and this is all handled outside of the program you are actually writing.There are also many, many more languages that more elegantly handle the problem of ease of development balanced against speed. Most modern languages, like javascript or python, act like interpreted languages in that they are flexible and just run, but under the hood they still compile to bytecode for speed - the performance loss of using them vs C++ is not as much as it used to be. Modern Javascript in particular is \\*\\*king FAST, thanks to google throwing millions and millions of dollars into optimizing chrome. The way the async cycle in javascript works is far more flexible than what C/C++ offers, and in general all the features in C/C++ are now available in newer languages, and usually they do it better.Finally, you should consider that your programs don't need the extra speed and complexity that comes with C++ because all the heavy lifting in your program will not actually be done by the program you are writing. The graphics are done by the GPU. If you want a video or mp3 encoder or something, you bring in someone else's tool into your program as a library (probably written in C++) and invoke it and get the results. Programming in 2025 is more about gluing premade tools together and orchestrating them, and your code is the orchestration layer. It is much more beneficial for this layer to be simpler and easier to comprehend and manage and leaving the dirty details to other tools. You will always be on hardware that is hundreds of times faster than you need for this purpose.",

        "body": "Advent of Code personally. It’s a coding challenge in December where the creator releases one puzzle a day like an advent calendar, although this year he only did 12 days. Each day you’re given a Christmas themed puzzle to solve and some input data and you have to write a code to solve it in a language of your choice. The puzzles get progressively harder as you go. The first few days are usually fairly simple list comprehension style but as you get further you have to use DFS, regexes, Dijkstras, interpreting JSONs etc. So it’s a fun way to practice DSA with a bit more of a story than Leetcode. As an example one of the puzzles from 2024 you’re given input data which is a large grid of #’s and .s plus one ^ . The ^ is the start postion of a guard. The guard walks in the direction she’s pointing until she hits an # when she turns right. You have to work out how many unique cells the guard visits before leaving the room.The challenge goes back to 2015 and you can play all of the old puzzles for free so I find it a really fun way to practice. Once I’ve solved a puzzle I look at how other people have solved it in other languages and find ways I can improve my code.",

The other was a 20 year tenured dinosaur using the same slides he'd been using since the 2000s, mumbling his way along while we were left to decode the remains.In both cases, algorithms were only touched on to a theoretical capacity in lecture - only word problems appeared in ungraded work which nobody did because the graded stuff took priority. In neither case was the learning experience long lasting. In both cases it was the same procedure: Survive the semester and try to prep for the next batch of courses.Beyond those courses, our projects rarely required algorithm work. The closest I've ever come was implementing A\\* pathfinding for a turn-based tactics game I made for a game programming course. Best course in my 4 years here. Besides that it's largely been 4 years of half-assedly displaying a false-understanding of concepts, rather than actually using them.This is why side projects are important for CS students.",

        "body": "You just finished your first semester. I'd say that for now look into different courses/paths your university is going to introduce you into. We can throw at you all kinds of tech stacks but what if you pick DevOps over web application development? Or you pick mobile app development over IoT/embedded programming? Perhaps you go for telecom technologies instead?You having finished your first semester is a bit early to make you pick a path and target one or another company. Unless you clearly know what you want to do.Also, your break is going to be what, 1 month or less? It will not be enough to go over all the different paths one might recommend to you.I'd say that if you haven't done yet, then learn to use Git. It will be used regardless in which field you'll be working at. Learn to make pull/merge requests, learn to make feature branches, etc. That knowledge will be needed also in your coming semesters. Try it out with some hobby project (whichever medium: mobile app, a script outputting to a terminal, a website, etc.)Then, you do can map the different technologies that are used by companies in your area. Search by \"junior developer\" or \"junior engineer\" or \"junior software developer\" or such. Yes, you are targeting internship but you'll be working with some tech stack. Even when it comes to very simple tasks they give to interns. You can make a list for mobile app development, a list for web application development, a list for IoT/embedded/hardware programming, etc. Might be that some of the technologies you will learn during your courses. But definitely can be that you might have to learn something on your own or they will teach you during the internship.Another thing that you can do is mapping down all the different companies that are taking interns in first place. You can learn all the different programming languages, but when you have no company to apply to then perhaps you are picking a technology that has no internships in your area. For example you might be learning Python or Java but if companies in your area are taking only interns to embedded programming then you'll need C and C++ instead. So, make a solid plan first before you start picking programming languages, frameworks, etc.You can also look into companies that are hosting open door days, hosting tech talks, etc. Yes, these are not internship events but if you are social enough, you might find internship via connections you make in these events.More realistic approach (instead of looking for internship via tech talk events) is looking if your university has a programming/robotics club. And then join that. These clubs will introduce you into different interesting projects, into different club organized events (but also company visits), and you'll get connections.This is what you realistically can do during your break. You'll have much clearer idea of your options when you start actually applying for internships. Whereas your course mates will be in your current shoes, looking aimlessly for internship offers, not knowing what to do.Sure, it helps if you have a hobby project and you have it in Github and perhaps even hosted somewhere or running on some device (depending of its nature). Then a company will see that you can actually work on a project.Besides an ability to work on a project you also should improve your group work skills / soft skills. This is why I suggested to join some programming related extracurricular activity club in your university. Software development is a group work, usually. Yeah, there is freelancing but you are not targeting it as an intern. An intern must be able to work in a team. I have had different bad experiences with new hires who just do not function in a team. Sure, you can have all kinds of technical skills but if you do not function in a team then it will harm your own progress, it will make you a blocker when it comes to handling tasks, etc. A good intern is somebody who is proactive, shows an interest towards learning, is willing to work in a team, is a good listener, etc.",

Thus, the code that calls the function with the pointer is also responsible for telling us how big it is. Note, size of socres in the function is the size of the pointer value, 64 bits or 8 bytes in this case. The int here is only 32 bits or 4 bytes.> So both *scores and &testScores[0] are float* numbers? Well... your pointer is always just a memory location. It's how you talk about it that makes it float. So here `scores` is a pointer when it gets to the function. We've told our program the type referenced by that pointer is float. To be clear, it could be a single float at the memory location or thousands. Once you pass that pointer, the actual size gets lost. As, hopefully, seen in that trace above.",

Key terms in bold. float arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};The **name/symbol** `arr` **aliases** the **address** (assigned by the compiler) of some **storage** (allocated somewhere at compilation time or runtime) that has a specified **value** (or values in the case of arrays) of a certain **type**. A **pointer** type is a type that stores addresses as values (pedants: yes, I've read the standard and this is good enough here). Example with address annotations in parens: float a(0x01) = 0.1f; // addr 0x01 (alias a) contains value 0.1f. float *b(0x05) = &a = 0x01; // addr 0x05 (alias b) contains value 0x01 (a's addr).Name/symbol, address, storage, type, and value, are distinct things. Names mean we don't have to write addresses (though you can, and do in embedded). Storage for a single object (not in the OOP sense, object = datum here) can of course be larger than a single address. Value is what is in that region of memory when read at a given time. Books can be written here (E.g. *Modern C*, Gustedt), this isn't supposed to be exhaustive.Answers:1. It's the address of the first byte of the first element in the array.2. Those are expressions that yield results of pointer type. Dereference and addressof operators can be thought of as inverses, yes. The reason you can write a function that takes a pointer and then pass an array is because of the language semantics, no doubt influenced by what is happening on the hardware. When passing by value in C++, the values of the arguments are copied into the target function's stack frame (usually, compilers are clever and will elide things). How do we efficiently copy an array here? We don't. We say that arrays \"decay\" to pointers in this scenario, and we copy a smaller fixed-size pointer value instead (fits in a register, nice!). Referencing the above, we've copied the (base) address of the storage of the array into the storage for the function parameter. We have a pointer value that we can dereference and/or do pointer arithmetic on. **Whereas the original name/symbol (arr) aliased the address of the first element directly, the parameter stores that same address as a value. In this situation, the language doesn't force us to explicitly take the address using an expression and then pass it, it effectively does it for us.**Hopefully that makes sense. I do recommend both K&R C and Modern C if you want to go beyond this summary. I simplified and left things out.",

In C and C++ it will do the math and return a memory location that you didn't reserve for the array.

        "body": "We have to go back to C for an understanding. K&R developed C on a PDP-6, which typically had ~144 KiB of memory. They thought arrays were too large to be passing around by value, like you could any other value type: void fn(int pass_by_value); int main() { int value_gets_copied_on_the_stack; fn(value_gets_copied_on_the_stack);So they decided that they would 1) pass by reference as a language feature to be more efficient, and 2) hide the reality from you: void fn(int array[123]); int main() { int gets_passed_by_reference[123]); fn(gets_passed_by_reference);In C parlance - a pointer references a value. What you DON'T see is how the parameter type decays: void fn(int *this_is_the_reality);The array itself doesn't decay - instead, it implicitly converts. You will not be informed, you will not be told, you will not be warned, and there's nothing you can to to prevent this. Again: LANGUAGE FEATURE. Notice the compiler completely strips out the array size.Thanks, K&R, for whatever the fuck this is about...The array is of type `int[123]`. The parameter is of type `int *`. The type system does recognize the array as a distinct type - where the size is a part of the type signature. We can even capture that in C: typedef int[123] int_123; typedef int* int_ptr; void fn(int_ptr pointer_to_int); int main() { int_123 array; fn(array);So what exactly is going on with pointers? The term is: Type Erasure. We are intentionally losing information about what the pointer points to. This can be powerful. Are we pointing to a single element or the first of an array? One past the end of the array? Heap or stack? Local, global, or member? Cast?We don't know SHIT about what that pointer is pointing at, other than that address right there \"is an int\". As far as the code and compiler is concerned, that's all we got. If you're willing to make some assumptions, you can write some abstract code that can do some interesting things. You can access, you can iterate, you can delimit, you can reinterpret...But unlike any other type in C, this means that when I pass an `int` by value, I'm working on a copy that exists on the stack, but if I pass an array by value, I'm reading and writing the original array in place. And remember that C didn't even GET `const` until C99...Type erasure is useful for writing all manner of abstractions. You can look at how `bsearch` is written and used, for an example. If you had to know what kind of thing you were pointing at, you'd have to have a local `int` pointer, a member `int` pointer, an array `int` pointer... It becomes an alias of limited value - often we want to operate upon a type without wanting to know too much detail.Oh, there are more specific pointer types... struct s { int i, j, k; }; int main() { s instance; int struct s::* ptr_to_member_int_of_s = &instance.i;Feel free to get more specific if it serves a utility. Such things are used less often.---So we've lost type information. Is there a way we can preserve it? Yes. void fn(int (*array)[123]);The extra parenthesis are necessary. This is still C; `array` here is a pointer, which means it can be null. C++ gives us references: void fn(int (&array)[123]);I hate the syntax. Luckily, this is what type aliases are for - since pointers are a distinct type: // C++ using alias... using int[123] = int_123; using int_123* = int_123_ptr; using int_123& = int_123_ref; void fn1(int_123 &pass_by_ref); void fn2(int_123_ref also_pass_by_ref); void fn3(int_123 decay_to_ptr);Don't get fooled by aliases. They don't make types, they only name them. You won't get value semantics for array parameters just because you've aliased it.This makes your code safer. Type information is preserved, you are referencing a more specific type. It also means the compiler can optimize more aggressively. But the size is a part of the type, so `fn1` and `fn2` won't work with ANY other type. `int[234]`? Go fuck yourself.Continued...",

Sure, menu automation and such has its place, in frontend testing and such, but first try to get it done by using the API endpoints of Beatstars. Because any and all menu clicks and dropdown selections in the end send some HTTP request to Beatstars server. Or SOAP requests or websockets or something.

Your work should be tracked somewhere (Jira for instance). There should be a record of what your code needs to accomplish and the acceptance criteria for it before any work starts.2. Your organization/team should have code standards that all code is held to. This should include testing requirements.3. Code should be in source control and require review before merging. The review should include verifying #1 and #2.4. Merges should require all tests to pass.This is the most bare bones description of a basic SDLC. If all 4 of the above are verified your code is ready to ship. Improvements are accomplished through iteration of this process.",

Being able to turn an idea into something working without depending on others gives you a lot of speed and clarity early on.Regarding Rails vs full-stack JavaScript, it really comes down to focus. Rails is great for learning how a product is put together on the backend and lets you ship quickly because it’s very structured and opinionated. JavaScript can feel messier at first, but using the same language for both frontend and backend is powerful if your goal is to build products on your own and understand the whole stack.In practice, the language matters less than finishing projects. While building theORQL, what helped the most wasn’t choosing the “perfect” stack, but learning how to build, break things, debug, and iterate quickly. Those skills transfer no matter what you use.",

        "body": ">I have never felt so dumb and overwhelmed. I can't even solve basic array problems. I've been trying to study the patterns like sliding window and two pointer and can usually identify when to use them.For this kind of stuff, then for me it's essential to have a well-illustrated example, in order to really understand. For example, you used the term \"sliding window\", which gave my brain a vague inkling of what you're talking about, but not yet enough to have a \"picture\" in my mind of what you're really trying to solve.Then I used Google and found this Answer which is illustrated beautifully: [What is Sliding Window Algorithm? Examples? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8269916/what-is-sliding-window-algorithm-examples)Anyway, as the Answerer points out, calling it a \"sliding window algorithm\" is really a misnomer; it is a useful technique, though.So, how does one get better at using this technique? Well, you've got to practice it, of course. The example shown in that Q&A is a pretty good starter problem (find the maximum sum of n consecutive numbers); you can adapt that to almost anything (e.g. find the lowest average of n consecutive numbers, find a particular small sequence within a large stream of numbers, etc.).For this example, I'd see the \"sliding window\" approach as an optimization of the brute force approach. That is, solve it first with the \"brute force\" approach (which will still be 'efficient' in computational terms, but will be a factor of n slower than necessary), and then solve it again with a sliding window approach.Solving a problem twice may sound lame or may sound like unneeded extra work, but in a situation like this will be satisfying because first, you'll be able to measure exactly how much faster the better approach is, and second, you'll have a \"testing client\" against which you can test your 'better' approach. For something like this, it's usually easier to make a mistake in the implementation of the more clever approach, so a handy testing method is to make a testing driver that solves your problems using both approaches.(I.e. the test driver tests some sample testing inputs against the 'dumb' solution way, as well as against the 'clever' solution way) and then stops if two clients give different results (which indicates that ONE of the approaches must be wrong for that particular input). Usually you'll end up with a bug or two in the 'clever' way, but by systematically comparing with the 'dumb' way, you can normally lay such bugs to rest in a fairly straightforward way (debugging will still be work to do it, of course, but it will never feel like you're totally stuck, because you'll have the alternate version to compare against).>I've seen many people say they took courses or they learned it in college, but I just cannot afford an expensive course let alone going to college. Does anyone have some advice?Robert Sedgewick et al's course on Algorithms is available free of charge on Coursera, the last time I checked (for auditing it); it's a pretty good course. You'll need the textbook to do the course properly, but I suppose you can find a low-cost edition, use a library, etc. if you cannot afford to buy that book.",

How to make processes work FOR people, or at least not totally against them.And now you’re thinking of leveling up in your ability to DO that kind of process-assistance stuff.

And how to make QR codes (hint: there’s a good Javascript package that runs in web pages). And figure out how to put data into a database like PostgreSQL. The point is to learn to imagine what is possible. As you’re doing that you can put together a nice consulting biz doing those kinds of things. Some people call this stuff “line-of-business apps”.",

Learning how to test your code and think about failure cases will also separate you fast from hobbyists. Since you already touch data and automation, a light dive into APIs, authentication, and how systems talk to each other would pay off quickly.One other thing worth developing is comfort reading other people’s code. Pick an open source project or a decent sized internal codebase and try to understand it without rewriting it. That skill maps directly to professional development work. You are already valuable because you bridge people, process, and code. The next step is making your solutions boring, reliable, and understandable to the next person who inherits them.",

Linux is kind of an umbrella term for a lot of similar operating systems. Every OS has a program called a kernel that deals with how much CPU time or memory to give to different programs. The Linux kernel is the thing that links Linux operating systems. From there, there are different \"distributions\" that pack in different software, like desktop layouts, ways to install software, and other tools and programs. Each distribution can feel different so it's worth experimenting a bit to find what you like. If you're trying to think what to use before you start to learn programming, it's not worth thinking about. Whatever's on your computer now is good enough. You'll learn more about operating systems when you need to.",

        "body": "Other people have explained the difference between an operating system and a distribution pretty well (and the distinction typically only applies to Linux - with MacOS and Windows, there is really no distinction between the concept of the operating system and the distribution).If you really want to learn about what operating systems do and how operating systems work, there is really no better way than to use Linux: with Linux, it's much easier to have access to the way that the operating system actually works and how the pieces come together, and the code of the Linux kernel is open source, so you can actually look at it if you want to. I would recommend making a USB drive with a Linux installation you can boot to if you don't already have Linux installed (Puppy Linux, MX Linux, and Slax are all good choices for this - a Linux distribution you can use from a keydrive and save your changes and files), or have a virtual system with Linux installed on it, or if you're really determined, install Linux on a partition, which can be a bit difficult to do. Another option could be to buy a Raspberry Pi, which is Linux-based, and play with that for many of your tasks.You can get books on Linux that will teach you plenty about how the operating system functions:\"The Linux Programming Interface\" by Kichael Kerrisk is viewed by many as a definitive encyclopedia for understanding how Linux works. You'll learn about making system calls, OS library functions, and the relationship between applications and the kernel in detail. You'll come away from that book with a whole new appreciation as to how OSes work.\"How Linux Works\" by Brian Ward. It really covers the glue that holds the OS together, covering the boot process, how the kernel manages hardware, and how networking and devices actually function under the hood.\"Modern Operating Systems\" by Andrew Tanenbaum is also a great book. It's not exclusively about Linux, but it will teach you the fundamental theory of OSes, such as process management, memory, and file systems that Linux is built on.Keep in mind that you don't **need** to really understand your operating system before you can start learning a programming language. Most programming languages these days run on all operating systems (with a few exceptions). Pick the language you want to learn, and there's a very good chance it will run on whatever operating system you already have installed on your computer, and will abstract away the differences between operating systems, which is one of the main functions of a programming language: that way, programs are portable, and can be run on any operating system.",

Each team can ship the services they own independently of other teams, which allows them to iterate faster and respond more quickly to issues.2. Security isolation. Isolating functionality reduces the blast radius if a component is compromised. If a monolith is compromised, then the attackers potentially have full access to everything.3. Reliability isolation. Similar to security isolation, reliability isolation means there is a smaller blast radius when a component fails. Following from #1, devops will also be easier when your teams only need to understand the components they own and deploy instead of needing to understand the whole monolith during on-call incidents.4. Scaling mismatches. Monoliths that contain multiple functional paradigms (for example both async batch processes and synchronous requests) can be very difficult to scale, performance tune, and cost tune. It is easier to scale and performance/cost tune systems when functional paradigms are isolated into separate services.5. Licensing/distribution issues. This one is probably the rarest in this list, but sometimes you need to isolate components due to billing/licensing/other business agreement purposes. Especially for per-cpu licenses, which kind of overlaps with #4.If you don't need anything in 1-5, then a monolith is probably fine.",

Unfortunately, I've seen diminishingly few video lecture series that are organized in this way (i.e. none). Sometimes, video lectures on platforms like Coursera have a limited amount of this kind of organization, e.g. \"pause the video and try to work out the solution\" type of stuff, but usually the problems presented in that kind of video situation are very simple \"fill in the blank\" or \"answer a conceptual question\" variety.TLDR: Get a textbook.",

You can't tackle any larger project, can't work together with others, etc. without understanding how a small part of a problem solved with code contributes towards solving a larger problem.In practical terms when you get a DSA exercises if I were you I'd just invest a little more time into planning, before doing the actual coding.- If it's more of a linear problem (you can tell if the problem reads like a sequential recipe) you can add markers or paragraph breaks where you think sub-problems start and end- if the problem description is more \"wild\" and all over the place instead of just trying to pull the problem apart through line breaks it's probably better if you create a list which on level 1 contains milestones and on level 2 contains the actual sub-tasks.

At least like 15 minutes but if you just never come up with ideas either pick easier problems or make the timer like 1-2 hours and just get so bored you start thinking. More precise idea is that you got some mental challenge like thinking you should be solving problems faster (overestimating your skill) or thinking you aren't good enough and so you don't even try (low self esteem and underestimating your skill or maybe picking problems that are beyond your ability). Idk I'm not you but if you can resolve those that could help.",

You don’t believe that you can solve the problem in front of you so you don’t even really try. Instead of looking for somebody to give you the answer, put that problem aside and try an easier one. Once you’ve solved some problems and feel pretty good about your problem solving skills, work your way back up to harder problems a little at a time. With a string of successful attempts behind you, you’ll have confidence in your ability to solve harder problems, experience in solving problems, and perhaps some determination to beat the problem in front of you.",

It's easy to fall into that trap, but what helped me was setting a timer for focused effort before I even look at a solution. The time pressure helps simulate what happens during interviews, anyway. During that time, I try everything - different approaches, simplifying the problem, drawing diagrams, sometimes even using pen and paper so the solution isn't an easy click for me. Even if I don't solve it, I write down my gaps/mistakes so I know what to improve on in terms of the problem-solving process.DSA exercises on LeetCode help, but I also found it effective to supplement my resources for more diversified learning. Look into textbooks, guides, and even entire platforms like Interview Query, as you get a breakdown of sample problems in a way that's applicable to interview settings - clear and concise. It really comes down to knowing your weak spots then making sure you're learning in a progressive way through structured resources.",

Use proper variable names, var0 tells me nothing. Same with folder1. 2. Use less comments. 3. Split your code into functions, this together with proper variable names makes your code easier to understand and will lessen the need for commenting everything. Make sure to use the local keyword on variables to limit the the scope of your variables to that function. 4. Use \"#!/usr/bin/env bash\" instead of \"#! /bin/bash\" as this is considered best practice as it makes fewer assumptions about the underlying system. 5. I'd prefer you created the Bookmarked and Originals folder after the colour definition, but this is just my preference as I'd expect definitions to come before commands. 6. Implement error handling and have the script clean up after itself if something fails. 7. Avoid shadowing your variables by naming a variable the same in nested code, see file. 8. Less nesting, use function calls. And that's all I've time for.",

Always be ready and willing to do the work that your experience tells you needs to be done.Take just one item from the list above, like reviews. A person who just \"knows a language\" often thinks, \"Hey, the code works. Why do I need anyone to review it? Why can't I just commit it and move on to the next thing?\" A good developer can explain *in detail* why reviews are needed, could teach a half-hour seminar on how to conduct an effective code review, and supply painful memories of times when poor or nonexistent reviews led to costly mistakes and recrimination.",

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the road less traveled by, and that has made all the difference\".",

Once you have your project set up, focus on displaying something - whether it's on a web page, or making a picture appear, or something move - whatever is the focus of your app.From there you can keep adding things gradually, testing to make sure all your previous stuff still works.

Usually Apache through WSL and MariaDB or SQLite for early development unless the project is specifically for learning other tools, or it’s for a client with other preferences. I test locally from 2 machines. The windows box I actually write on, and a Linux box based on the final deployment platform, both sitting in my home office.Then I set up a git repo. Make a .gitignore, set up a basic CI/CD pipeline if it’s for a client, sometimes I’ll do one for personal projects if I’m testing a new tool. Once everything is set up, I make a simple “Hello World” type page (unless the framework lets me generate one with a console command) to make sure both the server and the framework are working properly, and test both locally and on the test server.",

(If you're not yet familiar with github repositories, it's worth your trouble to spend some time doing that. [Read this](https://github.com/trending).My sell sheet tells the reader:1. What is this project?1. Who is it for?1. What does it do for those people it's for?1. Why should they use it?1. How do they get it?1. How do they get started using it?1. How do they find out more?I write this stuff down, super rough, for myself, as I dream up the project. I'm writing it as if the project is finished. Writing the sell sheet that way takes some imagination about the completed project. By the way, contracts for megabucks for software development look something like this sell sheet. I suggest you try writing a sell sheet for your project. It's a structured way to guide your imagination into figuring it out.Once you know pretty clearly what you want to do, figuring out how to do it becomes much much easier.You got this. Do good work!",

C or C++ are definitely not bad languages to learn those, as you will have to deal with many aspects of programming and learn a lot about how a computer works as well.I would like to caution you however, as working with these languages can also be frustrating, especially for a newbie. And I feel like you could lose motivation quickly because of that (especially because some of what you write seems to be very ambitious or even hints at perfectionism). Therefore I would suggest starting out with Python first - and then you can always fall back on that for the \"quick and dirty\" stuff and/or ideation. Or maybe give CS50X a shot, that gives you a good overview and you will learn lots of languages along the way. Don't get fooled by the first lecture, it will get a lot harder after that.",

Here it goes:I can offer my perspective as a junior. Got a job a year before graduation.TLDR: It’s still possible to make it, but you need a degree *with* internships. If you want to guarantee yourself a job, it’s going to be *hard* work, unless you’re a genius. I’m not a genius. Caveat that I’m Canadian, the market might be better or worse where you are.More details to give you an idea: I left my previous stem degree in 2022 when I realized that it wasn’t likely to yield a stable job. I started the CS degree in 2022. I’d programmed a bit before, always liked math and it seemed like a field with a bright future. I jumped in. Things turned sour for my cohort very quickly. By late 2022, many internships were rescinded, postings on universities’ coop programs dropped dramatically, the layoffs *started*. I was pretty dismayed by this to be honest, I’d left a degree that I loved in large part for improved job prospects and now there was a very real chance that it had been a poor decision. My family and I are really not rich (lower middle class at best) so I didn’t have much a choice, I wasn’t sure what else I could do either so I decided to work *hard*. I got perfect grades, I worked on eyebrow raising side projects, I TAed a math heavy class (thanks to my previous background in my other degree), I prepped for interviews. Got my first internship in my first year of the CS degree. Had to move to a different city temporarily for it. I didn’t quite like the particular field that it was in but it was really important for my CV, I finished it and got a good review. Didn’t want to stay in the city I moved to, so I decided to find another internship. Kept doing all of the above mentioned extracurriculars and still kept my grades very high. Meanwhile, things kept deteriorating for most of my cohort, the “best” students got internships, the majority did not. Keep in mind that I’m in coop so internships are *mandatory*.Prepped harder for interviews. Got a bigger company for the second one. If my first internship taught me anything it’s that if you want to be kept on after in this job market, you better be really good. I hit the ground running at this one, lost track of the hours I put into upskilling for it. I also took classes to not put off my graduation date. By the end of the 4 months, I was shipping year end deliverables. They were pretty happy and kept me on. Salary is about 80-90k TC. Quite good for a new grad in Canada. It’s been a huge relief and I’m immensely grateful for it.End all be all, success story in adverse job market conditions, but I want to be honest with you. I haven’t had a life for the past 2 and a half years or so. It’s literally all been school and working on side projects and interview prep and TAing. Now it’s working and still going to school. My relationship blew up and I haven’t been able to date because I just don’t have time, I don’t see my friends often. My own family that I live with doesn’t even talk to me often because I’m always in my room working one way or the other, they’re understanding and supportive though.I don’t want to complain at all because this is a thousand times preferable to being poor, but I want to highlight that this is what it takes to *guarantee* yourself a job now. You have to be the best of the best, whatever best means to the job market. Most of my cohort has not gotten internships and quite a few universities are working out deals with students: decreasing the number of internships, loosening the requirements of what classes to take when, actively involving themselves in our search. The situation has continued to devolve, at the entry level, things are not improving but actively getting worse.",

Stick around, study, interview for other positions. If you get laid off, hopefully you get a severance.Look at it this way, you might interview at some place you can tell from the outside is going to be worse than your current company. It might pay less. So, there's no reason for you to take the position. But if you're out of work, and really need the money (or health insurance!), then you might have to take the position.Keep the leverage you currently have. If you're complaining about having a hard time getting interviews, it might be even harder without a job. It will definitely make you panic more. And some companies will genuinely lowball you if they they you're in a bad spot.",

Lacking focus in the sense that \"SWE, data analysis, data engineer, and data science\" are all \\*very\\* different types of roles.

The only difference is the tools in your toolbox. Engineering majors do a much better job teaching this than CS.- you’re better prepared for data/noise analysis. P99 metrics, understanding distributions or finding a root cause for skew etc are all covered in EE, and I notice people with pure CS struggle with it- harder to self teach: my labs had $100k+ worth of equipment to learn on, whereas I was able to self teach software development using online resources.

Let’s take civil for example. You have transportation, structure, utilities, water resources as some big sections. Utilities, and water resources tend to be the most stable as they have long contracts and steady work. Plus they can and will do work for other sections. Transportation is boom or bust. If the local DOT slows down or shuts down work they are in a bad spot and harder to cross train. Structure is very heavy tide to construction so boom or bust. You see sections in cs like that as well but we can and do jump industries fairly easily so it is much more wild. I am in my 4th industry in my career and most likely not my last. Every time I changed jobs I change the industry I am working for. My wife is on her 4th employer but same base industry the entire time in civil engineering (water resources). Mine has been iOS most of my career but I have worked for 4 very different industries. It is different work. Don’t chase the paycheck. Chase the type of work you enjoy. I enjoy software engineering and mobile engineering. That being said if I was not getting paid to do it I don’t code and gladly would hang up my software engineering if I didn’t need money.

This is speaking as someone who has worked as a mechanical engineer (product designer) and an electrical engineer and currently works in software; software is leagues ahead of the other fields in terms of pay and benefits. Software also lets you work wherever you want; as a meche for example, a large part of the job markets is located in the middle of the country in relatively less desirable LCOL areas, and these companies are often boomer-led and have outdated work practices.This sub tends to glorify other fields similarly to how it glorifies the trades.

Then I’ll say “hey ai add this to my menu” - but I built the menu, I understand how it works. I think that stuff is actually going to be more valuable and more important as more people start relying on AI, cause AI writes some really junky code sometimes, and if you have basic engineering skills, you can see it and fix it quickly. The people who just rely on AI will go down endless rabbit holes with it as it guesses at fixes and eventually makes it work, but potentially in ways that are brittle or even just bad ideas.",

The way my last employer pushed AI tools was exhausting and I suspect my lack of use was a reason I didn't make the cut. It's hard not to see the long-term future as bleak. LLMs are a constant advancing threat to our jobs, and if that's not what ends up taking my next one, it'll just end up in India. If I do somehow find security, it will be in a job that I don't find nearly as fun anymore in a post-LLM world. And this isn't even getting into the headache that they have introduced into the job hunting process itself. I can't decide which future feels scarier, the one where the AI data center bubble pops or the one where it doesn't. I know LLMs aren't the silver bullet they're being marketed as but I don't think that matters much until the bloodythirsty C-suite ghouls stop drinking the kool-aid. To me it feels like the better outcome is for the bubble to pop but that could mean half a decade of a job market that will make 2025 feel like 2021. It all has me giving serious thought to a complete career pivot into a field with a stronger human element that provides better protection from LLMs.In summary, yeah, this environment is completely overwhelming",

It is ok to ballpark and \"saved X dev hours\" is a type of claim I've seen many times.For some things, we call them \"zero-to-one\" initiatives, where the impact of completion/rollout of the feature is self-explanatory (e.g. \"there was no two factor auth, now there is\")The real catch is that metrics solely for STAR format's sake won't necessarily look good, and it's a backwards way of thinking about things. E.g. \"saved dev hours\" sure, but to what end? Do they actually deliver more features or does the time end up being spent on other ancillary tasks w/ same overall velocity anyways?Metrics are supposed to provide finality to an overarching story that has actual metrics, so that the narrative sounds coherent rather than an aimless rambling. Just tacking on whatever metric to the end of a project doesn't necessarily make for a compelling STAR format story, just like adding sprinkles to the top of a poop cake doesn't make it a nice cake.",

They ballpark a number based on what they know and slap it in there expecting nobody to dig in too far.I think having actual real metrics comes easier working at some companies vs others. If you are at a company where the SW team comes up with their own work then part of that is justifying why it's important to do. More times than not metrics are likely to fall out of that. All of my 15 YOE has been at R&D companies working on greenfield medical device projects, think dialysis machines. It was very top down management style where you do as you are told at the product level. SWEs have control of code level design, but not really the direction of the productSo asking me to justify why did I implement X major feature over 1 year is on the level of asking why did you put as gas and break pedal in a car or why is there an infotainment system in the car. It's there because it's expected to be there if you want people to use your product.So asking me to put in metrics on my resume is pretty hard since we are implementing things on the project for the first tome and not iterating and improving something. Why did we need some feature comes down to the product owner saying this is what is needed based on conversations with X/Y/Z important person at the end of the day.There is obviously all shades of grey between the two extremes I gave as examples. Frankly I have no actual metrics on my resume. My bullets are along the lines of: I accomplished \\[X\\], that provides \\[Y\\] value, by doing \\[Z\\]. It works ok enough to get some visibility, but I don't have companies banging down my door to get me to interview or anything like that.",

If you can spend a few years expanding your skillset, you can possibly find opportunities at a non-profit or university, but those roles are incredibly competitive this year. The work you want to be doing is no longer being done by large enterprises. They used to pretend to do it, but now they don't feel the need to put up a guise of ethical behavior or initiatives because of the current political climate. Even back then, it really was mostly a guise to give off the impression they were ethical.",

I went from Java + Spring in AWS to .NET + C# with Azure and bare metal. Its a learning curve but something you shouldn't shy away from. I'm not saying you have to expand your horizon, or even take the job, but you should be having more interviews, preferrably multiple with companies you'd never work for so you can build confidence and experience for them.

        "body": "Ok, the rest of reddit seems to be outside of the track and I will provide you with real experience from my point of view:High performance programming is definitely real and highly desirable. Usually it's called \"real time programming\" or High performance computing (HPC). It involves supercomputer or regular computer to solves problem or process immense amount of data. Or it could be low latency code. Anything that is not web based usually will be subject to a tighter ressources allocation and thus performance being more important. Think of something mass produced, throwing 50$ more for better ram because you produced shit code and the price of the product is around 50$... It's just not acceptable.A real life example:Sicentific computing is usually very computing heavy for things like simulations or lots of dimensional processing (think RGBs processing but on 280++ channels instead of just 3). These sometimes have tight performance requirements such as processing before another data package is generated. My job is essentially that. I take bleeding edge reasearch code in python made by physicist and optimize the shit out of it so it takes little to no time to process. Initially the processing time was 18h ++ per dataset and now it's down to sub 2h making it so that we process faster than we acquire. This means it's processed in real time and you can have the results immediately which is neat for aviation decision, threat detection and all stuff highly critical.Usually it will require you to work with people of other domain which is very fun I think. You become good at physics, geospatial and other math heavy domain which makes leetcode feels even more stupid (because the time/space complexity is not all you look for in performance computing and usually one of the easiest thing to optimize). Overall, it's a very rewarding field as you may be recruted for satellites, geospatial, lots of physics project that are bleeding edge, quantum computing, etc.",

My teams (also at “rainforest”) have all of the juniors working on infra at some point, and I highly recommend OP taking a step back and looking at the “meta” tasks. Explicitly “building AWS infrastructure” without seeing the patterns is a gap worth focusing on. I know life at that company suck and people will ghost you, but there are many people who WILL bend over backwards to help you figure these things out given you’ve done some digging yourself and can ask informed questions.In my experience pretty much all feature work at all levels is going to have to consider business logic and deployments to a service that runs on compute, extend or create DAOs that write to databases, add routing rules for new APIs to an LB, and update front ends — the foundation for an application; lambdas and queues and ddb streams are all very common patterns too. That alone is a really good place to start researching trade offs, which is something you can do very intentionally while building, or even by looking through low severity system issues during oncalls. If you’re on the hook for LLDs, there’s even more room to dig into trade offs and alternatives.",

But at the same time, it’s a clear incremental improvement over classic Vim from 20 years ago.Modern debuggers are similarly old. I was showing a class of CS majors who hadn’t seen one how to use ‘em back when I was in school. I am consistently shocked by how many very experienced devs have never once used a debugger. I mean, even IntelliJ predates me by a bit. Of course, it wasn’t the hands-down best Java IDE for a bit, but now I wouldn’t work without it. VSCode is maybe the single most overrated thing in our space today. Yes, I have used it. No, I don’t like it very much. There are better text editors out there that don’t consume gobs of memory. That said, I do wish that `jq` had been around to be included in any version of the Single Unix Specification.ETA: I just realized that Git came out after I started.

You should relax!\"). **If you're ambitious, never listen to anyone who tells you to relax.** Take that as their own personality or goals being incongruent with yours and shed their advice like dust off your shoulder.\\- Then took a few grad school IT (\"MIS\") and Statistics courses\\- Moved to SF Bay. The combo of Digital Marketing, SQL & R / Statistics knowledge from grad school classes helped me land a data integration job in a marketing company\\- Was tough to break into 100% Software Engineering w/o some real programming projects and a portfolio, so I created a prototype full stack app. **(I lived in a tent** while working at cafes/libraries; **on a rural ranch** while doing **landscaping part time for rent**; and **later, in mexico after camping on a California beach became too tough** due to people waking me up for trespassing)-- my Dad's advice of \"How much do you want it?\" echoing in my mind when I'd need to encourage myself. As well as motivational music, and motivational speeches, regularly playing in my headphones while building the app for about 6 months-- 2-3 months of that involved just learning, 3-4 months was knowledgeably building or trial/error building)\\- Two weeks later, landed remote job doing full stack clojure (programming language)\\- 2 months later, hired as a digital marketing / data engineering consultantAfter that last job, it was all down hill-- had recruiters regularly contacting me. Applied to jobs and landed interviews decently easily. Worked a variety of contract & salaried full stack jobs. Even got into a DevOps job by continuing to learn new skills at work and in free time.Then the industry took a big shit in 2022-2023 due to a confluence of: AI, H1B, Tax law changes, Covid money running out.I got laid off. Now about to build my own ecommerce project.",

Networking is crucial; reconnect with former colleagues, attend meetups, or join online communities to hear about opportunities and get referrals.

You wouldn’t expect a coffee shop to be a leading data analytics, real estate mogul, and stock trading company, but here we are.Anyways, if the general economy goes down a little across a bunch of industries, tech goes down a lot. On the flip side, when the economy goes up a little, tech explodes.I don’t think we’ve exhausted all the creative ways to use software yet either.By the way, how much of the economy is boring B2B transactions we don’t think about as end users? That’s where a lot of the money in tech lies as well. Pole tend to just think about websites but don’t consider the amount of money that goes into tracking payroll or keeping inventory.",

For example, home automation is one of mine.Most \"smart home\" tech is incredibly stupid and as a result if you really want it to do smart things, you need to get into the weeds of the tech. That work needs to run somewhere, so that's an excuse for building a home lab. Having a home lab also opens up other wishes, like a Plex media server or backup solution for the family's computers, etc.If I'm building a home lab and building/running all these services, it only makes sense to build it all with IaC and keep track of everything with Git, just like I'd do in a professional setting. Maybe I won't PR myself and yolo it all right into main, but otherwise I'm building things out for my home with the same tools, tech, and patterns I use professionally.Because of this I'm very often doing \"POC\" work for my job on my own home lab first. *That's* where I built my skills first for example, in building and running k8s clusters and all the downstream details that brings for how I structure my code to run on k8s, how do I handle CI/CD cleanly to deploy, etc.When it comes to actual software, I'm coding a lot of family management apps to help track kid chores, keep our finances in order, etc. I'm also coding on robotics and drone projects, including some with/for my kids to run their Lego robot creations. Beats the hell out of building yet another \"pet store\" tutorial app I'll never care about.But always building my own stuff as \"professional grade\" and not just half-assing it because \"it's just for me so who cares\".",

Did that once to see how Nuxt, Svelte, Blazor etc would compare to my current old stuff (Vue+.NET backend).

It sounds to me like you are thinking in terms of android apps that are front-ends (effectively, websites). Thus, your logical conclusion is that to gain 'more depth' and employability, you should develop expertise in all parts of the application (i.e., backend).I want to challenge that point of view, and emphasize a few job-niches where smartphone apps really leverage the local computing power of a Snapdragon-level processor. In these cases, the app is not only a *part* of the project, it is *integral*. The android expertise you have is incredibly valuable for this use case.Take [ATAK-Civ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atakmap.app.civ) for example. It is a micro-ecosystem of apps and plugins that are used as tools for first-responding and security. Companies develop ATAK plugins using standard android tools, to do things like build software controllers for drones within ATAK, or stream health data from smartwatches of field operatives.Alternatively, Android (the operating system) is used by some companies for their own non-smartphone products. I recently interviewed with a company that builds treadmills. The treadmills use stock android for their OS and applications to serve standard functionality to their users and control hardware.These are small companies, sure. There are hurdles to finding these, especially since you're not in the US. You will have to do research to find such companies. And they may pay less than a large company like the one you're at, because the scale of the revenue they generate is going to be intrinsically smaller (the other side of that coin is that the revenue is shared with fewer individuals, so you may actually get paid pretty well anyway). But they are working on *cool shit,* and they want experts in the tools to help them do so.Source: I am one of those guys working on cool shit",

I asked ChatGPT and it says Austin is better:https://chatgpt.com/share/694cb77f-f034-800b-bbac-7d4604a8907cHouston is a much bigger city, in terms of population and geography. As an Austin-resident, I think Houston has better restaurants, and especially better ethnic food. But I'd believe ChatGPT that there are more tech jobs in Austin, in a much smaller geography.If you want funded startups, none of Texas is competitive with California, New York, Boston, or even second tier startup places.",

Then I'd be able to explain what HTTP/websocket/graphql/rest requests and routing you'd make (ie i'd have a get /users, a post /users/signin, post users/register, get /data, post /data), be able to explain authorization vs authentication and how'd you'd implement JWTs in all of this, what kind of database you'd use and why. Then some basic devops implementation choices, ie ec2 server with nginx, api gateway with lambdas, how you'd handle scaling.I think system design is really just knowing about what the available tools are, and why you'd make one choice over another and the drawbacks and benefits of them. Using react or just plain javascript or nextjs, SQL vs NoSQL, lambdas vs EC2, ECS vs Kubernetes, client side rendering vs server side rendering (ie maybe you dont want server side rendering with immediately important information like financial data or medical data, but otherwise you'd want it especially publicly facing applications).",

With my job and what worked for me was asking my team leader if there were any areas where he felt I was lacking or could improve. The company had fortnightly 1 on 1 with me and my team leader so I could have regular private conversations and ask about my performance. For “stepping up” for that getting ahead in your own time management is good, if I was running short on work and would have nothing to do soon, I would shoot an email to my team leader giving him an update on my progress, that I should be finished soon and ask if there’s anything specific that he wants me to work on next. Another good thing to do is shared knowledge. This isn’t something everyone can do in the first year. In my job we recently started trying out a new tool to help speed up debugging part of the software we use, because I had less work I had more time to allocate to learning the specifics and how to set up quickly and link it up. Because of this when senior team members had the time to sit down and go over it, I was able to “train” them on the new tool and pass on everything I learned to speed up their onboarding on the tool. Just because a team member is senior to you does not mean you can’t help them. Also they won’t know everything. If a senior is asking questions about what will and won’t work, sometimes it’s good to jump in and ask/offer to test the question for them. “I don’t know but I can try and find out for you” has been a great response to many situations at my job.",

This is likely on your 6-12 months, if you are confident that it won’t affect your current workflow, you should take it on and notify the team.I focused on shipping the features I had to ship until I realized I am either 2-3 weeks ahead of deadline or I am working less than 30hrs a week.Career growth can also be jumping ship to a bigger company, but this carries a lot of risk.

I think double major in math and CS is a good fit. I’ve had friends who were really good at programming and computer science knowledge in hs who went on to top programs in the U.S. where they were challenged in their honors CS classes. Like I had a buddy who had to write a rudimentary OS as part of his honor’s OS class. This will challenge even a good programmer. If you look for ways to learn and grow, you will.ETA: I see you’re going to MIT. You’re going to be challenged there overall from talking with folks, so I wouldn’t discount that having some classes you already know some stuff about might be a good thing",

That only matters if you're talking to an actual engineer, or engineering manager, who knows the difference between \"wrote HelloWorld in Rust\" and \"on the Rust board of directors\". Most HRBPs/recruiters don't know the difference, and speak \"years of accredited education\" and \"years of professional experience\" exclusively, and those are the people deciding whether your application/resume ever lands in the inbox of a manager with an open [req](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150317-00/?p=44453).Be sure to emphasize the internship and accredited education in your resume first and foremost. The portfolio, or interesting GitHub personal projects, can and should be a footnote below things recruiters/HRBPs are specifically looking for. I'll also add that tinkering alone, by yourself, on a project is not nearly as useful as collaborating with a team on a project. Because in the real world, most engineers work as a part of a team or teams to get stuff done. Consider contributing to well-known open source projects. Understand that step 0 of contributing meaningfully to most open source projects is: You understand what the project is, and who its end users are, on a deep level. That can take anywhere from days/weeks/years depending on the complexity of the project. And \"I was part of SIG release for Kuberenetes 1.31\" is easier for a recruiter/HRBP to grok than \"look at this chatbot I made, isn't it neat\". It's especially easier to grok if that recruiter/HRBP is staring at a req with the word \"Kubernetes\" in 5 different places.For extra emphasis; Fix your resume first before you spend time chasing shiny open source projects. Also, the job market just extra sucks right now -- sorry about that. Not much to be done about organizations shy around adding headcount.",

Because I want you in a position where you have **zero pressure** to make a move. If the team isn’t right, the scope doesn’t excite you, the comp isn’t real, or the location/logistics don’t fit your life, you can walk away without blinking....I prefer to live in a world and I always assume, most recruiters have positive intent in what they're doing and there's no malicious intent behind their actions.",

What are the circumstances where you would imagine that happening? For whatever it might be worth, I took recruiter calls frequently at my last job over the course of 2 years. I spoke with at least a 8-12 of them in this time and while most were one time conversations, some of them I went further with multiple communications. Never once was it a problem, and it eventually led to me finding a position that was a monumentally better fit for me and I made the move. I, personally, wouldn’t sweat having a conversation here and there. It’s good for you, I don’t think your concerns of your current job finding out are realistic (but maybe I’m wrong about that), and if you end up not liking what the recruiter is selling you then you just move on, no big deal. Best case scenario is you find something you’re excited about. You never know.",

Even the ones who just did typical math theses generally ended up as SWEs or data scientists if they didn't stay in academia, although this was pre-2023. So on the face of it, I do not think the PhD granting department being math vs CS is a big deal.However, yeah, some of your red flags are red flags. The repayment thing is brutal, attrition in PhD programs is very high and you don't want that hanging over your head. Why isn't it funded with TA or RA positions like a typical STEM PhD? You don't have to pay back your tuition waiver from those. Internships not being allowed is horrible if you're pursuing an industry role.Regarding your potential PI being new, do they have tenure yet? The last thing you need is your advisor going up for tenure and not getting it, and at least if you're in the US, that's a very real risk these days. I have a few friends from grad school who went the academic route and will be up for tenure soon, and despite playing their cards well, they're all very worried about this.So math vs CS, no real worries, but imo you are right to have reservations.",

Internships, connections, and ML conference papers are how people get jobs at those labs. Without putting in extra work, and potentially a lot of extra work, you won't have any of those three. Personally, I'd do it only if I were at peace with the full range of potential post-PhD outcomes. That includes not just the best case where you end up at an industry lab, but also worse cases including rejoining industry at basically the same level you are now (albeit with a PhD, or after mastering out) or being a postdoc. If what you'd work on during your PhD isn't so compelling to you to the extent that it doesn't matter where you end up after you're done, I wouldn't do it. I did my PhD at Stanford and I saw so many bright and talented people strike out on the industry research job market only to settle for \"worse\" jobs, including as data scientists or postdocs. That said, you don't have to view the next application cycle as your last chance, as I've seen many people start a PhD in their 30s or 40s or even later. But it is hard to justify applying again if you're not bringing something new to the table in your new application.",

Mine, for now, is something involving the modeling of risk. Operational / finance / etc risk for sure. I want to also create algorithms for risk. Like take a business algorithm, evaluate, model that, and then come up with other ideas and then do the same, then bring all the avenues together and come up with a suggestion of what to do and deliver that to business people. That's my goal.

This code is templatey enough that it's feasible to auto-generate in a lot of cases and I have a codegen project I'm working on that I'll probably add this to at some point or another, at least for fairly trivial objects like the ones I'm creating there. You can create threads and do background processing while Python is off doing other things, it's a fantastic way to work.Meta is pretty C++-oriented, there seems to be a lot of stuff for AI researchers right now though who knows where the industry will be in a couple years. Working with video, in aerospace or on projects with embedded code are all pretty C++-heavy positions at the moment. If you're getting heavily into it, you should probably get comfortable setting up your CMake instrumentation and maybe experiment with test driven development if you have some free time. I'd never fully drunk the whole test driven development kool-aid to the point of \"write your first test before you write your first class\", but I was pretty close to that on my codegen project and it's a great way to get unstuck with your design and focus on the very next thing in front of you.

A masters is a long ass time so I’d do as much due diligence as possible. Working at a SaaS company that is scaling may give you way more insight than just being able to do black scholes models or Monte Carlo sims. You literally can build tools that could make simple arbitrage plays just between stocks and corporate convertible bonds of a pool of companies. Does your schoolHave a portfolio club or anything that does investing or simulation? How about a Bloomberg or Factset terminal ? Is there an MBA program or mathmarics program ? How far are you from any kind of exchange ? I’d go chat as much as I could with actual people doing the development work where possible. See what they are doing and what the trends in exchanges are and data sellers with content based on what they have for their conferences. Ask to get a ticket to a conference because we love students attending. IMHO- the creativity in certain areas of finance and strategy is really epic. But there are some boring sectors that people stay out of due to regulations as well that are ripe for iteration rather than disruption. When I worked in fin tech building a software platform on the buy side , we had clients who used EXCEL macros from years prior to run their money . And those firms printed money. And that doesn’t even touch foreign markets and all the flavors of hedge funds. Again these tools open up so many sectors and not just finance. Look at how Budweiser created BUDnet to track their inventory and advertising. There is a ton of fascinating stuff out there.",

You don't really have a choice, just curriculum wise, you will eventually meet your maker if you believe in memorization as a true learning form. Computer science in that way breaks a lot of traditional learning isms about college in general. Because there IS some very real applied form of it (programming) unlike a lot of other fields that would require more set up.Anyway, i feel you. The only way to move forward imo is to have one foot in college and one foot out. When you're in school, listen, do the assignments, study etc. When you're out of class, be working on your side projects, doing leetcode, learning some other tool etc. It isn't easy.

You should probably ask yourself how do you actually learn skills.For most people, some combination of spaced repetition and recalling things from memory is usually how they retain information. So, transposing to coding, you may need to build the \"muscle memory\" in layers, e.g. first memorize syntax, then memorize specific API signatures, then eventually memorize semantics of the APIs.Syntax can be learned by just coding a lot and running the code to validate that the syntax is correct. API signatures can be memorized via exercises called Katas (basically do the same thing from memory multiple times) or just using them frequently enough. Semantics start to become easier to memorize once the \"lower\" layers become more second nature.",

Questions I usually ask juniors are related to the above questions. But then also I tend to focus on ability to problem solve, take constructive criticism, and ability to work with a team. So I’ll ask questions like;Tell me about a time you were unsure of how to approach a solution. What did you do?Tell me about a time you and a coworker had a disagreement about something, how did you resolve it?Things like that. First one tells me about your problem solving skills and is an indicator of how recognizing you don’t know what you don’t know. I also ask seniors this except in a way that shows they have the ability to mentor juniors. The second one is important because in software there are a million ways to solve one issue. Some better than others, but they’re all a solution regardless. It will let me know how you approach these kinds of situations that come up a lot of times in code reviews and architecting out solutions (no I don’t expect a junior to do this) But as a junior, we’re expecting to have to hand hold for aGood bit to get you comfortable and get you onboarded. So these questions and skills are important as they tell us whether you’re worth the effort it’ll take away from development to do said hand holding",

I have my own projects on the side but I did not have to deal with problems of scale, availability or other aspects of enterprise development that a mid-level would need to be able to handle. I've seen a few internships that are specifically only for undergraduates but largely they've been open to both undergrad and grad students, which I am, and prefer prior project/work experience, which I have.

You can join community college for 2 years, transfer into University of Washington which has one of the best programs in the country (and the major is easier to get into via cc transfer) and then be connected directly to Seattle tech. The amount of people they send to Amazon and Microsoft alone is crazy. I'm not super familiar with Vancouver WA but I know it's right next to Portland and they PROBABLY have some community college. Might need to be in state but it might not be too crazy of a move probably since it's so close (obviously depends on your situation). This will take like 4 years btw but will set you up well",

There's not many companies that will use python for their backend. Most postings will either use Java with springboot or C# with some .NET library. But react is an industry standard for front-end. Btw, front-end devs dont do UI/UX design. Someone else does that and the FE devs just implement the design given to them.Once you feel comfortable using whatever language and library you choose, the next steps are to at least have some basic level of understanding of containerization (docker and kubernetes), cloud engineering (AWS or Azure usually), and CI/CD pipelines (github actions). If you can build a full front-end app, containerize it with docker, and deploy the kubernetes pod to a azure/aws instance using github actions, you should be a really really strong candidate in your interviews. This whole last paragraph isnt required for a BE or fullstack position, but they are big plus-es",

Also people can ask different questions that you won't see coming. There's just too many possible questions and then they dive into those questions so telling a lie that seems believable is extremely difficult for me which is why I refuse to lie going forward.",
