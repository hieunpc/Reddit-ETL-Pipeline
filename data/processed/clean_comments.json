Many aren't even coders, aside from using a minimal amount of notebook-hosted python and SQL.I think it is important to realize that many folks build solutions by connecting a bunch of software components together using configuration. They focus on these third-party components and show little interest in underlying software engineering concepts. Some may not even know the implication when choosing between rowstore and columnstore, or between one language/runtime or another.Sometimes this just seems like a community of chefs who talk about microwave dinners, and they focus primarily on the type of microwave that cooks the fastest.

Today’s platforms have to support analytics, data science, and increasingly AI workloads alongside traditional BI.The criticism of Databricks and Snowflake feels a little unfair; they are not trying to replace data warehousing fundamentals, they are trying to support multiple workloads. Both platforms can absolutely deliver a well-designed data warehouse if the right discipline is applied.In my experience, the real issue is people rather than platforms; there is a strong tendency to chase modern tools and certifications while neglecting core concepts such as data modelling and integration. I regularly see engineers openly say they have no interest in modelling, which I would argue is foundational to being effective in this space.So I agree with the spirit of the post; that we have lost sight of fundamentals. I do not think modern platforms are the culprit; they simply expose gaps in skills and architectural thinking that were always there.",

In data analytics and engineering the real problems are and always have been people and processes. Technology only enables them. What actually got us here is weak data management and governance.That said, I also partly agree with the criticism. Modern data stack tooling has reached a point where many organizations think that throwing Databricks or Snowflake at every data problem and calling it done is enough. This is especially true in organizations where IT (which should not be the owner of data in the first place) is expected to “fix” data issues. They look for technological solutions to what are, in reality, problems of processes, roles, ownership, and culture. In that sense, the frustration expressed by Inmon is very much understandable.So the concept of the data warehouse did not fail. Technology simply made it easier to avoid the hard work. Vendors and consultants sold a convenient illusion. Integration and enterprise data are not a tooling problem, they are a design choice and an organizational commitment, and a governance problem. Expecting a platform to solve that is exactly the mistake that keeps repeating itself. Blaming modern platforms for the decline of data warehousing feels like blaming a database for poor data modeling. The real issue is that many organizations never built enterprise data capabilities in the first place.",

Even if you only have a single DE, they can use Kimball to guide the modelling that they do. And, depending on the needs of the organization, it isn't critical to make the model gigantic and intricate. Like most things, limit it to what you are working on and the level you need it at.Some specifics - Mesh is very much a decentralized approach, though the specifics vary quite a bit based on who you talk to. But in a Mesh environment, pulling a healthy fact table across is what you want to have happen. It allows that cross-group information flow, while minimally impacting either group. Yes, it is a dependency, but point to point isn't bad as long as there aren't too many; at which point you start looking at a central repository for these cross-group objects in place of point-to-point. dbt for all, I agree is not a good ideal and fortunately not one I've come across in the wild.",

You generate the code to download the historical weather and air quality data (backfilling) into feature groups (tables) and write an incremental pipeline to download weather forecasts, weather observations, and air quality observations. The 1st challenge you will encounter is how to perform a temporal join to join air quality observations with weather observations. This requires an ASOF LEFT JOIN between the tables. Only a few data warehouses support it it (and Hopsworks feature store). You want that data back in Python (e.g., Pandas DataFrames) to train the model. Hopsworks provides that data via Arrow from the Lakehouse tables. If you go via JDBC/ODBC to your data warehouse, performance will be vile - Arrow (ADBC or ArrowFlight) is best for Python clients.My book (referenced in the thread) covers these fundamental skills of backfilling vs incremental pipelines and data models - star schema, snowflake schema data model and OBT (don't use this for ML!).",

The fact is the rating calculated by the ML based on history available at the time the CR was calculated.

Librarianship is a skill.All of the above are massively under valued. SOLID principles are great for software development. Single responsibility and DRY work for documentation too.CMS experience taught me that documents are made up of reusable sections and templates. Being able to pull relevant sections into a document is a trick that has been around for decades.Gen-AI can't polish a turd but it can roll it in glitter.If the source documentation is well structured and focused on a specific context the Gen AI stands a much better chance of outputting what we need",

I'm not even talking about grammar, because I'm also bad with it (I'm not native in English). However, I don't like texts that are not straightforward to the goal.One example is dbt documentation. This doc was driving me crazy because it was too verbose with stupid things. For example, in the section about the dbt folder structures, they spend 3 or 4 paragraphs explaining why organization is important. I don't care for it, everyone knows that organization is important, just go to the point and tell us how to organize in DBT.I have the doc here, you can take a look. Basically 70% of the text is useless to understand dbt organization. https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overviewIn the documentation we have to be direct to the goal of the tool and explain how it works. There is no need to make stupid analogies for 5 years old kids. Who is reading the docs is expert enough to understand it.",

Personally I had an epiphany when I realized that IT is more like the fashion industry complete with “fashion shows” (like reInvent), but our resumes are where we see if we’re fashion forward or not.

E.g. requiring that analytics solutions only use data from gold when in production, but allowing analysts to utilize tables from other layers for their development and testing iterations. Dogmatic approaches is reminiscent of the age-old debate/criticism of centralized data warehouses that took years to develop before anyone in the business would get data access, which reduced their value and usefulness and accelerated the development of \"shadow BI\"-setups in business departments that didn't get their needs met. You can't develop in a vacuum and expect users to accept a (to them) long delivery time just because you want to run the data through all the layers in your architecture. Of course, you also have to protect your setup and governance, but sometimes speed of delivery is more important than perfected delivery.",

If you're doing everything incrementally there's little cost impact of that vs daily. But if you're doing a bit that's full refresh at the same time consider different frequencies based on day of week & hour of day. Ex: weekdays are every 15 minutes, but night & weekends are hourly. * Consider using aggregate tables for common dashboard pages. * Pay attention to database optimizations for files and tables.

For example, the name of a source, its connection, the name of the tables, and so on.Pros: scalable, easy to add new sources (just add a config)Cons: Harder to understand than \\[2\\] as there is an extra layer of abstraction (the \"metadata\" layer)2. Ease of understanding -- simply have processes for each source that move and/or process the data. It's a bit easier to understand for other people and new joiners since there's just one thing to look at which could be a bit more scalable in the future since other people can chime instead of you bottlenecking your data teamI've seen 2 work well when there isn't loads of data but a big need for data in the company. \\[1\\] works well in say traditionalindustries like manufacturing where realistically it will always be a central data or IT team trying to process probably quite a lot of data, so it depends but the key always is design first then modularity IMO",

        "body": "At my last job I built out a bunch of different ETL pipelines over about 4 years. At different layers of the stack there's different approaches.For custom API extractor's, I wrote the first two as completely separate. Then when I was working on the third, I started by copy-pasting stuff from the first two, looked at where things were identical and put as much of the overlapping code as I could into a library. Then I made all of our future extractors use that library. We were writing them in go so this took the form of an interface which extended `io.reader` that the custom extractor would implement.For loading, using the aforementioned library produced data in a standard format along with a schema file that could be used to generate a snowflake load statement. Then we had a single snowflake load component defined in our task orchestrator which we re-used everywhere, changing only the configuration. (We used argo-workflows as our task orchestrator instead of Airflow. I... don't recommend doing that)And then for transform jobs, I'd conceptually sort them into two categories. 1) Transforms which you can determine programmatically from some sort of metadata. This could be standard transformations you perform on every table like an upsert, or it could be parsing fields out of a JSON document based on a schema. You should generate these SQL statements with code. You can have that code be DBT macros, use code-gen to generate DBT statements, or just generate and run the SQL statements from your application. I'm not a huge fan of abusing DBT macros for stuff like this because I find JINJA to be kind of messy, but a lot of people swear by it. Probably comes down to personal preference. As for having the code that generates the SQL statements also run it, you should avoid this unless you directly benefit from detecting and implementing schema change on-the-fly. Otherwise just having a daily/weekly pull request that you generate with a script is probably fine.2) Custom business logic transformations. I wouldn't do anything special here. If it's in DBT that's enough standardizaiton.Then once you're writing custom transformations you can kind of do whatever you want. DBT forcing everything to be SQL select statements is a pretty high level of standardization.",

It sounds like you could use some re-structuring of your tables if I'm interpreting this quote correctly. You shouldn't need every single column of your table to know what to join on. How many columns do your tables have?>I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persistedThat's because that's not how that works. A count statement materializes your dataframe, but it doesn't magically make that dataframe available downstream. That's what caching is for. If you have `myDF.count` and then use do `myDF.join(other, ...)`, Spark will either re-calculate `myDF` entirely (which means your `.count` statement is actually making your code SLOWER by doubling the amount of processing you're doing), or it will intelligently cache the results on its own after seeing that the Dataframe is being re-used, in which case the `.count` still didn't do anything that a cache wouldn't do.TL;DR - don't use `.count` unless you're trying to get the count. Any other use of it is a hack that can be done better in different ways.>I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impactThis makes sense. With only 50-100 records, I guarantee that Spark is already broadcasting those anyway. None of your tables are large unless you have an enormous number of columns in your \"main\" table. 50k records isn't very much if you have your tables designed properly, which brings me back to my original question above.>Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without?Yes, you should always use good engineering practices and write clean code. Using functions and classes has no impact on the Spark query plan, but it does have an impact on your and your coworkers' sanity.>Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?Making your code maintainable and having a large query plan are separate issues that are only loosely related at best. Again, Spark doesn't care how your code is organized. Pulling code out into a function will not impact it at all.Use good software engineering practices to make your code maintainable. Use good data engineering practices to keep your spark plans efficient.Edit:After reading the post again, I have one more question>However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error.Are you doing something other than the joins? 6 joins isn't a lot and will absolutely not create a large query plan and also absolutely would not be the cause of an OOM error. Can you post a sample of what your code looks like? Because that really doesn't add up to me.",

Depending on what table i am joining i will also need to filter the main table. I do not bring in every single column from the small table but just just a few. I then repeat this 6 times. I then save the updated main table.The way i implement the join is to get all the keys from the small table, lets say key1,2,3. then iterate 3 times and get all the key1s from the small table and join it to the main table on the left. repeat this for all the keys. And rows in the left that havent been mapped will then have a new column written as flag and map this to Yes.The errors i get when writing it as a function / loop: The cluster runs out of memory (from my understanding of your point means my execution plan is too large)So for my side question the main point i should be focusing on is how to make sure my execution plan is optimal? is there a guide on this?Edit: just saw your edit regarding looking at the code:So first I get the keys from the mapping df:     valid_keys = (         mapping_df.groupBy(\"key\")         .count()         .select(\"key\")         .distinct()         .rdd.flatMap(lambda row: row) # we want to flatten to make a list         .collect()     ) I then loop to do the joins:     # Step 2: create a dictionary that only has the join keys that we need     filtered_dict = {k: v for k, v in join_keys.items() if k in valid_keys}     final_matched_df = None     current_df = main_df     for key_name, key_cols in filtered_dict.items():         # Drop output columns from current_df BEFORE the join to give us the filtered df without the output columns         for col_name in output_columns:             if col_name in current_df.columns:                 current_df = current_df.drop(col_name)         # Get the mapping key which is the key + the output columns on the key we are joining by         mapping_key = mapping_df.select(*key_cols,*output_columns).where(col(\"key\") == key_name) # return the rows where the keys match         # display(mapping_key) will do join on key 1 then get key 2 then key 3 etc         # We join the mapping key row on the key and get the mapping key which includes key + the output columns         joined_df = current_df.join(mapping_key, on=key_cols,how=\"left\")         # get DF which only has the matched rows         matched_df = joined_df.filter(col(\"key\").isNotNull())         # Accumulate the DF with the matched data         if final_matched_df is None:             final_matched_df = matched_df         else:             final_matched_df = final_matched_df.unionByName(matched_df)         # Get the unmatched rows for next iteration         current_df = joined_df.filter(col(\"key\").isNull())Then i create a flag if a join doesnt occur:     # create the flag     if missing_flag is not None:         final_matched_df = final_matched_df.unionByName(current_df).withColumn(             missing_flag,             when(col('key').isNull(), \"Y\").otherwise(\"N\"))So this code will be called 6x (one time for each small table)",

You could even write a test for it if you've got that kind of gumption, Trying with specific date ranges that you mentioned the API accepts. Also, if you did a merge statement instead of a copy into (just assuming I guess) on primary key, it would probably fix the dupe issue, even if the API returned everything every time. Seems like that shouldn't be the case though, and is likely a param in the API call that needs to be verified.",

A malformed param might end up getting ignored or erroring out depending on the API. Alternatively, your filter doesn't work the way you're expecting it to work or the param you're filtering on isn't the right one.>I’m deliberately not deduplicating downstream because I want ingestion itself to be incremental.Would suggest implementing something like a rowhash and which you can use to determine if a row \"exists\" or not. Will make your pipeline a lot closer to being idempotent and a lot less likely to see double insertions.Means you can run your pipeline in an incremental fashion now in an efficient way (only call the data you need ever X hours in a time period instead of doing a full load every single time), and it also means if you are in need of a full load for whatever reason, you can run the same pipeline one time to backfill.",

Do it on a smaller subset over more than a day,  make sure check your filter parameters are also parsing correctly e.g it’s not expecting datetime in some specific format and its erroring on their side and becoming 1900-01-01. They should return you a bad request but other systems often don’t follow best practice. Remember the [robustness principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) when it comes to integration. Ultimately if you’re going the route of a watermarking pattern to ingest incrementals and not dedupling downstream it doesn’t hurt to have some internal validations e.g asset min(created_at) > last_created) that fail the processing.",

It's a combination of:* Market temperature* You as an individual at a technical level* You as an individual at a personal level* How realistic your expectations areFrom what I read on the subreddit, people who struggle a lot tend to have very unrealistic expectations for their first role, underestimate how much work is required, as well as overestimate their own position within the job market e.g. no years experience, done one bootcamp, \"can't find a remote job paying $200k USD - job market is COOKED\".Purely anecdotal although I got into Data Engineering during the previous DE boom 5 years ago, so I had market temperature on my side. Additionally, I was unemployed so was programming, studying, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours per week as well as applying for jobs within the country I'm a citizen of, so a lot less complications in terms of borders.Based on what you have written, there is a possible issue with borders although if the subreddit is anything to go by, a lot of US work is being outsourced to your location. I'd definitely consider asking r/dataengineersindia as they're likely well positioned to answer your question.",

Thinking about this specific question, might help you align better with market conditions. And I am just curious, don’t wanna discourage you or anything. Hope you want the transition for the right reasons. Happy to help.",

I was once interviewed by a company that worked primarily with Excel and they'd asked me if I had experience with excel because they needed an excel guy who'd automate the excel routine and they called it a data analyst position but these types of companies never really understand that Excel is a spreadsheet not a database. So in your case, I wouldn't give up on being an analyst, I'd just try to find a job that has a different approach to what you are supposed to do. Otherwise DE will feel the same way in a company that doesn't understand the difference between a BI analyst, an ETL developer or a DE. So it ain't really about switching to another role, it is more about your current employee. And don't underestimate SQL. It is one of the most powerful tools there is in the data world. If you feel stuck with SQL, go and learn PL/SQL or any other procedural language, marvelous things can be done with it once mastered. Like the latest \"marvel\" for me was pg\\_clickhouse extension, you basically can query clickhouse from postgresql, build dashboards using just 1 connection. I am more of an Oracle guy myself, but postgresql and clickhouse or duckdb offer a new world of possibilities and it is all just SQL that you are feeling bored by =)",

Oven if you do the stuff with python.

Workaround data bugs, remind source system to fix their data. Enable analysts and scientist.Your tools are concepts. Data Vault, Kimball Star models.You work on data bases like Oracle, postgres, terraria.Or Kafka, Apache iceberg or had up to name fancy approaches.Data science is ML, fancy mathematics to get some insights from existing data.Maybe ask some data science guy. I would say your tools is mathematics first. Haha.I would not pick the job by fancy names/ tools. What do you want to achieve?

Thanks for providing more insight.When I started consulting in data engineering I have been told everything lower 3 years consulting in data engineering consulting is junior grade.There has been some truth to it, because no one taught me what data engineering is about and I learned through experience and failure in different projects.i would not say this is necessary today, since the knowledge is better accessible. For example here in r/dataengineering are multiple experienced engineers that are willing to share their experience. And AI also gives nice ideas on how to tackle the challenges.My advice is do not focus on tooling as the primary goal..Look into data governance ( most boring data engineering topic IMHO, and I put it here because it is about metadata)Data quality ( that's always a thing, and IMHO the most interesting part)Data modeling strategy ( that is the most difficult part. ).All of these topics you can tap in today without changing jobs and they will accompany your DE career.If you see a job that features a tooling that interests you, go for it.there is nothing wrong in that. But see it more like a car acquisition you always wanted to drive.Also when applying to position try to highlight your core data engineering skills that you already have. I think that's a better thinking approach then do tool bingo. You might also discover more interesting jobs by doing so.I hope that advice helps you and provides some motivation to you.",

A couple became lite-DE who also do lots of DA work. Most went into BA and project management instead because there were more opportunities there and they dont have to do lots of self-learning. If you go that route (management or lite-DE), prepare to have very strong domain knowledge and stay within your industry even if you switch job. The pay isn't bad, and maybe even better if you're political and ambitious. There are heaps of companies who are still using legacy systems and still need DE who are really good at SQL. You do have to upskill and learn data modelling. You should volunteer for those sort of project in your current job to at least say you have experience with data modelling such as Kimball. There are lots of courses on data modelling you can take. Once you got your foot in the DE door doing SQL and data modelling, you should learn Python, infrastructure etc and become a more well-rounded DE. The job description for DE is constantly changing. It's getting more and more heavy on infrastructure and companies just expect you to be able to do anything. But always know your strong point. The expertise I'm still advertising for myself is data modelling, Databricks and the ability to step into Data Analyst role if needed (because I was one). You'll be competing with DE who used to be software engineer. They'll be much better than you at coding. There might be DEs who were SREs/DevOps and they'll be better than you at infrastructure. I also have another friend who isn't that technical but she became the data lead and earns way more than me. She has excellent leadership skill, communication skill and also very studious and has a millions certificates so she can participate in any technical conversation even though she doesn't write code that much. So work with your advantage and continuously learn to overcome your disadvantage, regardless which path you take.",

When you get to the \"Set Scripting Options\" part of the wizard, there's an \"Advanced\" button—click that, then look for the \"Types of data to script\" option. Change it from \"Schema only\" to \"Schema and data\" (or \"Data only\" if you just want inserts). That will include insert statements for your data.For views and security objects like users/permissions, the wizard sometimes skips them by default. Make sure they’re selected under \"Choose Objects\"—expand the tree to manually include your View and Security options. For user permissions, you might have to script those out separately, as SSMS sometimes leaves out the explicit DENY/GRANT statements for users.Once you've done this, your .sql file should include create table statements, insert statements for your data, view definitions, and possibly some user/permission scripts. Double-check the final script to see if everything you need is there—sometimes for things like user permissions, you'll have to supplement with a bit of hand-written SQL at the end.Good luck! If your module ever evolves into building internal tools around this database and you want a less manual way to let others view and update data (especially if you don't want to give direct database access), there are platforms that can help you spin up safe, web-based interfaces pretty quickly. But for now, the scripting approach should tick all the boxes for your assignment.",

I had deployed my own project on AWS, set up a data pipeline and a basic streamlit front-end, spoke about docker, scheduled functions, the trade-off between different database options and why I made my decisions.My advice, unless you get a role as an apprentice where you're guaranteed a job afterwards, don't bother. Grad schemes say degree or equivalent experience a lot of the time, and jobs themselves definitely value experience more.Also, look up the apprenticeship providers in the uni league tables.

We had a bunch of automated processes scraping data from different sources feeding it into our CRM and then triggering marketing automations. Seemed straightforward enough but then we started seeing weird discrepancies in our reporting and it turned out one of the integrations was pulling in data fields from an older deprecated system that hadn't been properly sanitized. It wasn't a security breach per se but it was definitely a compliance nightmare waiting to happen. Trying to trace that data flow manually was a total disaster. It felt like we were untangling spaghetti and every time we pulled on one strand three more popped up. What really helped us was implementing a virtual data platform that basically acts like an AI data engineer. It was able to map all the data connections identify the data quality issues and flag those unexpected data flows between systems we didn't even realize were happening. Like it showed us this whole chain of dependencies that would have taken weeks for us to figure out on our own. The cool thing is that it didn't require us to move any data around. It just analyzed everything in place and gave us a clear picture of what was going on. Then we used the no-code tools it offered to build agents and workflows that enforced the correct data governance policies and automated the cleanup process. We even built alerts that would fire off if any of the agents tried to access data they weren't supposed to which gave us some peace of mind. Honestly before this our data team was spending all their time firefighting data quality issues and dealing with ad-hoc requests from sales and marketing. Now they're actually working on strategic projects that move the needle. The company that helped us out has a referral program and Id be happy to connect you. I get a little kickback if you become a customer so full disclosure there but it honestly solved a huge headache for us and it sounds like you're dealing with something similar. I can drop you a link if you're interested.",

I can't guarantee anything for this either but the timeline would likely be much shorter.\"Or something along those lines, this is obviously a rather condensed and throwaway example (I.e. the structure is more important than the content).Language might be a thing that makes you sound harsher than you intended but > only appeasing users matters in my department as leadership is non-technical> remain in their good books all the time, so that we can use-and-throw them like a credit-card laterdoesn't sound like a healthy approach. Even non-technical leadership can tell when there is a continued lack of results.",

Better to stay calm, neutral, and factual listen, ask clarifying questions, and if something is risky or wrong, bring it up later in a 1:1 or follow-up email instead of in the firefight. Also, ask your manager directly: “In these meetings, do you want me to just observe, or flag issues?” That way you’re not guessing, you’re protecting yourself, and you’re still doing your job instead of playing politics.",

Did I study the *library*? Nope. For one project I had I needed to do image manipulation *(straighten/skew an ID card)*, so I learnt how to do just that. Nothing else; anything that I try to memorize will end up being forgotten after a few days in a different library.My recommendation: Learn just enough for doing the task you have at hand. Once you feel satisfied with the current project *(or abandon it like 95% of projects that are started, because finishing one is extremely hard)*, move to a different project that requires you to use a different part of the libraries you are interested in.

        "body": "Most people responding in this thread are wrong. They’re coming from only their own personal experience and they don’t realize how much variation there actually is between people. I’ve taught software engineering to a couple hundred people. There is a spectrum for what you’re describing. I used to call it rabbit hole vs. fuzziness. Some people are comfortable moving on with just a vague understanding of a topic (these people are “fuzzy” on the details). Others can’t move on until they’ve understood every last piece (they get lost down the rabbit hole). Go too far on the spectrum in either direction and you have problems. In my experience with people learning programming, you run into way more people having problems because they’re too “fuzzy.” But you DO get some people who struggle because they consistently go too far down the rabbit hole — even when working on a specific project, even with a tight deadline. You should 100% address this. I have two tips:First, keep a very dynamic, organized todo list. What I mean is, before you start working on pretty much anything, you should explicitly write out high-level goals and todo items. Generally, what do you aim to accomplish? And what do you think the high-level steps are that you need to take to get there? Then as you work (and get a better sense of what needs to be done on a granular level), start to populate more specific sub todos (nested/indented below the correct parent todo). Cross todo items off as you complete them — and add more as you realize you’re missing them. You should be switching back and forth between doing the work and managing the todo list. Keep the todo list correctly organized in a hierarchy (sub todos indented below the correct parent). This process is helpful for a number of reasons, but in your case the biggest one is it helps keep you focused on the bigger picture. You’re constantly reminded how what you’re doing fits in to getting you to your initially stated goal. That way you’re working toward the goal rather than being distracted by every single thing you don’t totally understand.Keep a separate list of open questions. Writing them down can help you resist the urge to chase down all the answers right away. You can always come back to the list and answer the questions later if time permits.",

        "body": "A socket is provided by the OS as a means for different processes to communicate, essentially acting like a file handle. You can write to it or read from it to send or receive data. It’s like a mailbox where the OS acts as the mailman and figures out how to transport the mail. Sockets don’t necessarily need an address - e.g. you could have an anonymous socket for communicating between processes on the same computer. In this case, it’s usually held in memory by the OS kernel until the socket is closed. Sockets can also be local-only, and are often bound to a file path so other processes can also go find the socket and send mail to your program.When you’re writing an HTTP server you *do* want an address so that others can send you mail (HTTP requests), so when you bind to a socket with a specific port you’re telling the OS “if you get any letters to this address, stick them in my mailbox.” By binding your socket to a port, you’re giving it an address that is reachable over the network. Otherwise, you couldn’t have a server that just sits and waits for requests - nobody has a way to send your program any requests!Here’s a pretty good [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/D26sUZ6DHNQ) that explains sockets simply and in better detail than many developers ever know or care to learn. In practice, you usually just need to know that it’s a stream of data handled by the OS, very similar to reading/writing files, and how that data is handled beyond that is not really your application’s business. It is helpful to know that sockets usually stay open for a while after you’re done with them (in case the other side has more data to send), and you’re limited in the number of sockets you can create, so it’s prudent to reuse sockets where possible rather than open new ones regularly.",

Usually the first file you open is file #3, the next one is #4, the one after that is #5, etc.In traditional UNIX sockets, when you say \"I want to make a network connection\" the OS says \"OK, your network connection is #3.\" Then later you can say \"I want network connection #3 to connect to server 10.234.5.67 on port 80,\" followed by \"Send the bytes 47 45 54 20 2f 0a 0a over network connection #3\".Most of today's networking systems evolved from traditional UNIX sockets and work basically the same way, even on \"non-UNIX-like\" platforms such as Windows.> Is a socket an object?The socket is the object in the OS's internal data structures that is manipulated when you tell the OS to do something with network connection #3.> Is the socket a number?For the purposes of asking the OS to do something with a socket, the socket is #3...but \"3 means the connection between this computer and 10.234.5.67\" is only valid in the context of a specific conversation your program had with the OS.> Is the socket a file?The \"numbers the OS hands out, like #3 above\" are called *file descriptors*. They were originally made for files, but were adapted for sockets. When you want to write the word \"hello\" to a file that you previously opened and the OS told you it was file #3, you tell the OS \"Write these bytes to file descriptor #3: 68 65 6c 6c 6f\".One interesting decision they made was that if #3 refers to a network connection instead of a file, then *you can still tell the OS to read or write bytes exactly the same way*.A socket isn't a file, but it sort-of acts like one.(UNIX domain sockets are a different beast. I'm not going to discuss them here.)> Is a socket an IP:port combination?No. IP:port combination is a setting you put on the socket for outgoing connections. For incoming connections you set a port; the OS only gives you connections from others requesting that port. You can also optionally set an IP address for incoming connections, sometimes called a \"bind address\". In case your machine has multiple IP addresses, the bind address tells which one you're interested in getting connections from.> when creating an HTTP server, why do we use sockets\"Why do we use sockets to make an HTTP server?\" is like asking \"Why do we use a print statement to put data on the screen?\" Because that's what the system provides.There's a lot of stuff going on under the hood! For example the humble print statement could be replaced with a syscall or a BIOS interrupt or writing pixels directly to a framebuffer or [building your own graphics card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs).But as a beginner you don't want to think too much about the underlying layers just yet; you'll just get confused and overwhelmed. \"Use a socket for network connections\" is the networking equivalent of \"Use the print() statement to put text on the screen.\"",

        "body": "Build something. Look for some kind of project to build. If you can't think of one go browsing places on Reddit, Github, etc. and get a look at what others are making and see if you want to try to clone something or put your own twist on it. I usually try to ask myself what needs to be done to get the project going. Like I'd break it down into steps and go. If you're wanting to deploy something with Docker then pick something that can run in a Docker Container, figure out how to containerize it or if it's already done try to figure out what they did to get the project container ready, look into how the container is built, and then look at the steps needed to deploy the project somewhere. From there you can begin to find where your knowledge gaps are and then go search for appropriate documentation, videos, etc. as you go. If you're having attention span issues then try to train yourself to do a little at a time and then come back. (Or speak with some medical professionals about possible ways to help) I have used books, looking at open source code, videos when those came around, and talking with others to learn things. From there I try to build and stop to review materials and to brainstorm on how to get around blocks. You can use LLMs to help with learning as well, but you need a way to validate information coming from them as of now and you also need to learn how to not let it do all the work for you if your intention is to learn. If you're wanting to learn something try not to give up and keep at it. Good luck on your learning journeys.",

If you can build a project that parses JSON data in the FHIR format, you are already ahead of 90% of students.2. **Cloud Experience:** Learn the basics of AWS or Azure. Healthcare is moving to the cloud rapidly.3. **Data Pipelines:** For a Data Engineering role, learn **Apache Airflow** and **Docker**.4. **Privacy:** Read up on **HIPAA** compliance. You need to know how to handle sensitive data safely.For your portfolio, try taking a messy public health dataset and building an automated pipeline to clean and visualize it. Good luck!",

MOOC Helsinki is gold so definitely stick with that.Here is a solid progression path with the specific skills you need for each stage.**Beginner Skills*** **Core Logic** You need to master `if` `else` statements and loops like `for` and `while` to control the flow.* **Data Handling** Get comfortable with `int` `double` and `String` types and using the `Scanner` class to get input from the user.* **OOP Basics** For things like a Bank Simulator you specifically need to understand Classes Objects and Constructors. You also need to learn Encapsulation which just means using `private` variables and `public` getter and setter methods to protect your data.**Beginner Project Ideas*** **Number Guessing Game** This is a classic for a reason. It forces you to use random number generation loops and conditional logic to tell the user if they guessed too high or too low.* **Console Calculator** Build a calculator that runs in the terminal. It helps you practice breaking your code into separate methods for addition subtraction multiplication and division.* **Simple Quiz** Create a multiple choice quiz. You will need to use arrays to store the questions and answers and a loop to cycle through them while keeping score.**What you need** You really just need a good IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse and you should absolutely start using Git for version control right now. Good luck and keep putting in the work!",

A CLI tool that grows features, like persistence, undo, or import and export, will teach you more than jumping straight to flashy apps. As you move up, projects that involve failure handling, like a small server that must recover from bad input or partial crashes, force you to think like an engineer instead of a syntax user. Also, not using AI for a while is a good call, but do not confuse that with avoiding documentation or reading other people’s code. Learning how systems break and how you fix them is where the real growth happens.",

What matters is that you caught it early (3rd sem is still early).A big mistake people make right now is trying to pick a “future-proof domain” instead of building fundamentals + proof of work.Here’s a simpler way to think about it:Step 1: Stop trying to predict the job market.AI noise, saturation talk, etc. mostly affects people with shallow skills. Strong fundamentals age well.Step 2: Build a core base first (3–4 months):One programming language properly (Python / Java / JS — doesn’t matter much)Data structures & basic problem-solvingGit + basic LinuxThis alone puts you ahead of many students.Step 3: Use web dev as a vehicle, not a destination.Web dev isn’t bad — generic web dev is.Build 2–3 small but real projects:CRUD appAuth + databaseSimple APINot to become a “frontend dev”, but to learn how software actually works.Step 4: Let interest emerge from doing, not thinking.Most people don’t “discover” interests — they develop them after building something.After that, you can branch:Backend / systemsData / analyticsDevOps / infraApplied AI (later, not now)Important reality check:AI won’t replace developers who understand systems, trade-offs, and can build things end-to-end. It will replace people who only copy tutorials.Your goal for the next 6–9 months isn’t mastery.It’s momentum + consistency.Pick one path, commit for 90 days, reassess. That alone puts you ahead of most.",

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqjA04\\_dpk&t=4239s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqjA04_dpk&t=4239s) You learn SQL, C, Python, HTML/JS/CSS, Networking, and Flask. Generally, you \\*alone\\* decide what you need to know based on the problems you would like to solve. Nobody else does. The deep knowledge beyond 'checkboxes someone told you to fill' comes from your own independent learning. To learn 'real coding', pick something in your life you want to automate, or you wish was better. That's the key. Toy projects are fine, but it is nice to make something someone can use. Say you are in a Discord server, why not make a bot that does some useful task? As you make the bot, let people test the commands, see if they identify errors. The Python classes you teach to kids, what resources do they have to learn? Wouldn't it be nice if they had a pretty website with all the information related to the course? Wouldn't it be nice if they had a Leetcode style interface to do problems at your website? Wouldn't you want to tell them, \"Hey kids, look at this website \\*I made\\*, let me know if there are any problems with it?\"Is there any software you use you think is dated? As you make these useful projects, you get a hunger for wanting to improve it incrementally. You identify the necessary technologies to learn as you make these useful projects.if you were making my website suggestion, the learning could be like this: \\---1. \"i wanna make a website. how do i make a barebones site?\" -> consult youtube, perhaps watch Harvard CS50 for an HTML introduction, watch other youtubers you like. copy down the examples the lecturers give, maybe afterwards start writing your own barebones site. when you start writing, you consult documentation for intricate questions. learning generally goes: YOUTUBE VIDEO \\[brief intro\\] -> WRITE CODE -> CONSULT DOCUMENTATION | Repeat.2. \"i wish the site was pretty!\" -> learn css, watch a vid on css, put it in your site3. \"damn, this code is getting messy... maybe i need this fancy react.js format to make the webpage snappier & stop repeating myself.\" -> learn react.js, watch a video, start writing it, consult documentation as needed4. \"i wish the kids had a pretty editor they could write in... oooh what's this, monaco editor? i'll use it in my project.\"5. \"what's this tailwind css thing i've heard about? it could make making my site prettier easy, lets try it.\"6. \"hmmm... i want my site to have a backend so they can submit code.\" \\*google\\* \"oh, what's this, Judge0 is a framework that allows me to implement a judging system for the coding problems students submit?\" \"hmm... flask is good for site backends? lemme try it out!\" \\---Learn by DOING... there are 'buzzwords' to know, such as: Docker, Tailwind CSS, PostgresSQL, CI/CD, Flask, Django, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn. But the main way to learn these things is writing useful software you care about",

Right now you have a lot of tools, which is great, but you are missing situations where the problem is fuzzy and you have to decide what to build, not just how.One way out of the “I don’t know what to make” loop is to add constraints. Pick a small annoyance in your own life or school routine and try to automate or improve it, even if the result is boring and ugly. The learning happens when you hit decisions about structure, tradeoffs, and maintenance, not when the project idea is exciting.Also, getting lost in frameworks like React is normal. They assume context about state, architecture, and collaboration that beginners rarely have. Those concepts usually click after you have struggled through a few messy, self directed projects, not before.",

The first thing I did was get assigned as an extra code reviewer for an MR that was written by a developer experienced in the language. I did my review first, and I had to spend time reading through his code, cross-referencing documentation for the libraries being used, and generally just building my understanding of the code. When the other code reviewers and testers also did their passes, I read their issues to see what I had missed. (Which is a good habit that I do for everything I review, not just this).After that, I did an MR of my own and had it reviewed by the person who had done the previous MR. There was still a ton of referencing documentation but I had a fairly good idea of what I needed to do.It gets substantially easier the more experience you have under your belt. I've coded in more than a dozen languages, so at this point picking up a new one is pretty simple as I already know how to \"think like a programmer\" which is the core skill that we need.",

Tutorials feel productive, but there’s nothing forcing your brain to retrieve or apply anything, so it fades fast.What usually works better is picking a very small goal and letting that goal pull the language in. Something concrete like parsing a file, building a tiny game, automating a task you already do, or reimplementing a simple tool you use. Then you learn just enough syntax to make the next thing work, look things up constantly, and accept that forgetting is part of the process. That cycle is what actually builds memory.Docs and references are great once you’re actively coding, because you approach them with a question instead of passively watching. If boredom is the problem, reduce scope, increase feedback, and write code every day even if it’s messy. Speed comes from doing, not from finding the perfect resource.",

First you can attend a community college for two years to get an associates degree in computer programming. That's not as expensive as a bachelors degree in Computer Science but it gets you half way there. Most universities will accept an associates degree as the first two years of a computer science curriculum. The advanced math comes into play if you want to get a bachelors in Computer Science. Most degree programs are either in an engineering school or a business school. Some colleges make you choose an area of concentration (mine was physics) Business curriculums do not usually require calculus while science and engineering tracks require calculus, differential equations and linear algebra. A Bachelors in computer science will serve you well and keep you employed, but an associates in computer programming will also help you get work.

The only things you really need to know are how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and maybe a little basic algebra. Many programmers go through their entire career with having to do barely any math at all.> Do note, however, that the answer is a bit different if you are interested in getting a degree in Computer Science. Many universities or colleges will have specific prerequisites you need to fulfill before you can either enter the major or graduate (calculus classes, etc). And, since Computer Science is, to a certain degree, applied mathematics, you will almost certainly end up learning about discrete math, writing proofs and other similar topics while earning your degree. You do not need to be inherently good at math in order to learn these topics (or any mathematical topic, really), but having some mathematical maturity certainly wouldn't hurt, and would probably smooth the learning process.",

Firstly, it doesn't have the burden of having as much layers of backwards compatibility - C++ is filled with legacy code, and deprecated methods. Rust, on the other hand, is much fresher in that sense.Okay, I realized I am probably going on a tangent, so here's the list of the stuff I love about Rust over C++:* Beautiful error messages* Immutability by default.* Less verbose syntax (try to read the c++ std library, you'll get what I mean)* **THE ABSOLUTE BEST** tooling - `cargo` is really just a life saver. Don't even get me started on installing dependencies.One notable flaw I can point out is the borrow checker, since it can be confusing and you have to sacrifice some convenience in order to keep the code safe (but at least Rust doesn't allow unsafe behavior unless you explicitly want it)",

I dont want to discourage the idea, but you should be advised that the comparative lack of tooling and ecosystem might overshadow the other benefits of Rustby contrast C++ is native to the unreal engine and already integrates beautifully with its visual scripting language, unreal blueprints. C++ is also probably better for programming things that are very heavy on math and data structures and algorithms. it's basically the gold standard for high performance programming at scale, and has all the tooling and integration you'd want to write game code at any level of abstraction",

Also let the user mark off a to-do. Again, maybe extend it slightly, like allowing the user to view marked off to-dos.3) now maybe you want a simple console app that gets data from an API, instead of a saved file. There's APIs for everything, pick a free one that interests you (many people choose a weather API, for me, it was a football one, maybe you want a recipe one) and output some information in the terminal. This is also particularly good because you have to read the APIs documentation4) now you get to branch off what complexity you want to add. Maybe you want to figure out how to automate tasks. You could try and save data from the API above into a file at regular intervals. Maybe you want to add a graphical user interface, so you look up how to display the API data, which could mean in a web browser, or in a mobile app, or a desktop app, whatever interests you. Maybe you want to get data from multiple APIs and store it in a way that you can easily check what data you want, so you create a database that gets populated by various APIs.Start with the commonly suggested ones, expand on them slightly, iteratively add a little bit of complexity you haven't tackled before for every project.

However, as I've said many times to many people, programming is not about any particular language, it's about learning to think like a programmer. Methodical, structured, analytical thinking and problem solving skills. Those skills are universally applicable across all programming languages, and, frankly, throughout life as well.So you hone some skills and write a bunch of programs and learn how to program and think like a programmer. Then if you want to pivot into something less personally interesting but more lucrative to pay bills, you'll have the necessary skillset to make that pivot.",

Learning to code is a \\*\\*journey\\*\\*. But thankfully, there are loads of resources out there that can help you choose your path! So, it's okay if you're not totally committed to building a career, my advice would be to measure the amount of resource you devote until you know that.You can teach yourself to code without access to any paid content or courses. It's a long road, it takes a lot of dedication and frustration, and drive to go find the answers yourself. But I'm not sure there's ever been a skill so thoroughly documented online as software development. Software developers largely love to share what they've built, and the very fine details of how it works. Youtube is full of tutorials. There are plenty of websites that will explain different programming languages or tools to you. Github is a massive source of real code that drives real projects which you can read and download and involve yourself in the discussions of. If you're looking into a career, I recommend finding a university within your state with an accredited computer science program. The degree matters a lot when it comes to job prospects unfortunately. I also think it's a medium quick way to actually develop serious development skills. I know for me personally, I was on the self-taught path for many years and just very stuck. It was my degree program with the help of professors and peers that finally unlocked things for me and got me over the tough parts of learning development. You'll find no shortage of universities that offer remote degree programs in computer science as well. This is an expensive path, but its the most reliable path to a career.If you're not sure what you want yet, and you're just out to explore maybe try joining some community projects. Hackathons, game jams, competitions. Even if you don't feel like you're ready, just be honest about your level and express that you're there to learn and you're bound to find loads of people just like you who would be glad to learn along-side you. That's a great way to 'explore' and get a sense of what actual development is like even before you have the skills yourself. Even if it means you're joining a discord call just to watch and hear how more experienced developers are working it'll give you a sense of what its actually like once you're in the middle of things.I won't recommend any particular course or source of information personally. I've found that everyone seems to click with different materials.

When complete compile those coordinates into HPGL language and feed that into an HP CNC machine. I wrote that in HP PASCAL in 1981. I had known the manager of the tool department through the church I went to and he had seen my work on the CPM machine that was donated to our church. I was doing work on the CPM machine for free because I wanted to create computer games on it and I had to promise to do something productive on it while I played games. I wrote a rolodex type program for church memberships in basic. Over the years I've worked with almost every programming language known to man. What made learning a different programming language easier was learning a different spoken language to train your brain to think in that spoken language. I speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, German enough to order in a restaurant, and some basic Mandarin. This helps train your brain to easily switch between different programming languages as well.

If you want to store more geometric data than just the points this may not be the best solution, but I think it would still work well enough.Each position in the array would represent a cross point of a longitude and a latitude line.Something like```Point[][][] sphere = [[ [], [], [] ], // Latitude 0, longitude 0,1,2[ [], [], [] ], // Latitude 1, longitude 0,1,2[ [], [], [] ] // Latitude 2, longitude 0,1,2]```Of course, you would define the sphere something more like```Point[][][] sphere = Point[3][3][1]```Then if you wanted to reference a specific point, it's just an array lookup. Traversing the array can be done by storing the current lat and lon and then incrementing/decrmenting them, with wrapping logic as needed.",

Learning to separate your logic is important. Python has more frameworks/libraries to solve a larger variety of problems. JS -> Python basics are pretty straightforward, unlike say C# or Java. Something that’s bitting more than you can chew can be good. It forces you to think about modularity and separation of logic. Tutorials can be good as a reference, but not worth copying and pasting beyond getting a foundation, like a working web page or mobile app that’s half way presentable with standard practice folder structure. Build your own unique application from there",

The course is free, textual, extremely practice oriented with actually checked exercises, and a proper first semester of \"Introduction to Computer Science\").The key to learning programming is to practice as early as possible and as much as possible. Play around with the code, break it, fix it. Learn to read the error messages. Learn to work with the documentation for your language. These are all key points.Stay away from AI for the start. At the very utmost (and even that should be the ultima ratio) use it to give you explanations. Never use it to give you solutions nor code. AI is tempting. Still, it is far superior to pretend it doesn't even exist.Don't be afraid of making mistakes. We all do (even with decades of experience). Mistakes and failures are what teach us, from what we actually *learn*. You need to struggle to learn (and that's why I said to avoid AI - it will take the struggle away).",

Some of it is solid foundational theory. The rest of it is the history of brilliant quirky, strange people thinking strange thoughts. They didn’t have any idea we profs would try to teach, and you students would try to learn this stuff. So take it with a grain of salt. I bit the bullet and got through it.So, young Padawan, take it with a grain of salt. Keep plugging away. Bite the bullet, dive into the cloud of unknowing. You will get it. Also, my life as a programmer has, since then, gone through lots of cycles of “WTF? This makes no sense at all” and then understanding. You would be wise to get used to your emotions when you dive into that cloud of unknowing. I’ve struggled with that all my working life. I think it’s part of the creative process of programming.

In school you don't really have a lot of time and you can't put in as much focus or effort into it as you would like. With work it's not like that; you have one thing to focus on, makes things a lot more manageable. At that point what really shines through is your persistence; persistence is the key thing in programming, at least in my eyes. I will say that it is hard to decide whether it's right for you or not. I guess the answer is, when you are doing it are you focused on it and are willing to sacrifice things for it? If yes, I think that's enough. Don't let school kill your confidence. If you are drawn to programming, that's a very good strength, you just need persistence, diligence, and curiosity to carry you further",

You should evaluate your life, what you can handle, and what you prefer. All advice will fall short and even you won't know whether staying/switching/dropping out was the best. If I had to make a similar decision now, I'd switch, but only because I lost much more time than I expected. The mental distress is really what you should sort out though. It doesn't necessarily go away if you quit your pursuit of programming, and may stay with you after you're done with education. Don't be afraid to consult a professional. Of course also don't fall for the endless therapy loop, but some people do benefit medical help (e.g me) without much side or long term effects.",

My point is university is trash. Sometimes they're phenomenal and the best places to learn on the planet but more often than not they are a waste of money. Id encourage you to find trust in yourself as you sound quite creative and intelligent from the bit I know of you. Ill also bet you just simply learn 100x better from practice and self directed discovery and curiosity than a broken theoretical course.",

Or as [the \"monad tutorial fallacy\" blog post puts it](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/):> let us suppose that Joe’s metaphor is that Monads are Like Burritos. Here is where Joe badly misinterprets his own thought process: “Of course!” Joe thinks. “It’s all so simple now. The key to understanding monads is that they are Like Burritos. If only I had thought of this before!” The problem, of course, is that if Joe HAD thought of this before, it wouldn’t have helped: the week of struggling through details was a necessary and integral part of forming Joe’s Burrito intuition, not a sad consequence of his failure to hit upon the idea sooner.Learning is also a good mix of strategies that are entirely general to the human species across any domain, and tactics that will work for you specifically in some specific situation. If you find some great way for you to learn concept A, it doesn't necessarily mean that it'll work for some other learner, or that it'll work as well for concept B.What you're asking about is general enough that we can only give very general learning advice, like [Oláfur Waage's _Learning Rust the wrong way_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL9LANLg5EA) (more about learning in general with Rust as a specific example of something to learn).",

Asking questions about the problem/information6.

When something is more complex, it takes longer to make sense of the individual parts and make it all make sense together, and it makes it harder to know which questions to ask to gain clarification or find information that you're missing, but it's still the same process. If you're able to memorize the information and regurgitate it on command, but don't feel like you really understand what it means, then you've most likely been skipping over steps 3 and 5, meaning you're just encountering new information and trying to commit it to memory without *using* it.If you don't understand how something works, try to write something that uses it, and as you run into issues, start Googling away to find the information that you need. If you encounter more things you don't understand while Googling up info, follow up on that as well until you feel like you actually understand what's going on.

Sure, from one side, you'll be learning a bit less than you'd learn during your Bachelor studies as your Master studies will take less time. From the other side, you have already covered probably a lot when it comes to Databases related courses in Bachelor program. Still, a Master degree for non-CS people should teach you various topics that will be covered also in CS Bachelor program. So, you can cover that gap.I personally think that you won't get such quality from learning online. All these bootcamps and online tutorials are more like for beginners. I have checked some and they do not cover more complex topics one will learn during his university studies. They won't force you to work on your thesis project where you have to come up with something more unique than another \"X management system\" that you'd get from bootcamps. University studies will also give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects in your Github. When going by online tutorials and online bootcamps your imagination will be limited. They will tell you to make a TODO app. You will make a TODO app. Nobody will use that TODO app.If Master studies cost a lot for you then you can try some online learning and see how it works out for you. Your current career definitely will be a bonus point. But if you see that you are not landing a Junior developer or a Junior data engineer role (forget jumping into a Mid-level or into a Senior-level position) then consider going for a degree.",

You just start to get a feel for what good patterns are as well as what goes wrong when bad patterns are followed.But as for more concrete tips I'd say you want to keep your API /API layer as agnostic as possible from the implementation details - your API layer should ideally be focused on defining the contract and routing the logic to internal code to fulfill the contract. You don't want to expose internal details, raw primative implementations, or anything not relevant to the contract. This is both so external clients have a clean interface to work with as well as minimizing the blast radius of any changes to the workings of the API itself. Yeah you can implement a key value store with a dictionary but if you abstract it behind a data provider then your API layer doesn't care if you're using a dictionary or a database or a cache, and you can swap between them easily.In addition anything that's exposed to the public internet should have protection against anything that could possibly go wrong, malicious or otherwise. This includes sanitizing inputs, protection against injection attacks, rate limiting, proper status code handling etc...",

Mine makes a C.You start in the bottom-right where you don't even know THAT you don't know something. There's shit rocket scientists contemplate I haven't the slightest fucking clue.

I know Monte-Carlo is used to march approximations toward a correct result with sufficient precision. I've just never had to do it.Then there's what you know you know - this is active recall stuff. Rote memory. I know a closure is a poor mans object. I can repeat that all day. It's not very functional memory because I have to actively think about it with intent. I can write a closure, but it's not intuitive to me. I make mistakes. I can't see the forest for the trees.But I have a shitload of unknown knowns - shit I know, but don't actively think about. We're beyond active recall. This isn't rote - this is intuition. You can FORGET you know something, and yet that knowledge passively informs you.

When you've fully internalized and integrated your knowledge, you can speak on it as an authority. You won't be quoting a book or resource, you'll be saying it yourself, and you'll hardly think about how you're even doing it.So then how do you learn? It's not just time.

You're already gaining self-awareness, seeing more than trees, but the forest for what it is. To accelerate your experiences - you need to have more of them; finish that project. Validate inputs - that's easy as shit. Use data structures, that makes it easier to validate your inputs. Add concurrency, this will apply pressure upon you to design a more consistent architecture.You didn't do these things in your demo because you don't have the intuition to do them.

It feels very natural for me to program in Kotlin, and just very right, even though I use Java at work.Haskell is a great language to learn from \"Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!\" (Freely available online.) It will teach you to think about programming very differently if you haven't done FP (functional programming) before. It's radically different than the standard imperative / OOP styles and definitely worth knowing. You will see the beauty in FP and how, if the types work out, you can have a fairly. hgih level of confidence that your program is correct. It's quite a beautiful way of doing things.",

Data analytics is definitely a skill that’s in demand, and you don’t need a ton of theory or expensive courses to get started.Here’s a roadmap that works for a lot of people breaking into analytics:Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera — audit for freeKhan Academy / YouTube playlists on Excel & basic statsSQLZoo for interactive SQL practiceNext step is to focus on building something that hones your skill. Try analyzing something you care about (budgeting, fitness, etc.) Document your work — even simple visuals or insights go a long way. This will lead to something called “portfolio” like a folder of all your project work Analytics folks use Excel / Google Sheet, SQL, Python with pandas, R, Tableau/PowerBI If you want something practical and project-oriented that walks you through real exercises in data analytics, this book below is designed for beginners and emphasizes hands-on work over pure theory:AI-Powered Data Analysis for Beginnershttps://a.co/d/8v7IwjKThe book offers good ground in programming, math and stats, analytics mindsets and methodologies, using AI, with lots of examples. Many of the prompts that’s discussed are fully optimized to use lowest tokens. Full disclosure: I’m the author of the book I mentioned — sharing it because it’s designed for similar use casesNo pressure — you don’t need to buy it to start. But some folks like having a structured guide as they work through exercises and build confidence.",

I don’t see much value in inventing my own Netflix or re-implementing an HTTP library, especially when AI can do that with a single prompt.Because of this, I sometimes feel like I didn’t manage to get into the industry in time — and at the same time, that the industry itself might soon look very different from what it is now.And on top of that, there’s real life: buying a home, raising kids, all the usual responsibilities.I guess overall I’m just worried about how to live this life the right way.",

AI will be/is important and will be/is generating this stuff super easy and quick, but it’s not quite that simple…..A few months ago I decided to dive into Identity in ASP.NET (basically built in .NET authentication) and .NET does so much of the heavy lifting. It abstracts all the details away, allowing you to just focus on plugging it in, creating your policies and then focusing on your business logic instead of infrastructure.However…. I sort of quickly realised, that if you don’t understand how it works internally, the abstractions don’t really help or make it any better. You still have to call the relevant methods in the relevant order, and understand what’s going on in order to get the most from it. The abstractions, just save you having to write your implementations… it’s not a substitute for understanding how it works.I see AI as the same. It’s an abstraction. We ask it to generate code, it does. That saves us time and speeds up development, but if we’re unable to understand the inner workings, we won’t be able to get the most out of it. The best way to learn is to build. So build these solutions yourself, and understand how these work not because you’ll be building these yourself in the future but because it is imperative you understand the inner workings to get the most from AI generated code….",

If you don’t know what’s happening under the hood, you can’t really use them well — whether it’s [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Identity or AI-generated code.My struggle is more about the next step after that understanding. Even if I go deep, build things properly, and really learn how they work internally — will there actually be an employer willing to take a chance on someone without formal work experience? In many cases, resumes are filtered out automatically before a human even sees them if you don’t have 3–5 years of relevant experience.Part of me knows that building something unique, finishing a real project, and showing it publicly might be a way to bypass the traditional job search. That also takes time, just in a different way. And realistically, 6 months isn’t a long time at all — maybe even 1–2 years isn’t.So for now, I’m trying to treat programming as a serious hobby and long-term investment, and see where it leads. No matter how the industry changes, I still believe that understanding programming fundamentals will become almost mandatory, and once you have that, switching languages or technologies is much easier.I’ve also been living outside my home country for 6 years, and while things are generally fine, being a foreigner adds extra friction to everything — internships, official employment, even simple life stuff.

Excel and Libre Office Calc both use RAM to load spreadsheets, and get real squirrely when the spreadsheet is too big for RAM.You could also try Google Sheets. Another approach might be to convert your xlsx file to a csv file, which is plain text. Then use a giant-file-capable text editor like notepad++ to break the csv file into more manageable chunks. Sheets can do that conversion. If you can load the file into Calc, it probably can too.If I were involved with your org ( as a donor or whatever ) I would offer to do this for you.

They do not analyze the whole picture but have a tunnel vision.So, having said that, go for programming if you want to do that. First, learn to make stuff without AI. Then, when you can already build stuff on your own, learn to use the AI (and also how to NOT use the AI). AI should not fill a gap of knowledge, for you, but it should just speed up these tasks that you would know how to do on your own as well. Like this you'll be able to assess the output that AI gives.

If you just do the daily leetcode you could hit something that you're just simply not equipped to solve yet. As someone else suggested, maybe spend 30 mins a day on a problem until you solve it or run out of time; then learn what the solution is and note down the problem.When I study for interviews I like to keep track of all the problems I get stuck on and need to look at the solution. Then a few weeks later I come back to the same problem and retry it. If I still can't solve it then I review the solution and it stays on the list until i can solve it on my own.",

It’s primarily a Dependency Injection framework with extra modules for web, databases, etc.A big idea behind dependency injection is you don’t create the objects yourself, someone else does and you simply request what you need. The reason this evolved is because when you do “new SomeClass()” within Java it’s very difficult to test it the class that contains it.Imagine you created a CreditCard service within your Controller, when you want to unit test the controller you want a FakeCredirCard service, but if you did “new” it’s very hard to swap it out.Spring lets you annotate both the real CreditCard service and the fake one, then you dynamically get the one that fits the scope (ex: test)",

        "body": "You just need a crash course on web development it sounds like. What you are describing is more a full stack software dev. You sound like you have trained more on backend roles, which is 100% ok, and typically mkre marketable and higher paid. But, if you want to get to where you are writing your own modern single page apps and web deployments, that is what you need to look into.To understand full stack development you need to understand that there are MANY ways to do it. The most popular is the Odin Project, which teaches the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS). This is popular for bootcamps and personal projects, but not as common in the professional world, but it can be. MEAN stack is where you learn Angular as your front end framework instead of React. Both are very good and useful. Angular had a steeper learning curve.So in the full stack your backend can be anything. It can be a NodeJS backend, which is basically a way to write your backend in Javascript or Typescript. There is ZERO reason to write it in JS, imo. Typescript is great and is more enterprise marketable. You learned Java, this means you can have Java as your back end. You do this with the Java Spring Boot framework. Or, you can use C# as your backend. You can do this with .NET Core. Also VERY popular. Or, you can use Python as your backend, which to do this you use like Flask or FastAPI frameworks.These frameworks I am telling you are basically ways to write in these popular languages and essentially deploy a working normal application that will run through a web interface.Your front end can then be different. You can mix and match what you like. You can skip frameworks and just go very simple HTML/CSS/JS. You can write in C# on the backend with .NET Core Web API and React as your front end. You can skip React and just write raw JS/HTML as your front end as well, if you really wanted. You can choose to have React as your frontend and have no backend. You can choose to write and deploy a serverless front end too, so no actual backend deployment needed as you choose to use things I like Azure CLI, or AWS CDK. This is actually really common as you can build really lean sites with say, Angular or Vue as the front end, and with Vite for super fast development.The tough part is picking and choosing what is right for you.My point in this messyness of it all is to point out purely that there is isn't really a \"correct\" one and only path to learn to do this. And, it's too much to learn in parallel. So, you need to pick a lane and stick with it. You already have a background in Java. So consider learning how to build web apps in Java Spring Boot, or transferring to C# and doing .Net Core Web API or .Net with Entity Frameworks (basically a SQL relational database integrated into thr project boilerplate). C# is VERY similar to Java, so easy to transition to. C# is like a more advanced Java. Just be aware you will need to use Visual Studio(not VSC) for maximum advantage here over other IDEs. JetBrains is also pretty good with .NET Core, but it is a paid cost. Or, just go do thr Odin Project as it will teach you all the web dev basics first before pushing you into full stack stuff hard. It is really useful to learn fundamentals of html and how to add the stuff in the header, the imports, the meta and X tags, importing Google fonts, and so on.If you don't care about building web apps then don't go this way and ignore everything I said.",

They just let you freeze-frame and walk through your code step by step. But that's an incredibly usesful ability.(Some debuggers also let you change values on the fly, but this is rarely all that useful, since you'd likely need to make that change many times and you'd be better off making a temporary code change for that instead.)",

You get access to the courses for life, and the better rated ones are generally quite good. As for making is stick, building things on your own is 100% the best way to get there. Get a feel for the language out in the wild and make some things on your own, and it will stick a LOT better. I wish I had started doing that earlier than I did.",

It's a concept of how to handle data at runtime by creating objects and then performing actions on those objects.A method or function are the actions that you can use on those objects.A class is a description of an object, at runtime a constructor creates that object in memory, and the instance is the runtime object that was created by the constructor.You need to think in two ways - the code as a dry written thing, and then the multiple real things created when you run that code.Like the Cake class.At runtime you pass in (as arguments) butter, flour, sugar, eggs, vanilla flavour to the Constructor, which then makes an instance of a cake - say a plainSpongeCake.You then call the methods or functions of that Cake class.So you call addIcing(), add sprinkles(), etc.For your next cake, you instantiate the same class but this time you add in chocolate instead of vanilla and then call the same methods. Voilà, you now have a richChocolateCake too.You can now call the cutSlice() method, and that works on both cakes.That's pretty much OOP in a nutshell.You could make an interface class and have the cake class call that. You just put the addIcing() etc method signatures in that class, as you only really use them to guarantee that particular methods will be available in your cake class.Lots of languages use the principles of OOP so it's very much worth learning!Once you've mastered OOP and are getting to grips with Java, then you can start looking at using patterns in the code such as MVC and Singleton.Good luck!

Couldn't find a way to implement my chosen approach. I tried a couple days, but then left the exercise and kept revisiting it regularly.

When I first started, I would follow a tutorial to put something together, and then make my own changes on top of it (e.g. a tutorial on how to rename files in python, then expanding that into a program that also sorts them into folders by their creation time). Or I'd have an idea for something, and I'd follow different tutorials for each part of it (e.g. one tutorial on how to connect to an API, another tutorial on how to save data in a db, then put the pieces together to build a scraper). Now that I'm much more experienced... I do exactly the same thing. I built a tool recently for orchestrating restic backups in kubernetes using CRDs and it was the same process. Follow a tutorial to read/write kubernetes objects from python, follow a tutorial on installing CRDs in a cluster, etc.. put the pieces together and go. The only difference I suppose is more often than not the \"tutorials\" I'm following are docs pages instead of explicit tutorials, or sometimes a short \"how to\" from an LLM. The content is the same though: read how to do x, and apply it to y.",

It's one of those (mostly) low-pressure desk jobs that you do to make a stable income while you do what you really want to do in your free time. That said, it will contribute close to nothing when it comes to helping a career in game dev. The knowledge will 100% be helpful, but it won't help you get a programming job unless it's ultra entry-level (and 99% of game dev jobs aren't entry level).It is an excellent job to have for paying bills though, and depending on the environment/level of independence, it can give you lots of time both at home and at your desk to learn programming independently. As long as I get my tasks done each day, I can pretty safely bring my laptop to the office to study/work on my own projects most of the time.I will say though, \"building a multiplayer online game\" is a very, very ambitious goal shared by many aspiring game devs who don't know what it actually takes to do something like that. To the point that it's a known red flag/meme if a dev tries to crowdfund an MMO. If you intend to make games by yourself, your scope needs to be reduced \\*drastically,\\* and you'll not only learn more but be more satisfied with the process if you focus on making small, simple games. If you want to make something bigger, then find friends/collaborators to work with-- particularly people who are willing to work on something for the fun of it instead of trying to turn it into a business. It's very, very difficult to \"start a game studio,\" so you want to start by making games for fun and learning to enjoy the process of making them before you \\*ever\\* think about monetizing. Basically don't think about monetizing/turning it into a business until you \\*have business.\\* And if you want to get into programming for an existing studio, be prepared to spend years and years doing contract work to build a reputation, and to navigate a highly competitive field where you could be let go at a drop of a hat.Make small games. Fail faster. Fall in love with actually making the games, not the idea of making games. And know that game dev, especially solo, is a very multidisciplinary endeavor where each discipline within it can take years and years to master. Pace yourself.Source: IT person of 6 years who gave up game dev because I found out I don't actually enjoy the process of programming after even more years of trying and going to school for it. What I discovered was that I actually wanted to tell stories, and I didn't need to force myself to be a programmer/artist/designer/writer/composer unicorn to do that.

You need basic ones, and more specialised ones for programming certain things (e.g. writing a networking protocol will require you understand networking), but they diverge very early on into generalist vs specialist. IT generally isn't really a path to (games) programming work per se, it's more a path to help desk, ops, sysadmin, database admin, infra, devOps, etc. If you want to work as a programmer, providing you can already operate a computer to do basic file admin, web browsing, text editing, etc., you should just start programming right away and focus on that. If you need to earn money right away and IT jobs are all you can get right now then it's better than starving... We very much need IT people to keep the software we write up and running.For games and multiplayer online games specifically you'll need to have good overall programming skills and pattern awareness to implement the gameplay logic. Plus OS awareness, networking, database design/implementation for the online part. Plus a good understanding of 2D or 3D graphics as applicable for the rendering part. Then there's all the art...If you use a modern game engine you can mostly get away with just doing the art and use their abstractions for most of the other stuff. Still very much need to know most of the above though, just not as much as if you were to implement it.\"multiplayer online game\" is very ambitious, so a very rough idea of what your expectations starting from zero should be: A small/toy 2D game you could build within the next few months. A very simple 3D one within the next year. A moderately complicated multiplayer online game within the next *decade*.",

Mimo, Brilliant, and apps like those are good for getting your feet wet, so I wouldn't tell you to stop. However, once you feel like you want more of a challenge, and are looking for more in-depth knowledge that'll last you through your career, I would recommend free courses like cs50, The Odin Poject, or freeCodeCamp.

As you've discovered, checking pixel-level collisions like this is a bit performance intensive.Most games don't check collisions this way. Instead, like \"You can't move through walls\" or \"If an enemy touches you, you die\" are determined by representing both the character and the object as simple shapes. Boxes and circles are the most popular (often the sides of the box are parallel to the coordinate axes which makes the math super simple). A \"capsule\" shape is also quite easy (it's just the union of a box and two circles). Triangles involve more math to program, but may be helpful if you want arbitrary rotation or more complicated shapes (any shape is approximately a polygon; any polygon can be broken into triangles).Often the hitbox really is, quite literally, a box!",

Whether it was a small game, or tool on my computer, I just liked making stuff.I started when I was around 14, so the projects I was interested in reflect that. One of my early programs was a tool to automatically fish for me in Runescape. It scanned the screen for certain color patterns and clicked things, and it was the coolest thing ever.Find something that interests you and make it. For me, that was:* Automation tools, like the Runescape bot or a program I wrote for an internship to scrape a website* Game AI, like for Chess. It's cool to see something you made be better at a game than you* Coding challenges, like CodingGame (also kinda Game AI I guess)* Computer graphics. I *tried* to make my own game engine, didn't finish but it was enjoyable",

        "body": "First off coding is work, it doesn't produce adrenaline but rather headaches, drowsiness and fatigue. Lets not 3 Mile Island the world here, C or Python, should not cause somebody to feel slow and dumb. So the first thing that comes to mind right now is to choose one, which if you are learning is C.Not to date myself but I first got interested in computers before the S100 bus debuted, so maybe 13 or 14 at the time. For years all I could do is read Byte and when I could find it Dr.Dobbs. It wasn't until the Vic-20 came out, 1980, that I could actually afford a computer and that ViC 20 was barely usable. So for a good number of years my interests where satisfied by reading what I could.It actually took me a while to get to college and that was where my first formal training started and unlearning the VIC 20. At the time the school had Sun workstations so that was like a step into the future. So what motivated me, well the place I was working for was paying the bill. Since I didn't want to go hungry anymore it was a good idea to keep working. Now that said not a programmer per say but use the knowledge almost everyday before working. So staying sharp with software was important. However that required me to keep writing code, sometimes toy programs and in a couple of cases finding bugs for an Open Source project. At work I had some focus on CNC and PLC controllers which is always a challenge, beyond spread sheets and Python code. So even if work was NOT as a programmer, I was heavily involved in automation.Now that I'm retired the motivations are different. For example to keep track of my investments, I have spread sheets of stock portfolios. Now on the surface one might laugh at spreadsheet programming because it looks to be simple but I'd have to say there is as much depth there as their is with Python. The motivation is that I need to keep this organized and understand where my next meal is coming from.If you want to stay sharp though, who doesn't and frankly at this age you work at it, yo need to do more than stock portfolio management. To that end I keep a couple of hobbies going and use those interest to drive software development there. This is the key, use it or loose it. If you want to have any usable skill at all with respect to software you need to stay in the game. Motivation is sometimes hard to come by or even keep, so you really need to integrate programming into projects that you are interested in. Programming itself can also be a motivator, simply learning about new languages can motivate some. I didn't even know that C3 existed until yesterday for example and it actually looks interesting. For most of us though we need that outside pull to start a new project.Lets say you are into bicycling and those little trip computers look to be so handy. That lust could be the motivator for a DIY trip computer for a bicycle. Going DIY means it can work exactly as you expect, in every way it is yours. The challenges are the motivator. What are those challenges (just a few):1. Embedded project.2. Battery operated (maybe solar) and thus needs to be efficient3. Small custom Printed Circuit board.4. Limited screen size and I'o possibilities.5. Case size limitations.6. Limited program and data space.7. Limited programming languages due to microprocessor.In any event the project becomes the challenge.",

C is not significantly more math-intensive than any other language. Things like pointers are tricky for beginners, but those are tricky for beginners regardless of whether they're good at math or not.Modulus is something that will come up in any programming language. It's usually used to determine if a number is evenly divisible by another number. It's pretty easy, conceptually. Divide two numbers. Discard everything before the decimal point. That's modulo. Like, 9 % 3: That's 9/3, or 3.0. Discard the 3. You're left with 0.0. It's evenly divisible.Now do the same thing, 9 % 4. I'm pulling out my calculator for this part. That's 2.25. Discard the leading 2. You're left with 25. Not evenly divisible. In most cases, that's as far as you'll need to go with it. Some sub-disciplines within software are very math-heavy, such as graphics/games programming and AI/machine learning.

If you build a game using raylib, you'll need to learn quite a bit. If you encounter difficult maths problems, someone has probably figured out how to do it so you don't have to work from scratch, and there are plenty of good resources online to learn the harder stuff. You'll also naturally develop your math skills as you progress as a programmer.I will now offer rambling unsolicited advice on learning math based on my own experience. I believe many people that believe they are bad at math are encountering two related problems that make it difficult to identify or articulate why learning math is harder for them relative to others. The first is missing prerequisite knowledge, the second is study methods that do not work or are inappropriate for them. The exception is for some cases where neurodevelopment and learning disabilities create hard limits, however in many cases these can be managed by adjusting your study methods (as was the case for me, as I have ADHD and dyspraxia).Learning math and learning to program are very similar in that there are foundational concepts/skills you need to learn or develop in a particular order before you can learn more advanced content. When I got to university I had a lot of gaps in my knowledge; elementary stuff that compounded from my early education through to high school (which I ended up dropping out of). This conceptual debt made it harder to progress over time, while others only had to learn one new concept to solve a problem, I might need 5 or 6, which snowballs very quickly. This also made the traditional lecture -> tutorial -> homework learning pipeline ineffective because it assumes you have certain prerequisite knowledge and they cant/won't help you identify specific concepts needed to catch up.I found it much easier to learn at home following youtube videos (I highly recommend organic chemistry tutor), khan academy lessons, resources on the r/learnmath mega thread, or good textbooks with clear progression and references to related previous topics. These formats are easy to pause if something is too advanced, giving you the opportunity to go learn prerequisites as you need, before returning to the original problem. To practice I would follow videos of worked examples, print 50-100 problems to work through, then mark my own answers to find if/where I was going wrong. I'd also return to reattempt packets of questions later. Now I have the ability to not only deal with difficult math problems day to day, but when I can't I have learned how to learn to solve things. Good luck, and apologies for the wall of text!TLDR; Don't worry. You probably aren't bad at math, missing prerequisite knowledge and/or study methods that don't work for you might be falsely giving you that impression.",

That said, it's one of the more primitive options. If you feel another language has something more to offer you, that's your call. However, you're learning both programming and a programming language. The language is not the hard part. Once you wrap your head around programming, the language is just an implementation detail.> or would it be wise to simply use another language that isnt as math intensive?There isn't one. The math you run into in C is to be found in any other language. Some languages will let you get away with being more sloppy, but I'm not sure if that's better or worse for you.> I don't have very little foundation with mathematics beyond basic +,-,*,/ problems.Again, you generally don't need it. Also, unlike on a math quiz, you have a computer to check your work. You might think the formula you wrote will offer a certain result, but the computer will let you know if you're right.> I'm struggling pretty hard to get through the math related portions.I'm the programmer who sucks at math, which is why I tend to respond verbosely to things like this. Programming really doesn't require math. A mathematician will say it's all math, but that's their problem. Programming requires a way of thinking and, amusingly, some folks who are very good at math kind of suck at it. I hate seeing folks with math frustration allow that to gatekeep their possible programming glory.I got a minor in computer science, where the only higher math course required was calculus 1. I took it twice, passed the second time. I also tutored people in programming. One student, a science major, had her 4.0 in jeopardy because of a basic programming class she thought would be easy. Another student I helped out was my former calc professor, trying to learn programming.Being science or math oriented doesn't equate to programming success. Some of the worst code I've ever seen comes from engineers; folks who know and use far more math than most mortals.I mayn't be great at math, but I can program and have done it professionally for decades. And, so can you. Good luck.",

Our team have seen much better results and project velocity in training engineers up in software development than we have in trying to teach software developers about the AEC space. All your current experience plus a reasonable amount of software development knowledge should open up some exciting doors.My second observation that you are more than welcome to ignore is that, based on your comment at least, you might be at risk of spreading yourself quite thin. Python alone is going to open up hundreds of rabbit holes you can dive into, web development is fantastic to have an understanding of especially if you want to hook your python scripts up to services or APIs but again is a bit of a behemoth, and ethical hacking is of course a huge field in itself.I'm not trying to dissuade you from any of it, it sounds like you find loads of it interesting which is fantastic, but focusing on one at a time to a reasonable depth and making sure to cover your fundamentals would be my advice. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is a great course / website / book if you want to start seeing some results early on. LLMs can be great personal tutors too if you're happy to be patient with them when they lose the plot, but they're pretty double edged in that they will also rob you of learning opportunities if you lean on them too heavily.Hope some of that helps!",

It’s overkill for many personal projects, but is the standard for enterprise software in my experience. I also just think it’s nice to have a server for the UI for a million reasons, even just to have things like environment variables without rebuilding. Even if you don’t want to hide away your true backend, server-side rendering and other server features that are UI-specific are still useful.",

You need to build things yea but you also need to monitor your weaknesses and practice.Start by learning a programming language and core software development concepts until you can build something. For this look at courses (free or paid) and also doing coding exercises like from [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/).Once you feel confident you can start to look at small projects you can build, aim for something you can build in 2-3 days which will require some core concepts or development pattern. This is practice, not designed to build things to release or for a portfolio. Repeat building more core understanding and building bigger projects.During this process try to step back and identify weak areas and focus on them.Key advice, don’t get hung up on remembering syntax and language specifics, that can be looked up while coding. But you do need to understand core concepts and patterns. Example: having to look up the syntax for a for loop is ok, not knowing when you need to use a for loop not ok.",

Look up Bob Tabor and go through his javascript course. It is as easy as it gets, but you won't be a developer when you're done. What it will do is instill concepts and maybe give you some confidence, because when you are done, you'll realize, Bob Tabor makes it look easy. But he's slow and methodical.2. Start on a free and easy platform like w3schools. They are constantly adding content and I have full access (got it on sale), so I can pretty much do anything, learn new skills as they are added, get certifications.3. Lookup roadmaps and game plan all this4. Eventually I think you need to consider paying to learn, on a platform or in college.5. You might look into Team TreehouseI have used Team Treehouse's platform and they have what's called tech degrees. Some companies have heard of them and people have gotten jobs after completing their curriculum. But it's no guarantee. Thing is, without something reputable on your resume, you won't get a job, so if you're learning for fun, great, if you're looking for a career, well, just go on indeed or elsehwhere and see how many jobs there are for inexperienced engineers and look at the requirements. Nearly all require a degree, and nearly all are using ATSs to scan resumes, so no degree means, resume is dragged to trash bin. Self-taught is alright, but you won't save yourself time, and you should think about paid school, just because that's the smart route. Employers trust Professors, not youtube instructors. I mean, it's okay to be home-schooled, but I'll tell ya, you may still be studying in 6 years on your own.So that's my recommendation for you. Have some goals. Lookup roadmaps. Game plan.Honestly, you should consider a different career, like delivering pizzas. Something that's less resourceful than building code. Dreams die when reality hits. None of this is easy. If you use Tabor and w3schools, maybe they instill the confidence for you to move onto harder learning, because that's beginning stuff, and you need to get into intermediate and advanced concepts and learn far more than HTML/CSS/JS to get a job (or to show anyone you're serious). My guess is, you'll give up like everyone else. But if you are driven and surprise us all, please check in with progress reports.

I've seen devs accidentally leak API keys or internal URLs when sharing learning projects. \\`git filter-branch\\` or BFG Repo-Cleaner are lifesavers for this.

You can set it up so that when you push a new change to github, a build will be started, you can set it up in such a way that new code changes can't be merged into your main branch UNLESS that build succeeds. You can write automated tests to test your code, and only merge into main if those pass. For a small project you might just think \"whatever\" but a big project this is very very useful.Log viewer looks fine - but path to log is hard coded in. What you should do is change it to take command line arguments, for the path and the different options it presents the user with.Look at some code that accepts and parses command line arguments - You want to use this mechanism if possible. Consider this: if you want that interactive aspect where it asks you to pick an option and then you pick one, you can still have that if you use command line args, but you'd wrap it in a shell script (or batch file on windows). You don't really want to restrict any tool you write to interactively ask the user for input, when all user input it requires can be given up front as command line args.",

The 3rd call to what? to quicksort()? to partition()? But quicksort has two recursive calls inside it for the left and right, and no obvious order to them. So which one is the 3rd one? Is it the first recursive call on the left, the first recursive call on the right, or the second recursive call on the left, or the second recursive call on the right? Also, what is the partition scheme being used? If I make some educated guesses:The first call to partition with pivot=4 results in \\[4, 55, 92, 80, 81, 95, 88, 19, 52, 38, 71, 74\\] and now the pivot is at index 0Now we recursively call and partition the right with pivot=74 to get \\[4, 55, 71, 38, 52, 19, 74, 88, 95, 81, 80, 92\\] with pivot going to index 6.Now recursively call and partition the left (that's \\[55 .. 19\\]) to get \\[4, 19, 71, 38, 52, 55, 74, 88, 95, 81, 80, 92\\] with pivot now at index 1.I'm guessing that's where they got k=1?",

It's not necessarily the \"holy grail\" solution (in the end, organization of any kind requires work, no matter whether you're using docker or WSL2 or whatever else), but nowadays VMs are quite handy for the following reasons --1. Storing a VM and moving it around nowadays is cheap due to low-cost portable storage (e.g. multi-TB portable USB hard disks).2. Virtualization is in basically all decent laptops nowadays, so virtualizing an OS, although not as fast as \"the real deal\", is definitely \"fast enough\" for almost all tasks.3. Trying out other OSes is fun (for me personally). If I had to install a new distro on my hardware itself to try out something new like Omarchy (which got a lot of attention recently), then most likely, I would just never even try it at all. If I have a VM though and am used to using them, then there's no excuse not to try something new like that -- the only cost is the hard disk space (BUT, see point #1 above). Finally, if you do start \"losing track\" of what you have installed somewhere, then my solution nowadays for big disks is to just fire up a tool like WinDirStar (or QDirStat on Linux distros) and then start consolidating stuff into physically adjacent locations. For example, most likely all of your streaming stuff should be on a single drive PLUS a backup drive (presumably the cost of an extra drive is much less than the horror you will experience if you lose your recordings accidentally or drop your disk in the toilet by mistake or something else like that).",

I am not sure how difficult this would be or how interested you are in JWST but that could be a fun project. I am sure you can find some science data your interested in to do projects with.

One company we worked with had a NSFW mode on their site, so I usually worked with that toggled on whenever it was possible. Otherwise, browser extensions can also be useful to blur/black out images as-needed, and on staging sites where we did a lot of our dev work we wouldn't test with actual NSFW content, and instead use whatever bland imagery/videos we had on-hand. This actually works out better in most cases; If you're troubleshooting compression issues on UGC, it can be handy to test with specific images/videos so you can see differences in compression in a more controlled format.Now, when troubleshooting production problems? Yeah, sometimes you can't avoid seeing some.. Stuff, and even if whatever it is \\_is\\_ your kink, you're there to work, not jack off (especially if it's a production issue that's costing the business money).Given I primarily do front-end work, the hardest part for me can be focusing on the issues no matter what is being displayed front-end center..

We had to dig deep into how to prevent the presence of these bots and taking down their posts and deleting everything in short notice before they'd shut down the whole forum. Unfortunately vBulletin didn't have many tools at the time to recognize these posts like modern online community sites do, so we had to implement this from scratch (with the help of a group of students from a local university one of the cofounders of the forum was tutoring their thesis)",

If you can accept and find a way to keep your leverage, learning, and identity separate, you'll be far better off. When you lose one of those things, like your job, it really helps if you don't spiral and remember you still have leverage, and keeping learning.The failure mode for some many people in this field is basically: job loss -> identity collapse -> loss of continued learning -> inability to frame leverage for new jobs -> out of field. They have everything they need to keep moving forward, but the ideal of accepting the chaos and moving incrementally through without the shield of formal employment is too much. You have the skills, you have the experience, you just adopt a resilient mentality. It's okay to take a break, and of course none of this is far, but also, no one is coming to rescue you.",

Know that it's not too late. A lot of people are JUST getting back from holiday vacation now. Now's actually a GOOD time to apply for jobs. Let's look at what you DO have! You'll have your degree, you'll have your medical data internship, you'll have some decent project experience, and your AWS certification. That's more than most people. Everything will be okay. Keep it up with the applications. Remember to apply to any and every company you can think of. Apply to med companies, tech companies, space companies, banks, insurance companies, the power company, your local city if they hire developers (many do for things like the city websites and sometimes for infrastructure).

He is killing team morale, and if his behavior continues to go unaddressed the good people on your team are going to start heading for the exits.Taking the management position puts you more in the line of fire, and TBH this is kind of the most un-fun situation you can walk into as a new manager, but it also gives you more control over how this goes down and *potentially* gives you an opportunity to get some great peer feedback from the other team members at performance review time if you effectively clean up this messy situation.It's up to you, and how much initiative you want to take. Taking the manager position under these conditions is definitely the higher risk, higher reward path. I think I would have a very honest discussion with your boss and tell them you might take the position, but you need to know the full context of what you're walking into before committing to it. That seems like a fair request to me. The comments that concern me most is the current manager saying things like \"this is a really delicate situation right now\". That *could* mean that they are just naturally conflict-avoidant and are (unrealistically) hoping that the kid will knock it off on his own (he won't). *Alternatively* it could mean that the manager knows something about the situation that you don't, and as a new manager walking in to deal with it I would want to know what I'm getting myself into.",

And the process was not competitive (avoided leetcode and technical interviews ahahahha) but Ill see if I wanna branch to data engineering or business analytics in the future/ would like to explore a diff industry. The idea that I can branch into different fields without necessarily having to start from ground 0 is appealing because I’m a type of person who likes the idea of moving around cities and trying new things. However if you feel like you don’t like technical work n a diff major is more aligned to what is fulfilling for u; go for it.

I’ve always been skilled with coding but knew I needed to put in extra work to learn more tools and languages, as well as come up with impactful projects to have on my resume. I thought a lot about it and realized i didnt want to do the upskilling work necessary to be appealing in the tech job market— this led me to realize that the industry work in general may not be for me. So as a CS major— be very introspective about whether you are willing to do the work you’ll need to do to get internships and jobs rn. Even if the job market gets better, it will still be just as competitive in my opinion— from here on out just the degree won’t be nearly enough. Ask yourself if you’re afraid of doing the extra work because you’re doubting yourself *or* if it genuinely just doesn’t interest you. It was the latter for me, so I switched. Lastly, look at any data your current college puts out about career outcomes, and look on Linkedin to see how people who graduated in CS from your college recently are performing. Talk to any upperclassmen you know about their struggles or successes in finding internships, because if you dont get an internship during college, the only thing thatll help you in the postgrad job search will be luck and an immense grind on applications and a project portfolio. Ask yourself if you enjoy CS enough to do that. A lot of people are! I was not.",

Maybe 1-2 will get a green card before they’re 50 if they’re exceptional. AI has made these margins just smaller. Fewer jobs, lower pay, especially at the entry level. Once your foot is in the door- you’re a lot better off. Any experience in India does not matter.

Not UML diagrams or factory patterns. I work at Prepfully and from what our ML coaches tell me, companies like Meta and Google focus heavily on ML system design (think designing a recommendation system end-to-end) rather than traditional software patterns.Leetcode is still important though, especially for the coding rounds.Your time is better spent on ML-specific design (feature stores, training pipelines, A/B testing frameworks) and leetcode.

Doesn't need to be a GoF, but extensible, maintainable code doesn't just organically come about from a language's built-in features. Over the last 10 years, I've worked with multiple codebases (at FAANG and out) that were really poor at extending to new use cases. Each of the teams had this code-level blind spot: they had business requirements, they had system-level designs, but at the code-level, it was coder's choice on structure and pattern.",

If you report this to his next level or HR, he will get fired. So this can mean one of the following: 1. If you are a good performer, and expecting a salary raise, your manager want to give you that raise, but he feels unable to negotiate with upper management, so he is nudging you to get an offer and then use that as a leverage for your own sake. 2. Your manager has insights into upcoming downsizing and he is okay if you go. He is pretending to \"match\" your offer but giving you a chance to secure a good position. 3. Your manager for some dark reason is working against the interest of the company. He is either disgruntled. 4. Perhaps he is really concerned for his future, and sees that you have become relaxed at work place and not growing your skills, so this is his clever way of making you realise that you are still not good enough as an all rounded engineer. 5. Perhaps he is really concerned about your future, and general nature of the industry and the need to be in the habit of interviewing. 6. Your manager is just plain stupid and doesn't know how to do his job properly. I think it is a combination of 1 and 6. However there are better ways to do his job than nudging an employee to get an offer so that he can give you a raise.",

It has little to do with whether or not AI is useful; it’s clear that there is a market for access to LLMs (even if the people who want to pay for them are wrong about their usefulness, which I’m not saying they are or are not.). Think about previous bubbles: the dotcom bubble did not mean the internet was useless, for goodness sake, nor did the housing bubble mean uh, houses were useless. In both cases, it rather meant investors had made foolish decisions about where to put their money in a mad rush to profits driven by hype. It is pretty clear at this point that there similarly just is not a path to investors making their money back given how much investment has gone into this now. However, the thing about any bubble is there’s no telling what it will take to pop. It may go tomorrow, or it might take another few years. There’s no way to know, usually. In the case of the housing bubble, you could look at when the higher rates of crappy ARMs kicked in and make a pretty solid bet things would fall apart at that point (see The Big Short) but that was a special case.You can look at the AI buildout and see, “okay, we’re building data centers like there’s no tomorrow, Nvidia’s accounts receivable is ballooning [ie, they’re allowing companies to take out debt to pay them], we keep inventing more 2008-style debt instruments to build these data centers, OpenAI and Anthropic and Cursor are completely unprofitable” and you can see that this cannot go on. But the bubble will only pop when investors lose faith in a major way, and there’s not really any telling when that will happen. There are some signs it might be soon, but it won’t happen until it does.",

Spend some time learning how to use the tech effectively, while maintaining your standards. If your company gives you the flexibility, look into spec driven workflows like speckit or BMAD.

I have deliberately constrained myself to more tech focused roles, because that is what I thrive in, but I have moved around within that space, be it as tech lead, architecture or pure senior developers.I have had the opportunity to be CTO and everything in-between, which I've declined.But to answer the concrete question: It depends. Burnout is a fickle beast. It might help just getting a new day-to-day, or it might make it worse due to pressure to perform in a new role. It ca go both ways.In my case, it helped, but there are no guarantees.> Did you feel more exposed during layoffs? I didn't, no.> How did you make your value visible when outcomes were less tangible?When I'm in a more architectur'y or tech lead'y roles it is more about mentoring and communication, so the more you're seen around the teams, helping out, answering questions and just being someone that enables those around you, then that is mostly enough.Making other teams succeed is also a success for you. Just make sure that you're actually a part of that success and not leeching of it (looking at you middle management).In higher positions you also get to start initiatives you believe brings value, and that value can be measured in some way. But again, don't be the guy that just starts stuff just to boost their resume. Do something that the others will actually like (or at least have good support from the ones that will be affected).",

I made one switch after being burn out due to boredom and ended up in basically the corporate trash pile of non-performers that had managers who found it easier to move them to this new effort than to terminate them. I had an impossible situation of kicking something off with a bunch of people who had poor skills, poor follow through, and poor attitudes. I was heavily involved in terminating over 80% of the team, including my boss. All while trying (and obviously failing) to make forward progress and then playing catchup while onboarding the new team while dealing with an unhappy customer who just wanted results. I was very busy for a period with HR actions, customer engagements to appease an upset customer, serving the role of like 5 different positions, trying to come up with clever ways to meet impossible milestones, convincing company leadership that the project was completely screwed and we needed help, etc. I went from boring to extremely not boring. But one type of burn out to another. Having a mountain of work to get done that grows much faster than you burn it down, constantly pivoting to emergent tasks that had to be resolved immediately and had me up until 3am writing documents and building slides, dealing with nasty people on the regular… it really wears you out. I’d much rather have the burn out from boredom over that.",

This alleviates you from your current daily grind and gives you a fresh new grind and a new bought of imposter syndrome. For example, you could be the retail industry expert floater who is brought in to talk about macro industry outcomes and not just technology design. This would mean more high level executive vision discussions and more delegation of execution & architecture details — more soothing for your fried brain, but comes with a learning curve. You know, trade offs. This might set you up for a leadership role in a real industry instead of tech where you can actually own something. Or you could coast in post sales / enablement.

Now I am getting consistent interviews every week since I started applying in earnest again about 3 months ago after doing all that.I used to get excited about interviews, now I've had so many I don't get as excited anymore, but certainly feels better than before. Like I'm making progress. And I know the interviews I failed, I'd ace now (no more failing leetcode, how would you build this project okay well I went ahead and built a professional level project of exactly that, etc). Most of my interviews seem to go to the final stage only to be told they filled it with an ex employee returning or the position is no longer needed though.",

On days where I didn't fell like writing yet another cover letter I'd convince myself to just find 3 job ads I liked and leave the tabs open, which would turn into starting the cover letter, and eventually into applying to all 3. Also, start using an AI assistant to help, like copy+pasting the role text into it and getting a score for your profile. Networking helps a lot, I suck at it so I can't help, but you should try to expand your Linkedin friends list. Speaking of Linkedin, forget Easy Apply, I haven't heard of a single person who got hired through it. A really good advice I found was, find Linkedin Easy Apply jobs and then apply through the company website. Good luck",

This limits your options with non-programming jobs to ones that you are physically able to perform unfortunately.

It's done basically 0 for me other than I have a MUCH better idea of what's going on with electronic devices compared to pretty much everyone I work with. That's worth... basically nothing over the course of a typical 9-5. Not exactly a CS MS, but a technical degree with some rigor nonetheless (like a CS MS).Generally speaking, degrees like EE, CS, CE, ME, etc. are all fungible. Nobody really cares which specific degree you received as long as you can pass the interview. As you get further in your career the fact that you have a degree becomes completely irrelevant, unless you need to check the box to meet requirements for a job. A CS degree might be a more natural fit for today's LC style interviews, but an EE major that takes a few electives can easily be on-par and any major that grinds LC problems will have a massive advantage.I've interviewed a large number of folks over the years. I can think of 3 personal projects out of well over 100 that were actually interesting to me. Most are obvious resume fluff and might as well just not exist. The 3 that were interesting were all related to hobbies that the individual had. For example, one was for scheduling and tracking autocross (I think? maybe some other race type) races. It was technically not very exciting in the least but demonstrated that the individual could identify business opportunities and then deliver value.",

Picking up “slower” hobbies. For me specifically, the gateway drug into slower hobbies was painting. Having a hobby/skill that takes a long time to develop and see results from is what you need to get out of the lowest effort dopamine cycle of social media. You need to do something that delays your dopamine payoff for much longer than minutes to start training your brain to not expect it all the time.3. Diet and Exercise - this fits in the same category as #2 in that it’s a slower payoff activity, but I think it deserves its own mention because being able to physically see your progress is huge motivation and doing it just puts you mentally in a better space.",

The upside of this is that you don't need to spend hours in library or school.

As a simple example, let's take variable assignments: x = 1 y = 3 y = x print x print yWhat would the output of this block of pseudo code be? Among students new to computer programming, a variety of answers are common:Some, intuit overwrite semantics and answer: 1 1Some, intuit swap semantics and answer: 3 1Some, intuit move semantics and answer: 0 1A good teacher will have a series of test questions designed to ferret out these mismatched mental models, and correct them. Once students have good mental models of how languages behave they can finally start learning.So I doubt that you are cooked. You probably just need a bit of guidance. If you're struggling with a particular concept, go talk to your teacher. Write out the different possible code snippets you're considering to achieve a particular task, and have him explain why they do or don't work.Have you tried sitting down, and just writing some simple code to see if you understand things. I would suggest using a language that offers a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) so that you can try things out interactively without getting bogged down. A google collab notebook, or a Jupyter notebook can be great for this.I got started writing software when I was in 4th grade on my Commodore 64. Started out just faffing around with loops to repeatedly print things like \"I am the greatest!\" on the screen. I played around with sorting algorithms. I created a program to display the Mandelbrot set (it took about 12 hours to calculate on the C64 when written in BASIC). I even learned to use raster-interrupts and bank-switching to create a double-resolution interlaced display (albeit at an eye-watering 30Hz).",

I don't think it is soon enough at all to quit like the other commenter is saying.",

The chill rotations I've had you'd maybe get one off hours page every six months or so, maybe.It's more of a mixed bag for the rotations I don't like, but when I see corners being cut for deadlines and product managers being okay with that I get real nervous. I had one rotation (also at Google) where I could expect to get a 2AM incident at least a few times that would take hours to address, and I held the pager every other month. It was hell. I burned out so fast.On call bonuses were normalized at Google, I wish that was more industry standard. We essentially made half pay for the 16 off-hours on-call time (double pay for two weeks).

Also every day I get handed things that aren’t outright wrong but don’t quite make sense and we work it out. Asking questions helps to resolve those things. Part of being a developer is actually validating requirements and things you’ve been assigned. It’s an ongoing dialog. You got through a CS program, you’re smart enough to figure it all out but be proud of your work but also humble and you’ll be a better developer for it. It took me 6 months to get okay at asking for help. I was used to never needing assistance in school. I never got any help from tutoring or anything in computer science classes bc it always clicked and was easy for me. I had this weird sense of pride about that. I did good work my first 6 months like that but definitely spun my wheels a bit and could have done better had I just embraced collaborating with folks. Now if I don’t understand it after spending a few minutes looking stuff up, I ask for another set of eyes or to talk something out.

He was still working at Netflix, but then taught our DSA class as well. Some days we wouldn’t have class cause he’d have to fly out to California.

Completely self taught myself graphics programming through The Cherno, LearnOpenGL, and Game Engine Architecture Volume 3, since my college classes did not really cover it in particular. Made the switch because I desperately needed something more fulfilling job wise than game dev, which was drying up way back in 2018 just about. Way before Ai and outsourcing has caught on. I enjoyed C++ so I did that. Then fast forward a bit more I dabbled in web dev a bit (did use Ai to initially learn, and figured it out in about a month), did that a bit longer but really did not like it. So, basically just learned I love working in C++. From there just continued building little c++ projects and am now actively working on my engine which is in a presentable state, but nowhere near complete (if it ever will be). Recently been diving into embedded for job opportunities, since even graphics development is a big challenge in my area. Been screwing around on my Nucleo board, and building circuits and what not. The job doesn't require embedded, but is definitely embedded oriented. So, I have a bunch of little nick nack projects in c++, my engine, and this sample embedded project just to show I am interested in embedded. At the end of the day, I have quite a bit to talk about in an interview. I bet they would maybe be surprised for someone to explain how they developed a fairly large project, made design decisions, and just know the full ins and outs of the project they built, especially from new grads. At least, that's just under the presumption that a lot of candidates may be going full fledge into Ai and not understand a lick of what they are doing. Regardless I feel as though I do fit the role, it is super duper entry level after all (they listed wanting someone with some form of knowledge in at least one out of every language under the sun basically), but was just concerned how fast they expect you to adapt to something more complex than you have ever worked on before. My engine is three projects, with about 100 files, but that's a drop compared to a companies code base with thousands just on one project.Edit: All of that just to say I am currently waiting to hear from them, though they are located near me in bumb-fuck nowhere. So, there may be a couple qualified candidates, but not many. On top of that, they have five roles open for the position, so just increases the odds.",

Status every day people bring up problems they had all day the day prior. One of the juniors on my project is like that so I check in on her most days to see how things are going and chitchat.

You might annoy someone mildly but that’s just bc they are focused. Come in a meeting and say you struggled for 8 hours the day before to understand something that takes 5 minutes to figure out?

Chances are low they’ll actually look through the projects, but they can be talking points during your interview. Some people are genuine geeks with curiosity, so it’s possible you could get lucky, and someone will be passionate about one of the topics around one of your projects. If you’re going for traditional web dev, you could develop a few different backend systems. SQL/NoSQL/event-based architecture are a few that come to mind. The OS/game engine stuff is more relevant if you’re targeting those types of jobs. I’ve seen so many people with a chess game on their resume. I don’t care in the context of an interview, but I might enjoy taking about it while getting to know you.",

Most of my friends work in big tech (UWaterloo grads) and don't write much code themselves anymore.

My first role was a 3-month contract that I only got because of my healthcare domain knowledge. It was almost entirely Excel3.

I'm in the devops/IT infra market, with \\~10 YoE. I have an unfinished degree in area unrelated to CS and am in the process of obtaining bachelor in CS. This doesn't look great on my CV obviously.I would like to further my resume by getting certificate, since companies using AWS are my target, I plan to get AWS certificate(I chose the architect ones).The purpose is only to pass around HR/AI, I'm confident in my ability to deliver business-visible results.The thing is, I am terrible at taking exams. I did 2 practice tests - one for associate and one for professional. Based on the results I will have to invest significant time on passing the professional one.So I'm trying to figure out if the ROI on the professional one is worth it or associate will also fulfil the goal of passing HR.",

        "body": "Hello, Ive been at my current job for about 1.5 years. I havent had much luck in landing interviews, but I also haven't been around as aggressively. Although I did get one phone interview from Capital One, where I talked to the recruiter but she told me that I would get rejected from the position since I didnt meet the baseline requirements of a 1.5 year minimum for the position. She gave me her number and told me to apply again in January since that is when I would meet the requirement. I am going to text her soon now, and apply to the position she tells me to apply to, but I am wondering on whether I should put this startup I had a big part in founding, and getting off the ground. Its only 3 months in and its steadily growing traction. I obviously don't get paid by it yet so need another full time job on top of it. Should i include it on my resume? I think I have done some cool things while working on it and it rounds out my skills well. My only concern is whether this would dissuade recruiters from selecting me for an interview since it may seem like I wouldn't be able to put the time commitment into the paying full time job. For the record, I've done a pretty good job on balancing both and still am able to perform well at my current job. Just concerned on whether this is a plus or a con to a recruiter. I would love some feedback on this and my resume overall. Thanks!resume: [https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu](https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu)",

IMO working with these tools will become just part of the job over time.As someone who took a deep tech / architectural track over the last 10 years, I think the product / marketing side is actually the better focus for the next 10 years.I would guess that something like 70% of the work done by humans in the last 10 years will be accessible to non-technical vibe coding folks like PMs and leads now. What used to be a PM + 5 engineers in the future might be 2 PMs vibe coding + 1 super deep engineer supporting with human effort. There will still be a need for hardcore deep tech people to do truly novel / hard things. But there will be so much opportunity for people who actually have product / business skills to create prototypes and find PMF before that point.For you as someone who doesn't currently have those deep skills, this is a fresh slate. On the tech side you would be competing against people like me who DID spend 10 years coming up the old way, hands on. Whereas on the product side, I think a lot of the engineers are hopeless and even demonstrating luddite behavior as they see their jobs threatened. That seems like the path of least resistance for you.It does depend on your nature a bit also. Personally I have always enjoyed both the product and engineering sides. I gravitated to the tech side because it was more valuable and the limiting factor. I very much feel that shifting now the other direction for a lot of types of software products.",

Most of what I use I learned on the job. If you only care about the basics, you won't make it through interviews. Recruiters like passion.If you want to get hired in embedded, you want/need the full EE or CE degree. Half the jobs won't interview CS and the ones that will, you're a lower tier candidate. Very little of standard CS coursework involves low-level coding and none of it involves learning bare metal from the logic gate up.Your list isn't enough prep but Signal Analysis and Processing is the most fundamental to advanced EE and CE theory.

If you want embedded software then I would do signal analysis and processing it is critical to IOT (granted most signal analysis courses will require circuits as a pre-req). Digital circuits and systems is not going to help you as much as an embedded SWE, nor will EE fundamentals as it will be more mathematical theory. Automatic controls is more for robotics or system control (which is more niche).",

Depending on how hardware oriented you wanna get you might even manage to throw in FPGAs and some other stuff. Regarding EE/CE only for embedded? Sure they’re more inclined but CS for embedded is perfectly valid and you aren’t seen as a lower tier candidate because your degree is highly relevant. Ofc this depends on position, you have no clue about PCBs or pure electronics but for an embedded software position it’s more than enough. I’m a CS grad, and in my BS I had about a 40% overlap with the CE program. I’m in my masters now, and I have plenty of embedded, low level and hardware related courses which I take as a pure CS student. I also do research in hardware security, where the majority of my peers are ECE grads (I’d say 70%) and the rest CS. Apparently the notion that CS degrees don’t touch low level stuff and are only pure high software is quite propagated which typically doesn’t hold true. As for job prospects, a bunch of my peers work in embedded with CS degrees and I worked nearly two years part time as well in embedded.",

I would still require a visa to live in the US, but I've had multiple points in my life where I could have chosen to move to the US permanently. I chose to move to the UK.Dublin, Paris, and Berlin don't, imo, have a better tech scene. You get a lot more jobs and variety in London. The pay also doesn't compare and you usually have much more growth opportunities in London. I speak about Dublin from experience, I moved from there to London. The other two I've mostly seen from a distance and talking to friends. Berlin is probably the one that gets closest, but the truth is that FAANGs all have large tech offices in London, they don't all have one in Berlin. Add that to the language issue (I don't speak German) and it doesn't make much sense to move there.The US tech jobs are a much more interesting problem. The Bay Area and Seattle have objectively better tech scenes, higher salaries, and more variety in jobs. My problem with both of them (but especially the Bay) is that I do not enjoy or want to live in either of those places. I enjoy living in a city where I can walk places, where there's public transport, where there's a museum, culture, and arts scene, where it's easy to travel to other countries, and where not everything is tech.NYC would be a good option, and while the salaries aren't as good as the Bay, they're still likely better than London. I think it provides a good mix, and if I were to ever move to the US I would go there. I do still not like living in the US generally though. As I said, there's certain aspects of how European cities work that I enjoy, and to add to it, I enjoy getting plenty of days off to enjoy my free time and I feel like I have more breathing room while still finding interesting things to work for good pay. Between that and the fact that I've now established myself here and I have a friend group that I'm happy with and a flat I own, I'm unlikely to want to move.Edit: another issue with the US I forgot to mention, the immigration precarity has always been an issue for me with the country and to a degree still is. In the time I've moved to the UK, got permanent residency and citizenship, many of my friends in the US haven't been able to get permanent residency status. In that period I've not really had any prolonged periods where I can't visit family or leave the country for holidays, whereas I've had friends who weren't able to leave for **2 whole years**. Most visas you can get to move to the US can put you in that situation if you ever want to turn your status into a long-term one, and you're treated throughout a lot of the process as if you're somehow doing something wrong. It's not a situation I want to put myself in",

The four big ones in the US: Bay Area, Pacific Northwest, NYC area, perhaps Austin area all need London people to go through an already difficult and now even more difficult US immigration system. Besides those what is there? Dublin, Paris and Berlin are downgrades from London in terms of volume of opportunities. There’s no single city in Europe, Canada or Australia actually that I think has more opportunity than London. Lots of other places are better to live in imo for quality of life btw, but if we’re talking strictly about volume of job opportunities there aren’t as many. Dubai and Singapore also have less opportunities and then India/China aren’t going to work for vast majority because of low salaries and cultural differences. I’m of Indian origin and just got back from a trip to India, it’s a fine place to live if you have an online business making an income to sustain your life there, especially if you like sunshine, but to work there, it’s not going to work for people born and raised in the west and for those wages your lifestyle would be very poor.The reality right now is tech jobs are in a precarious position all around. Outside the US, London’s probably the best, but that’s not saying much with the changing landscape with AI and lack of VC investment in anything other than AI. It’s the most stressful time to be in tech imo with respect to knowing what’s happening I’ve ever seen in my 20 year career.",

Data science/data domain has a similar track as does electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, IT and so on. The view that the primary source of value is management is antiquated and for most companies just plain old wrong. Management is a very valuable role in a company but if you are encouraging everyone to become managers for pay, value, and recognition in many companies that is just by bad management and bad leadershipThat doesn’t mean there are zero companies for which a primarily management centric view of advancement makes sense, just with the rising role of ai, technology, global competition, and flatter organizations, self directing team, etc it is becoming less and less prevalent",
