        "content": "Recently interviewed at DoorDash. Onsite had 4 rounds System Design, Data Modeling, Business Partner and Leadership The recruiter who had reached out regarding the role had transferred my profile to other recruiter at onsite process. This new recruiter , not friendly. In a cold email said that I should book time on her calendar for a prep call. Well there was not a single slot available for next 3 weeks. I kept checking for couple of days and finally found one. On the day of call she rescheduled for different time. On the call read the same pdf that she had shared with me over the email on what to expect. Not a great conversation. I’ve met really good recruiters who are friendly enough. System Design question - question was quite big 6-7 lines. I’ll put it in simple words - Design DataBricks! Yes, you read it right! Interviewer was interested in knowing how will I write exact YAML code for this. I was able to answer all his questions.Data Modeling - Design fitness app. But the interviewer wanted me to draw visualizations. Well never in my past 8 years of work experience I had to do any visualizations but looks like DE in DoorDash work on visualizations as well. It wasn’t a basic graph , some advanced trend graph. Business Partner - DoorDash expanding business how will you go about it etc. basic questions interviewer also seem to be onboarded on the approachesLeadership - Hiring Manager joined 2-3 minutes late. Didn’t bother to apologize. I ignored that and continued to talk with my positive energy. He said he will leave 10 minutes at the end for me to ask any questions. Questions were normal tell me about the time kind. Situation based. I answered all. He had multiple follow up questions. Kept asking something from the list. It was almost 5 minutes to end the meeting and then he stopped and started sharing about the team. Even here he didn’t ask if I have any questions. I had to ask him when we were at time if I can ask couple of questions. I felt like I performed well.Next day morning Recruiter’s cold email came in that team has not decided to move forward. Happy to answer any questions anyone has.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "https://i.redd.it/fsa3dtvkfrgg1.gifHello all!I'm new in this subreddit! I'm a Data Engineer with +3 years of experience in the field.As shown in the attached image, I'm making an ETL simulator in JavaScript, that simulates the data flow in a pipeline.Recently I came across a Linkedin post of a guy showcasing this project : [https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival](https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival)He made a little tower defense game that interactively teaches Cloud Architecture basics.It was interesting to see the engagement of the DevOps community with the project. Many have starred and contributed to the Github repo.I'm thinking about building something silimar for Data Engineers, given that I have some background in Game Dev and UI/UX too. I still need your opinion though, to see whether or not it is going to be that useful, especially that it will take some effort to come up with something polished, and AI can't help much with that (I'm coding all of the logic manually).The idea is that I want to make it easy to learn Apache Spark internals and distributed computing principles. I noticed that many Data Engineers (at least here in France), including seniors/experts, say they know how to use Apache Spark, yet they don't deeply understand what's happening under the hood.Through this game, I'll try to concretize the abstract concepts and show how they impact the execution performance, such as : transformations/actions, wide/narrow transformations, shuffles, repartition/coalesce, partitions skew, spills, node failures, predicate pushdown, ...etcYou'll be able to build pipelines by stacking transformer blocks. The challenge will be to produce a given dataframe using the provided data sources, while avoiding performance killers and node failures. In the animated image above, the sample pipeline is equivalent to the following Spark line : `new_df = source_df.filter($\"shape\" === \"star\").withColumn(\"color\", lit(\"orange\"))`I represented the rows with shapes. The dataframe schema will remain static (shape, color, label) and the rendering of each shape reflects the content of the row it represents. Dataframe here is a set of shapes.I'm still hesitant about this representation. Do you think it is intuitive and easy to understand ? I can always revert to the standard tabular visualisation of rows with dynamic schemas, but I guess it won't look user friendly when there are a lot of rows in action.The next step will be to add logical multi-node clusters in order to simulate the distributed computing. The heaviest task that I estimated would be the implementation of the data shuffling.I'll share the source code within the next few days, the project needs some final cleanups.In the meanwhile, feel free to comment or share anything helpful :)",

While it answers the basics right it still fails at complex things which require deep domain and business knowledge.There are several prompts injected and several key business indicators defined so the Agent performs good ( honestly if we add several more layers of prompt and chain few more agents it would get to answer come hard questions involving joining 6+ tables as well)Since it already answers some easy to medium questions based on your prompts the headcounts are just slashing. No I am good at what I do but I won't self proclaim as top 1%. I have very strong skillset to figure things out if I don't know about it. A coworker of mine has been the company for 6 years and didn't even realize how to solve things which I could do it ( even though I had no idea in the first place as well) . I just guess this person has become way more comfy and isn't aware how wild things are outside.Is there anyone actively considering goose farming or something else out of this AI field ?There is joy in browsing the internet without prompts and scrolling across website. There is joy in navigating UIs, drop downs and looking at the love they have put in. There is joy in minimizing the annoying chat pop that open ups at the website.And last thing I want to read is AI slop books by my fav authors.There is reason why chess is still played by humans and journalist still put heart out in their writing. There will also be a reason human DE/DS/DA/AE would be present in future but maybe a lot less.What's the motivation to still pursue this field ?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’ve been spending time lately looking into how big tech companies use specific phrasing to mask (or highlight) their updates, especially with all the chip investment deals going on. Earlier this week, I was going through the Microsoft earnings call transcript and (based on what seems like shared sentiment in the market), I was curious how Fabric was represented. From my armchair analyst position, its adoption just doesn’t seem to line up with what I assumed would exist by now...On the recent FY26 Q2 call, Satya said:>Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric's annual revenue run rate is now over $2 billion with over 31,000 customers... revenue up 60% year over year.The first thing that made me skeptical is the type of metrics used for Fabric. “Annual revenue run rate” is NOT the same as “we actually generated $2B over the last 12 months.” This is super normal when startups report earnings, since if a product is growing, run rate can look great even when realized trailing revenue is still catching up. Microsoft chose run rate wording here.Then I looked at the previous earnings where Fabric was discussed. In FY25 Q3, they said Fabric had 21k paid customers and “40% using Real-Time Intelligence” five months after GA, but “using” isn’t defined in a way that’s tangible, which usually is telling. In last week’s earnings, Satya immediately discusses specific metrics, customer references, etc. for other products.A huge part of why I’m also not convinced on adoption is because of the forced Power BI capacity migration. I know the world is all about financial engineering, and since Microsoft forced us all to migrate off of P-SKUs, it’s not hard to advertise those numbers as great. The conspiracist in me says the numbers line up a little too neatly with the SKU migration:* $2B in revenue run rate / 31,000 customers ≈ $64.5k per customer per year. * That’s conveniently right around the published price of an F64 reservationObviously an average is oversimplifying it, and I don’t think Microsoft is lying about the metrics whatsoever, but I do think the phrasing doesn’t line up with the marketing and what my account team says…The other thing I saw was how Microsoft talks when they have deeper adoption. They normally use harder metrics like customers >$1M, big deployments, customer references, etc. In the same FY26 Q2 transcript, Fabric gets the run-rate/customer count and then the conversation moves on. And that’s it. After that, I was surprised that Fabric was never mentioned on its own again, nor expanded upon, and outside of that sentence, Fabric was always mentioned with Foundry.Earnings reports aren't everything, and 31,000 customers is a lot, so I went looking for proof in customer stories, and the majority of the stories are just implementation partners and consultancies whose practices depend on selling Fabric (Boutiques/Avanade types), not a flood of end-customer production migrations with scale numbers. (There are are a couple of enterprise stories like LSEG and Microsoft’s internal team, but it doesn’t feel like “no shortage.”)Please check me. Am I off base here? Or is the growth just because of the forced migration from Power BI?",

        "title": "Are Python UDFs in Spark still less efficient than UDFs written in Scala or Java?",
        "author": "Lastrevio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm reading \"Spark: The Definitive\" guide and there's a part about how user defined functions in Python can be inefficient. This is the quote: \"When you use the function, there are essentially two different things that occur. If the function is written in Scala or Java, you can use it within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that there will be little performance penalty aside from the fact that you can’t take advantage of code generation capabilities that Spark has for builtin functions. There can be performance issues if you create or use a lot of objects; we cover that in the section on optimization in Chapter 19. If the function is written in Python, something quite different happens. Spark starts a Python process on the worker, serializes all of the data to a format that Python can understand (remember, it was in the JVM earlier), executes the function row by row on that data in the Python process, and then finally returns the results of the row operations to the JVM and Spark.Starting this Python process is expensive, but the real cost is in serializing the data to Python. This is costly for two reasons: it is an expensive computation, but also, after the data enters Python, Spark cannot manage the memory of the worker. This means that you could potentially cause a worker to fail if it becomes resource constrained (because both the JVM and Python are competing for memory on the same machine). We recommend that you write your UDFs in Scala or Java—the small amount of time it should take you to write the function in Scala will always yield significant speed ups, and on top of that, you can still use the function from Python!\" I heard from Reddit that this book was written a long time ago and some things may be outdated. Is this still relevant with the latest versions of Spark? Are Python UDFs still significantly slower than Scala/Java UDFs in Spark? If yes, have you ever encountered a situation at work where someone actually wrote a UDF in Scala or Java and avoided using Python for the sake of performance increases?",

        "author": "Ulfrauga",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "As title. **When** ***shouldn't*** **we go through the efforts of building a dimensional model?** To me, it's a bit of a grey area. But how do I pick out the black and white? When I'm giving feedback, questioning and making suggestions about the aspects of the design as developed - and it's not a dim model - I'll tend to default to \"should be a dim model\". I'm concerned that's a rigid and incorrect stance. I'm vaguely aware that a dim model is not always the way to go, but *when is that?*Background: I have 7 years in DE, 3 years before that in SW. I've learned a bunch, but often fall back on what are considered best practices if I lack the depth or breadth of experience. When, and when *not* to use a dim model is one of these areas.Most our use cases are A) Reports in Power BI. Occasionally, B) Returning specific, flat information. For B, it could *still* come from a dim model. This leads me to think that a dim model is a go-to, with doing otherwise is the exception.Problem of the day: There's a repeating theme at work. Models put together by a colleague are never strict dims/facts. It's *relational*, so there is a logical star, but it's not as clear-cut as a few facts and their dimensions. Measures and attributes remain mixed. They'll often say that the data and/or model is small: there is a handful of tables; less than hundreds of millions of rows.I get the balance between *ship now* and *do it properly, methodically, follow a pattern*. But, whether there are 5 tables or 50, I am stuck on the thought that your 5-table data source *still* has some business process to be considered. There are *still* measures and attributes to break out.EDIT: Some rephrasing. I was coming across as \"back up my opinion\". I'm actually looking for the opposite.",

Which downstream dashboards break Table-level lineage says \"everything connected to this table\" (useless, 200 false positives). Column-level says \"these 3 specific dashboard fields\", which is actually helpful.**What didn't work****My first attempt: Regex parsing SQL**Wrote a bunch of regex to pull column names from SELECT statements. Worked for simple queries. Completely fell apart with CTEs, subqueries, and window functions.Example that broke it: WITH customers AS (   SELECT      c.id as customer_key,     c.email as contact_email   FROM raw.customers c ) SELECT customer_key, contact_email FROM customersMy regex couldn't track that customer\\_key came from c.id. I gave up after 2 weeks.**My 2nd attempt: Query INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA only**Thought we could just use Snowflake's metadata tables to see column relationships. **Nope**. INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA tells you schemas exist, not how data flows through queries.I found success by parsing SQL properly with an actual parser, not regex. I used sqlparse for Python but JSQLParser works if you live in Java world.Query Snowflake's QUERY\\_HISTORY view, parse every SELECT/INSERT/CREATE TABLE AS statement, build a graph of column → column relationships.**The architecture** Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY    ↓ Extract SQL (last 7 days of queries)   ↓ SQL Parser (sqlparse)   ↓ Column Mapper (track renames/transforms)   ↓ Graph DB (Neo4j) + Search (Elasticsearch) import sqlparse from snowflake.connector import connect # Pull recent queries queries = snowflake.execute(\"\"\"   SELECT query_text    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY    WHERE query_type IN ('SELECT', 'INSERT', 'CREATE_TABLE_AS_SELECT')   AND start_time > DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) \"\"\") for query_text in queries:     parsed = sqlparse.parse(query_text)[0]          # Extract SELECT columns     select_cols = extract_columns(parsed)          # Extract FROM tables and resolve schemas     source_tables = extract_tables(parsed)          # Handle SELECT * by querying schema     if has_star_select(select_cols):         select_cols = resolve_star_expressions(source_tables)          # Build edges: source_col -> output_col     for output_col in select_cols:         for input_col in output_col.dependencies:             graph.add_edge(                 from_col=f\"{input_col.table}.{input_col.name}\",                 to_col=f\"{output_col.table}.{output_col.name}\",                 transform_type=output_col.transform             )**Some issues I ran into****1. SELECT \\* resolution**When you see SELECT \\* FROM customers JOIN orders, you need to know what columns exist in both tables at query execution time. Can't parse this statically.The solution is to Query INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA.COLUMNS to get table schemas, then expand \\* to the actual column list.**2. Column aliasing chains** SELECT    customer_id as c_id,   c_id as cust_id,  -- references the alias above   cust_id as final_idYou have to track the alias chain through the entire query. The symbol table gets really messy really fast.**3. Subqueries and CTEs**Each level of nesting creates a new namespace. The parser needs to track which customer\\_id is which when you have 3 nested CTEs all selecting customer\\_id.**4. Window functions and aggregates**SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY customer\\_id) means the output column depends on revenue (for the calculation) and customer\\_id (for the partition), but differently.Your lineage graph needs different edge types: \"aggregates,\" \"partitions\\_by,\" \"direct\\_reference.\"**Performance at 50K tables**Parsing 7 days of query history (about 500K queries): 2 hours Storage: Neo4j graph (200M edges), Elasticsearch (column name search) Query time: \"Show me everything downstream of this column\" = sub-2 seconds Query time: \"Where is customer\\_id used?\" = sub-1 secondTo save yourself a future headache, save the 20% of lineage paths that get queried 80% of the time.**What I’m still struggle with**Cross-warehouse lineage. My data flows Snowflake → Databricks → back to Snowflake. This approach only sees the Snowflake side.Real-time updates. I run lineage extraction every 6 hours. If someone on my team changes a column and immediately asks \"what breaks?\", they get stale data.ML pipelines. Notebooks that do df.select(\"customer\\_id\") don't show up in Snowflake query logs. That’s a blind spot.What's your current table count? Curious where others hit the breaking point. Sorry for the wall of text!",

Especially because points are team relative, work varies in complexity, and of course there are always interruptions/support work that can get unevenly distributed.I've also suggested tracking cycle time trends per individual (but NOT comparisons...), and defining role specific KPIs, since not every single engineer does the same type of work.Unfortunately leadership wants something more uniform and explicitly individual.So I'm curious to know from DE or even leaders that browse this subreddit:* if your org tracks individual performance KPIs for data engineers and data scientists, what does that actually look like? * what worked well? what backfired?Any real world examples would be appreciated.",

In this case, you just have to add a description to the column. But what about filterng business logic ? Example: # models/gold_top_sales.sql 1 SELECT product_id, monthly_sales 2 FROM ref('bronze_monthly_sales') 3 WHERE country IN ('US', 'GB') AND category LIKE \"tech\"Where do you document this filter condition (line 3)?For now I'm doing this in the YAML docs: version: 2 models: - name: gold_top_sales description: | Monthly sales on our top countries and the top product catergory defined by business stakeholdes every 3 years. Filter: Include records where country is in the list of defined countries and category match the top product category selected. Do you have more precise or better advices?",

        "author": "seagullbreadloaf",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I'm currently working in a data science role but was thinking about making the switch to data engineering. I have a background in statistics and have been working as a data scientist in biomedical research in academia for 1.5 years. This is my first job since finishing my Masters in statistics. When I first started the job, I was responsible for cleaning datasets from clinical trials (this was 90% of the work), statistical modeling, creating visual aids like graphs and charts, and presenting and explaining my work to biologists. After 6 months, my manager told me I \"wasn't a good fit\" for the role because I \"lack curiosity\". I wouldn't say he was wrong. I didn't mind the work but it also didn't excite me and I didn't find it that fulfilling.I was transferred to a different team within the same company and my main project became writing programming scripts to automate compression of thousands of files from patient databases, and creating lookup tables containing information on all the files (such as patient identifiers, visit dates, etc.) This involved a lot of identifying and sometimes renaming files that were mislabeled, had missing information, or used different naming conventions, and make sure these edge cases were accounted for in the compression process. We also received multiple batches of files from different sources, and I had to modify the scripts to account for all the nuances between different sources. I noticed I enjoyed these projects much more and that I'm very precise and good at paying close attention to small details. I liked how expectations were more well-defined with this project and was more like \"it either works or it doesn't\", rather than the previous data science role which was much more open-ended. I feel like I do better when expectations are more structured and consistent, rather than exploratory. My new manager also noticed the new role was a much better fit for me.That being said, I'm thinking about pivoting into data engineering for my next role because I feel it may be a better fit for me. I've been looking at job postings for data engineering roles, but I don't have many of the skills required for a lot of these roles. My work so far has mainly been in R since that's what my company uses, and I've had some exposure to SQL and Python. I know Python and SQL are important in data engineering and tech is all about transferable skills, but I feel like I don't yet have the toolbox to switch to data engineering, nor do I have strong software engineering skills. I'm also not sure if I will be a strong candidate considering how competitive the job market is nowadays. My plan for now is to learn the important skills so that I'm able to make the switch.Those of you who switched from data science to data engineering, what was your experience like and how did you navigate that shift? What are the most important data engineering skills/tools I should familiarize myself with to become a competitive candidate and be ready for interviews? What are some good resources you would suggest for learning these skills/tools? And do you have any general advice for me?",

Also for our specific use case, ML inference is based on client timezones, so inference usually runs between 06:00 and 09:00 local time, but each energy market has regulatory windows that change when they need data by and it is best for us to run the inference closest to the deadline so that the lag is minimized.Interested in hearing about other data engineers' battle wounds when working with incremental/schedule/timezone conflicts.",

        "author": "Spooked_DE",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,I have inherited a pipeline where some of the inputs are reference data that are uploaded by analysts via CSV files.The current ingestion design for these is quite inflexible. The reference data is tied to a year dimension, but the way things have been set up is that the analyst needs to include the year which the data is for in the filename. So, you need one CSV for every year that there is data for.e.g. we have two CSV files, the first is *some\\_data\\_2024.csv* which would have contents:|id|foo||:-|:-||1|423||2|1|the second is *some\\_data\\_2021.csv* which would have contents:|id|foo||:-|:-||1|13||2|10|These would then appear in the final silver table as 4 rows:|year|id|foo||:-|:-|:-||2024|1|423||2024|2|1||2021|1|13||2021|2|10|Which means that to upload many years' worth of data, you have to create and upload many CSV files all named after the year they belong to. I find this approach pretty convoluted. There is also no way to delete a bad record unless you replace it. (It can't be removed entirely).Now the pattern I want to go to is just allow the analysts to upload a singular CSV file with a year column. Whatever is in there will be what is in the final downstream table. In other words, the third table above will be what they upload. If they want to remove a record just reupload that singular CSV without that record. I figure this is much simpler. I will have a staging table that captures the entire upload history and then the final silver table just selecting all records from the latest upload.What do we think? Please let me know if I should add more details.",

        "content": "Hello. I’d like to start by saying that this is my first time asking a question in this kind of format. If there are any mistakes, I apologize in advance. I should also mention that I have very little experience in the Data Engineering field, and I haven’t worked in an organization that has a standard or mature Data Engineering team. My knowledge mostly comes from what I studied, and for some topics it’s only at a surface level, with little real hands-on experience.I currently work in an organization that does not have sufficient resources to recruit highly skilled Data Engineering personnel, and most of the work is driven by the data analytics team. The current systems were mostly built to solve immediate, short-term problems. Because of this, I have several questions and would like to seek advice from experienced members of this community.My questions are divided into several parts, as follows:* What kind of Data Tech Stack would be most appropriate (Open Source, Cloud Services, or Hybrid)?* For a Data Orchestrator, is a code-based approach (such as Dagster or Airflow) or a GUI-based approach (such as SSIS) better in the long run, especially if the Data Engineering team needs to scale?* What roles should exist within a Data Engineering team (e.g., Lead, Infrastructure, Operational Service), or is it actually unnecessary to divide the team into sub-roles?* How should we choose Data Storage to suit each layer? Is it necessary to use newer technologies (such as Data Warehouse or Data Lakehouse), or should we choose based on the expertise of the organization’s IT department, which is likely more familiar with OLTP databases?* For a Data Dictionary, should it be embedded directly into table names for convenience, documented separately, or handled through a dedicated platform (such as DataHub)?* To comply with PDPA / security audits, should data be masked or encrypted before it reaches the data storage that the Data Engineering team has access to? And which department in the organization is typically responsible for this?* As someone who can be considered a new Data Engineer, could you please recommend skills that I should learn or further develop?Lastly, if there are any parts of my questions where I used incorrect terminology or misunderstood certain concepts, please feel free to point them out and explain. I’m still not fully confident in my understanding of this field.Thank you in advance to everyone who takes the time to share their opinions and advice. PS. English is not my native language.",

I acknowledge that not being able to finish in time could mean that I am may not be qualified for the role but I also think that once on the job, the timed aspect is not as severe due to other factors like being more comfortable with the schemas, and business sense.I know the job market is tough, but this is not what I'm asking about. How can I be more efficient in these screens? I've tried LeetCode and other things but the structure of the questions don't tend to match or are not as useful.Or do I need a reality check with not being as qualified as I think I am?Edit: removed repetition",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone! Long-time listener, first-time caller. I have an opportunity to offer some design options to a firm for ingesting data from an IoT device network. The devices (which are owned by the firm's customers) produce a relatively modest number of records: Let's say a few hundred devices producing a few thousand records each every day. The firm wants 1) the raw data accessible to their customers, 2) an analytics layer, and 3) a dashboard where customers can view some basic analytics about their devices and the records. The data does not need to be real-time, probably we could get away with refreshing it once a day.My first thought (partly because I'm familiar with it) is to ingest the records into a BigQuery table as a data lake. From there, I can run some basic joins and whatnot to verify, sort, and present the data for analysis, or even do more intensive modeling or whatever they decide they need later. Then, I can connect the BigQuery analytics tables to Looker Studio for a basic dashboard that can be shared easily. Customers can also query/download their data directly.That's the basics. But I'm also thinking I might need some kind of queue in front of BigQuery (Pub/Sub?) to ensure nothing gets dropped. Does that make sense, or do I not have to worry about it with BigQuery? Lastly, just kind of conceptually, I'm wondering how IoT typically works with POSTing data to cloud storage. Do you create a GCP service account for each device? Is there an API key on each physical device that it uses to make the requests? What's best practice? Anything really, really stupid that people often do here that I should be sure to avoid?Thanks for your help and anything you want to comment on, I'm sure I'm still missing a lot. This is a fun project, I'm really hoping I can cover all my bases!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So we had Spark, Trino, Flink, Presto, and Hive all hitting different catalogs and it was a complete shitshow. Schema changes needed updates in 5 different places. Credential rotation was a nightmare. Onboarding new devs took forever because they had to learn each engine's catalog quirks.Tried a few options. Unity Catalog would lock us into Databricks. Building our own would take 6+ months. Ended up going with Apache Gravitino since it just became an Apache TLP and the architecture made sense - basically all the engines talk to Gravitino which federates everything underneath.Migration took about 6 weeks. Started with Spark since that was safest, then rolled out to the others. Pretty smooth honestly.The results have been kind of crazy. New datasets now take 30 mins to add instead of 4~6 hours. Schema changes went from 2~3 hours down to 15 mins. Catalog config incidents dropped from 3~4 per month to maybe 1 per quarter. Dev onboarding for the catalog stuff went from a week to 1~2 days.Unexpected win: Gravitino treats Kafka topics as metadata objects so our Flink jobs can discover schemas through the same API they use for tables. That was huge for our streaming pipelines. Also made our multi-cloud setup way easier since we have data in both AWS and GCP.Not gonna sugarcoat the downsides though. You gotta self-host another service (or pay for managed). The UI is pretty basic so we mostly use the API. Community is smaller than Databricks/Snowflake. Lineage tracking isn't as good as commercial tools yet.But if you're running multiple engines and catalog sprawl is killing you, it's worth looking at. We went from spending hours on catalog config to basically forgetting it exists. If you're all-in on one vendor it's probably overkill.Anyone else dealing with this? How are you managing catalogs across multiple engines?---**Disclosure:** I work with Datastrato (commercial support for Gravitino).

This one, however, just won’t load the 1 million row table. Given our capacity, this should be an easy task.Has anyone encountered a similar scenario?What do you think could be the issue here?

Many of these responsibilities can be handled in dbt through tests and macros, and I’ve already implemented those pieces.What I’d like to enable is a way for every new dbt project to automatically include these generic tests and macros—essentially a shared baseline that should apply to all dbt projects. The approach I’ve found in Snowflake’s documentation involves storing these templates in a GitHub repository and referencing that repo in dbt deps so new projects can pull them in as dependencies.That said, we’ve run into an issue where the GitHub integration appears to require a username to be associated with the repository URL. It’s not yet clear whether we can supply a personal access token instead, which is something we’re currently investigating.Given that limitation, I’m wondering if there’s a better or more standard way to achieve this pattern—centrally managed, reusable dbt tests and macros that can be easily consumed by all new dbt projects.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi! I've been to several data warehousing projects lately, built with the \"medallion\" architecture and there are a few things which make me quite disturbed.First - on all of these projects we were pushed by the \"data architect\" to use the Silver layer as a copy of the Bronze, only with SCD 2 logic on each table, leaving the original normalised table structure. No joining of tables, or other preparation of data allowed (the messy data preparation tables go to the Gold next to the star schema).Second - it was decided, that all the tables and their columns are renamed to english (from Polish), which means that now we have three databases (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different names for the same columns and tables. Now when I get a SQL script with business logic from the analyst, I need to transcribe all the table and column names to the english (Silver layer) and then implement the transformation towards Gold. Whenever there is a discussion about the data logic, or I need to go back to the analyst with a question, I need to transpose all the english table&column names back to the Polish (Bronze) again. It's time consuming. Then Gold has still different column names, as the star schema is adjusted to the reporting needs of the users.Are you also experiencing this, is this some kind of a new trend? Would't it be so much easier to leave it with the original Polish names in the Silver, since there is no change to the data anyway and the lineage would be so much cleaner?I understand the architects don't care what it takes to work with this as it's not their pain, but I don't understand that no one cares about the cost of this.. : DAlso I can see that people tend to think about the system as something developed once, not touching it afterwards. That goes completely against my experience. If the system is alive, then changes are required all the time, as the business evolves, which means the costs are heavily projecting to the future..What are your views on this?

That I could just coast here until I get old. I'd miss better jobs, better money, better life.SoThe most \"smooth\" transition path for me would to break into data engineering. It seems logical, probable and interesting to me. Sometimes I read what other people do as DE and I simply get jealous. It just seems way more important, more technology based, better learning experience, better salaries, and just more serious job so to speak.Hence my question..**With this new AI era is it too late to get into data engineering at this point?*** I read everywhere how hard it is to break through and change jobs now* Tech is moving forward* AI can write code in seconds that it would take me some time to learn* Juniors DE seem to be obsolete cause mids can do their job as well Seniors DE are even more efficient now**If anyone changed positions recently from BA/DA to DE I'd be thankful if you shared your experience.**Thanks",

I got through the recruiter call and the Hackerranks which were super easy (just some Python & SQL intermediates and an advanced problem solving). Now, I'm onto the live coding round, but I feel so worried and scared that I know nothing. Don't get me wrong, my Python & SQL fundamentals are pretty solid; however, the theory really scares me. Everything I know is through practical experience through my personal projects and although I got good grades, I never really learned the material or let it soak in because I never used it (the normalization, partitions, etc.) because my projects never practically needed it. Now, I\"m on the live coding round (Python + SQL) and I don't know anything about what's going to be tested since this will be my first live coding round ever (all my internships prior, I've never had to do one of these). I've been preparing like a crazy person every day, but I don't even know if I'm preparing correctly. All I'm doing is giving AI the job description and it's asking me questions which I then solve by timing myself (which to be fair, I've solved all of them only looking something up once). I'm also using SQLZoo, LC SQL questions (which I seem to be able to solve mediums fine), and I think I've completed all of Hackerranks SQL by now lol... My basic data structure (e.g., lists, hashmaps, etc.) knowledge is solid and so are the main stdlib of python (e.g., collections, json, csv, etc.). The worst part is, the main technology they use (Snowflake/Snowpark), I've never even touched with a 10ft pole. The recruiter mentioned that all they're looking for is a core focus on Python & SQL which I definitely have, but I mean this is a startup we're talking about, they don't have time to teach me everything. I'm a fast learner and am truly confident in being able to pick up anything quickly, I pride myself in being adaptable if nothing else, but it's not like they would care? Maybe I'm just scared shitless and just worried about nothing. Has anyone else felt like this? Like I really want this position to workout and land the job, because I think I'll really like it.

I'm working on contacting local businesses and offering free data analysis services in the hopes of getting some useful experience. I'm learning a lot of the DS tools myself and I have the Statistics knowledge to back me but there's no entry-level DS anymore. DE is the only one that appears to be difficult to self-learn and relies on learning on the job which is why I'm thinking a MS that helps me with that is better than a MS in DS (which are mostly new and cash-grabs).I could also further study Applied Statistics but that's a different discussion.

It will take a bit more effort to design, build, and test the ingestion into bronze with schema drift/evolution.Although implementing schema-evolution isn't a big deal, a more controlled approach to new columns still provides a viable trade off.I'm looking at some different options to mitigate it.We'll enforce schema (for the standard included fields) and ignore any new fields. The source database is a production RDBMs, so ingesting RDMBS change tracking rows into bronze (append only) is going to really be valuable to the client. However, the client is aware that they won't be getting new columns automatically.We're approaching new columns like a change request. If they want them in the data platform, we need to include into bronze first, then update the model in silver and then gold.To approach it, we'd get the new field they want; include it into the ETL pipeline. We'd also have to execute a one-off pipeline that would write all records for the table into bronze where there was a non-null value for that new field as a 'change' record first.Then we turn on the ETL pipeline, and life continues on as normal and bronze is up to date with the new column.Thoughts? Would you approach it differently?",

        "author": "Beneficial-Flow-2105",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I built BigAsk, a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language. It’s a fairly thin wrapper over the Gemini CLI meant to address some shortcomings it has in overcoming data querying challenges organizations face.I’m a Software Engineer in infra/DevOps, but I have a few friends who work in roles where much of their time is spent fulfilling requests to fetch data from internal databases. I’ve heard it described as a “necessary evil” of their job which isn’t very fulfilling to perform. Recently, Google has released some quite capable tools with the potential to enable those without technical experience using BigQuery to explore the data themselves, both for questions intended to return exact query results, and higher-level questions about more nebulous insights that can be gleaned from data. While these certainly wouldn’t completely eliminate the need for human experts to write some queries or validate results of important ones, it seems to me like they could significantly empower many to save time and get faster answers.Unfortunately, there are some pretty big limitations to the current offerings from Google that prevent them from actually enabling this empowerment, and this project seeks to fix them.One is that the best tools are available in a limited set of interfaces. Those scattered throughout the already-lacking-in-user-friendliness BigQuery UI require some foundational BigQuery and data analysis skills to use, making their barrier to entry too high for many who could benefit from them. The most advanced features are only available in the Gemini CLI, but as a CLI, using it requires using a command-line, again putting it out-of-reach for many.The second is a lack of safe access control. There's a reason BigQuery access is typically limited to a small group. Directly authorizing access to this data via the BigQuery UI or Gemini CLI to individual users who aren't well-versed in its stewardship carries large risks of data deletion or leaks. As someone with experience working professionally with managing cloud IAM within an organization, I know that attempts to distribute permissions to individual users while maintaining a limited scope on them also requires considerable maintenance overhead and comes with it’s own set of security risks.BigAsk enables anyone within an organization to easily and securely use the most powerful agentic data analysis tools available from Google to self-serve answers to their burning questions. It addresses the problems outlined above with a user-friendly web interface, centralized access management with a recommended permissions set, and simple, lightweight code and deployment instructions that can easily be extended or customized to deploy into the constraints of an existing Google Cloud project architecture.Code here: [https://github.com/stevenwinnick/big-ask](https://github.com/stevenwinnick/big-ask)I’d love any feedback on the project, especially from anyone who works or has worked somewhere where this could be useful. This is also my first time sharing a project to online forums, and I’d value feedback on any ways I could better share my work as well.",

Its really a one way integration between two OLTP systems where webhook from System A writes to apigw which routes to a lambda which writes to dynamo where another lambda on a schedule reads from dynamo and writes unprocessed records to System B. There's also another flow where we have a lamdba check System B to see if users have a token and if if they don't, the lambda writes them to SQS where we have another lambda batch from SQS, grab a token from System A and write them back to users in System B.Its my first real pipeline as a \"Data Engineer\" but it feels like integration engineering not DE. It gets slightly more DE related where we are landing that same webhook data into S3 and materializing it in Redshift for downstream analysis. But im not involved in the code for this part, just the SQL querying for our group's own reporting on the data. Not sure where to go for next job, I am lacking the DBT and airflow skills most DE roles require and I have these cloud skills and some IaC stuff as well to sprinkle on top of my SQL and python skills. I have been a DE title for a year now (was Senior Data Analyst at same company and did some DA/DS for a few years before that) at diff companies) and I want to change roles and make more money for my family. Not sure what jobs to shoot for or how to market myself... Event Driven DE? Not sure. Also, I'm new to reddit so forgive me if there's a better board for this. One more thing is I have been reading books like DDIA so my systems thinking is getting good but my coding skills are rotting because I'm really just trouble shooting the logs and only enriching the code maybe once a month. This post is all over the place but I just need some general guidance.",

        "content": "So my boss recently told me that try-catch statements are \"garbage\" and that I should avoid using them when developing. This wasn't specific to any particular language - they seemed to mean it as a general programming principle. I'm pretty confused because I thought error handling with try-catch was fundamental to most modern programming languages. I know it can be misused (like catching exceptions and doing nothing, or using exceptions for control flow), but completely avoiding it seems extreme. Is there some programming philosophy or best practice I'm missing here? Are there alternatives to try-catch that are considered better? Or is my boss maybe referring to specific anti-patterns that I should be aware of? Has anyone else encountered this \"no try-catch\" philosophy? What are the actual best practices around exception handling across different languages? Any insight would be really helpful - I want to understand if there's something legitimate here or if I should push back on this guidance. ‐-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When people say vague things like \"That's not good programming,\" I always ask, \"Why?\"Why is it garbage? Why is it bad design? Why isn't it good programming?When I asked that, they said, \"You should at least make a program that doesn't produce errors,\" and then laughed at me.Anyway, thanks for all the responses.

I think it can be useful in the right contexts and when used well.But if you learn OOP as a course in college, you'd know that professors seem to think that it's God's perfect gift to programmers. My biggest problem is that colleges overemphasize inheritance as a feature.Inheritance can be useful, but when used improperly, it becomes ridiculously difficult and annoying to work with. In software engineering, there is a concept called \"orthogonality\", and it's the idea that different parts of your code should be independent and decoupled. It's common sense, really. If you change one part of your code, it shouldn't fuck up other parts. It makes testing, debugging, and reasoning about your program easier.Inheritance completely shits on that.When you have an inheritance tower two billion subclasses deep, it's almost guaranteed that there will be some unpredictable behavior in your code. OOP can have some very subtle and easy to overlook rules in how inheritance and polymorphism work, so it's very easy to create subtle bugs that are hard to reason about.So yeah. By all means, learn OOP, but please do it well. Don't learn it the way professors have you learn it, focus on composing classes rather than inheritance.",

It is much faster but I do not wrestle with ideas long enough for them to sink in.It's like having the solution manual for every puzzle before I've even touched the puzzle. Yes, I know the answer, but I didn't learn it.And, I can feel my patience shrinking overtime. If something doesn't click in 30 seconds, my brain goes \"eh, AI will explain it better anyways\". I cannot sit with difficulty anymore. I'm not anti-AI but I miss the struggle. I miss feeling proud of understanding something because I worked for it.

Like somewhere I'd absorbed this idea that real programmers write clean elegant code on the first try, and if I couldn't do that, I wasn't ready to build yet.So I'd go do another tutorial. Where the code was already clean. Where I could follow along and feel competent without risking being bad at something.The thing that broke it was just... accepting I was going to write garbage. Not as a temporary state until I got good. As the permanent reality of programming. Everyone writes garbage first and then improves it.My first real project was mass truly mass mass terrible. Nested if statements everywhere, variables named \"thing2\", logic that made no sense. But it worked. And finishing something that worked, even badly, taught me more than all the tutorials combined.I swear I post even the ugly code on WIP Social now, and seeing other people also posting imperfect work made me realize everyone's first drafts are bad.

If you're allowing AI to dictate whether you should learn how to build applications due to the fear of not being able to find a job. Then your passion is probably not there for programming, and better off looking for something else.If you're genuinely curious and want to develop something meaningful. Then I have no doubt you will do well. But you need to trust the process and ignore the noise from people that don't even program themselves and just post AI fear online because their too lazy and lack ambition to do anything so they rather tell others to give up on themselves too. ​​​​Ignore them.

I was looking at programming from a flowchart perspective- I.E questioning how in the hell people keep track of all these branching paths stretching out into infinity- but a quick convo with chatgpt cleared that up IMMEDIATELY. There is no flowchart with infinite branching paths, and there never was. It was ALWAYS a straight road with occasional detours that lead back to the main path! Before it was like, \"What the fuck is going on?\" and now it's like, \"I can hear colors! See sounds!\" :DYou have no idea how happy I am right now. \\^\\_\\^ Just needed to celebrate that.",

Specifically a lot of questions came up about memory, how computers store and retrieve information, and how that connects to AI systems and such but from a computing perspective.I was already working on something like that but figured I would finish it up early !This one starts with Mad Libs. Not as a gimmick but because the pattern behind that word game, templates with typed blanks filled according to rules, turns out to be structurally how computing works at every level (with a grain of salt). Abstract Syntax Trees are this. Compilers are this. And the way AI systems assemble prompts from system instructions, memory files, and your actual message is this too.Same disclaimers as last time. The computing fundamentals are standard. The framing around AI and where it fits in this history is my own take and I completely understand if people push back on it.

And I'm absolutely obsessed with programming!For the last 2.5 years I've explored many fields of CS and I've absolutely fallen in love with ALL of them:• Frontend design with Flutter.• Game development with the Godot game engine.• Backend development with Django.• low level system design with C and Rust.• programming language and compiler design with Haskell. Every 6 weeks or so I bounce between my interests and create a project in one of them, and honestly it's been great so far. My peers criticize me and tell me to just choose 1 thing and get good at it. But I didn't listen. I was having too much fun and making steady progress in all my interests.But last week when I wanted to create a bigger game I realized something... I'm missing so many fundamentals of game development despite me learning it for the last 2.5 years !I still didn't know any 3D modeling. Didn't understand Shaders. Barley knew anything about 3D dev in general. Didn't know how to create 2D assets.And this was a pretty bad feeling. I wanted to create something big after 2.5 years of learning; But couldn't do much because I didn't have enough experience.And yeah I realized this pretty much applies to all my interests:• The most advanced flutter app I made is a Basic calculator.• Every game I've made is a 2d arcade game with stock assets.• I haven't even learned Authentication with Django yet.• I don't know how to program in any system language. Just watching random videos about C and C++• I've only created 2 new Programming languages and they're both toy languages with limited use cases.• I'm still not experienced enough with Haskell to create anything I can think of.Honestly I'm having a crisis right now. I feel like I should just focus on backend to get hired and game-dev as my main non-work hobby. But I also love the other stuff so much and don't wanna abandon them !I love all of them so much and I wish I can do everything at the same time. But at some point I need to get hired in one of them.",

Do you have previous knowledge of it all and know how stuff works? Do professional coders also just check up stackoverflow and similar sites to get similar codes to what they want? Am i too knew to this that the best way for me to learn currently would be typing other peoples codes and figuring out how stuff works and why it works?Is there a way i can learn all the kinks in coding so that i can write a code from scratch without needing to check forums and other peoples codes, or is that something that comes with years of work and practice?",

The issue is that she has **no prior Computer Science background** at all, yet she’s now doing A-Level.She also never asks questions. I’ve noticed she zones out quite a lot, but when I gently address it, she denies it. I try to engage her with prompts, guided questions, and encouragement, but I don’t get much back.At this point I’m wondering:* Is this a confidence issue, a foundational gap, or just passive learning?* Am I expecting too much too quickly?* Would it help to switch to **Python first**, build problem-solving skills and logic, then come back to C#?* Or should I slow C# down even more and focus purely on micro-tasks and repetition?I genuinely want to help her succeed, but I’m feeling stuck and unsure if my approach is right.

Even before ai era, I always feel the stupiest in the room. Like everyone else got it but me, yet I managed to survive more than 3 years in this job market.Now im in this new company for three months now, they are the kind of small companies that wanna ship fast no matter what. So you have no time to make architectural decisions or planning. The type of company where requirements are discussed in each daily and can change trillion of times then they question your skills when deadlines are missed. I cant leave though because I need the money and the market is just scary to be jobless. How can I improve in this environment. I started to use ai heavily to the point where I wait for claude code limits to reset so I can keep working. Even though I used to work without ai at all. I will changz companies if I find a better alternative but a better company will ask for a good developer who knows architecture and software design. Not a coder who survives using ai tools. I still ship, and im not against using ai. But when I try to work without it I struggle with the basics even. Any advice is much appreciated",

From what I can tell, pretty much nobody here (who uses Python) is writing modular, testable code, it's mostly just scripts in notebooks.So my question is should I be using OOP for everything I build, even if I'm the only one touching the code? How do I know when something actually needs proper classes and structure vs just being a straightforward script?Like I get the theory behind clean code and all that, but when you're building a niche pipeline for one specific use case, does it really need to be over-engineered? Or am I just making excuses for laziness?Would appreciate any perspective from folks who've navigated this kind of environment.",

I don't have much experience in coding. I learnt a little bit of it in college. I know about basic libraries on python like matplotlib and such. I tried VS code while trying to pursue a personal project in order to learn some coding by myself.I got this idea when I made a graph that looked like a room on python. Basically, it had multiple coordinates. I thought what if I code a room like that and then add frames of things that depict how I see her soul. I want to complement them with little notes. She is an artist herself so I would love for the gallery to have her own pieces too. I want it to be a reflection of her and our memories and her soul.But I don't really know coding like that. Please help me. I am here because I don't want to use AI chatbots to write codes for me. I want this project to be extremely intentional. I need your help!My questions for now-1. What application should I use to code this?2. What are your opinions on the feasibility of this project? Do you think I can do it considering my experience with coding? (I think I can but please be honest)3. Can you direct me towards the libraries that I can use to make these possible. I will scoop the internet for codes and information based on the libraries. 4. Do you have any insights or ideas about what I can do more to make this a fun and nice little gesture for her.Thank you!",

My usual approach is to first try to solve the problem on my own and then - even if I succeed - watch a YouTube video with deeper explanation to gain better understanding of the problem. Recently, I worked on [LeetCode 778: Swim in Rising Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/). It was a bit different from the problems I had solved before - I hadn't worked on this kid of problems yet. Although I managed to solve it successfully using a min-heap strucutre and a graph traversal algorithm. But it was something new for me, I had never used them two together. If you're an advanced programmer, when you hear a min-heap and graph traversal, you probably know what it means - but I didn't. Only when I was watching an explanatation of the optimal solution on YouTube, I realized that I had actually implemented a Dijkstra's algorithm - an algorithm invented by one of the greatest figures in computer science history. So even though this algorithm was created many decades ago, I was very excited that my analytical and problem-solving thinking process naturally led me to the same solution as Dijkstra's solution many decades ago. I'm sure that wouldn't happen if I was solving LeetCode blindly, learning only patterns. I wish every programmer feel this kind of moment from time to time to stay motivated on the path of learning!",

That led me to rethink everything and start thinking more about working independently or as a freelancer.Currently, I'm studying programming, and I started with the basics: HTML, CSS, and some web design. In the long term, I'm also interested in learning backend development (Java or other languages). Lately, the world of automation has caught my attention, but I have many doubts because there's a lot of talk about it on YouTube, and it doesn't always feel realistic.I understand that many people recommend \"starting a local business\" or \"taking any job,\" but in my case, I don't have capital to invest, I live in a small city, and I'm not hired because of my age. Even so, I'm a persistent person who learns quickly and doesn't give up when something doesn't work out.My goal today isn't to \"make easy money,\" but to learn a real, in-demand skill that makes sense in the long run—ideally something I can do remotely and independently.I'd appreciate constructive feedback on:whether my thinking is flawedwhat skills you see as most valuable for a young person (programming, data, automation, something else)what you would avoid if you were starting overI know I'm not the only one who's tried something like this at my age, so I really value any realistic advice.

If two objects have the same hashCode, can I be 100% sure they are the same?2. If not, why do we even have hash codes? Why not just use `==` for everything?3.

I'm planning to apply to a CS college since I've always liked the domain and I always did well in both math and school programingBut right now I'm at a massive crossroad. Despite my effort and how much I've evolved, these past few weeks I've been incredibly stagnant. Even though I know how to solve a problem on paper, actually applying it in code overwhelms me and nothing seems to work. Although I don't think I abused AI too much, I now wonder if that's even the case anymore.My professor began to be very dissatisfied in me, and keeps pressuring me to do more, but even if I try it doesn't seem to work. I've never been truly able to focus on anything for a long time, and I've never really \"learned\" how to learn. I just picked up everything on the fly, and lately this has been biting me back. I feel like I don't actually know any math or programming and I'm starting to doubt if a CS degree is even for me. I haven't even tried to apply to the college and I'm already failing basic problems. I only have under a month before early admissions...",

I'm a recent CS graduate (also did a bootcamp 2 years ago) and while I completed all these things, I still don't feel like a programmer or someone who thinks like one. My older sister is a tech lead at X company and I've legit seen her break problems down one by one when presented with an issue, even problems that have nothing to do with tech lol, I still remember the first time I seen her do that and I've been wanting that ever since but I feel like a fraud. How did you guys get better at this? I've been more or less coding everyday since October trying to find a job and whenever I'm presented with a bug or an issue in my code I don't really approach it like actual programmers I just sit in my chair thinking, trying to beat my brain for a solution, sometimes it works, sometimes I end up just asking AI for help. (The other day I spent like two and a half hours trying to debug an \"edit inline\" feature for a finance app i was making and it was the most easiest solution ever that i could've solved on my own if i knew how to google/be resourceful Also, how did you guys get better at reading documentation? What is your process when you're learning new tech? I'm pretty bad at reading documentation I have to re-read certain MDN things like a million times for it to click. I think the overload of information on certain docs is what messes me up, but idk These are all things that I think are holding me back and I want to get better at so I can become a better programmer and not be too dependent on AI since no one knows where this is all going, because tbh AI can easily fill those gaps for me but then I'll never actually feel like a programmer or break problems down like the example I gave of my older sister.

Especially nowadays, when they ask for more experience in stuff like Docker, AWS, etc., etc.**I guess the question is:** Is it possible to get into SWE when you're just starting to learn to code in your first year of college? Especially when becoming a good developer takes time?",

Hence I’ve decided to continue working on my technical skill before matriculating.I’ve still yet to decide whether I should focus on practicing DSA (probably using Python since that’s the language used in the college I’ll be going) or learn new software (was planning to look at Angular and Spring framework). Another option was to look explore other forms of CS such as Machine Learning, Data Science. However, I’m leaning more towards the first 2 options due to it being more aligned with the hiring process…Any advice would be appreciated!Edit: Sorry I can’t post on r/csCareerQuestions since I’ve not enough karma :(",

I previously had a system where I basically separated a scenes class, containing what inanimate textures and sprites each scene needed, a map class, which cointains objects' positions, an animations class, with the bulk of sprite textures, and of course the main game class which runs in a loop. The other files were kinda interdependent, and in scenes I had key dictionaries that bound each texture to its position, so that Game would know where to draw it. Just now, I switched to a class-based version, where characters are just their own class, complete with position, animation, name, etc. So each one is a 'package' with more different types of data, but kinda usable as-is in the Game file.I did this because I got the impression the first way might become too fragmented, but actually I kinda liked the separate dictionary-version too. What do you think? Is the class-based one more standard, or is it better to separate by function like with my first version?Thanks!",

The only reason I found I was able to keep my head on targets was by using Claude to do stories while I was reviewing pr and meetings.should I look for a new job now?",

In my spare time, I’d play around with tech I thought was interesting. If I had some downtime at work, I’d play around with new thingsPerhaps it’s a lot of very demanding, unpleasant working environments… but now I see code and I feel borderline nauseous. In my own personal life, I don’t really get excited about tech or look forward to any of it. Great, new tech released, I’m not even gonna bother checking it out cause it’s either some sort of scam or will enshittify before I can really enjoy it. I’ll just stick with the 4 apps I use on my iPhone 13, and hope that they don’t deprecate my phone anytime soon cause I don’t want a new oneThe people I’ve worked with since about 2020 feel very different than before. It seems like everyone is more interested in business and finance than they are in tech and product. Many people working in tech seem like they don’t care about it. Tech companies have this very “Harvard MBA” feel to them that I can’t describe. Lots of ladder climbing, lots of clamoring for status and visibility. I’ve seen act in really unscrupulous ways to get ahead, despite the fact that it seems very toxicAlso, I’m level 1 autism. As time has gone on, I’ve noticed it’s been less and less tolerated. This doesn’t have to do with any changes in title, either, cause that’s stayed the same for years. Previously it seemed to be viewed as, at worst, a little quirky. Now at work people tell me that being able to read subtle social cues is more important than being able to do \\_any\\_ hard skill. I am still a senior engineerPart of me thinks I’m just getting old (I’m 35) and tired of this industry and maybe I’ve mentally checked out. The thing is, I’ve met at least a small handful of people who have expressed the same feelings to me: tech just isn’t \\_fun\\_ anymore. I also noticed that it even seems like people at these companies don’t even really believe in what they’re selling, really. Like I don’t get the feeling someone like Sam Altman \\_actually\\_ cares about OpenAI, it just feels like a griftLike when I think of growing up, I remember video games like world of Warcraft and newgrounds and MySpace. It felt like the attitude was more along the lines of “how do we get money so we can build what we want to build?” And not “what can we build that will make money?”Yes I know companies have to make money, but I suppose before it didn’t feel like they had to MAXIMIZE how much money they’d make at the expense of everything else they care aboutHas anyone else experienced this or have I just kinda started seeing the way it always was? Was I simply naive before?",

I said blatantly that it is good for boilerplate and understanding the repo and changes done, and great for tests, albeit still needs significant edits. For actual development work, it has proved lackluster.He was pushing that coding was dead and AI should be able to do all of it now, so we should all be much faster. He also mentioned software quality in the same discussion, advocating AI should make it easier. He then gave an example of someone he knew in a well known company who was very experienced, IC6 level, and he was bring told that he needs to use AI or go away. Whilst using AI has been useful, I do think the extent of it's usage is being stretched significantly by people who are even developers or were themselves. How does everyone find using AI for their companies so far? When i make a new side project and do simple client side work, it's great and I rarely need to read any code. But for my corporate job, it still hallucinated a lot even with very specific prompting. Am I doing it wrong and has this improved significantly to the level my manager was claiming, or is it still useful for learning and planning to some extent but not execution? Also, should I be looking for a new job",

I thought that I had made some sort of mistake or forgot to do something.Last night, HR messaged me and said that my manager has asked that I lower the ratings that I gave to all of my reports.I'm upset by this for many reasons and don't know how to respond.I work in the same office as my manager and feel like we have a decent relationship. Why is he going through HR instead of coming to me?I gave my reports ratings that I sincerely believe they deserve. My boss is completely non technical and has no idea what makes a good software engineering employee. He's not qualified to rate them. If my employees don't deserve the rating that I gave them, then what do they need to do in order to get the higher rating, since they're already doing those things? I don't know how to respond, because every way forward involves something that has the potential to hurt my career, my employment status, or my integrity.I could lie to my employees and make something up as to why they didn't deserve better. That's likely the best thing for my employment status and career, at least at this company. But it makes me absolutely sick.I could tell my employees that I rated them higher but that my boss, who they have daily contact with, didn't think they deserved it. That doesn't feel like a good idea.I could refuse to change the rating. That's also not going to go well for me.My decision as of right now is that I'm going to set up a . meeting with HR and tell them that I'm not going to change their ratings without some convincing justification.I feel like if my boss wants the ratings changed, then my reports should be moved under him, and he needs to own their ratings. I'm unhappy about it in any case, but I'm more comfortable if he owns what he's done and the software engineers know it was him. I left my last company for similar reasons, and I'm now considering switching again.Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed?Update: After reading the advice here, I've messaged HR to set up a meeting with them to try and understand:1. Why they want me to downgrade my ratings2. How do I tell my reports that calibration forced me to rate them lower even though they're doing everything they were supposed to be doing to get their ratings? (I did not rate both employees the same,)3. If my employees ask how to get the higher ratings, what do I tell them, since they were already doing what the HR document lists?",

Is that a valid concern?I'm also far enough into my career to have a comfortable amount of savings and not all the energy of a 22 year-old, so I'm not willing to take an insanely demanding job with crazy hours and stress. No money is worth that to me anymore.So, where do I go from here? I'd been keen to hear from others who have moved from \"normal\" jobs toward these high-TC jobs after 10+ years in the field.",

Fast forward a couple of days, and I get a rejection email. Even the HR recruiter seemed surprised. She mentioned the team is looking for someone who can \"fully unlock AI's potential\" or something along those lines.They also told me my technical rounds are valid for six months, so I can apply for other roles and jump straight to the Hiring Manager or VP rounds. Still, now what am I even supposed to say to that?",

We’ve had posts in company channels stating “Prompt-first is the only way” and that we need to start spending time in our personal time to get better with ai-development strategies or “the alternative would be to ignore this and fall behind in your career and at the company”.I know this probably isn’t uncommon anymore, but is this true that this is the future?

When I started, I was making 100k base, but I was promoted a year ago and now make 125k. I love that my job is remote, I like the work I do, and I get along well with my team. I am 26F and currently have 5 YoE and an engineering degree from an Ivy. In December, a recruiter from Capital One reached out to me. I guess at one point I had applied in the past and was rejected but my name was in their system and they wanted to consider me for a Senior Software Engineer (Principal Associate) role. I kinda thought eh, what the hell why not, but after a little brushing up on Leetcode I managed to pass the online assessment and the Power Day and am now at the team match phase. The recruiter called me yesterday to let me know that while I still passed, they ultimately are going to offer me a Software Engineer (Senior Associate) role, which is the level below what I interviewed for. I'm honestly shocked I even passed so this is still good news, and according to Levels.fyi I would be making \\~160k base in NYC which is significantly more than what I make now.Now that I've passed and I'm waiting to hear back about team match, I was looking on Blind and Reddit about working at Capital One and I worry that the culture is really cutthroat. Apparently every 6 months they PIP 15% of employees per team and it's common for new hires to get cut. This is really concerning to me. My entire career I've been more used to a startup environment where there is obviously a chance of layoffs (and have been through one) but they weren't cutting teams every 6 months. Going from having mostly startups on my resume to having somewhere with more name recognition like Capital One might be more beneficial for my career in the long run, plus the compensation is significantly more than what I make currently. However, I worry that I'll be out of a job in 6 months and with this current job market I don't think most people are in a place to take risks. I'm weighing the pros and cons and I'm not sure how to proceed once I hear back about team match and get an offer. Should I stay at my current job, or take the leap?",

        "content": "I am currently in my last year of a Computer Science degree at a T10 public university and will be graduating this June after finishing the degree in three years. I am also minoring in Statistics and Management and have applied for a Master's program as a backup.Academically, I have done well with a 3.7 GPA and I have never really struggled to understand CS concepts. With a few hours of focused studying, I can usually grasp everything and do well on exams. The issue has not been that the material is too hard. It is more about motivation and how I feel about the path I am on.After freshman year, where I honestly did not do much career wise, reality hit me in my second year. I felt like I had to catch up. I took on multiple research projects to make up for my lack of industry experience, built personal projects, constantly took 20 units a quarter along with some community college classes, and spent a lot of time grinding LeetCode. I really pushed myself because I thought that if I did everything right, the results would come.But even after all that effort, I did not see the outcomes I expected in terms of internships or job offers. That gap between effort and results has been mentally exhausting. Over time, the constant grind with no clear payoff has worn me down, and I have lost the excitement I used to have for CS.I have realized that I do not hate problem solving. I still like thinking through ideas and solutions. I especially enjoy working with numbers and seeing patterns, which is why my Statistics and Management minor has felt more interesting recently. What I do not enjoy is the actual process of coding. Sitting and building things line by line feels draining, even though thinking about the solution at a higher level feels engaging.Right now I am not excited about more studying, more interview prep, or more side projects. I want to work and get real experience instead of staying in this cycle of preparation. Applying for a Master's was partly strategic because I have not landed a job yet, not purely because I am excited to keep studying.At this point, I am trying to figure out if this loss of passion is just temporary burnout from overworking myself, or if my interests are actually shifting toward something more analytical or business focused rather than pure software engineering.I know I am just ranting and will probably just get flamed in the comments (please be nice)",

I might think of datasets the business doesn’t have access to etc. He refused and said I need to outline the datasets first. I need to list all the data I need, he will then go and ask for the data. But he’s the one who wants this data, I’m not the one driving this, it’s his vision. Whilst I’m used to driving projects and working with ambiguity, he wants essentially a super dashboard and is judging me on the outcome with giving no direction other than “business wide”.

They don’t actually reflect skill levels, and hiring managers tend not to actually care about them once the interview process begins.* View B: They’re a measure of general competency and a candidate’s willingness to put in effort to learn. They’re a tiebreaker when other qualifications are roughly equivalent.For people who have experience hiring or interviewing software engineers:* Do AWS/Azure/GCP certifications actually factor into your hiring decisions at all?* What level of career progression do you think certifications become irrelevant to hiring or consideration, or do they remain relevant no matter what?* Have you seen any correlation between certification holders’ performance on the job?* If you had two candidates that were comparable in terms of experience, would a cert ever be the deciding factor?I’m not asking if certs are a good tool for learning.

I hope this is useful for someone# CS Student 4-Year Plan## Freshman Year* Join 1-2 clubs related to your major. My recommendation is to pick a general engineering one and a more niche technical one (e.g. SHPE + Robotics or NSBE + Cybersecurity)> **Note**: If you attend school online or your school does not have active clubs, you still need to network with people in person. Look for local tech meetups for your chosen programming language, tech stack, or the local makerspace. Pick 2 and show up often and be active* Pick 1 programming language and follow an in-depth tutorial or book such as Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, or a Learn GO with Tests* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Make a resume and a LinkedIn profile## Freshman -> Sophomore Summer* Get a part-time job, anything will do* Practice more for your chosen programming language## Sophomore Year* Be more active in the same 1 - 2 club(s). Join event committees, help setup at events and show up frequently to events. Aim for a leadership position when elections are next held* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile. By the end of sophomore year you should have on your resume: a part-time job, some relevant coursework, 1-3 programming languages and some technologies, and active participation in a student organization* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely (slacks, a dress shirt and dress shoes can be had at Walmart). Take 5 - 10 printed copies of your resume with you and make it your goal to hand out all of them to recruiters. The point is to get accustomed to talking to professionals## Sophomore -> Junior Summer* If you got an internship, congratulations you are ahead of the curve. If not get a part-time job, anything will do* Fill in gaps as necessary (Git, SQL, basic cloud stuff, HTML & CSS, Unix CLI, basic networking)* By now you should have taken a Data Structures and Algorithms class. Time to start LeetCode. You don't have to go too crazy if you are consistent. Pick 2 days a week for ~1 hr: * **Day 1**: Watch an instructional video, attempt a problem, watch the solution video, then write the code for the solution * **Day 2**: Attempt a problem (30 mins for Easy, 45 mins for Medium, 1 hr for Hard). If you can't solve it in time, watch the solution video, then write the code for the solution. If you have more time, attempt another problem * **Repeat**: Continue with Day 2 until you run out of problems on a topic. Then start again on the next topic from Day 1 Check out NeetCode 250 for a list of problems organized by type, ordered from least to most difficult, with solutions## Junior Year* Be active in the same 1 - 2 club(s), hopefully this time in a leadership position. Try to get a leadership position during officer elections* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects. Take resumes and be dressed decently (clean shirt and pants with no holes). Recruiters sometimes do interviews* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile. Make sure to have a professional headshot. Obtain 500 connections by the end of the year. Add folks in you classes, in your student orgs, and at hackathons* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely. Take 10 - 30 printed copies of your resume with you and make it your goal to hand out all of them to recruiters. You NEED an internship this upcoming summer* If you have the money, go to a national conference so you can try to get an internship (e.g. SHPE, NSBE, Grace Hopper, WICSE, IEEE, etc). Dress nicely, take resumes, add people on LinkedIn* Start looking for internships in August. The goal is to get out 2+ applications out EVERY day. Don't just apply in your city, apply nationally## Junior -> Senior Summer* Do your internship and do it well. Dress nicely, ask questions, do your best work, add folks on LinkedIn. You are trying to get a return offer## Senior Year * Be active in the same 1 - 2 club(s). If you already had 1+ leadership positions feel free to take a break this year if you like. If you have not gotten a leadership position and you have not had 1+ internships you NEED to have a leadership position senior year* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects. Take resumes and be dressed decently (clean shirt and pants with no holes). Recruiters sometimes do interviews* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile* Keep up the LeetCode* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely. Take 10 - 30 printed copies of your resume with you and make it your goal to hand out all of them to recruiters. You NEED a full-time offer If you have the money, go to a national conference so you can try to get an full-time job offer (e.g. SHPE, NSBE, Grace Hopper, WICSE, IEEE, etc). Dress nicely, take resumes, add people on LinkedIn* Start looking for full-time roles in August. The goal is to get out 5+ applications out EVERY day if you do not have a return offer. Don't just apply in your city, apply nationally. Feel free to apply less or be more selective if you got a return offer that you wouldn't mind taking",

So far my team is delivering and delivering faster than any other team in the Product group.We've been planning a roadmap of 7 more projects over the next 2 years, I'm hiring 2 more people soon. One senior with production experience and one bright junior.

We have tonnes of tickets of features planned out too.My CTO is beaming and really talking us up now to the execs. I know my value is managing my team and unblocking them, motivating them etc. However, I do wonder if I'll get rusty and sort of pigeon hole myself to a management career.I'm not even sure how interviews look at this level?

They hired me as a solo developer to manage 4 different projects. There is no other technical person in the company. One of the projects specifically is a mess. The way it was built wasn't very robust. The previous developer used a bunch of technologies that they were not familiar with, and it's very messy. I was not aware of the state of this project when they hired me. It took me about a month to get set up because there was no one to onboard me; I basically had to figure everything out on my own, and there were some really niche things about the system that weren't documented properly. Actually, their entire documentation is a mess and not very helpful. It also took like 3 weeks for them to give me access to everything I needed.I've been stuck on a few issues for months, and it's driving me insane. These issues are direct symptoms of how the system was built. Initially, the system worked fine, but the way it was built is now causing a bunch of long-term problems to arise. I'm trying my best, but as soon as I fix one thing, another issue pops up. My boss and our clients don't really understand this, and they basically blame me for everything. I feel so overwhelmed right now. I've been trying my best, but I feel like it's not good enough. I've been working through nights and on weekends to try to resolve these issues, but it's like an endless cycle because more issues keep popping up. They also want me to do a full QA assessment every time I test, and that takes time.I've tried to explain to my boss that I'm just one person and that there is only so much I can do, but he doesn't care. They basically want me to do the job of an entire team while paying me below average for what a developer makes. I also mentioned to my boss that we should hire another developer or a consultant to help with the workload, and he told me that in order to do that, they would have to cut my salary by at least 45%. By their logic, they hired me to do a job, and if I need extra help to do that job, then it's going to have to come out of my pay. I'm trying my very best, but they make me feel like I'm incompetent and that I'm not even trying at all. They told me that I should be able to do this and more. I am actually questioning my skills right now. I don't know if I'm just a bad developer or if I'm being gaslighted by them.",

        "content": "Right after graduating college in 2020, I wasn't really confident in my coding abilities. Luckily, I got an offer from a company that was willing to teach me a low-code platform to be a developer in (Pega). Things were pretty ok but I eventually changed roles to do manual QA and I'd been doing that for about 3 or 4 years. Due to government lockdowns and budget cuts, I got laid off and now I'm not really sure what I can do. Since I went into manual QA, my pega dev skills aren't really up to snuff, and my regular Java/C++ skills are definitely extremely rusty. I've applied to both Pega dev jobs as well as manual QA jobs, but I'm trying to figure out what else I can do in the meantime.I'm considering going into pharmacy technician jobs since I have connections there, but on the coding side I'm not really sure what I should do to bounce back. Should I try and relearn my pega skills even though there are less jobs up for that? Relearn java/c++ thru bootcamp or otherwise? Try and learn javascript or python for automated testing roles? New language entirely like Cobol or Rust? I'm just feeling very lost and not sure where the best use of my time would be. Edit: just to mention what my current plan is, right now I'm studying for a pharm tech certification so I can get a job to supplement/replace my unemployment checks. Once the cert is sorted, I was gonna continue applying for manual QA roles and maybe even entry level/junior dev roles while also looking into other, less coding-centric tech roles to pivot into so I can have a more financially stable long-term full-time job.",

Wanted to hear anyones thoughts on if I should do anything or just leave it.Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions - sent a nice note to the recruiter, figured I don't have much to lose, really only gain if he can sympathize but likely won't change anything.

        "content": "Huge gap between ego driven job posting requirement / interview process and the actual job.C level execs started to force only senior level hires, because AI supposedly magically does junior / mid level job by itself without anyone \"driving\" it. (it doesn't)I have had open positions, and often the job is not that difficult, but I'm forced to hire giga seniors only, with ego driven super tough interview processes. HR and people involved feel good drafting a super demanding job posting requirement and process. I internally cringe when I compare it to what actually is the job.The truth is no one wants to challenge it, my theory is it’s because in terms of optics. When leaders and execs say they hire senior only, it gives the impression that they are raising the bar, that they work on super hard problems, that the org super mature, etc... No one wants to say the truth that sometimes \"well actually what we work on here is not too hard, let's get a coachable hire we can invest in\". Last we tried we got shut down hard.What happens then, we eventually find someone senior enough that can pass the process, then they are underutilized, get frustrated and leave. Or they stay but invent problems and over engineer (and some important basic work does not get done).In the recent job posting I worked on, we had to remove a line about how \"you will get to coach juniors\" because we literally don't have any now. The simple tasks haven't disappeared, it’s just that seniors are wasting time on them instead of juniors.Frustrated with this, can anyone relate?[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qwmnv8)",

Based in NYC, at this point, I will consider any technical field a great starting point. I also would like to know what my options are for SWE? Should I continue working on personal projects and pushing out as much as I can? I get no interviews at all, which leads me to believe my resume is lackluster and it's probably because most of my projects are old. It's something I'm self aware of and actively try to fix but I usually abandon projects half way through for no reason. I'm still working on that part of myself but I would just like to know if it's even worth it at this point. tl;drWhat other tech positions can I apply for to stabilize myself?

        "content": "To not make it extremely long yet also consice enough...I'm a recent CS major graduate, and I managed to land a role very shortly after graduation (aka. zero actual work experience) as a \"game dev intern\" at a software company (they're not a game studio, they're mainly vehicle-oriented), basically making them a simulation for cars.The internship is 6 months, and during these months, I'd been working on my own in this project, with the only additional help is just insight from my supervisor, but other than that, I built everything myself from the ground up.Now I'm mainly a game developer, just regular Unity/Unreal stuff, with some knowledge with graphics APIs like OpenGL and DirectX, but that's pretty much it. On the job however, the actual \"game dev\" part is like 40%, maybe 35% of the project. The rest is system configurations on platforms, bash scripting, networking and front-end, and recently robotics too. All of that was not only way outside my main working field, but also no one else in the team is able to help me with the project.About two months ago, deadlines started approaching, and with them, much more pressure and extremely long days, especially since I, as an intern, was responsible for this project that should be presented at some big \"conferences\". And of course, wouldn't you expect it (even though I'd have loved achieving it and being proud of it), I failed every single deadline. Too many moving parts of it and with the typical managers' requests, made me even more burnt out. The \"internship\" is 5 days/40 hours a week, full on site, with no options for days off. And more than once, I had to (not by my choice, but it did sort of help once) go on weekends to catch up.Eventually, about a month ago, I reached a state of burnout where I'm simply not even doing the bare minimum of a job to not get fired anymore, I couldn't be bothered. Even though the job pays so well at this level, the pressure made me terrified of staying any longer at the company.Am I right to feel that way or do I need to \"toughen up\"?Edit: I forgot to mention, we have paid access to AI agents so they handle all the heavy duty I barely write code myself anymore. But still, even with them, it's become quite exhausting working like a senior yet being an intern.",

I’ve got about \\~3 years of experience, and I’ve been working as a full stack developer on a DoD project, so I do have an active security clearance (secret level).I started as a campus hire making $65k for this big defense consulting company, and after a few raises I’m at $79k now. No bonus though (my company doesn’t pay bonuses at my current level, which is some BS...). Also no promotion so far as they keep saying the market is bad, even though the company used to promote campus hires within 2 years just a few years before. I’ve been basically fully remote the whole time, which has been the best part about this job honestly.But yeah… things are getting worse. They’ve been slowly cutting people, and now they just eliminated our entire team (the project is going to end some time in February), so we’re basically being told we need to find other projects internally. I’m definitely not quitting without something lined up, and I’ve already started sending my internal resume to other teams inside the company. But at the same time, I feel like I should start looking outside too since i feel i can get paid more if i switch jobs...So I’m curious, how’s the cleared job market right now? I’m currently living in a MCOL city, and I’m willing to relocate if the company offers relocation assistance. I know the job market overall is pretty rough right now. Any advice would be appreciated.",

My brain is telling me the 93k job is a better set up, but I can’t stop thinking about the other one and how I might make a great mistake as this decides the course of my life for me.I know 93k is already a lower swe offer I suppose, but earlier this month I was debating between a 60k ar/vr internship that has great potential to become full time vs this 93k job, and I decided with the 93k. This time the decision is a little more difficult for me. If you have any advice please let me know, as anything would greatly help.",

Recruited hard by team there but ultimately was told at the end of the day they are restricted by their compensation and bands and this is top for senior software engineer. This company has 10x ARR of current company and seems to have better w/l balance and long term stability. I believe a much better chance at getting value from options, and a fairly low strike all things consideredVery hesitant to take such a large cut to base but bonus helps in year 1, and in this market riding it out and then counting on a better opportunity coming along in 6 months or so seems dubious.

        "content": "For context, I finally got an offer from a company that’s a bit smaller, but the compensation is decent and the work is solid for learning a lot at the beginning of my career. That said though, I have to give an answer to them within the next day two days. I’m also in the running for another company that’s relatively larger, would teach me a lot, and most importantly would start me at about 15-20k more base than the first company. The issue is I’ve done 3 interviews with them but would still need to do another in-person and I’m almost certain they won’t give me offer before the deadline for the other offer. With how the economy is right now, declining the first offer and hoping the other one comes through is simply off the table, I have to take the guaranteed offer right now no matter what. That said though, if the other company does come through say a week down the line, I would hate to have to decline the materially better offer due to some unfortunate timing. My question is, would it be acceptable to accept my first offer and then potentially rescind my acceptance a week or two later if I do get a better offer from the second company? I would ideally like to not burn any bridges, but the company is smaller so I’m sure it would impact them a little more. Of course, that would also mean it wouldn’t be the end of the world if I can’t work with them anymore since it’s not a big company with a lot of potential job openings anyways. I’m just not familiar with this area, and I’m not sure if this is like unheard of or potentially career-threatening later down the line. I do understand this is all assuming I get the job for the other company which may not happen anyways, but I wanted to be prepared just in case. This is all unfamiliar territory for me, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

        "content": "I have the Anthropic CodeSignal OA coming up and want to be as prepared as I can.After doing a bit of research, I've learned that Anthropic's OA is a 4-stage system design problem using OOP, with actual coding and test cases to pass (not just talking through design on a whiteboard). I've done a few system design interviews before, but those were whiteboarding sessions. I haven't had to actually code up a full system under time pressure and validate it against a suite of test cases.Are there any sites where you build a system in code and run it against a test suite? Essentially, Leetcode but for system design? Or problem sets/files that I can work through and then locally run the tests myself? I've already found some LeetCode problems like \"Design an In-Memory File System\" and \"Web Crawler,\" but I'm curious what else is out there.Any resource recommendations on OOP design principles and patterns, too? I'm currently going through System Design Interview by Alex Xu, but that's about it.Lastly, I'd love any advice for those who have taken this OA. Definitely a bit nervous!Thanks!",

I’m looking to transition toward AI/ML or GenAI based roles while staying aligned with backend technologies.My current role has no exposure to ML or AI and I’m trying to understand what credible paths look like from a hiring perspective.A few specific questions:1. For someone without professional ML experience, what realistically qualifies a candidate for AI/ML-focused roles? Is targeting ML-adjacent backend roles (data pipelines, model serving, infra) a more practical first step than pure ML roles?2. Are there beginner-friendly learning paths that hiring managers actually respect? In particular, are Google’s free AI/ML courses ([https://grow.google/ai/](https://grow.google/ai/)) useful as a foundation, or are they generally too high-level to matter in interviews?3. What types of side projects best demonstrate readiness for applied ML or GenAI roles? For example, end-to-end ML systems, LLM integration (RAG, evaluation, fine-tuning), or ML infrastructure work.I’m looking for a realistic path that builds on a backend background. Appreciate any insights from people who’ve hired for or made this transition.",

I’m about to join another similar role with decent TC.The role is stable and pays well, but with the market tightening and big-tech backend roles becoming very selective, I’m worried this kind of experience may not translate well outside finance and could box me in long term.My long-term goal is strong backend/systems engineering, optionality to move to big tech/product companies, and eventually build something of my own.Given the current market:Can buy-side, back-office Python roles still be a good stepping stone to big tech or front office quant roles if I focus on fundamentals?Or is it better to try pivoting earlier, even if it means lower pay or more risk?Would love practical advice from people who’ve switched or consciously stayed.Thanks :folded_hands:",

Basically to sum it up, I just graduated with a bachelors in CS with a focus on video games, but my curriculum was very disappointing and barely actually focused on game development. I didn’t get a single internship throughout my entire experience in university because the vast majority of them were for cybersecurity students and none of them were related to what I wanted to be doing. My classes also burned me out on coding and made me lose my passion for it. Now I’m at a point where I’m still burnt out and I’m lost on what I should do for a career. I’m hesitant to try to break into the game industry right now because I know it’s competitive and very underpaid, so I’m considering working on my own indie game on the side while doing something else as my main job.The problem is I don’t know what to do as a main job now that satisfies my creativity, doesn’t hurt my brain, and pays enough to make a living off of. I’m thinking about something like web development or UI/UX design but I’m not sure if those fields are too competitive (or being too easily replaced) to be worth it. I’m someone with an eye for visual design and I also have skills in digital art, but I feel like I’m not at a point with my art where I think it’s professional enough and I don’t have any kind of professional portfolio yet.And yes I know I probably should have been working on side projects to build a portfolio while still in university, but I was burnt out constantly by my classes and didn’t recover from that burnout even during breaks. Maybe that’s a sign of a bigger issue, I don’t know. I do know I suffer from perfectionism that prevents me from starting things, even things I want to do.Any advice, tips, or insight would be appreciated. I want to move forward and get “unstuck” so I can properly start my adult life.I’m in the U.S. by the way if that’s relevant, in a very rural area, not a big city.",

        "content": "TL;DR: I have \\~3 years of SWE experience (including 2 years at Amazon), but I’ve been out of the industry for almost 2 years due to health issues. In today’s market, is it realistic to get back into an SDE role, and how should I approach it?Hi all. I’m looking for honest perspective from people who’ve been in the industry for a while, especially anyone who has hired or returned after a gap.I have a CS degree and about three years of professional experience as a backend engineer. I spent roughly a year at a banking-as-a-service/fintech company, then two years at Amazon working on backend services. After Amazon, I took time off because I had savings and I needed a reset. What I expected to be a shorter break became much longer because I ran into health issues that took time to resolve. I’m doing better now, and I’m ready to re-enter the workforce, but the gap has me worried; not just because it’s almost two years, but because I’m re-entering during a slower market.I’m currently getting back into interview prep (LeetCode, system design, and behavioral). I haven’t applied broadly yet because I wanted to rebuild momentum first. The part that’s making me anxious is whether recruiters and hiring managers will view the gap as a hard stop, even with the Amazon experience. I learned a lot in that role and I feel like the work itself made me a stronger engineer, but I also know the market can be unforgiving about “recent experience,” and I don’t have that right now.I’m not asking for reassurance so much as a realistic read on how this plays out. Is a two-year gap something that can be overcome with strong prep and a straightforward explanation, or does it usually require a different strategy (contracting first, down-leveling, focusing on smaller companies, heavy networking/referrals, etc.)? If you’ve seen people come back successfully after a gap, what actually made the difference?I’m genuinely committed to staying in software and I want to work in the field I trained for, but I’m also trying to be pragmatic about what the next step should look like. Any advice on how to approach applications, how to talk about the gap without oversharing, and what expectations to set would really help.",

        "content": "5 YOE, data engineer, NYC. Currently work for a lizard person who owns a FAANG component. Started working at my job about 6 months ago, and while the pay is good, I'm not happy there. I'm a bad fit culturally, most of the people I interact with on a daily basis are very shy/asocial and it's making me unhappy just being around them. DEs also seem to have very limited career progression here, there are only a couple IC6es for the entire company and your only real option for moving up is going manager track or switching to a different job function. Neither of these would be grounds for me to ditch early in a vacuum, and had things stayed as they were I'd probably put in a couple years and see where things went.Anyways, as it happens, hedge fund recruiter calls me out of the blue a week or so ago, says they want me for a DE position in-house, puts me in at a **BASE 100k higher than my total at the FAANG**, (350k vs 250k) and considering bonuses I think there's a good chance I end up higher than 400k, all cash. Seems like they bit because I had the first (non-screener) interview today and I think my chances are pretty good. I wouldn't have to move or even change my commute really. It's a phenomenal opportunity all around even if I'd be working longer days.Questions I have are:* Does anyone know the fund Point72 and/or have any anecdata about them? Glassdoor looks good. * This isn't going to come back around to bite me in the ass later trying to find job N+2? My prior experience is all 2-3 year stints so this would be an outlier, but I know cutting out after 6mo would probably completely burn any chance of me ever boomeranging at my current job.",
