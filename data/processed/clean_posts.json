If you are *not* building LLM agents, what cool stuff are you actually working on these days?What is the most interesting thing on your plate right now?A weird ingestion challenge?Internal tools?Something that sped up your team?Some insane BigQuery or Snowflake optimization rabbit hole?I am not looking for PR answers. I want to hear what actual data engineers are building in 2025 that does not involve jamming an LLM between a user and a SQL warehouse.What is your coolest current project?",

        "content": "For every other data engineer or someone in higher hierarchy down the road comes to a choiuce of Apache Iceberg or Databricks Delta Lake, so we went ahead and benchmarked both systems. Just sharing our experience here.TL;DR Both formats have their perks: Apache Iceberg offers an open, flexible architecture with surprisingly fast query performance in some cases, while Databricks Delta Lake provides a tightly managed, all-in-one experience where most of the operational overhead is handled for you.Setup & MethodologyWe used the TPC-H 1 TB dataset  which is a dataset of about 8.66 billion rows across 8 tables to compare the two stacks end-to-end: ingestion and analytics.For the Iceberg setup: We ingested data from PostgreSQL into Apache Iceberg tables on S3, orchestrated through OLake’s high-throughput CDC pipeline using AWS Glue as catalog and EMR Spark for query.. Ingestion used 32 parallel threads with chunked, resumable snapshots, ensuring high throughput. On the query side, we tuned Spark similarly to Databricks (raised shuffle partitions to 128 and disabled vectorised reads due to Arrow buffer issues).For the Databricks Delta Lake setup: Data was loaded via the JDBC connector from PostgreSQL into Delta tables in 200k-row batches. Databricks’ managed runtime automatically applied file compaction and optimized writes. Queries were run using the same 22 TPC-H analytics queries for a fair comparison.This setup made sure we were comparing both ingestion performance and analytical query performance under realistic, production-style workloads.What We Found* We used OLake to ingest to Iceberg and was about 2x faster - 12 hours vs 25.7 hours on Databricks thanks to parallel chunked ingestion.* Iceberg ran the full TPC-H suite 18% faster than Databricks.* Cost: Infra cost was 61% lower on Iceberg + OLake (around $21.95 vs $50.71 for the same run).here are the overall result and our ideology on this-Databricks still wins on ease-of-use: you just click and go. Cluster setup, Spark tuning, and governance are all handled automatically. That’s great for teams that want a managed ecosystem and don’t want to deal with infrastructure.But if your team is comfortable managing a Glue/AWS stack and handling a bit more complexity, Iceberg + OLake’s open architecture wins on pure numbers  faster at scale, lower cost, and full engine flexibility (Spark, Trino, Flink) without vendor lock-in.read our article to know more on our steps followed and the overall benchmarks and the numbers around it curious to know what you people think.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Lately I’ve been deep diving into data governance because our \"wild west\" data stack is finally catching up with us. I’ve read a ton of dry whitepapers and vendor guides, and I wanted to share a summary of a framework that actually makes sense for modern engineering teams (vs. the old-school \"lock everything down\" approach).I’m curious if anyone here has successfully moved from a centralized model to a federated one?The Core Problem: Most frameworks treat governance as a \"police function.\" They create bottlenecks. The modern approach (often called \"Active Governance\") tries to embed governance into the daily workflow rather than making it a separate compliance task.Here is the breakdown of the framework components that seem essential:1.) The Operating Model (The \"Who\") You basically have three choices. From what I’ve seen, #3 is the only one that scales:- Centralized: One team controls everything. (Bottleneck city).- Decentralized: Every domain does whatever they want. (Chaos).- Federated/Hybrid: A central team sets the \"Standards\" (security, quality metrics), but the individual Domain Teams (Marketing, Finance) own the data and the definitions.2.) The Pillars (The \"What\") If you are building this from scratch, you need to solve for these three:- Transparency: Can people actually find the data? (Catalogs, lineage).- Quality: Is the data trustworthy? (Automated testing, not just manual checks).- Security: Who has access? (RBAC, masking PII).3.) The \"Left-Shift\" Approach This was a key takeaway for me: Governance needs to move \"left.\" Instead of fixing data quality in the dashboard (downstream), we need to catch it at the source (upstream).- Legacy way: Data Steward fixes a report manually.- Modern way: The producer is alerted to a schema change or quality drop before the pipeline runs.The Tooling Landscape I've been looking at tools that support this \"Federated\" style. Obviously, you have the big clouds (Purview, etc.), but for the \"active\" metadata part, where the catalog actually talks to your stack (Snowflake, dbt, Slack), tools like Atlan or Castor seem to be pushing this methodology the hardest.Question for the power users of this sub: For those of you who have \"solved\" governance, did you start with the tool or the policy first? And how do you get engineers to care about tagging assets without forcing them?Thanks!",

But what I'm seeing and doing right now is more of ticket solving / incident management, talking to data publishers, giving out communications about downtime, etc.I observed what other people were doing with the same or higher comparable role to me and what I observed is that, everybody is doing the same thing, which honestly stresses me out because of the sheer amount of proprietary tools and configuration that I'll have to learn but all fundamentally uses Databricks.Also, the documentation for their stuff is atrocious to say the least, its so fragmented and most of the time outdated that I basically had to resort on making my OWN documentation so I don't have to spend 30 minutes figuring shit out from their long ass confluence page.The culture / it's people is a hit or miss, it has its ups and downs in my very short observation of a month. It feels like riding an emotional rollercoaster because of the work load / tension from the amount of p1 or escalation incidents that have happened on the short span of a month.Right now, I'm contemplating whether if its worth to stay given the brutality of the job market or just find another job.

        "author": "raginjason",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "When it comes to reporting, I’m a fan of Kimball/star schema. I believe that the process of creating dimensions and facts actually reveals potential issues inside of your data. Discussing and ironing out grain and relationships between various tables helps with all of this. Often the initial assumptions don’t hold up and the modeling process helps flesh these edge cases out. It also gives you a vocabulary that you don’t have to invent inside your organization (dimension, fact, bridge, SCD, junk dimension, degenerate dimension, etc).I personally do not see OBT as much of a data model. It always seemed like “we contorted the data and mashed it together so that we got a huge table with the data we want” without too much rhyme or reason. I would add that an exception I have made is to join a star together and materialize that as OBT so that data science or analysts can hack on it in Excel, but this was done as a delivery mechanism not a modeling methodology. Honestly, OBT has always seemed pretty amateur to me. I’m interested if anyone has a different take on OBT. Is there anyone out there advocating for a structured and disciplined approach to creating datamarts with an OBT philosophy? Did I miss it and there actually is a Kimball-ish person for OBT that approaches it with rigor and professionalism?For some context, I recently modeled a datamart as a star schema and was asked by an incoming leader “why did you model it with star schema?”. To me, it was equivalent to asking “why did you use a database for the datamart?”. Honestly, for a datamart, I don’t think anything other than star schema makes much sense, so anything else was not really an option. I was so shocked at this question that I didn’t have a non-sarcastic answer so I tabled the question. Other options could be: keep it relational, Datavault, or OBT. None of these seem serious to me (ok datavault is a serious approach as I understand it, but such a niche methodology that I wouldn’t seriously entertain it). The person asking this question is younger and I expect he entered the data space post big data/spark, so likely an OBT fan.I’m interested in hearing from people who believe OBT is superior to star schema. Am I missing something big about OBT?",

        "author": "Hefty-Citron2066",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "hey folks, curious how others are tackling a problem my team keeps running into.**TL;DR:** We have data spread across Hive, Iceberg tables, Kafka topics, and some PostgreSQL databases. Managing metadata in 4+ different places is becoming a nightmare. Looking at catalog federation solutions and wanted to share what I found.## Our SetupWe're running a pretty typical modern stack but it's gotten messy over time:- Legacy Hive metastore (can't kill it yet, too much depends on it)- Iceberg tables in S3 for newer lakehouse stuff- Kafka with its own schema registry for streaming- A few PostgreSQL catalogs that different teams own- Mix of AWS and GCP (long story, acquisition stuff)The problem is our data engineers waste hours just figuring out where data lives, what the schema is, who owns it, etc. We've tried building internal tooling but it's a constant game of catch-up.## What I've Been Looking AtI spent the last month evaluating options. Here's what I found:### Option 1: Consolidate Everything into Unity CatalogWe're already using Databricks so this seemed obvious. The governance features are genuinely great. But:- It really wants you to move everything into the Databricks ecosystem- Our Kafka stuff doesn't integrate well- External catalog support feels bolted on- Teams with data in GCP pushed back hard on the vendor lock-in### Option 2: Try to Federate with Apache PolarisSnowflake's open source catalog looked promising. Good Iceberg support. But:- No real catalog federation (it's still one catalog, not a catalog of catalogs)- Doesn't handle non-tabular data (Kafka, message queues, etc.)- Still pretty new, limited community### Option 3: Build Something with Apache GravitinoThis one was new to me. It's an Apache project (just graduated to Top-Level Project in May) that does metadata federation. The concept is basically \"catalog of catalogs\" instead of trying to force everything into one system.What caught my attention:- Actually federates across Hive, Iceberg, Kafka, JDBC sources without moving data- Handles both tabular and non-tabular data (they have this concept called \"filesets\")- Truly vendor-neutral (backed by Uber, Apple, Intel, Pinterest in the community)- We could query across our Hive metastore and Iceberg tables seamlessly- Has both REST APIs and Iceberg REST API supportThe catch:- You have to self-host (or use Datastrato's managed version)- Newer project so some features are still maturing- Less polished UI compared to commercial options- Community is smaller than Databricks ecosystem## Real Test I RanI set up a quick POC connecting our Hive metastore, one Iceberg catalog, and a test Kafka cluster. Within like 2 hours I had them all federated and could query across them. The metadata layer actually worked - we could see all our tables, topics, and schemas in one place.Then tried the same query that usually requires us to manually copy data between systems. With Gravitino's federation it just worked. Felt like magic tbh.## My TakeFor us, I think Gravitino makes sense because:- We genuinely can't consolidate everything (different teams, different clouds, regulations)- We need to support heterogeneous systems (not just tables)- We're comfortable with open source (we already run a lot of Apache stuff)- Avoiding vendor lock-in is a real priority after our last platform migration disasterBut if you're already 100% Databricks or you have simpler needs, Unity Catalog is probably the easier path.## Question for the GroupIs anyone else using catalog federation approaches? How are you handling metadata sprawl across different systems?Also curious if anyone has tried Gravitino in production. The project looks solid but would love to hear real-world experiences beyond my small POC.",

I didn’t even know the DE role existed. It really catched my attention, and I started studying every single day. I’ll admit I made some mistakes (jumping straight into Airflow/AWS, even made a post about Airflow here, LOL), but I kept going because I genuinely enjoy learning about the field.Two months ago I actually received two job opportunities. Both meetings went well: they asked about my projects, my skills, my approach to learning, etc. Both processes just vanished. I assume it’s because I have 0 experience. Still, I’ve been studying 4–6 hours a day since I started, and I’m fully committed to become a professional DE.# My current skill set:**Python:** PySpark, Polars, DuckDB, OOP **SQL:** MySQL, PostgreSQL **Databricks:** Delta Lake, Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines, Jobs, Roles, Unity Catalog, Secrets, External Locations, Connections, Clusters **BI:** Power BI, Looker **Cloud:** AWS (IAM, S3, Glue) / a bit of DynamoDB and RDS **Workflow Orchestration:** Airflow 3 (Astronomer certified) **Containers:** Docker basics (Images, Containers, Compose, Dockerfile) **Version Control:** Git & GitHub **Storage / Formats:** Parquet, Delta, Iceberg **Other:** Handling fairly large datasets (+100GB files), understanding when to use specific tools, etc **English:** C1/C2 (EF SET certified)# Projects I’ve built so far:– An end-to-end ETL built **entirely in SQL** using DuckDB, loading into PostgreSQL. – Another ETL pulling from multiple sources (MySQL, S3, CSV, Parquet), converting everything to Parquet, transforming it, and loading into PostgreSQL. Total volume was \\~4M rows. I also handled IAM for boto3 access. – A small Spark → S3 pipeline (too simple to mention it though).I know these are beginner/intermediate projects, i’m planning more advanced ones for next year.Next year, I want to do things properly: structured learning, better projects, certifications, and ideally my first job, even if it’s low pay or long hours. I’m confident I can scale quickly once I get my first actual job.# My questions:– If you were in my position, what would you focus on next? – Do you think I’m in the right direction? – What kind of projects actually stand out in a junior DE portfolio? – Do certifications actually matter for someone with zero experience? (Databricks, dbt, Airflow, etc.)Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",

Plus, since we are using GitHub codespaces, it's essentially free to run in the browser with just a couple clicks! If you don't want to use GitHub Codespces, you can run this locally via Docker Desktop.Bonus for loacal: Since Cursor is based on VSCode, you can use the dev containers in there and then have AI help explain code or concepts (also super helpful for learning).One thing I do want to highlight is that since this is meant for students and not production, security and user management controls are very lax (e.g. \"password\" for passwords db configs). I'm optimizing on student learning experience there, but it's probably a great starting point to learn how to implement those controls.Anything you would add? I've started a Kafka project, so I would love to build out streaming use cases as well. With the latest Kafka update, you no longer need Zookeeper, which keeps the docker compose file simpler!",

Luckily we dlt that integrates them well. I also added Stripe to get some income data too, so have an overall cost dashboard with costs and income to calculate margins and other important data. I hope this is useful, and I'm sure there's much more that can be added.Also, huge thanks to pre-existing dashboard [aws-cur-wizard](https://github.com/Twing-Data/aws-cur-wizard) with very detailed reports. Everything is build on open-source and I included a `make demo` that gets you started immediately without cloud reports setup to see how it works.PS: I'm also planing to add a GitHub actions to ingest into ClickHouse Cloud, to have a cloud version as an option too, in case you want to run it in an enterprise.

I like to have more control. And the idea that it deploys everything, but it will be in invalid step untill you do some manual work really pushes me away. Next I added a video about git integration and python based deployments. That one is much more code oriented and even \"code-first\", which is great. Still, I was quite annoyed because of the parameter file. If only it could be split, or applied in stages...Anyway - those are 2 videos I mentioned: Fabric deployment pipelines - [https://youtu.be/1AdUcFtl830](https://youtu.be/1AdUcFtl830) Git + Python - [https://youtu.be/dsEA4HG7TtI](https://youtu.be/dsEA4HG7TtI)Happy to answer any questions or even better get some suggestions for the next topics! Purview? Or maybe unit testing?",

We are a financial asset management company and get loads of transaction data, performance data, RIA data, SMA data, etc. I use PowerBI to connect data sources, transform data, and build out analytics for leadership. It works well but is very time consuming. We are looking to aggregate all of it into one Warehouse, but I don't really know what the next best step it. Or which Warehouse. In my head I am building custom tables with SQL that have all the data we want aggregated and transformed so it's easier to report on. Intead of doing it every time in PBI.The world of data engineering is vast and I have just started. We are looking at Fabric because we already have Azure and use PowerBI. I know Snowflake is a good option as well.I just don't fully grasp the pros and cons of the two. Which Lake is best, which warehouse is best, etc. I have started some training modules, but would love some annecdotes, and real work advice.Cheers!",

Here is the catch, we have some many different types of JIRA issue and each of those jira issue has different custom fields. The .csv file has all the field names mashed together and it’s super messy but very small. My manager want us to keep a record of those data even though we dont need all of them. What I am thinking right now is using a lakehouse architecture. Bronze layer: we will have all the historical record, however we will define the schema of each type of JIRA issue and only allow those columns. Silver layer: only allowed curtain fields and normalize it during the load. When we try to update it, it will check if it already has that key in our storage, if not it will add, if it does, It will do a backfill/ upsert. Gold layer: apply business logical along with the data from sliver layer. Do you think this architecture is doable?",

I often needed help from an AI model but did not feel comfortable sharing certain parts of the code because of sensitive names and internal details.Between the feedback from this community and my own experience dealing with the same issue, I decided to build something to help.I created an open source local desktop app. This tool lets you hide sensitive details in your code such as field names, identifiers and other internal references before sending anything to an AI model. After you get the response back, it can restore everything to the original names so the code still works properly.It also works for regular text like emails or documentation that contain client specific information. Everything runs locally on your machine and nothing is sent anywhere. The goal is simply to make it easier to use LLMs without exposing internal structures or business logic.If you want to take a look or share feedback, the project is at [**codemasklab.com**](http://codemasklab.com)Happy to hear thoughts or suggestions from the community.",

We are considering the open lineage format because it is vendor agnostic and would allow us to use a range of different visualisation tools. Part of our design includes a processing layer which would validate, enrich and harmonize the incoming lineage data. We are considering using data bricks for this component, and following the medallion architecture and having bronze, silver and gold layers where we persist the data in case we need to re-process it. We are considering delta tables as an intermediate storage layer before storing the data in graph format in order to visualise it. Since I have never worked with open lineage json data in delta format, I wanted to know if this strategy makes sense. Has anyone done this before? Our processing layer would have to consolidate lineage data from different sources in order to create end to end lineage, and to de duplicate and clean the data. It seemed that data bricks and unity catalog would be a good choice for this, but I would love to hear some opinions.",

Currently, we spend a significant amount of time copying data into Excel, processing it, and performing analysis. This manual process is inefficient and affects our productivity. Therefore, as the first step, we want to establish a centralized database where all our historical and future testing data—currently stored year-wise in Google Sheets—can be consolidated. Once the database is created, we also require a reporting feature that allows us to generate different types of reports based on selected criteria. We believe your expertise will be valuable in helping us design and implement this solution.”When i called for more information i was told, that what they do now is store all their data in tables on Google sheets and extract the data from there when doing calculations (im assuming using python/google colab?)Okay so the way I understood is:1. Have to make database2. Have to make ETL Pipeline?3. Have to be able to do calculations/analysis and generate reports/dashboards??So I have come up with combos as below1. PostgresSQL database + Power BI2. PostgresSQL + Python Dash application3. PostgresSQL + Custom React/Vue application4. PostgresSQL + Microsoft Fabric?? (I'm so confused as to what this is in the first place, I just learnt about it)I do not know why they are being so secretive with the actual requirements of this project, I have no idea where even to start. I'm pretty sure the \"reports\" they want is some calculations. Right now, I am just supposed to give them options and they will choose according to their extremely secretive requirements, even then i feel like im pulling things out of my ass, im so lost here please help by choosing which option you would choose for the requirements. Also please feel free to give me any advice on how to actual make this thing and if you have any other suggestions please please comment, thank you!",

Instead, it lets you interact with a database via raw SQL, while it handles mapping the SQL query results to in-memory objects.Onlymaps does just that by using Pydantic underneath. On top of that, it offers:\\- A minimal API for both sync and async query execution.\\- Support for all major relational databases.\\- Thread-safe connections and connection pools.This project provides a simpler alternative to typical full-feature ORMs which seem to dominate the Python ORM landscape, such as SQLAlchemy and Django ORM.Any questions/suggestions are welcome!",

Were on managed Airflow (not US-hyperscaler) and i need to fetch data from a mariadb that is part of a external VPN. Were talking relatively small data, the entire DB has around 300GB. For accessing the VPN i received a openvpn profile and credentials. The Airflow workers themselves have access to public internet and are not locked inside a network.Now im looking for a clean and robust approach. As im the sole data person i prioritize low maintenance over performance. disclaimer: Im def reaching my knowledge limits with this problem as i still got blind spots regarding networking, please excuse dumb questions or naive thoughts. I see two solution directions: a) somehow keeping everything inside the Airflow instance: installing a openvpn client during DAG runtime (working with docker operator or kubernetespodoperator)? --> idek if i got the necessary privileges on the managed instance to make this work b) setting up a separate VM as a bridge in our cloud that has openvpn client+proxy and is being accessed via SSH from the airflow workers? On the VM i would whitelist the Airflow workers IP (which is static).a) feels like im looking for trouble, but i cant pinpoint as im new to both these operators. Am i missing a way easy solution?The data itself i will probably want to fetch with a dlt pipeline pushing it to object storage and/or a postgres running both on the same cloud.Cheers!",

The rest of the time just using GUIs (SAP users will know what i am talking about) **Expectations / Priorities:**1. I would like to switch from consultant to inhouse. 2. I would like to diversify my skill set and add some non-SAP tools and technologies to my skill set.3. I would like to strike a better balance between pure data engineering (as in coding, SQL, data analysis, data cleansing etc.) vs. other parts of the job: doing workshops, communication, collaborating with team members. Wouldnt mind gaining some managerial responsiblity either. Past 3 years i felt like a \"only\" data analyst, writing mostly SQL and analyzing data.4. Over the course of these 5 years i never really felt like i was part of a team working on a mission with a any degree of purpose whatsoever. Would like to have more of that in my life.5. I would like to stay located in Switzerland but open to work remotely.I applied to a decent amount of jobs and having a tough time to find an entry point with my starting position. I would be more than happy to prepare before starting a new position through online courses in case there it is expected to have knowledge around certains tools / products / technologies.I am also considering to do freelancing, but i am unsure how much of the above list would actually improve in that setting. Also i wouldnt really know where and how to start / get clients and would require some networking i suppose. I am reducing my working hours next year to introduce more flexibility to my daily life and foster my search for a more fulfilling job setup. I am also aware that the above wish list is asking for a lot and most likely i will have to make some sort of compromise and will never check all the boxes. Looking for any advice and happy to connect with people who are in a similar spot or share the same priorities as me.",

After many iterations, this exploration eventually matured into what I now call Internet Object (IO).Key characteristics that came out of the design process:* schema-first by design (data and metadata clearly separated)* row-like nested structures (reduce repeated keys and structural noise)* predictable layout that is easier to stream or parse incrementally* richer type system for better validation and downstream consumption* human-readable but still structured enough for automation* about 40-50 percent fewer tokens than the equivalent JSON* compatible with JSON concepts, so developers are not learning from scratchThe article below is the first part of a multi-part series. It is not a full specification, but a starting point showing how a JSON developer can begin thinking in IO: [https://blog.maniartech.com/from-json-to-internet-object-a-lean-schema-first-data-format-part-1-150488e2f274](https://blog.maniartech.com/from-json-to-internet-object-a-lean-schema-first-data-format-part-1-150488e2f274)The playground includes a small 200-row ML-style training dataset and also allows interactive experimentation with the syntax: [https://play.internetobject.org/ml-training-data](https://play.internetobject.org/ml-training-data)More background on how the idea evolved from 2017 onward: [https://internetobject.org/the-story/](https://internetobject.org/the-story/)Would be glad to hear thoughts from the data engineering community, especially around schema design, streaming behavior, and practical use-cases.",

But I’m concerned about running into Dagster’s recommended 100k asset limit. Alternatively, I could use a single dynamic partition on EQP_Number, but then I’m worried Dagster will try to reprocess older data (when mew data arrives) which could trigger expensive downstream updates (also one of the assets produces different outputs each run so this would affect downstream data as well).I’d also like to avoid tagging processed data in S3, since the client plans to move toward a database storage/ingestion flow in the future and we don’t yet know what that will look like.What partitioning approach would you recommend for this?

My goal here isn’t to advertise anything, just to explain what we learned in the process in case it’s useful to others working on large-scale inference.**Why we looked into this**Batch inference behaves differently from online serving. You mostly care about throughput and cost. We kept seeing GPUs sit idle even with plenty of work queued.**Two big bottlenecks we found**1. **Uneven sequence lengths** made GPUs wait for the longest prompt.2. **Repeated prefixes** (boilerplate, instructions) forced us to recompute the same first tokens for huge portions of the dataset.**What we built**We combined:* **Continuous/streaming batching** (keep GPUs full instead of using fixed batches)* **Prefix-aware grouping and routing** (send prompts with similar prefixes to the same worker so they hit the same cache)We call the combination **dynamic prefix bucketing**.**Results**On a 128-GPU L4 cluster running Qwen3-8B, we saw roughly:* **≈50% faster throughput*** **Much higher prefix-cache hit rates (about 54%)*** Good scaling until model-load overhead became the bottleneckhttps://preview.redd.it/nw7knwg6lh2g1.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=76257441bb38b0c7eaf4cbce12e9c5c769d75015https://preview.redd.it/5sr9ovg6lh2g1.png?width=1602&format=png&auto=webp&s=689c014bdd9abebb6b7cf7ccda7cb22c849afde4**Why I’m sharing**Batch inference is becoming more common for data processing, enrichment, and ETL pipelines.

For example, should the first step of the Orders ETL be querying the registry to check whether the specified Customers version is ready before proceeding?",

My company haven't got high quality test data so before I role out a big change, I really want to test it manually.I've setup the pipeline on Jupyter so I can pull in a subset, test out the new functionality and make sure it outputs okay, but the process seems very tedious.The library has internal package dependencies which means I go through a process of installing those locally on the Jupyter python kernel, then also have to package them up and add them to PySpark as Py files. So I have to git clone n times !pip install local_dir from pyspark import SparkContext sc = SparkContext.getOrCreate() sc.addPyFile(\"my_package.zip\") sc.addPyFile(\"my_package2.zip\")Then if I make a change to the library, I have to do this process again.

        "content": "Hey folks,I'm curious about how the data folk approaches one thing: if you expose Snowflake (or any other data platform's) data to people external from your organization, how do you do it? In a previous company I worked for, they used Snowflake to do the heavy lifting and allowed internal analysts to hit Snowflake directly (from golden layer on). But the datatables with data to be exposed to external people were copied everyday to AWS and the external people would get data from there (postgres) to avoid unpredictable loads and potential huge spikes in costs.In my current company, the backend is built such that the same APIs are used both by internals and externals - and they hit the operational databases. This means that if I want to allow internals to access Snowflake directly and make externals access processed data migrated back to Postgres/Mysql, the backend needs to basically rewrite the APIs (or at least have two subclasses of connectors: one for internal access, other for external access).I feel like preventing direct external access to the data platform is a good practice, but I'm wondering what the DE community thinks about it :)",

        "author": "xandral95",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I’m experimenting with a storage-engine design and I’d love feedback from people with database internals experience.This is a thought experiment with a small Python PoC, I'm not an expert SW engineer, for me would be really difficult to develop alone a complex system in Rust or C++ to get serious benchmarks, but I would like to share the idea to understand if it's interesting.# Core IdeaTo think SQL like tables as geospatial raster data.1. Latitude ---> row_index (primary key)2. Longitude ---> column_index 3. Time ---> MVCC version or transaction_idAnd from these 3 core dimensions (rows, columns, time), the model naturally generalize to N dimensions:* Add hash-based dimensions for high‑cardinality OLAP attributes (e.g., `user_id`, `device_id`, `merchant_id`). These become something like: * `hash(user_id) % N` → distributes data evenly.* Add range-based dimensions for monotonic or semi‑monotonic values (e.g., timestamps, sequence numbers, IDs): * `timestamp // col_chunk_size` → perfect for pruning, like time-series chunks.This lets a traditional RDBMS table behave like an N-D array, hopefully tuned for both OLTP and OLAP scanning, depending on which dimensions are meaningful to the workload by chunking rows and columns like lat/lon tiles, and layering versions like a time-axis, you get deterministic coordinates and very fast addressing.### ExampleHere’s a simple example of what a chunk file path might look like when all dimensions are combined.Imagine a table chunked along:* **row dimension** → `row_id // chunk_rows_size = 12`* **column dimension** → `col_id // chunk_cols_size = 0`* **time/version dimension** → `txn_id = 42`* **hash dimension** (e.g., `user_id`) → `hash(user_id) % 32 = 5`* **range dimension** (e.g., timestamp bucket) → `timestamp // 3600 = 472222`A possible resulting chunk file could look like:```chunk_r12_c0_hash5_range472222_v42.parquet```Inspired by array stores like **Zarr**, but intended for **HTAP** workloads.### Update strategiesNaively using CoW on chunks but this gives huge write amplification. So I’m exploring a **Patch + Compaction** model: append a tiny *patch file* with only the changed cells + txn_id. A vacuum merges base chunk + patches into a new chunk and removes the old ones.Is this something new or reinvented? I don't know about similar products with all these combinations, the most common are (ClickHouse, DuckDB, Iceberg,...). Do you see any serious architectural problem on that?Any feedback is appreciated!TL;DR: Exploring an HTAP storage engine that treats relational tables like N-dimensional sparse arrays, combining row/col/time chunking with hash and range dimensions for OLAP/OLTP.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "We are piloting ADF copy-data pipeline to move files from 3rd party SFTP into azure storage account. Very simple pipeline that retrieves last successful execution and copies files last modified between that time and this pipeline execution time. If successful, current pipeline execution time is saved for next run.This worked great when execution interval was 12-24 hours. When requirements changed and pipeline is executed every 30 minutes, more and more files were reported missing in our storage account but present in third party SFTP.This happens because when 3rd part place files on their SFTP the LastModified datetime is not updated as that file is moved into their SFTP. A vendor employee will edit and save a file at 2pm, schedule it to be put into their SFTP, when file is put into SFTP at 3PM the LastModified datetime is kept as 2pm. When our pipeline runs at 3PM, file is missed because it was modified at 2PM as shown on SFTP but pipeline is looking for files modified between 2:30PM and 3PM.What seems to be an enterprise solution is a pipeline that takes snapshot of remote SFTP, compares it to snapshot during last run, and using loop activity copies file by file.What I would like to do is find a solution in a middle. A compromise that would not involve a whole new approach.One thought came to mind is continue running pipeline every 30 minutes but copy files last modified in 12-24 hours prior and then deleting source files upon successful copy. Does this seem like a straightforward and good compromise?Alternative solution was to do same as above without deleting source file, but enable versioning on storage account to ensure that we can filter out blob events for files that were not modified. This has a huge downside of unnecessary re-copy of the files already copied before.Management is looking into hiring a Sr Data Engineer to take over the process but looking for interim solution for next \\~2 months.Thank you Edit: Side question, is common for source SFTPs to not update LastModified datetime when files are placed into their SFTP? We see this happening with about 70% of SFTPs we pull from",

This setup has caused us nothing but headaches however. Sync stalling, a refresh taking ages, jobs not even starting, updates not working and recently I had to install it from scratch again to get it to run again and I'm still not sure why.

Making fun of engineers, openly laughing if they do not have any knowledge, misleading them to memorize C++. Add to all of it, some ridiculously crazy views on plastic surgery, women.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I recently lost my first ever developer job because the company decided to outsource development, so I’ve been applying for backend roles that match my experience.I had an interview where the first part went fine, it was with a team manager and a project manager. The second part was a technical screening with two backend developers. They showed various technical terms on the screen, one by one, and asked me to explain them: things like API, REST, microservices, encoding vs. encryption vs. hashing, some CLI commands, DOM, XML/JSON/YAML, and so on.The thing is, I’ve been working with these concepts for over three years. I use them regularly, and I understand them in practice. But I really struggled to \\*explain\\* them clearly. I couldn’t put into words what I actually know how to do. It made me feel like I completely bombed what should have been simple questions.Since I’m self-taught, I’m wondering if this is just a gap in the theoretical knowledge you’d typically pick up in school. I already deal with imposter syndrome, but this interview made it feel a lot worse.I haven’t studied specifically for technical interviews before, but after this experience, I feel like I should.Has anyone else gone through something similar? Any advice for improving this kind of theoretical knowledge?",

The income is good, but sales is slowly burning me out and I feel like I don’t have any “real skill” or long-term stability.I’ve always been fascinated by computers and technology, even though I never studied anything related to it. I finished only high school (general gymnasium), and never went to university.Recently I’ve been seriously considering switching to **software engineering**. I’m ready to dedicate all my free time outside of work to learning programming and building skills, and I’m highly motivated to build a long-term career in this field.My main dilemma is this:**At 28, does it make sense to start a CS degree (which would take 3–4 years), or is it better to follow a structured self-study path + build a portfolio and projects?**Since I’d be learning while working full-time, time is my biggest constraint, and I want to avoid wasting years if a degree isn’t necessary for entering the industry — especially for EU/German or US remote positions.I’d also love to hear examples from people who were in a similar situation (switching careers later, learning while working full-time, or transitioning with or without a degree) — how did it go for you, what worked, and what would you do differently?I’d really appreciate honest advice from people who transitioned later or from those hiring developers.

I used InterviewCoder for some of those sessions because it gives structure instead of chaos. It forced me to slow down, think out loud, and understand my approach instead of just clicking through problems. Weirdly enough, I improved faster with less stress. I feel like half of interview prep is just learning to be calm and organized, not solving a million questions. Wish I realized that sooner",

Well, I wanted to be able to access my code from my school laptop and my home desktop, so I put all of the files on google drive and now I can access and update them from either. Problem is, we just got into reading and writing .txt files, and because my coding folder is on Google Drive, the directories are all messed up and my code can never find those files.My entire coding tab on VSCode is saved on Drive. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get that back onto my SSD so the directories work normally again. I've tried downloading the files from Drive but that doesn't seem to help. Any advice would be amazing, thank you.Edit: a friend FaceTimed me and helped me figure it out! So for some reason, when I tried to move the folder to my desktop or onto my local drive, I would get an error message. But what *did* work was ctrl+x on the file and then pasting it onto my desktop. Still not sure why I couldn’t move it, but that solved the problem and all of my code now exists on my local drive!Thank you to everyone for your help, as soon as this assignment is done I’m going to start learning git",

Should I just start a project of my own, should I just do more homework, should I memorize syntax? I always had passion for programming but unfortunately I followed completely different studies, so I am hoping it's not too late to change career.However, everyday the same questions come back to me, is it to late? What should I pursue? Web Dev? AI? Python? Javascript? I feel lost in this huge ocean, and don't have a specific plan. I do not really trust the plan chatgpt had for me, and wanted to ask real people who know what they talk about.Thank you very much, I appreciate any kind of help.",

I tried python and failed.AI came out and around 2023 I started using python and c# to make tools. But felt like a imposter due to all of my failing.Today I write golang and im getting better everyday but the part I keep failing at that Ai helps me with is the docs.When I read docs it gives me a bunch of functions that I dont know if I need because im solving a new problem. When I ask AI it says you need these ones and I feel like a idiot. I dont know how people before actually got answer to what they needed. Do you guys have any advice on how to be able to navigate docs and understand what you really need when solving new problems. I use examples but even then its incomplete for my use case.It would go along way with my imposter sydrome. And help me break away from using AI",

I could go on about why I hate my current job, but I'll move on.If the job market weren't demotivating enough, I'm so exhausted from work that I don't want to sit at my own computer at home, which makes learning so difficult. I remember during my first Python class, I was fascinated by a simple function that told you the total length of all sides of a shape based on the shape and length of one side. I tinkered with that and other code so much and never got tired of it. Now I'm sick of the thought of code, and that makes me sad because my dream is still to get into the gaming industry. The idea of not getting in makes me want to cry.I want to reignite that love I had for coding. I want to get back into it and find that love for tinkering and understanding how things work (I'm actually very good at learning through reverse engineering. It's how I learned everything I know about web development.) Is there a game or something that teaches code, particularly C++, in a way that is different and fun? I've been trying to work through an Udemy class that is actually taught very well, but I keep running into that block because it's just mostly watching someone code, taking notes, and then doing a couple of exercises throughout the chapter. It's just another class.And please, don't tell me about how difficult things are out there. I already know, and I need to be motivated, not have what little of a spark that's left put out.",

If bots can easily pass as humans through all detection methods then my project is a non-starter. I know bots can do things like, be given spending money and then find a person to solve the captcha for them, but I'm just looking at what bots can do by themselves without any outside help.I'm finding some results through research, but none of it is what I would consider conclusive or scientific. Mostly I'm just finding people maybe making up stories, sharing anecdotes, that kinda thing. I'm not seeing a lot of demonstrations of bots beating captchas but then again if they were doing this I doubt I would see somebody uploading themselves doing it on youtube.I have some vague knowledge of how captchas work, and that a big part of why they work at all is because, at least in Google's case, they read a bunch of metadata such as speed, how you move your mouse, etc. But I'm very lacking in specifics and I'm open to learn more about them.From some demonstrations I've seen, it looks like if you show a captcha image test to an AI, it will correctly find the squares with the specific object. But then if the AI or an automated program tried to input those results, it would fail due to not passing the metadata stuff? Is that a correct assumption or can AI bypass these checks now? Wouldn't it be pretty trivial to beat this by just making a robot physically tap a phone screen?I'm not asking if captchas are 100% effective, because I know that's not possible. But even if they're 90% effective, for my purposes that would be good enough. Besides that I'm also open to implementing more ways to verify if someone is a bot, but I'm looking for methods that are quick and practical like how captchas are. Maybe making the user solve multiple captchas instead of just one?",

I then wire everything in a bash or PowerShell script and voila.Is the second way the \"standard\" or \"better\" way to do things, which I should default to? Or did I fall in love with a new concept and now \"everything looks like a nail to a hammer?\" I'd prefer a Python-centric point of view, but figure this works for all languages.",

I based my Dissertation I did a software development project.For this project I basically attempted to mirror what the dev team at my place of work did. It was a Full Stack project:.Net C# BackendREACT frontendMVP Design PatternSQL Server ExpressORM (Microsoft Entity Framework Library) for interacting with the databaseThis burnt me out. Due to also working at a company that did not believe in work-life balance, I ended up rushing this project and the dissertation. Granted although not every feature was working perfectly, it did work. And yeah... I passed the module (and burnt out after a final month of finishing work at 5pm and coding or writing dissertation till 2am every day).Initially my tutor was very against me using this technology stack. As none of it was covered by the Open University. As well as pulling this off I was teaching myself C# from scratch, REACT from scratch and ORM from scratch (I shamefully admit, I had to ask chatGPT a few questions regarding that).Anyway, fast forward a year or so, and I am finally building a portfolio, as being in a more inf orientated job really does not suit me.So this week I started learning Flask. I actually have tried the very tutorials I have now completed previously and to be honest it confused the hell out of me. However... after my ordeal with C# and .Net, damn this just seems easy and straight forward. I would even say I am enjoying it.Anyway this weekend, I will be refactoring my Tic Tac Toe project to Flask and touching up the Vanilla HTML/CSS frontend I have already made (albeit zero functionality). And yeah.... I am going to need to start taking GitHub more seriously (ie a Readme file).I know this adds no value to any thing and is not even a question. But I was dreading Flask based on my experience with C# and .Net. Someone even told me recently that I should not have done what I did for my Dissertation Project and it was wayy to ambitious, but whatever.... I passed.",

I realized how behind I am compared to my peers since I have only completed school courses, which are very theoretical and more so like \"fill in the blanks\" type of projects (at least up until now). I can write pages of math proofs for sorting algorithms but I can't code for the sake of my life.Because of this, I accepted a job offer as a data analyst for 8 months. It isn't what I want to pursue since I want to pivot more into the SWE side of tech, but I'm taking it just so I have some time off from school to self-learn programming and build some projects before I get back into school (and also to network since it's a very, very large company.) I feel like I can't contribute much to my course projects. Also, my college is very well known for CS/ AI and I feel like I'm not utilizing my opportunities enough due to how useless I am.With that said, with my co-op coming up soon, I need some advice on where I can get started and the best way to go about this most efficiently. I know python and java in terms of syntax, I know all the structures like loops and stuff, but I haven't coded any projects before. I know R and SQL as well but that is useless.I think I can commit about 3-4 hours per day on average for the next 8 months (I will still be taking a calculus proof course + a data structure class on top of full time work, for the sake of 3rd year courses prequisites).Any advice will be helpful! I am a bit stupid but I am willing to put in the work to catch up to everyone. It definitely is overwhelming starting from zero haha, there's so many resources, so many terminologies, so many languages out there... I'm hoping I would find the most efficient way so I won't be wasting my time. Hopefully I'll be able to build some complex project by month 5. Thank you :)",

But it can be the case that the external API notification is okay, then the save to the db failed, and thus the API is already notified. If let's say there is a background job that periodically reruns the function, the API will be re-notified. Thus what I thought was to add a state Notifying such that before notification, and the state is not Notifying, then set the state to Notifying, then notify. Thus on retries we avoid double notifying if setting state to Finished is failed.But this makes me have to introduce a new state. Is there a better way?",

I mainly only took mostly math theory courses(lin alg, probability, random processes), and I feel like it really didn't work for me to have so little exposure to any practical things. I feel like I was exposed to some mathematical programming in Matlab and a lot of proofs.My bachelors was in computer science, but for electives I took quantum/math(stuff like number theory), and I was mediocre at it--so I didn't have exposure to any SWE electives/ lack of time investing in programming.I spent a lot of time looking at hard things without having a foundation nor specialization, and I struggle to be practical in getting things done, how to break down projects, how to learn things.I am trying to be consistent with Python projects for data science roles, but I think I choose things too big in scope and I end up really lost on how to build out a project on my own. For example, I am trying to build a Python CLI that uses models I downloaded for inference. I have written out the processing logic for predictions on paper, but I get lost in managing multiple python files, how to organize my functions, how to choose the structure of my data, how to handle the logic for the inference pipeline. I have trouble not jumping around everywhere between my files, and I guess I read more Python than I write it myself. **I feel like I spend weeks just reading and never doing anything. I am good at concepts, but not writing the code.** I am trying to go for \"data science\" roles, but I only sometimes worked in Jupyter notebooks using sci-kit learn models or implemented the math for some algorithm in a singular python file. I am a little lost on whats the best way to get better programming for data science. What is the best thing I can do to maximize my chance of getting a job at this moment and learn to be more practical?",

        "content": "I think that one of my biggest intellectual weaknesses is constructing a more complex chain of logic while at the same time remembering what has already been constructed and how they work together.While other areas have improved noticeably, such as the ability to break down problems into their smallest components or remember how the syntax works (using c++ BTW), I'm not sure my brain's \"multi-threading\" ability is improving significantly. Practically this means that even after coming up with the solution and battle plan, as soon as I get coding with a bunch of variables that need a class type from here with an instance from there calling something from another place, even trying to stay organized I can feel the spinning plates of data in my head get out of hand. My workaround is to comment the hell out of everything, for example \"// 'r' now contains a pointer to 'rects\\_' from rect\\_packer which has x, y, h, w, etc. data\" because even though it's so obvious at the time when I come back to it in a couple hours or a couple days I have to click through all the files again just to re-understand what is doing what. I've also thought perhaps I'm being to \"greedy\" with keeping stuff smooth in my head; afterall that's why we write stuff down so we don't have to be amazing at recall. To hopefully improve this ability I'm working on the Trachtenberg method and doing 3x3 digit multiplication which seriously over clocks my mental CPU but I can manage, however I'm not sure if there is something better I can do to improve the \"concurrent logic buffer\" size in my head.",

For that, I need to design a collection system that reliably gathers publicly available thread metadata from Reddit (titles, timestamps, comment counts, etc.) without breaking any API rules or putting load on the infrastructure.I’ve tried two approaches so far. First, the official Reddit API, but my application wasn’t approved. Second, I tried using a scraping service, but that returned consistent HTTP 403 errors, which I assume are anti-bot protections.Before I build the full system, I want to choose the right engineering approach. My constraints are long-term stability, strict rate limiting, predictable failure behavior, and minimal load on external services. Nothing related to bypassing anything; I just want a clean and reliable pipeline.The options I'm evaluating are: building a pipeline around the .json endpoints with strict rate limiting and retry logic, using something like Apify to handle scheduling and backoff, or creating a hybrid setup that treats external data sources as unreliable and focuses on resilient architecture, caching, and backpressure.From an engineering point of view, which approach tends to produce the most maintainable and fault-tolerant system for long-term public-data collection?I’m not trying to gather private info or circumvent restrictions. This is strictly a systems-design question about building a predictable, well-behaved pipeline. Any advice from engineers who have built similar systems would help a lot.",

It's my first full time job and I'm wondering why the fuck everyone pretends like they're working as if there's like a set timer that once it reaches past 5pm suddenly unlocks and allows them to leave these people literally aren't working half of the day. They're either just not at their desk (taking like their 6th walk of the day, grabbing a snack, coffee, etc), or chatting with the people around them, or doing something else on their computer. It's just a huge waste of time, why don't we just work for 4-6 hours then leave? I would think that other software engineers would understand that's it's literally just not possible to code/work efficiently for 8+ hours, but no. I get 85% of my work done between 9am - 1pm, im sure the majority of these people are like that. I just cant for the life of me understand why they don't just leave? Like you're not doing anything anyways? What if I just start leaving at 3-4pm everyday? Would it be a bad look? I guarantee I can work 4 hours, and get just as much (if not more) work done than these people working until fucking 530PMI was thinking of talking to my manager about this, but not sure.

        "content": "Background: Mid 2022 bootcamp grad. Got a job as a mostly frontend developer for 65k. Was there for \\~1.5 years, after our big project, they laid off about 1/4 of the company.Just had an 8 round interview process, I thought there wasn't a chance. Got the call, they said it was an easy decision for them and I signed the offer for 115k today. I'm over the moon.So what worked / didn't workApplying:Had 3 referrals, none turned into interviews. I think the value of referrals have gone down dramatically in the last couple of years and that a lot of companies stopped giving referral bonusesI didn't get a single entry / jr level interview. I think the no cs degree hurt for those roles, so many say 1-2 YoE so I thought I was a shoo-in, nahMy success rate fell sharply after 6 months unemployment. Success rate improved dramatically (only for mobile positions) after publishing a personal project (this was about a year into unemployment, I had a single interview in months 6-12 and it didn't go past hiring manager)No interviews from linkedIn job apps, despite targeting same day postingsgot 2 interviews from hiringcafe and an ai auto fill extension (simplify)I went in-person and dropped off a resume to two local companies that I saw had openings. One gave me an interview (50% success rate, you were right Grandpa)The mobile position I got, came from linkedIn. I stumbled across the tech lead of a local company posting about the opening, there was no linkedIn job posting. I messaged him about my app and he said he tried it out, liked it and wanted to interview me.I think the other 2 or 3 came from hackernews, again, where I was talking directly to somebody technical about my app.I tried linkedin premium and messaged a ton of hiring managers / recruiters, nothing came from thoseI had 6 or 7 interviews in the last year and a half, all above my last role. Was definitely unprepared for the first few, feel I went from jr. to mid level while unemployed.But yeah, highest success rate was finding local companies and contacting somebody who was technical (and part of the hiring process) about what I was working on Technical Interviews: I was grinding leetcode for a bit but found it not to be worth while (past getting comfortable with mapping and array, obj, string manipulation). I did have some coding challenges but they weren't leetcode mediums or hards, either can you fetch data, format / display / style it or a leetcode easy to see if you can code (though I didn't interview at major companies). I did have two system designs interviews earlier on that I wasn't prepared for. And one later on that I knew was coming and spent a week cramming for. Did really well in that and moved to final round but didn't get job. My recent interview didn't have a strictly system design round but a lot of topics I had studied did come up in conversation and I'm glad I was able to talk on themAnother thing that was a huge help was I was MUCH less stressed about the recent interview. I thought I wasn't going to get it, was working as a bartender so had money coming in, might as well see where it goes and try to learn something. Most of the interviews I had when I was deep into unemployment, I would get 2-4 hours of sleep the night before because I was so stressed. Somehow, the night before this company's technical, I had planned on doing leetcode all night but I was strangely tired, thought I wasn't going to get the job anyways and didn't want to waste my night off doing coding problems. I ended up conking out hard way earlier than I typically go to bed and had the best nights rest I've had in two years. I truly don't know how it aligned that way but being well rested was way more valuable than a couple more leetcode problemsBehavioral interviews:The 3 companies I interviewed with - post releasing my app - were much more interested in my app than my previous role. They were all for mobile positions.I also started keeping an interview prep journal that had 6 star stories (and what questions they could be used in) as well as all other questions I've been asked in interviews (and had a separate tab for system design notes)I would often get a \"how's your week going\" question at the start of interviews. Early into unemployment, I thought, 'I don't want to waste their time', and just say something like, 'It's been a good week, have been looking forward to this interview.' and let them jump into it from there. After it happened a few times I realize they want to see if they can have an actual, casual conversation with you. So in these last few interviews, I always made a point to spend literally a minute, 2 max, chatting. Just something like an event that weekend I was excited for. The recent interview the guy had mentioned having a kid, the next interview I asked what his kid was dressing as for HalloweenThe other thing that was a big help was the CEO really liked me. I really didn't understand the company's industry, so I spent a couple of hours with ai learning about it, making sure I knew some basic terminology, read articles about the company, and had actual, non fluff questions, about the company and the industry for the CEO. In the middle he mentioned being surprised by the questions65k -> \\~27/hour -> 115k Again, absolutely over the moon. Very excited, will be working hard to make sure I continue to grow and never go through such a grueling unemployment periodTl;dr Try talking to technical people directly. Look local. Have some system design knowledge. Build something with users. Be well rested and sociable. Be able to talk about the company, past being a developer. Good luck to those searching and be easy on yourself, it's hard out there.",

Companies are slapping the FDE title on sales engineering work because it sounds cooler and attracts better candidates.How do you tell if it’s fake? Look for quota, OTE, or commission structures - that’s sales, not engineering. Check if the role reports to Sales/GTM instead of Engineering. If responsibilities focus on demos and deal closure rather than production deployments, or you hand things off after the contract signs, it’s not real FDE work.In short, read the job description, dont just base everything off the job title.",

I live in a MCOL city.The company I work for is great in terms of work life balance, it is 5 days in the office with on call rotation, but we do have 6 weeks PTO and another 1 week of sick days. We also surprisingly don’t do layoffs, we’ve never had layoffs even when oil hit negative during covid.I currently have 4 years of experience in software and before that I was an electrical engineer with 4 years of experience. I’ve been with this company for almost 4 years now.Right now I’m currently a Senior within the company but probably out in the market I’d be considered a mid level. I’m working my way up in the company pretty quick and I have a good relationship with my manager. I believe within 3 years I’ll be at a manger role with my TC somewhere around $350k.In terms of the work I do, it’s a variety of backend work from API development, to ETL’s, managing database schemas/SP’s, and working with real time data. The tech stack on the backend is mostly Python with a little bit of .NET, I’ll be dabbling in GO soon as well for our realtime data calculations from RMQ. On the database side I’ve pretty much worked with every sql/nosql database you can think of. I’ve been thinking about my long term career growth. I’ve seen posts about people making 500k - 1m TC and would like to work towards that. I’m absolute dogshit at LC, however at work I’m able to architect out solutions for new projects and solve issues quickly. I would say I still have room to grow here, I’m still learning new things and have the freedom to introduce new technologies. Wondering what I need to do to prepare for that next big jump? And how’s my career here so far?",

I'm making 200k, I have health insurance, my boss is nice, and yet still I may have just completely fucked it up.Basically, here's the situation: I'm on a small team with just me and my boss. We use an in-house office software with a built-in chat and email, but 99% of the time we just use the chat or talk face-to-face.However, the office software sucks. If you don't use it for an hour, it disconnects without any notification. While you're disconnected, chat messages get sent to email, and don't display in chat when you log back on. The home page displays new email notifications, but only some of them, not all of them. I thought it only filtered automated messages, but I was VERY wrong.This week my boss was on a business trip. He was still working in my timezone though so we could talk. I was waiting for some details in the chat, but either I was logged off or he just emailed it directly. Either way, no notification.The day after he sent it, I had a day off I scheduled in advance. While I was out, he forgot I had off and sent me an email. Same thing, no notification.Two days later, I got a message from him. While he'd remembered I had a day off, he was still extremely pissed that I hadn't seen his emails. He said it was the bare minimum act of communicationAdmittedly, it feels like he'd be right at most other companies, but we'd always used other means of communication. Before he left, he even gave me his phone number saying it's how I should contact him if he wasn't online to recieve chat messages, completely overlooking the email.Regardless, my contract is supposed to be renewed soon, and now I'm worried it won't be. I'm not sure what to do to hopefully avoid being shitcanned.",

I was tested on designing UI's for semiconductor (switches, data center etc) data visualization, as well as javascript fundamentals. I initially asked, wouldn't you want a graphic designer since bulk of the work is UI/UX design? but they said no, they could never understand the technicals of FE dev nor EE. they wanted someone who knew UI/UX design, FE, AND EE. So i was a unique fit for the role.Stats:\\-280k TC\\-High level role with mostly design + telling other devs what to create, less coding\\-5 days a week, 30mi commute (45m no traffic, 1.5hr traffic), absolute killer. + Occasional travel overseas to india.**UPDATE** 4 days a week, 30mi commute 10AM-2:30PM, avoids traffic, 45mins. On call for overseas folks 8-10PM.\\-highly rated on glassdoor, low layoffs compared to peers\\-incredibly smart EE folks with buncha guys PhD from MIT in Physics, cutting edge tech\\-I studied EE in college but pivoted to FE dev and now this is almost going back to my roots.\\----I have an potential incoming offer with a well known Streaming company (not Netflix), traditional Senior Front End SWE.

        "content": "Just in case this would be useful to anyone as a datapoint...**About me:**- US Citizen- Graduated in 2022 from an average state school you may or may not have heard of - 3 YOE at the time of job hunting, all at one SaaS company in SF (+ 2 internships) - Full time experience was all backend development, and I did lead a larger project at my last company so I used that as a talking point in interviews - Located in San Francisco, looked to the entire Bay Area for my search. Wasn't open to relocation outside the Bay but that didn't seem to matter thanks to the AI boom... **Gearing up:**Total time from interview prep to first offer: 3 months (beginning of May 2025 to end of July 2025)Resources used: Paid for neetcode and the design gurus grokking system design course, and studied them meticulously. Already had LC premium and used that for specific companies. Didn't really do mock interviews because I was an interviewer myself at my last company and already had a ton of practice being on the other side of the table. **Applications & Interviews:**NOTE: All numbers are approximate and may be off by 5 or less, especially for interview counts. I didn't meticulously track everything. Number of applications: ~250 sent by me. However, I also got reached out to a lot and pretty much all of my interviews came from recruiters coming to me first, so I can't create a reliable Sankey diagram! I only used 2 referrals from my network and got ghosted by those companies anyway. Mostly targeted full stack roles at mid-late stage startups (Series C+), with the occasional big tech interview if they reached out to me first. Had 35 recruiter screens -> 32 first round interviews -> 14 second round+ interviews. Many of the first rounds were during my first few weeks studying, I used them to get my feet wet and didn't stress too hard over rejections. 14 second+ turned into 2 offers, 5 rejections, and I canceled 5 final rounds & 2 first rounds myself after signing. I had ~100 individual interview blocks total, according to my calendar. (not 100 companies, 100 interviews). **The offer I took:**- Series D unicorn healthcare startup, fully remote in SF Bay Area (with the option to go into the office whenever I want, or not.) Big upgrade over my previous hybrid job!! - Mid level / level below senior - $195,000 base salary ($20k raise over previous job), and some ISOs that I don't consider real money. - Full pivot into full stack from my previous 100% backend role(The other offer was $200,000, upleveled from junior to midlevel and hybrid in SF, but it was SaaS and I was tired of SaaS, plus they told me some stuff about the future direction of the company that I didn't quite like.)**Insights & Tips**1. I got asked a lot less Leetcode and a lot more \"practical\" coding, like writing API endpoints, parsing JSONs, and even writing basic websites from end to end.2. Around 3-4 interviewers encouraged AI use during the coding interviews. 3. LinkedIn pushes recently updated profiles to the top of recruiter searches, so every Sunday I would log in and make some minor change to my profile like adding a period, changing a word, etc. Then I would wake up on Monday with a full inbox. 4. I went back and replied to all the recruiters and startup founders that had emailed me in the past 6 months. Some were still hiring, others weren't. One very kind startup CEO still chatted with me for 30 minutes and offered to pass my resume on to his founder friends, nothing came of it but he gave me good advice anyway. 5. I interviewed on top of my day job by doing interviews 8-10 am, working 10-5, and then interviewing again 5-6. I didn't take a single \"sick day\" which I'm super proud of lol. Companies with an East coast presence were open to interviewing me as early as 7 am.6. As for how I pivoted to full stack with little to no frontend experience, YOLO I guess? The project I led had a small amount of frontend, and when I had fullstack interviews I did React crash courses and followed along. I got to the point where I knew what to look up for frontend, because most interviewers let you Google stuff on the spot if you look like you know what you're talking about, and just need to double check something etc.",

I’m mid-level, a few years in, mostly doing cloud/infra.Now I’m looking at a public sector (state) IT job that pays about 65k. The pay cut is huge, but it seems way more stable, good hours, and good benefits. The tradeoff is it’s probably slower pace and not cutting edge.What I’m stressed about:•If I take 65k after making 129k, am I shooting myself in the foot long term?•Is it actually realistic to go back to higher-paying private roles later ?•For those who went public sector: did your skills keep growing, or did you feel like you stalled out?If you’ve gone from private → public (or back), how did it affect your career, pay, and stress?In my situation, would you take the 65k for stability, or keep holding out for something closer to what I was making before?",

I have to keep thinking about whether or not I will like a job while applying so I know I am applying to jobs I want, but man it sucks never actually getting to see any of it through.The worst is when you go through interviews. In my experience they usually are not very truthful, they'll give you praise throughout the interview, drag you along through multiple rounds, over a month of interviews. Then right when you feel like you have a chance, poof, ghosted. This has happened to me many times.I just don't know how much longer I can go through this process of interviewing with a company for a month or more just to be ghosted. Hell, I haven't had a company formally decline me after going through multiple rounds of interviews in YEARS. They all just ghost me now.I just want to get my life back, man.",

I can put a ton of effort into troubleshooting some failure and fix it, just to get grilled in a meeting on the one little detail that I missed. I can work hard on a project just to get asked by my manager why it isn't done yet.Speaking of my manager, he is an anxious basket case who will randomly walk up during the day and ask me to drop everything that I'm doing to work on something \"urgent\". After finishing the \"urgent\" task, he'll ask me about the work that got postponed and why it's behind schedule. To make it even worse, he'll do it in the most condescending way, asking if I \"need help\", or trying to reassign my work to others. No, I don't need help. I need you to leave me alone so that I can do my work that I was already planning to do.As for the work itself? Very rarely do I get to build or design something interesting. The majority of the time, I'm digging through the shitheap trying to figure out what this service with 20k lines of code and no comments does. Or reading through internal documents that were written by someone with a 3rd grade vocabulary and not updated for the past decade.Very rarely do I heard any kind of positive feedback. Most often it is criticism. You could've done this faster. If I do it faster, it could've been cleaner. This despite the fact that our codebase is filled with garbage code that I had to dig through to get what we have today.I also don't really feel like I'm learning valuable skills. I spend maybe 15% of my time *actually writing code.* The rest of my time is spent digging throug garbage trying to figure out why nothing works.I don't know how to end this post, so here's a link to an article about bananas.

I’ve only been working there for a month and was in the same place as all of these people so I try and help as much as I can, but so many of the messages I’ve been getting are terrible. Here’s what I’ve identified to hopefully help some people improve their chance at getting a referral.Don’t say stuff like:“Hey cristinon, I’m really impressed by Company and would love to hear about how your team operates day-to-day. Could we chat sometime?”Super vague, unclear what you want. Ask a specific question if you are genuinely interested.“I’m curious how your team uses Tech and Tech in production, would love any insights you can share!”Again vague and I can’t tell you these specifics.“I’m very interested in the engineering culture at Company, could you tell me more?”The worst one this must be some kind of template because I get it so much. What am I supposed to tell you? Ask a specific question.“I’m exploring opportunities in software engineering at Company, are there any roles I could apply for?”Look on the careers page, some people even say this after mentioning they have applied to a certain job. I don’t work in HR idk.“Could you let me know if your team is hiring?”Again, idk ask HR or look on the website.“I will send you my résumé, please review it and let me know whenever you’re free.”I’ve gotten this word for word. I’m not your boss, or the hiring manager. Sounds too commanding.“I’ve heard great things about your team and Company, and I’d love to know how you got started there.”I applied just like you are, idk what I am supposed to say. Very vague.“Would love to hop on a 15-minute Zoom to hear about your experience.”Type whatever question you have I don’t have time for calls. It’s not my job to hire people.The fix for all of these is to directly ask a specific question. Make it easy for the person to reply and be nice and that’s all it takes.If any of these people had just asked something specific like “Can I get a referral?” I would have gladly tried to help. Instead I don’t know how to even reply so I don’t.TLDR:- keep your message short (few sentences)- be nice- don’t ask for calls- ask something easy to answer- be specific- understand what position the person you are messaging has- don’t give tons of vague compliments- don’t be overly formal",

They also claimed they would payout my unvested RSU's (which I'd probably have at least 100k worth with amazon).I'm thinking of just high-balling and asking for 250k. It sounded like they wanted me, so I figured worst case they'd either rescind (which means I'd need to gamble surviving layoffs in January), or they'd counter offer.

Software/Web Dev here, 8 YOE.Long story short, I got blessed with good fortune and just landed in a company that provides generous benefits, including one where they will pay for any post-secondary education I pursue... as long as it's part-time (I have to continue working there while I pursue the degree).Thing is, I'm not sure what I should pursue to make it worthwhile. Seems like with Comp Sci careers you can advance perfectly fine without any post-secondary education. Would a part-time MBA actually move the needle for a software developer? Or a master’s in computer science? I don’t want to let this benefit go to waste, but time is a limited resource too, and I don’t want to sink a few years into something that barely impacts my career.FWIW I also am a boot camp grad, and with the decline in reputation of coding boot camps lately, I do wonder if it'll be worth it getting a \"legit\" comp sci degree to strengthen my credentials and protect my career prospects long-term.Would love to hear your thoughts, thanks in advance!\\------**EDIT**: just to provide some additional context -> The company I worked at prior to this one was quite established. Not FAANG, but a major bank. My resume has some interesting projects. I'm not exactly drowning in recruiter linkedin messages everyday, but I also don’t have trouble landing interviews. Given that, would getting a formal CS degree still be worth it to “solidify” my legitimacy, or is it unnecessary at this point?**EDIT 2:** Something I mentioned in a reply that I’d like to hear more perspectives on:with AI making it easier for people to fake experience or inflate resumes, do you think companies might start relying more on formal degrees again as a credibility filter? It’s something that honestly gives me a bit of anxiety, since I came up through a bootcamp route.",

        "content": "No question, just sharing and discussing my experience with the UK job market.So, I graduated with a masters in mathematics in early 2020, and got my first offer for a developer job just under 2 years later at the end of 2021 on a 20k salary. I left after a year because it was shit.- They had unreasonable expectations. My first task assigned on day 2 was to independently build an entire data analysis and prediction system from scratch. Literally just \"here's all the data we have, we want to do XYZ, go and figure it out and make it work, and have it ready in 3 months\" and no other guidance or requirements- It was highly stressful with bad WLB. Unpaid overtime was expected of everyone regularly, and people were asking and answering questions late into the evening most days, and on most weekends- They had a horrible open office environment with music playing in the background, people constantly talking about non-work-related things, people regularly shouting information from one side of the room to the other, and a table of customer support right in front of me taking phone calls all day- Mandatory 9-5 in office 5 days a week, no exceptions. A day out of the office for any reason is a day's pay deducted from your salary- Near-minimum wage salaryAfter I left (and before I left), I started applying for more jobs, expecting that it wouldn't take too long to find a new job, since my new CV was much much better than my old one.Anyway, long story short, after 3 years of applying to jobs (mostly software dev but not entirely), I had a total of zero offers.More recently, I decided that since I quite like driving, I'd start looking at driving jobs. HGV driving seems like something I'd like, but the training and licensing costs thousands so there's no way I can afford it. I also started looking at delivery driving, and here are the results of my job search.Software dev (approximate numbers): https://i.imgur.com/bYlxdC4.pngDelivery driving: https://i.imgur.com/VVUppoQ.pngSo... a slightly different experience. I applied, got a response the next day asking to confirm that yes, I can actually drive, and then had a call to arrange my start date where I would begin training. No CV needed to apply, no experience needed, no references needed, no interviews, and no other questions. Just \"can you drive\" and \"when can you start\". Oh and it pays 50% more than my 2022 software dev job.I now see that this is what it looks like for a job to be in demand. If tech was in demand, you'd apply, prove that you can write basic code, and then get an offer. And yet, somehow, people STILL think that tech is in high demand and there is a shortage of developers.",

I currently have \\~4 YOE and am a US citizen (I know this helps when evaluating risk)1. **Work** \\- Both companies have what I think are interesting work. I put embedded-specific details here for those are interested, but they both feel equally cool - [Embedded Software vs Board Support Package : r/embedded](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1p44co2/embedded_software_vs_board_support_package/). Meta would be more high-level / specific product work while Qualcomm is a more general role where the work will touch many of their products across their portfolio. This makes me wonder if working on a niche application like AR glasses would be better/worse for long-term career development2. **Location** \\- Meta would have to be in Sunnyvale while Qualcomm is in San Diego. I currently live in SoCal so I would have a preference to stay here, but I can't deny that there seem to be more opportunities in NorCal. Nonetheless taking Meta would require moving / establishing things in a new location3. **Culture** \\- I've been hearing bad things about Meta / Reality Labs, but I'm not sure how true they are since I've been relying on anecdotes from Blind (which is admittedly a negative community). I'm sure Qualcomm has its own pitfalls (e.g. offshoring), but I haven't heard of anything to the severity of Meta's current reputation with stacked ranking and PIPs4. **Compensation** \\- Both roles are pretty accurate to their grades on levels.fyi. Qualcomm would be a senior engineer role in San Diego while Meta would be E4 role in SunnyvaleAny advice would be appreciated. I know having the brand name of Meta on a resume does wonders for a career, but I want to make sure I have as complete of a picture as I can.Edit: since there was some interest in the comments:* Meta (Sunnyvale) - 193k + 100k RSU/year + 35k sign on* Qualcomm (San Diego) - 147k + 43k RSU/year + 35k sign on",

        "content": "Context: I am a software engineer working at a company that was recently acquired. Currently make 135k. My current company is being merged into a larger parent company and there were some recent layoffs. Management has signaled these will not be the last, and there will be more next year after a 'discovery' phase where they figure out what can be integrated into the parent company's existing software and what cant. Sometime after that (undisclosed time), there will be an RTO to a different city (I am currently WFH). We are currently mostly working on documentation + support work instead of new features. This has resulted in me going on a job hunt.I have three options:Offer 1: 165k base salary, 15 days of PTO (WFH). Working on a recently started project modernizing a legacy system (like, lots of logic in stored procedures style legacy) to python / AWS, immediate team and manager seem really nice. \\~20 engineers total in the tech department.Offer 1 Cons: Company has been owned by private equity for the past 7 years, has 2.7 stars on Glassdoor, mentioning lack of raises, leadership shifting priorities, and layoffs / reorgs, position was a backfill.Offer 2: 145k base salary, 30k equity in company, unlimited PTO (Mostly WFH, in office \\~2 times per month). Management seems fun (like, trips to Cancun type stuff), really interesting and exciting IoT style work with golang. Company was a Series A startup a few years ago, but is rapidly growing now with lots of customers and doesn't need funding anymore.Offer 2 Cons: It would just be me and 1 other engineer who is on a contract (my position would be full time) and may or may not convert to full time. The tech side of the company just started and is still a very 'early startup' environment, so I would have to juggle Project Manager + Software Engineer responsibilities. Could be fun, could also be super stressful, especially if the other engineer who seems like would be 'firewall' for the rest of the business leaves after his contract was up.Option 3. Take neither offer and stay at my current company and keep looking and hope i dont get laid off before i find something better. I have been getting a consistent amount of interviews each month. Seems like the laid off employees at my current company got 2 months severance at least...What are y'all's thoughts?",

        "author": "NigoDuppy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I’m trying to figure out when a salary increase actually justifies giving up a very comfortable setup. I officially have a 5-day/week job, but because my manager and I work remotely and are in different countries with different weekends, I’ve effectively been working 4 days a week for the last 1.5 years with a 3-day weekend. The work is simple, mostly Power BI dashboards and Power Automate flows for upper management, with nothing deeply technical or challenging. The problem is that the job is *too* comfortable. I’m not learning much, and I worry that future cost-cutting (I work in corporate) or AI could replace me since the work is so basic.Because I essentially work 4 days (32 hrs/week), my hourly rate is higher than it would be in a typical 5-day (40 hrs/week) job. For example, if I took a job with a 50% salary increase for a 5-day schedule, it would end up being only about a 20% increase in hourly pay after adjusting for the extra day and hours I would work. So I’m stuck asking myself if a 20–25% hourly increase really worth giving up a 4-day WFH lifestyle?I’m a CS graduate, but I ended up in this role because the job posting was labeled as Software Engineer. It turns out the only real engineering work was rewriting a legacy system using the Power Platform. After that, it turned into pure dashboards and Power Automate flows on the business side because my manager believed upper management liked fancy, colorful reports that were tangible and made their lives easier.Before this job, I was studying AWS, Terraform Linux, and getting into Kubernetes, but I haven’t touched any of that in a year, and I feel like I’m falling behind. If I stay in comfort, I risk stagnating, but at the same time I don’t really know where I can go from here, or what percentage increase in salary or hourly rate is worth leaving this job. Also, my company is a large corporate, and one of my goals is to work abroad. I checked their internal positions offering relocation, and almost all of them are either pure engineering or management roles. I don’t think it’s realistic for me to apply to any of these in my current position unless I sharpen my engineering skills, as management is still a pipe dream given that I’m still junior with only about 2 years of total experience.So essentially my questions boil down to:1. What kind of pay increase would make you give up a 4-day WFH job? Is 20% hourly increase enough? That’s already roughly a 50% increase in total salary.2. Should I pivot to a technical path like cloud infra/DevOps, which I plan to study over the next 6 months, or is there a well-paid path using my current skills? Would transitioning to data engineering instead be a better? Is it realistic in that timeframe?",

        "content": "**TLDR**: Basically the title. My manager will not promote me even if I do already the job, and I could apply to the position I want but in US, same company, north of Baltimore through a L-1B visa. My manager will be against it as he needs me on his current project.My possible futures now are to stay and stagnate, stay and get replaced/fired, apply abroad and get accepted/refused/fired. I have a wife and a young kid which makes the move even harder.**Now the long version :**Living in QC, 35+, Canada, I was hired as a senior developper in embedded field at the beginning of the pandemic, I worked quite hard with great reviews every year and I am the most senior member in my team now.I worked for the last two years on our department flagship product almost alone, partnering closely with the hardware engineer who provided our product, I did all the schematics review, system design and firmware, board bring-up, demos, development framework for other teams etc, and for a few months now I am listing and documenting the tasks left for the new members of my team since I got the big picture.My manager told me more or less this week that the role I wish I could get, Technical Lead or Embedded Software Architect, would not be available soon, maybe not in years, and not in our workplace in Canada. I have a colleague that got recently promoted to manager position for another team, but I want to remain close to the hardware and the products. It has been a few weeks that interviews are being conducted for a Team Lead or manager for my own team, which is not pleasant and feels like a betrayal as this person will very likely override any technical decision I make for the products, making me going back to a simple developper. Funny anecdote, I was hired with two others to replace a senior that did not know it yet...Since I don't have a tech lead or architect title, some colleagues dispute my decisions (even if I got the support of several directors on the software design) while they know nothing of the product or the framework (yocto), and those conflicts regularly end up at the director office since I have the same title (and so same authority) as them. I feel that they are happy to have me do several jobs and overtime with a smaller title and pay grade, this was the case for several developers when I moved there years ago, they were here for 20 to 30 years with no change in position or title during that time. I believe this will be the same if I don't have leverage for a higher position.**Now the interesting part :**The company is huge (100k+ employees) and posted an offer for a job of Design Lead (the description is exactly what I do, minus one thing, 2 years as task giver), this would be based in US (on site) above Baltimore, at the border of Pennsylvania. The offer has been reposted recently, so I suspect they struggle to find someone.The local HR I contacted told me that they do L-1B visas, so that would be great for my wife that has a remote job, our kid could go to kindergarten. I meet all the conditions to apply in another location (years in position and good standing/no bad reviews), I need also to notify my manager. The salary in US would be around 30-50% more than I do in Canada, and converted to US dollars, which make for a big change since here the taxes are the highest of North America.Would that move be wise ? I don't want to remain in my position forever, but also as a father I don't like the idea to make my manager upset and get fired, or get a job that will not keep me, or apply, get rejected, and then be on the list for the next layoffs.",

I've applied what I've learned to my job, creating easy to read dashboards for various metrics and automating many of my data cleaning tasks with Python. When I talked to my cousin who works in tech about the feasibility of switching careers into something like Data Analyst or Business Analyst, he told me \"to be completely honest, your resume won't get looked at without a related degree.\" He told me that the stuff I learned is \"easily replaceable with A.I\" and that I need to get way more technical and learn Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, or a very specific technical field along with a degree in order to have a chance at switching industries.I was disheartened to hear this, but if he's telling the truth, I don't want to waste my time self-learning if it's not going to lead to a job. I didn't want to go back to school given the extensive time and money commitment it would be, but if it's the only chance I have to find a higher-paying job, I can bite the bullet. Was my cousin telling me the truth? Is self-learning a waste of time if I don't intend on getting a degree to back it up?",

        "content": "I started as a new grad at Amazon back in mid-July and am still there. But I’m honestly feeling really worried about my performance. My manager never addressed any particular issues with my performance when we met 1:1 a few months ago (we never had a 1:1 since), but I was still worried. For every task I’ve been given so far, there’s a point where I don’t know what to do after I try figuring out myself and have to ask for help. I have been asked to give ETAs fore and can my very loose estimations were always less than how long it actually took to finish tasks since I barely know what I’m doing. There had also been an instance where I messed up the deployment for some of my changes, and my teammates had to help me rollback. One of the tasks I had been working on were supposed to be finished before this past week, but I couldn’t since the changes were more involved than I initially realized because of differences in the service between non-prod and prod (whereas it worked in non-prod where I had been testing prior). Teammates also had to step in again for that. I’ll even try reading through docs our team has to try to get a better sense of things, just for things to still not click. I know I’m supposed to properly ramp myself up within 2 more months, and I’m worried that I won’t be able to. There was a new task I was working on today, and once again, I got stuck on it and don’t know what to do. I was really hoping to make some progress during the weekend so I can finish it ASAP, but…I guess that isn’t happening anymore.At this point, I feel like I should probably cut my losses and focus more energy on getting a new position since people are saying that there’s another layoff in January, and I heard that my organization was going to be impacted. I don’t have any other ground of suspicion of getting laid off, but another intern I knew had gotten laid off during the first wave when he started a few months before me, and I’m one of the least experienced people on my team. Either that, or I’m guessing getting PIP’d. I was wondering if anyone happened to have any advice for what to do.",

Has the role name in the offer and everything, but was placed on the QA Automation team. At first, I did not know much, except that it's not liked, so I gave it a couple weeks, got some tasks, and I realized that I don't like this work at all, it isn't fufilling and I miss development work. I tell this information to my boss, about how the role is misleading and how I want to switch and be given tasks, and if it's possible to switch and they said it can happen, but it takes time and that someone did that after working in qa for a couple years. So, this isn't a good situation for me, I don't want to be stuck doing this work forever, then struggle later getting a dev job. Even hearing the word QA is becoming a trigger word for me, because there's that seperation between being qa and being a dev, and I am not considered a dev. It sucks knowing that after 4 years of grinding CS work, and doing full-stack projects, that you spend your time running tests and trying to find bugs, but don't get to fix them. Since i only worked here 2-3 months now, should I include this in my resume when I am applying, or pretend it dosen't exist and just apply without it? Also has many people had this issue happen to them? I know it's not the end of the world, but it makes me anxious knowing each day longer I am here, the more I feel like I am settling and i can do better. So I decided to just bite the bullet and start back on applying, but I just want to know whats the best thing for me to do. Thanks for reading.",

No positive response in weeks and it's getting close to the point where my parents are going to force me into some random dead end job for the rest of my life. (I don't count the random calls out of nowhere as they're either scam job training or they hang up after realizing I don't have years of experience). I have no confidence I'll ever be able to get out of jobs like that (if I'm working full time in some random back breaking job I won't have time or energy to interview or do anything else, and upward mobility doesn't exist, and once recruiters see my resume with a dead end job on top they will reject immediately because a guy with actual skills wouldn't be forced into a job like that). I'm also not physically strong or sociable so jobs like that would probably kill me after years in them. And it would mentally destroy me too, what's the point of trying at all in school or in general if I can only get a useless dead end job?I feel so useless, I know I should be spending every day applying to 100+ places and doing useful projects but I'm not very motivated to? I've actively tried to force myself into it, deleting video games off my computer and archiving the folders for most of my useless projects but I kind of relapsed and did more work in those, but I should know those projects are going to absolutely nothing for me useful. I need someone to push me around so I can finally delete them and move onto something that will actually help me. They have no impressive metrics so there is nothing to put in resume bullet points. No recruiter is going to be impressed by an ugly indie rpg prototype or a garbage chess engine that's 100x slower than the stuff you can already get out there. And neither of those projects have a massive CI/CD pipeline or use expensive cloud servers or use Docker or whatever else is on the long list of technologies that are mandatory nowadaysI just don't know what to do? I need to get a good job at some point but it's feeling more and more impossible? This time of the year might be really bad for hiring also, but I feel like I can't wait months to get a job or else it looks like I'm unhireableResume wise it is pretty unimpressive but I'm losing motivation to try to make \"impressive\" things, I haven't been able to come up with any \"useful\" project ideas that justify me paying money for an enterprise level server for something (found somewhere that said that real projects have to use enterprise level things, free servers are for useless toy projects). I can't \"make something I'm interested in\" because the things I'm interested in are all useless, I need to only work on useful things which means I can't pick something that I like to work on, I have to only work on something that will help me and not just play all day. I don't feel like I'm skilled enough to make a project useful and impressive for a specific company since they have their own experienced developers, who am I to think that I can surpass all of them combined? (Plus even if I spent months on a project like that what's to say their recruiter just rejects me before even seeing the project, or the company just rejects me anyway because they flat out aren't hiring low experience people?)",

        "content": "I've been a professional software engineer for about 12 years now. A couple of those years were spent in sales engineering but otherwise I've been committing code on a daily basis. I wouldn't say I have ever loved it but I've always enjoyed it. I got into the game late -- I started learning to program a few months before my 30th birthday -- but I never felt at a disadvantage. I've been able to roll with the punches and learn new techs throughout my career.The last few years have been different. I've had a few bad experiences at companies, including one where the CEO was lying about the company's finances. They missed payroll for my first two pay periods, and after about 6 months I got laid off. Since then, I've struggled to stay motivated and find a job in my area (cloud with a focus on Kubernetes, working almost exclusively in Go).I know part of my struggle is the market, but I also know part of it is that the optimistic utopianism that dominated the industry in my early career seems to have given way to a much darker culture that is very extractive and impersonal, even soul crushing at times. I find it very hard to stay motivated in the current climate. It's possible that this is just a reflection of the job market tilting in favor of employers, since the utopianism and benevolent paternalism of companies always kinda felt like BS anyway. But I'm not sure.I know AI has something to do with it, but I don't understand it enough to know what's coming down the pike. I'm not worried about chat bots writing code so much as I'm worried that handcrafted software will be replaced by AI. I would like to embark on a new phase of learning and figure out a new direction for my career, but I'm really stuck. I don't know if this is just a temporary lull or if I need to find a different specialty, maybe one that's AI-based.Any technical or non-technical advice is welcome. I really just need to figure out a way forward.",

        "content": "I have a little over five years of experience at the same FAANG. I was promoted a few years ago and landed on a team with good WLB. In late 2023 that team was cut, but I managed to move internally and have been there since.That layoff pushed me to build my first startup between 2023 and 2025 while working full time. For a bootstrapped product it did well early on, but after 1.5 years and some unavoidable headwinds, I shut it down and we sold it for scraps. That experience made it clear how empty my FAANG job felt in comparison. Startup life was intense, exciting, and the complete opposite of cushy FAANG work.At the start of 2025, after shutting down the company, I tried to fill the void by interviewing aggressively, mostly at unicorns. I went through five full loops and 30+ rounds of leetcode and system design. I ended up with nothing, burned out, and unsure whether I even wanted the roles I was chasing.In the spring, a colleague asked me to help with their fintech startup after their CTO stepped away. I joined part time and have been with them for six months. It has been a great experience with 7k MAU, ~$15m in annual GMV, and we just raised. It feels like a natural step up from my first startup in terms of maturity and traction.My only concern is that all this fulfilling work I do on the side is essentially invisible. I cannot talk about much of it, and companies rarely care about it on a resume. Even my first startup’s early traction, $150k GMV in three months with 6k signups, never seemed to impress anyone - they don’t care or get it. Meanwhile, I feel stagnant in my FAANG job and I am not learning much, but the pay is hard to walk away from.Ultimately, I’m just tired of having two hands in two different pots all the time. I’m concerned about my career prospects. What do yall think?**TLDR:** Five years into FAANG, built one startup that I shut down, now part-time at a fintech that just raised $10m. FAANG job feels stagnant, startup work is fulfilling, but none of it is visible on a resume. Debating whether to go full time on the startup and worried about the career risk in general.",

I recently got a grad offer for a hedge fund/trading firm (keeping it not very specific), in the ballpark of £115-125K total comp - call them A. I have a return offer to a big tech-esque company, which is about £95-105k total comp - call them B.In the past, I'd have chosen A without too much thought. However, I really enjoyed my time with B (can't understate this enough), and I know the hours would be considerably better (at least 1h30m less than A, daily).B is also a much bigger name, and has a couple particularly deep strengths which could enable me to seriously upskill and pivot back to finance if I wanted to. TC grows steadily year-on-year; I think £150-160k TC by year 4.On the other hand, I suspect that As comp would grow similarly fast, and probably skews towards big bonuses in particularly good years. I also feel like it'd also set me up well to join a tier 1 firm (say Citadel, DE Shaw).Anyone been in a similar situation? If so, how would you weigh in on this? Would really appreciate any advice.",

        "content": "I’m in the UK and recently went through a negotiation that left me a bit confused about how to interpret everything.I applied for a role and originally put 80k as my expected salary. They came back with a verbal offer of 90k, which was already above what I wrote down.Since I had previously turned down another offer around 86k because the commute would have forced me to wake up extremely early, and I know similar roles sometimes land in the 90 to 100k range, I tried to negotiate. I mentioned that I had other pipelines in that range.HR told me they would run the numbers internally and get back to me. The next day they emailed saying they had some “exciting numbers approved” for my offer and wanted to discuss them. That wording made me think something might have changed.On the call they told me the offer was still 90k. The reason they gave was not that the band was capped, but that the hiring manager did not want to get into a bidding war. I asked whether 95k could be considered, especially because the bonus figures on levels. fyi do not match what they verbally mentioned. The written offer I have now received is still 90k. HR also said they would check in with me again in a couple of days to see how I feel about the offer.Now I am unsure what to think. I turned down the previous 86k offer for lifestyle reasons and I do like this new role more, but the negotiation process felt a bit odd and I am not fully sure whether I should accept.Has anyone experienced something similar? Is it normal for HR to phrase internal approvals so positively even when the number stays the same? And would you take the 90k in this situation?",

Maybe that's not a crime, but it felt unprofessional and rushed.2. **The hiring process suddenly changed.**They originally said there would be three stages: verbal English, technical interview, and then a written English test at the office. I only completed the first two, and they skipped the final step and moved me forward anyway.3. **The job description keeps shifting.**I started as *Software Engineer*. Then later they said I might be placed into front-end. Then they said they do front-end, DevOps, software engineering, etc. and **they** will decide which department I'm going into. They literally told me **\"you have no choice\".**4. **The salary dropped mid-process.**At the beginning, the pre-employment stage was supposed to pay **$262.14** (in local currency). Now they say it's **$196.61**. No explanation, just a new number.5. **The 5-month course is unclear.**They keep mentioning 5-month training period, but they haven't explained what exactly it includes, how it works, or what kind of guarantee (if any) there is afterward.6. **They want my passport, social card, and bank account details before showing a contract.**This is the part that really stresses me out. They're asking for sensitive info even though I haven't seen an offer letter, a contract, or anything in writing.Everything combined makes me unsure whether this is normal or a big red flag.I'd really appreciate advice from anyone who knows hiring practices or has dealt with similar programs.

You should read our [Resume FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_resumes) and implement any changes from that before you ask for more advice. Abide by the rules, don't be a jerk. **Note on anonomyizing your resume:** If you'd like your resume to remain anonymous, make sure you blank out or change all personally identifying information. Also be careful of using your own Google Docs account or DropBox account which can lead back to your personally identifying information. To make absolutely sure you're anonymous, we suggest posting on sites/accounts with no ties to you after thoroughly checking the contents of your resume. This thread is posted each **Tuesday and Saturday at midnight PST**.

        "content": "Hello everyone! What exactly is the best way to stand out for crypto companies? I started a mining pool when I was a kid, then got into a T5 CS school. Specifically went to this school because one of my profs was the author of an early blockchain textbook I read. I’ve been remote at Capital One for the last few years since I’ve graduated, and I’ve been looking to work in crypto. I would also be very excited to work on exchange infrastructure. I’ve been rejected at the few places I’ve applied. Not sure how much longer I can work on something that is not terribly interesting to me. I’ll likely start a company if the job market doesn’t permit me to move onto something more interesting.In the meantime, how can I improve my resume for crypto companies? Should I just put my mining pool project all the way from 2013 on the very top of my resume?",
