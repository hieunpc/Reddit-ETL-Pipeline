If you are worried about how a given tool works, you aren't doing data engineering. Engineering is so much more and tools are near the bottom of the list of things you need to worry about. The one thing this subreddit does tell me is that the Databricks marketing has earned their yearend bonus. The number of people using the name medallion architecture and the associated colors is off the hook. These design patterns have been used and well documented for over 30 years. Giving them a new name and a Databricks coat of paint doesn't change that. It does however cause confusion because there are people out there that think this is new.",

        "content": "I am a senior engineer, and although this has been discussed before, I experienced it again recently. I was asked to prepare a presentation for a panel with only two days’ notice. I spent the weekend preparing the slides, attended the final meeting, and presented to six people. The presentation went very well. However, a month later, I was informed by the recruiter that the hiring process had been paused. After that experience, I decided not to accept take-home assignments again.Unfortunately, I made the same mistake again recently. After a phone screening with fairly basic questions, I was given a take-home assignment. It was described as a prototype, expected to take only a few hours, with up to a week to complete. They also said it didn’t need to be fully finished, as long as I explained what I would do with more time.I was genuinely interested in the company, so I spent two full days working on it and submitted what I had. The feedback came back saying it wasn’t at the level they expected and that more work was needed, so they decided not to move forward. From the comments, it was clearly not a “few hours” task, it was closer to a full week of work and would require paid cloud resources. What is your opinion?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I was reading through Kimballs warehouse toolkit, and it gives this beautiful picture of a central collection of conformed dimensional models that represent the company as a whole. I love it, but it also feels so central that I can't imagine a modern ML practice surviving with it.I'm a data scientist, and when I think about a question like \"how could I incorporate the weather into my forecast?\" my gut is to schedule daily api requests and dump those as tables in some warehouse, followed by pushing a change to a dbt project to model the weather measurements with the rest of my features. The idea of needing to connect with a central team of architects to make sure we 'conform along the dimensional warehouse bus' just so I can study the weather feels ridiculous. Dataset curation and feature engineering would likely just die. On the flip side, once the platform needs to display both the dataset and the inferences to the client as a finished product, then of course the model would have to get conformed with the other data and be secure in production.On the other end of the extreme from Kimballs central design, I've seen mentions of companies opening up dbt models for all analysts to push using the staged datasets as sources. This looks like an equally big nightmare, with a hundred under-skilled math people pushing thousands of expensive models, many of which would achieve relatively the same thing with minor differences and numerous unchecked data quality problems, different interpretations of data, confusion on different representations from the different datasets, I can't imagine this being a good idea.In the middle, I've heard people mention the Mesh design of having different groups manages their warehouses. So analytics could set up its own warehouse for building ML features and a maybe a central team helps coordinate the different teams data models to be coherent. One difficulty that comes to mind is if a healthy fact table in one teams warehouse is desired for modeling and analysis by another team, spinning up a job to extract and load a healthy model from one warehouse to another is silly, and it also makes one groups operation quietly dependent on the other groups maintenance of that table.There seems to be a tug-of-war on the spectrum between agility and coherent governance. I truly don't know what the ideal state should look like for a company. To some extent, it could even be company specific. If you're too small to have a central data platform team, then could you even conceive of Kimballs design? I would really love to hear thoughts and experiences.",

I mention findability, which suggests a decent search engine is needed.I've done a lot of work on auto-documenting databases and code.

At some point , my boss decides he wants to “centralize the company data” and hires some agency out of the blue. They drafted up an outline of their plan, which involved setting up a separate database with a medallion architecture. They then requested that I show them how the APIs we’re pulling data from work, and a week later, they request that I help them pull the analytics from the existing db. they never acknowledged any of the solutions i provided for either of those things nor did they explain the Point of those 2 conflicting ideas. So I ask my boss about and he says that the plan is to “replace the entire existing database with the one they’re working on“. And the next time I hop on a call with them, what we discussed instead was just mirroring the analytics and any relevant data to the bronze layer. so I begin helping them set this up, and when they asked for a progress update and I show them what I’ve worked on, they tell me that no, we’re not mirroring the analytics, we need to replace the entire db, including non analytical data. at this point. at this point, I tell them we need to take a step back and discuss this all together (me, then, and my boss). we’ve yet to meet again, (we are a remote company for context) , but I have literally no idea what to say to him, because it very much seems like whatever he’s trying to achieve, and whatever proposals they pitched him don’t align at all (he has no technical knowledge , and they don’t seem to fully understand what the platform does, and there were obviously several meetings I was left out of)",

I have exposure to other tools through my job, but to go in-depth, most online resources (YouTube, Coursera, etc.) I found are very high-level.

Turns out Apache Arrow implementation uses wrappers for C++ and is quite heavy. So I created a minimal-dependency pure C library on my own (assisted with Claude Code).The library is quite comprehensive and the performance are actually really good notably thanks to SIMD implementation. Build was tested on linux (amd), macOS (arm) and windows.I though that maybe some of my fellow data engineering redditors might be interested in the library although it is quite niche project.So if anyone is interested check the Gituhub repo : [https://github.com/Vitruves/carquet](https://github.com/Vitruves/carquet)I look forwarding your feedback for features suggestions, integration questions and code critics :slightly_smiling_face:Have a nice day!",

Right now I have finished the IBM data engineering course for Python, and it was good and I like it and I took the certificate but this is not enough. I obviously learned that I must implement what I learned and will learn into projects but I kinda feel that I can start on my own. I feel like don’t need to continue with the course, but at the same time I am very lonely and overwhelmed. I have tried to look for people who are like me everywhere , and on my country’s subreddit but no use. Because no one knows English evenWhat do you suggest? Is it possible to create an organization on my own? Should i continue with IBM course? And how can I find my people?

        "content": "Hey y'all, over the holidays I wrote Tessera (https://github.com/ashita-ai/tessera)It's like Kafka Schema Registry but for data warehouses. If you're using dbt, OpenAPI, GraphQL, or Kafka, it helps coordinate schema changes between producers and consumers.The problem it solves: data teams break each other's stuff all the time because there's no good way to track who depends on what. You change a column, someone's dashboard breaks, nobody knows until it's too late. The same happens with APIs as well. Tessera sits in the middle and makes producers acknowledge breaking changes before they publish. Consumers register their dependencies, get notifications when things change, and can block breaking changes until they're ready.It's open source, MIT licensed, built with Python/FastAPI. If you're dealing with data contracts, schema evolution, or just tired of breaking changes causing incidents, have a look: https://github.com/ashita-ai/tesseraFeedback is encouraged. Contributors are especially encouraged. I would love to hear if this resonates with problems you're seeing!",

You got it boss but for the life of me I could never get past tutorial hell.I recently got put on databricks project and I was thinking that it’d be some simple star schema project but rather it’s an entire meta data driven pipeline written in spark/python. The choice was either fall behind or produce so I’ve been turning to AI to help me with creating code off of existing frameworks to fit my use case. Now I can’t help but feel guilty of being some brainless vibe coder as I take pride in the work that I produce however I can’t deny it’s been a total life saver. No way could I write up what it provides. I really try my best to learn what and ask it to justify its decision and if there’s something that I can fix on my own I’ll try to do it for the sake of having ownership. Ive been testing the output constantly. I try to avoid having it give me opinions as I know it’s really good at gaslighting. At the end of it all ,no way in hell am I going to be putting python on my skill set. Anyway just curious as to what your thoughts are on this.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,I am building a databricks notebook that joins roughly 6 tables into a main table. Some joins require some of the main table, whilst other joins will use the whole main table. Each join table has a few keys.My question is what is the best architecture to perform the join without having an out of memory / stack overflow error? Currently I have written a linear script which sequentially goes through each table and does the join. This is slow and confusing to look at. As such other developers cannot make sense of the code (despite me adding comments) and im the main point of contact.Solutions tried:* I had tried to write a function that performs multiple joins using a while loop. However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error. Sometimes i get a driver error and the whole notebook fails to continue to run.* I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persisted. As such we had to roll back to the linear way i wrote before.* I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impact.* Caching after some joins but problem persists. Other information:* Small tables - row count roughly 50-100* main table - as of now row count roughly 50k* join type - left join on main table * All tables are already cleansed and are delta tables * Technologies: databricks, pyspark, ADF, ADLSSide question: I used to be a software engineer and now moved to being a data engineer. Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without? in terms of time complexity and clean code writing? My assumption is the former but after a few months of writing pyspark code i believe the correct answer is the latter? Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?",

I'm using goverment data (I'm from Mexico) for automobile accidents from 1997 to 2024 in total I have more than 9.5 millon records. The data is published on CVS files 1 per year and is semi clean. The proyect I'm developing is a data architecture applying medallion. So I created 3 docker containers:1. Pyspark and Jupiter lab2. MinIo (I don't want to pay for Amazon s3 storage so I'm simulating it using minio. I have 3 buckets landing, bronze and silver)3. Apache airflow (its monitoring the landing bucket and when a file is uploaded it calls diferent scripts if the name of the script starts with tc it start the pipeline for data catalog file if it start with atus it calls the pipeline for processing the data files with the accidents records any other name just move it to bronze bucket.On the silver quality I implemented a delta lake 4 dimension tables and 1 for the facts.My question is how con I improve this proyect so it stand out more for the recruiter and also that I can learn more. I know that maybe I did overkill for som parts of the proyect but I did it to practice what I'm learning. I was thinking to develop an api that reads the csvs and create a Kafka container so I can learn about streaming processing. Thank for any advice",

PDBoost is a wrapper that keeps the familiar Pandas API but runs operations on DuckDB instead.**Key features:*** Scans Parquet and CSV files directly in DuckDB without loading everything into memory.* Filters and aggregations run in DuckDB for fast, efficient operations.* Smaller operations or unsupported methods automatically fall back to standard Pandas.**Current Limitations:**Since this is an initial release, I prioritized the core functionality (Reading & Aggregating). Please be aware of:* merge() is not implemented in this version* DuckDB doesn’t allow mixed types like Pandas does, so you may need to clean messy CSVs before using them.* Currently optimized for reading and analyzing. Writing back to Parquet/CSV works by converting to Pandas first.* Advanced methods (rolling, ewm) will fall back to standard Pandas, which may defeat the memory savings. Stick to groupby, filter, and agg for now.Any feedback on handling more complex operations like merge() efficiently without breaking the lazy evaluation chain is appreciated.**Links:*** PyPI: pip install pdboost* GitHub: [https://github.com/ashish-002/pdboost](https://github.com/ashish-002/pdboost)It’s still early (v0.1.2), so I’m open to suggestions.

        "content": "I've been working on a project I wanted to share. GraphQLite is an SQLite extension that brings graph database functionality to SQLite using the Cypher query language.The idea came from wanting graph queries without the operational overhead of running Neo4j for smaller projects. Sometimes you just want to model relationships and traverse them without spinning up a separate database server. SQLite already gives you a single-file, zero-config database—GraphQLite adds Cypher's expressive pattern matching on top.You can create nodes and relationships, run traversals, and execute graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and shortest paths. It handles graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes comfortably, with sub-millisecond traversal times. There are bindings for Python and Rust, or you can use it directly from SQL.I hope some of y'all find it useful.GitHub: [https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite)",

I've been asked to develop a method to allow internal users to upload files to S3 so that we can ingest them to Snowflake or SQL Server.At the moment this has been handled using Storage Gateway and giving users access to the file share that they can treat as a Network Drive. But this has caused some issues with file locking / syncing when S3 Events are used to trigger Lambdas.As alternatives, I've looked at AWS Transfer Family Web Apps / SFTP - however this seems to require additional set up (such as VPCs or users needing to use desktop apps like FileZilla for access).I've also looked at Storage Browser for S3, though it seems this would need to be embedded into an existing application rather than used as a standalone solution, and authentication would need to be handled separately.Am I missing something obvious here? Is there a simpler way of doing this in AWS? I'd be interested to hear how others have done this in AWS - securely allowing internal users to upload files to S3 as a landing zone for data to be ingested?",

I'm looking to make a move over the the DE side of things and wondered if I had a place long-term with my experience, but without a degree.I got into the data team from an administrative role and had/still have no degree, just a lacklustre secondary school education (high school level). The department is a mix of those with stellar academic records, random degrees and people like me who fell into the work - I've found a similar split at most organisations and businesses I've worked with or met at conferences.I've experience working with a ton of different systems and a variety of stakeholders both within the organisation and externally such as software companies, central government departments etc. to tackle complex operational problems.I started my career using basic SQL, Excel and VBA. Currently I'm using advanced SQL (including performance tuning, building pipelines and data warehousing), Python (mainly pandas, numpy and matplotlib), Power BI (with a great understanding of DAX and TMDL, plus I do some platform administration). I've a sound(ish) knowledge of stats, though we don't really using anything too advanced. I'm considered mid-senior atm and paid £47k, which is quite typical for the public sector in the UK \\*Americans recoil in horror\\*.Outside work I mess around with my home server to expand my wider IT knowledge and explore some more modern tooling and cloud platforms.My organisation are moving to Azure next year and I'm lining myself up for a DE role (there's no bump in pay) as that's where my interest lies.Would it be worth me getting a degree at this point in my career? My employer has offered to put me through a degree apprenticeship (not sure how familiar people are with those outside the UK), with the Open University, a distance-learning university.Recently, I applied for ten BI/DA jobs in other companies (just to test my marketability) and was invited to eight, so I'm not worried at all about the immediate term in my current area of work, I'm just concerned about whether I'd have a place in DE over the long term?

Most of my work so far has been very technical: pipeline development, data handling, tool testing, Docker/Apptainer images, Git, etc. I’ve rarely worked on actual data analysis.I recently changed jobs (about 6 months ago), and this experience made me realize a few things: I don’t really enjoy coding, working on other people’s code often gives me anxiety, and I’d like to move toward a related role that offers better compensation than what’s usually available in public research.Given my background, I’ve been considering a transition into data engineering. I’ve started learning Airflow, ETL/ELT concepts, Spark, and the basics of GCP and AWS. However, I feel like I’m missing structure, mentorship, and especially a community to help me stay motivated and make real progress.At the moment, I don’t enjoy my current tasks, I don’t feel like I’m developing professionally, and the salary isn’t motivating. I still have about 15 months left on my contract, and I’d really like to use this time wisely to prepare a solid transition.If you have experience with a similar transition, or if you work in data engineering, I’d love to hear:* how you made the switch (or would recommend making it),* what helped you most in terms of learning and positioning yourself,* how to connect with people already working in the field.Thanks a lot in advance for your insights.",

This toolkit allows you to configure and train end to end recommendation system using multi-modal encoders (you can choose any encoder or even bring your own encoder) and train end to end model with just a config file. Its still in its native stage and I'd love your feedback and thoughts. Is it useful ? Would you want more features ? Is it missing something fundamental ?

        "content": "Hi, just looking for different opinions and perspectives hereI recently joined a company with a medallion architecture but where there is no “data cleansing” layer. The only type of cleaning being done is some deduplication logic (very manual) and some type casting. This means a lot of the data that goes into reports and downstream products aren’t uniform and must be fixed/transformed at the report level.All these tiny problems are handled in scripts when new tables are created in silver or gold layers. So the scripts can get very long, complex, and contain duplicate logic.So..\\- at what point do you see it necessary to actually do data cleaning? In my opinion it should already be implemented but I want to hear other perspectives.\\- what kind of “cleaning” do you deem absolutely necessary/bare minimum for most use cases?\\- i understand and completely onboard with the thought of “don’t fix it if it’s not broken” but when does it reach a breaking point?\\- in your opinion, what part of this is up to the data engineer to decide vs. analysts?We are using spark and delta lake to store data.Edit: clarified question 3",

        "author": "iamspoilt",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "First of all, Happy New Year 2026!Hi folks, I'm a long time lurker on this subreddit and a fellow Data Infrastructure Engineer. I have been working as a Software Engineer for 8+ years now and have been entirely focused on the data infra side of the world for the past few years with a fair share of working with Apache Spark.I have realized that it's very difficult to manage Spark infrastructure on your own using commodity cloud hardware and Kubernetes, and this is one of the prime reasons why users opt-in for offerings such as EMR and Databricks. However, I have personally seen that as companies grow larger, these offerings start to show their limitations (at least in the case of EMR from my personal experience). Besides that, these offerings also charge a premium on compute on top of the charges for using commodity cloud.For a quick comparison, here is the difference in pricing for AWS c8g.24xlarge and c8g.48xlarge instances if you were to run these for an entire month, showing the 25% EMR premium on your total EC2 bill.**Table 1: Single Instance (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$2,794.79|$3,493.49|$698.70||c8g.48xlarge|$5,589.58|$6,986.98|$1,397.40|**Table 2: 50 Instances (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$139,740|$174,675|$34,935||c8g.48xlarge|$279,479|$349,349|$69,870|In light of this, I started working on a platform that allows you to orchestrate Spark clusters on Kubernetes in your own AWS account - with no additional compute markup. The platform is geared towards Data Engineers (Product Data Engineers as I like to call them) who mainly write and maintain ETL and ELT workloads, not manage the Data Infrastcructure needed to support these workloads.Today, I am finally able to share what I have been building: [Orchestera Platform](https://orchestera.com/)Here are some of the salient features of the platform:* Setup and teardown an entire EKS-based Spark cluster in your own AWS account with absolutely no upfront expertise required in Kubernetes* Cluster is configured for reactive auto-scaling based on your workloads: * Automatically scales up to the right number of EC2 instances based on your Spark driver and executor configuration * Automatically scales down to 0 once your workloads complete* Simple integration with AWS services such as S3 and RDS* Simple integration with Iceberg tables on S3. AWS Glue Catalog integration coming soon.* Full support for iterating on Spark pipelines using Jupyter notebooks* Currently only supports AWS Cloud and the us-east-1 regionYou can see some demo examples here:* [Developing Spark applications using Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/jupyter-notebooks/)* [Using Iceberg tables with Spark](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/iceberg-hello-world/)If you are an AWS user or considering using it for Spark, I would request you to please try this out. No credit card required for using the personal workspace. Also offering 6 months of premium access for serious users in this subreddit.Also very interested to hear from this community and looking for some early feedback.I have aslo written [documentation](https://docs.orchestera.com/) (under active development) to give users a head start in setting up their accounts, orchesterating a new Spark cluster and writing data pipelines.If you want to chat more about this new platform, please come and join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9TXybZcd).",

        "content": "Anybody have tips for using claude to adjust a complex pipeline that's in databricks? My current workflow is to export a notebook's source file, add it to claude, then give it the context for the problem. Or sometimes I upload the steps before and after. But this is slow compared to when I work on pure python projects in PyCharm, which take full advantage of claude code.I'm using git folders and my code is checked into source control, but I'm not using an IDE when developing in databricks. I just use the web UI.What I would like to set up is:\\- claude knows all steps in my pipeline (maybe by exporting the pipeline using 'view as code') \\- claude can see the latest files and understand the types involved, etc \\- bonus: claude can access some tables in read only modeMy hunch is I need to use VS code with the databricks extension so that I'm in a legit IDE rather than the Databricks UI. But I'm not used to testing notebooks, etc with that setup. Also, to keep the pipeline definition up to date I will need to export that manually and add it to source control when there are changes.",

Programming does not have that; you have to have the ability to learn things out of sequence. You can't wait until you have the entirety of JS learned before you move on to something like React. Heck, you will probably never get there in a lifetime, as there will be new additions to the language and deprecations. I have a degree, I have been self-studying, and I am still unemployed. When I start learning a library, it is hard to sort of know what to pick up and then move on and hit the library only when you need it again.This is a barrier, or at least one of the barriers that makes programming a high-paying job.

So, I decided that I wanted to take a break from the hostile environment and work with other stuff (and enjoy some of my life after uni). The thing is, job market wasn’t so lucky to me. It was (and it still is) hard to even get an interview. So I ended up doing some freelance and gigs all around. But one stuff that was all over my head ever since I finished uni was the famous “imposter syndrome”. And, I got the realisation that I was, in fact, very lucky to land my positions. I always relied on AI to deliver something, didn’t know how to start a project from scratch. So, in November I decided to “start again”. Focusing on getting the basics well and enjoying coding again. And it has been a quite fun journey! In fact, I’m liking studying and trying some stuff. I got a membership on Frontend Masters (mostly because of the algorithm course) and gifted myself with some books for Christmas. I’m relearning (or learning in fact) Javascript, algorithms, some cloud computing (aiming for AWS SAA-CO3) and eager to learn DBs and Golang. Challenges are getting fun again, struggling is getting fun again and, more importantly, learning is getting fun again. I’m still doing some gigs (mostly because I really need the money), but I’m planning on diving deep in interviews at June. But, until then, I’ll enjoy the ride :)",

The Playstation 1 and 2 use MIPS architecture, the Gameboy and GBC use z80, and most modern applications and games use x86-64, which is why I'm torn between the three.I don't have a computer science background and my career isn't anything close to CS unless you count working in excel. I also don't anticipate switching careers. This is purely something I want to do in mh free tkme. I understand basic computer concepts but don't know how to code or program. I've made a few game mods, I can look at code and change a thing or two, and I can locate some stuff in memory to freeze or edit via emulator or CE, but that's probably as close as I've gotten. Anyways, I am wondering if there are any great online courses or books I can follow that are good for people with little to no CS background? I'm torn between x86, MIPS, or z80, but leaning towards x86 since it seems more comprehensive and I would think going from CISC to RISC would be easier than the inverse. I rented the book *Assembly X64 Programming in Easy Steps: Modern Coding for MASM, SSE and AVX* from my library since that was all they had. Not sure how that compares to some of the other resources out there.",

I talked to them a bit about it and it managed to get me into programming and learning about pc's and on and off for a few years, i would try and learn C# because i was curious to try and learn how to make a game, and i was into pc's because i wanted to know how pc's work (hardware wise, not software). Fastforward to graduating high school recently (i graduated in june). When it was time for me to pick my future career i decided i wanted to go to computer science (a bit off topic but i was also into music, specifically playing the guitar and wanting to learn about music theory, and i like to learn to draw) and even though i was into those other hobbies, i picked computer science because i thought i could make some decent money from it, however thats when things went down the hill. When i first started, things weren't too hard, i managed to understand some early stuff. I was learning C++ and general computer theory, and when it came to computer theory i was good at it, because in my mind it was easy. Then when November / December came, everything just didnt make sense. I couldnt even pay attention in classes because i just couldnt understand it and when i try and learning it on my own i still couldnt get it. It got pretty bad because i would cry many nights and being constantly stressed at me not understanding the subjects and that i didnt want to fail my classes. Eventually my school finally had christmas holidays and im still having them as im writing this, but yesterday or before yesterday (it was on jan 2) i got an email from two of my professors (one for programming and another for computer theory) where the computer theory would make a test on things that we learnt for a bit before christmas holidays and from my programming teacher where we would get a midterm on stuff we did from november / december. At that point i just started breaking down because i just dont want to go through that awful experience anymore of being constantly worried and stressed, feeling as if i was on the edge, and one screw up would ruin everything for me. So i guess what im asking is should i even continue my course or should i pick a different career for my life (i was thinking of maritime studies because my dad is an expert in maritime since he worked for 40+ years in it) at this point, im lost and i dont know what to do with my future.thanks for anyone who read the whole essay of a post. But to give a TLDR version: was into computers since middle school, graduated high school, got into compsci for my career, in the beginning understood the material but later i didnt get it, started having panic attacks and stress, dont know what to do.",

I’ve been in a database developer role where I use SQL and PL/SQL for about 6 years, and I’ve noticed with PL/SQL there are some similarities when it comes to programming fundamentals (variables, data types, loops, etc.). I’ve always been interested in doing Software Engineering (either Full-stack, Backend, or Data Engineering). I graduated in 2018 with a major in Management Information Systems (MIS). I wonder if to get into a Software Engineering career, would it be better or worth it to go back to school and get a major or master’s in Computer Science? Or would it be better to learn programming online and do some projects to add to a portfolio? Any other advice would also be appreciated!",

Most junior roles seem to be for fresh IT graduates, and starting from zero at my age feels almost impossible.The hardest part is that there *is* progress, but it doesn’t feel real.Half a year of work, more knowledge, more understanding — but no visible or material result yet.AI and the current state of IT make things even more confusing.Does it still make sense to learn coding?Are junior positions still real?There are tons of job postings, but almost no replies.Even in my previous field, things don’t look great.I honestly don’t know if the world is going in the wrong direction or if I’m doing something wrong.With the new year starting, I want to reset mentally.Find at least some kind of job to stabilize things, and continue programming more as a hobby for now.I want to try to finish a project and publish it to the App Store, even though it’s not easy right now.I also have a Raspberry Pi lying around, so maybe I’ll build something simple with hardware and AI vision.At least to see if this can move me closer to the kind of work I want to do, without a degree and years of experience in a field I didn’t start in earlier.Wishing everyone in the new year some progress on their path.Not necessarily big achievements, but at least small and real ones.",

        "content": "I am trying to learn programming and have a question about frameworks/programming languages.I have made a simple HTTP-based API in both python (using fastAPI) and java (using Spring Boot).In fastAPI framework, I notice that I mainly write functions which are either passed in as parameters into other functions or called by other functions. To me, this makes sense from my perspective, or at least feels intuitive. I can literally see the programming \"primitives\" I wrote interacting with each other in my source code. For example, I build an endpoint like```python@APIRouter().get(\"/blah\")def get_blah(): return \"blah\"```then I must tell my main FastAPI() object about the routes using `.include_router()`. Nice. I can also somewhat imagine whats going on in my head, like the `APIRouter` object has some record of all the routes I defined via the decorator and that object is being passed to my `FastAPI()` object.Spring Boot, on the other hand, I notice that I create classes, and some of these classes are never instantiated! At least they're certainly never called in my source code. I can run my application with Gradle and the class I created that was never instantiated actually did something. E.g., I make this class```java@RestControllerpublic class TextController { @GetMapping(\"/texts\") public List getTexts() { return service.getTexts(); }}```but I never wrote \"TextController blah = new TextController()\" anywhere?Like, I feel more in control of my FastAPI application than I do with my Spring application? Do others feel like this? Do I just chalk up the framework differences to \"thats how the authors who designed each framework intended it to be\"?",

For now I got started with SQL and AWS.From a little bit of Chatgpting and Redditing, I am thinking to go over these below tech stack in the exact order. SQL, Git & GitHub, Python, AWS, DataBuilt Tool, Data bricks, Apache Airflow.Also for AWS, Data bricks, DBT and Airflow, I’m thinking to do certifications as I believe they’ll add credentials to my profile.I need help and advice on the following please : 1. Does the tech stack and order look good or Do I need to add/remove anything?2. Regarding certifications, I’m a bit confused as both AWS and Data bricks are offering similar kind of certifications. Should I do both or choose one, if one which would be better.3. I have chosen AWS rather than GCP and Azure as I read that AWS has the highest market share among these. I’m open to any suggestions even outside of my questions. Thank you in advance!!",

Thing is, that tutorial is finished, and I have no idea where to go next. I’ve searched around and found a lot of resources for learning. I have books, pages, youtube tutorials and much more, but I still don’t have an «end-goal» with those. What should I work toward learning? I got interested in OpenGL, and started there. It went alright, but it is some steps ahead of my very basic knowledge and it ends with me just copying code without *really* understanding most of it. So let’s say I want to start making very basic apps. Say a to-do list, a calculator or something like that (with some sort of graphics library so I can make something else than just prompt programs :face_with_tears_of_joy:), but I’m still very fresh, what should I do?",

I don’t know what to expect. Can any senior developers or anyone who works in a tech company tell me what, exactly, would make me look professional? Do you do PowerPoints to explain stuff to clients ? Do you explain the code, or maybe more the concept and how the software works ? What is expected of you? Anything would be helpful because I’m very out of my depth. I really want to impress my teachers. One of them worked for years at Microsoft in a high position and is a bit of a snob.

        "author": "ByteMender",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "From a \"mechanical\" perspective, it seems like anything you can do with inheritance, you can do with composition.Any shared behavior placed in a base class and reused via `extends` can instead be moved into a separate class and reused via delegation. In practice, an inheritance hierarchy can often be transformed into composition by:* Keeping the classes that represent the varying behavior,* Removing `extends`,* Injecting those classes into what used to be the base class,* Delegating calls instead of relying on overridden methods.From this perspective, inheritance looks like **composition + a relationship**.With inheritance:* The base class provides shared behavior,* Subclasses provide variation,* The `is-a` relationship wires them together implicitly at compile time.With composition:* The same variation classes exist,* The same behavior is reused,* But the wiring is explicit and often runtime-configurable.This makes it seem like inheritance adds only:* A fixed, compile-time relationship,* Rather than fundamentally new expressive power.If \"factoring out what varies\" is the justification for the extra classes, then those classes are justified independently of inheritance. That leaves the inheritance *relationship itself* as the only thing left to justify.So the core question becomes:**What does the inheritance relationship actually buy us?**To be clear, I'm not asking \"*when is inheritance convenient?\"* or \"*which one should I prefer?\"*I’m asking:**In what cases is the inheritance relationship itself semantically justified—not just mechanically possible?** In other words, when is the relationship doing real conceptual work, rather than just wiring behavior together?",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello! New poster here. I just started to practice some C# and learn its style with a couple simple projects. I guess I have some questions on it as a whole, firstly: for most cases where you need a data-holding object, do you just use a class? Coming from python I keep defaulting to a dictionary, but there it's extremely simple to initialize one with whatever key value pairs I need, whereas in c# the statement is so complex I wonder if it's because objects with more than just a string-number or string-string pairs are meant to be classes. Also, I read that classes are faster in execution.Secondly, I guess I've been struggling to explain the need for all the explicit type declarations and other things that to a beginner seem more complicated than they need to be. Like, it was very complicated in VS to just figure out how to run the script I created, having to choose a debugger and running console commands to get there. What do you do if you want to test a snippet of one script in isolation? Also, I had a class script in the same namespace as the main one, but its class wasn't being recognized. Eventually I noticed the class script was in a different subfolder of the project, so I moved it and it worked fine. But what's the point of a namespace if the file still needs to be in the same directory... I imagine all these details are for good reasons, so wanted to ask some experts haha",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello! So I've recently been working on a simple test game with Monogame. After some trial and error, I made a collision detection system based on several parts:\\> under Scenes class, I load textures for obstacles in each scene and create a dictionary to map each scene to the obstacle textures to be drawn. Also created a dictionary to map each texture to its position.\\> in my Map class, I create a 2d array of zeros to represent terrain; then, a method loops thru the dictionary from Scenes, to place 1's on all array elements corresponding to the texture's width&height on the grid.\\> In the map class, I create methods like this for each direction, which are called in the main Update() method later when the arrow key is detected: (EDIT: position and tex1 in CanMoveL() refer to the player)         public bool CanMoveL(Vector2 position, Texture2D tex1)         {             bool check = true;             if (position.X == Xbounds[0]+10)             {                 return false;             }             for (int y = 5; y < tex1.Height-1; y++){                 if (terrain[(int)position.Y+y, (int)position.X +1]==2)                 {                     check = false;                 }             }             return check;         }Note: I know there are built-in detection methods in monogame, but I'm not really interested in refactoring in the best way possible, I just had the objective of figuring it out from scratch in a way that makes sense. But, if you have some ideas on how you would have approached it/whether my method is way too inefficient, I'd be happy to hear them!Mainly, I'm concerned about the loop that looks through each \"row\" of my character's height, seeing if it hits the obstacle when projected. I was thinking of Numpy style slicing but I couldn't figure that out in c#?Secondly, It seems like this method is kinda fragmented, with the scene textures loaded in Scenes, but the actual mapping of them in Maps. Should both those be in Maps?Thanks!",

That makes me wonder whether SvelteKit is mainly intended for cases where you don’t already have a backend.If I already rely entirely on a separate Go backend for APIs and business logic, would plain Svelte with TypeScript be sufficient, or does SvelteKit still provide benefits in this scenario? I’m trying to understand when it makes sense to use Svelte versus SvelteKit, especially for someone coming from a more traditional frontend-backend separation.

        "content": "Hi All, I built this thing called K8sQuest because I was tired of paying for cloud sandboxes and wanted to practice debugging broken clusters. \\## What it is It's basically a game that breaks things in your local kind cluster and makes you fix them. 50 levels total, going from \"why is this pod crashing\" to \"here's 9 broken things in a production scenario, good luck.\" Runs entirely on Docker Desktop with kind. No cloud costs. \\## How it works 1. Run \\`./play.sh\\` - game starts, breaks something in k8s 2. Open another terminal and debug with kubectl 3. Fix it however you want 4. Run \\`validate\\` in the game to check 5. Get a debrief explaining what was wrong and why The UI is retro terminal style (kinda like those old NES games). Has hints, progress tracking, and step-by-step guides if you get stuck. \\## What you'll debug \\- World 1: CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, pending pods, labels, ports \\- World 2: Deployments, HPA, liveness/readiness probes, rollbacks \\- World 3: Services, DNS, Ingress, NetworkPolicies \\- World 4: PVs, PVCs, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets \\- World 5: RBAC, SecurityContext, node scheduling, resource quotas \\## Install \\`\\`\\`bash git clone [https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git](https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git) cd k8squest ./install.sh ./play.sh \\`\\`\\` Needs: Docker Desktop, kubectl, kind, python3 \\## Why I made this Reading docs didn't really stick for me. I learn better when things are broken and I have to figure out why. This simulates the actual debugging you do in prod, but locally and with hints. Also has safety guards so you can't accidentally nuke your whole cluster. Feedback welcome. If it helps you learn, cool. If you find bugs or have ideas for more levels, let me know.

I am used to creating new objects in OOP programming. Then after consulting with AI I realized that React Native is probably the best choice of framework for mobile android development. In around mid December I decided that in 2026 I am going to start learning it. However I found that even the configuration (or setup) for React Native is super complicated. For example the JDK has to be between 17 and 20, and installing something on Android Studio SDK manager. Fortunately I sorted it all out with the help of AI's assistance in a few hours struggling attempts and managed to install React Native apps on my phone. React Native's code structure reminds of HTML at first glance. Hopefully in this year I will be able to independently write code for android apps through React Native.

This summer, I got interested in software development and started self-studying Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I really enjoyed it and decided to pursue a tech career.I got admitted to UNT for a traditional Computer Science degree, but financially it’s not feasible for me. Collin College offers a Bachelor of Applied Technology in Software Development, which is more workforce-focused than a CS degree. The program covers software development fundamentals, includes a capstone project, and has lighter math requirements. Essentially, it gives the skills needed for a software development career.My main concern is if employers will view this degree the same as a traditional CS degree? I’ve read that a CS degree is considered the “gold standard,” but I’ve also heard otherwise. I’m lucky to be able to pursue school debt-free with VA benefits and family support, so I’m trying to make the most practical choice.Would appreciate feedback or advice. Do you think this degree will open the same doors as a CS degree?",

Did you struggle with something like that before?",

Even in large code bases, my co-workers and I have fixed complex bugs without manually writing a single line of code. The LLMs understood parts of the project we've never seen before and were able to fix the issues with more holistic approaches.Much less skill is needed for solving problems that used to involve years of study. I'm worried the main three areas (coding, domain knowledge, system design) that made skilled workers more desirable will no longer matter. Now, workers can simply add the domain knowledge to the context window, use well-established system designs, and generate code adhering to standards with existing prompt templates.The knowledge barrier once attracted me to this profession because of the differentation from low skilled labor. I'm considering switching into a different career with more human judgement involved but it feels pointless. Now anyone, including unskilled workers, can automate their tasks well enough without manual coding.I would like guidance on what paths I should considering switching into, or topics of upskilling, if any, that aren't easily replaceable by unskilled laborers overseeing the work of AI.",

I don't think AI will eliminate software engineering, but I do think it'll change the number of people who need to it to achieve very good outcomes. With each iteration and vast amounts of training data, the AI models to get better - and honestly, I'm part of the reason, I have to hold my hands up and say I've used GPT a lot since it came out - it synthesizes anything on Google, SO, documentation, etc. so why not use it to get to the bottom of what I need to know way quicker?And I think this is the general consensus - AI will never do away with software engineering, software will always exist, but it will change who does it, and the number of those people.More relevant in 2026 though is offshoring. For better or for worse, I understand the rationale of offshoring labor, particularly junior positions. Companies exist solely to deliver profits to their shareholders, investing a lot of money into an \"unproven\" college graduate is far less appealing than investing that same amount of money into 3-4 new graduates.So as offshoring accelerates, and AI becomes better and better, I'm \"hiding\". I do my due diligence at work, and I learn what good software is.But no matter how many times I implement a strong observability backbone, no matter how many times I write CDK code and deploy to AWS, no matter how many times I implement authentication middleware, etc. - I have the same feeling that I'm on borrowed time.I'm \"hiding\" in the sense that there will be a time in the future, how soon, I don't know, but there will be a time when my leadership thinks, \"We don't need him anymore\" because I cost them too much, and my work can be consolidated into an offshore option or a senior engineer that is producing more with AI. It'll be a simple decision for them, and honestly I'll be the first to say that their intention aligns with the purpose of a business in the first place, which is to churn a higher profit.But until then, I have no choice but to hide, I can upskill and get as good as I want, and believe me I will try to, but there's going to be an inflection point where I can't hide anymore, and by then who knows what the world will look like.But do any other juniors sort of feel this way, this sort of existential dread, but also acknowledgement that that's sort of the way the cookie crumbles? In the meantime, I hope we can both be grateful for having a job at a time so difficult. Take care, my friends :)",

It was unexpected, because just the week prior, our manager told us the team was doing well and there was even a new project that the company was considering having us work on. When I was told I was being laid off, I then was escorted out of the building, so I had to leave immediately without transferring my tasks/knowledge or even saying goodbye to my co-workers. The manager said he'd hire me back if they end up hiring again now (January) and I apply. I'm just wondering, would I really want to go back to a company that treated me that way? I feel like it was sudden, and I was treated rather coldly, being made to leave immediately without even saying goodbye to anyone. It's sad because I liked working there overall. And if he'd hire me back, then why even let me go in the first place?",

That in-human connection is invaluable when networking. But the trade offs just seem to get larger each year and the difference between living in a tech hub / not seems to lessen too, opportunity wise.If we look at the primary reason for moving to a tech hub (I.e. Seattle, SF, NYC) it comes down to:- more job opportunities- ability to grow a larger networkWith the advent of online applications & speaking to recruiters virtually, many roles aren’t relegated to those living in a specific city anymore. There may be some preference from certain companies to choose locally, but that’s about it.Networking is a big one, but if you were really dedicated to building a solid network, you could do lots of cold outreach on LinkedIn and attend virtual conferences in the industry. Not saying it would be as effective, but the tradeoff of uprooting your whole life and paying a premium (higher COL) just to network a little more efficiently doesn’t seem to weigh in evenly.From people who have moved for these reasons, curious to hear your opinion.",

        "content": "So I work for a FAANG company as a SWE, 3 YOE, got promoted to mid-level 7 months ago and then switched to a chill team. The work is more boring than I expected coming from a fast-paced, cutting-edge team building brand new services leveraging AI agents to now maintaining legacy services written over a decade ago - very simple services but with high scale (millions of transactions per second).The path to senior engineer here is slim, maybe even non-existent because we already have one on the team and there isn't any real scope in terms of next-level projects for promo. My teammates are also great but not amazingly talented in the sense that there's not a lot for me to learn from them. The pace is slow and the work is quite mundane and nothing to do with AI - it feels like I'm missing the AI wave. So there's minimal career growth here.But apart from that... it's just really good compared to all my previous teams - really nice and fun teammates and manager, love just hanging out with them, we have lunch together everyday, go for outings once or twice a month, play games, talk about a lot of things outside work, the on-call load is very low, no pressure due to relaxed deadlines, excellent work-life balance, minimal meetings, flexible timings, the pay is great, almost guaranteed to be safe from layoffs.... it sometimes feels too good to be true after grinding for the past 3 years on multiple other teams. There's only like 2-4hrs of actual work a day..... and I even look forward to Mondays now (?!)But yet, after many months of relaxing after promo doing not much impactful/interesting work, the itch to do more and grow is back again, especially being young and single with a lot of time to dedicate to work, but I'm not sure if I want to leave something so good in every other aspect... it's hard to come across such gigs over the span of a career and maybe I should just enjoy the chill life while it lasts - but it feels like it'll last forever for this team :) this is like the true definition of rest and vest but maybe I'm too young for that already.So I'm planning to stay at least for a few more months, but not sure after that. I'm also interested in maybe going to a startup, but perhaps that's best to do once I have 5 YOE and can apply for senior instead of chasing promo here which is quite difficult irrespective of team. I could also try switching internally to a team with better work and better promo prospects but not sure if it's worth giving up all the good things here for career growth - vs. just rest and vest... what would you do in this situation ?",

        "author": "Cheap-Sparrow",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I (31m) am the tech lead of a small \"sub team\". We have 3 different groups reporting to the same manager. This manager is not a software engineer. I work at a FAANG company.My coworker (25m) is incredibly toxic. They have had multiple blow ups at others and myself. They won't use jira, they won't make merge requests, and every meeting with them is like walking on eggshells. They are late with all their code and it's very buggy. In order to not go through the MR process this coworker created their own repo and pushes directly to main. When we asked them to combine repos they get very agitated. We asked them to start making MRs for review and they flat out refuse and it causes the meetings to become very tense. My manager doesn't understand why merge requests are important and sees no issue with the coworker's behavior. We recently hired 2 new senior engineers. Within 1 month, both engineers have had issues with this person. They are both actively involved in the behavioral coaching of this person. One new hire told me \"this guy is the single worst behaved engineer I've ever worked with.\" He expects me, as tech lead, to deal with this situation. I think that's understandable but I have strict instructions to not get involved.I asked my manager to affirm my position as tech lead so I can get this coworker to make MRs and document their designs. My manager said \"No, if I do that then [coworker] will lose their shit and this is a really delicate situation right now.\"This young coworker hates me in particular. Probably because I am in charge? My manager has asked me to stay out of it so he can coach this guy himself. My manager told me \"I've never met someone like this in my entire career. I am completely flummoxed and I have no idea what to do.\"During one very public blow up, my manager was slacking me privately saying \"I'm confused why he's mad\" and \"just drop [this requirement]. You're right but we need him to feel like he's saving face\".The approach that we're taking is to let this coworker fail on his own. We aren't supposed to save their code when we find bugs, we aren't supposed to push for improvements. We are supposed to let them fail so they realize they need help. Our project is off track.One of the new engineers told me they are having a \"very hard time\" on the team because of this person. I feel a responsibility to respond to that but I have strict instructions to stay out of it. ***Okay. So here's my question.I'm being positioned to become the manager of this team. I said No a year ago because this engineer would have been my only report. My manager thinks I have the wrong attitude and \"[I] need to work with [coworker] because we can't just give up on everyone under the age of 30\". I think this person probably needs to be PIPed and let go. At my previous company (also faang) this would have resulted in a pip a long time ago, both for the attitude but also the sheer lack of deliverables.I can stay on the IC ladder and climb this way, but then a new manager will be hired. This hurts my chances of moving into management later. It also annoys my boss who wants me to just deal with the engineer by coaching instead of a PIP.* Should I take the manager position and have this person as my report, knowing my hands are tied when dealing with them? Or should I try to stay as an engineer?* Do I have an obligation to work with this person, like my boss is telling me? Or is this situation already beyond what is acceptable in the workplace?",

        "content": "My entire team is filled with senior developers and I am the only recent entry hire. When I was interning, there was another entry developer that stayed on for around two years but left due to no promotion (they said he kinda sucked delivery wise).I am told I do good work and meet expectations, I expect a promotion this year after a year of work post grad. But our team is a little dysfunctional in the sense that it isn't a team and individuals are siloed on specific applications. We have little to no documentation. So anytime I am introduced to new tech or systems, my seniors really do hand hold me, to which I am appreciative of. I am not the type that asks the same questions over and over, I just need to see it once throughly and I can replicate what they've taught me.The problem is, after a year of this siloed style of work, I am getting burnt out. I can not stand coding. There have been multiple occasions for multiple projects where I have stayed at work alone and extremely late, staying until 8-10pm, just typing away at my computer. Recently I have been tasked with developing an entire web app alone. It's functionality seems simple but no application meant for production is ever simple. We are understaffed, so there is nobody else to divy up project tasks with. I've asked if we have any plans to get more entry hires on the team and it is always met with a soft no, the company is on a hiring freeze, economy yada yada.I talk with my friends from uni who are all working. Their teams practice agile and scrum philosophies, and their coding tasks are divided up for multipe team members. They love their jobs. Their eyes bulge when I tell them about my work load and my work effort. I always feel unfortunate when I hear about how lucky they have been, but really, it sounds like those types of tech teams are the standard and I am the unlucky one to have landed in an underdeveloped team. Senior developers can afford to ignore a team dynamic like this and still be successful in it.In my eyes, saying that this is too much work is basically telling them I am not up for the job and I might as well quit honestly. I know I can handle it, I mean I am meeting their latest expectation for an entire web application on my own, but I do not want to handle this anymore. It used to make me so happy to run an application and see the results of my hard work in action, but I genuinely can't even stand opening visual studio anymore.With how bad the job market is, I am scared to walk away. But I know if I continue to eat my feelings about this, I might turn impulsive and quit without any plan for my career or cut ties in a bad way. I don't want to fall into a slump.",

        "content": "I'm 23 years old, and I've had several part time/contract jobs for indie game development studios, and a wealth of programming projects. However, I have never had a full-time job. Unfortunately, my current part-time job has had struggles with finances, leaving me unable to afford paying bills for myself and my long-distance girlfriend without posting on social media begging for donations, even with both of us having part-time jobs. I've been searching for a job as a programmer for 3 years now, with no luck due to the major crash in both the game development and general software scene.I don't have a degree, but I've taught myself programming over the last 5 years and have what I'd consider pretty decent knowledge for a junior. I have 5 years of C++ and Python and 4 years of C#. I'm also quite experienced in Unreal Engine, and to a lesser degree, Unity. Additionally, I am versed in x86 and ARM assembly, as I spend a lot of time reverse engineering binaries in IDA Pro/Ghidra/Binary Ninja. However, I'm struggling to find jobs that meet my relatively lower-level language experience while hiring a junior dev in terms of workplace experience. Game development and malware analysis are probably where I'd do best, and I could definitely handle general software engineering, but the game development scene is obviously fucked, malware analysis jobs are extremely hard to come by, and my skillset doesn't include web development yet. I'd be fine with learning on the job, but it seems that these days, job postings require experience in almost every aspect to begin with.I'm aware that contacts are usually the best way to get a job in this industry, but all of my job-related contacts exist in the game dev sphere, and no one's hiring for roles that I'd meet in that scene at the moment. I don't have much connection to people in general software engineering or malware analysis. I cannot afford to travel even close distance due to lack of funds and physical disability, so I don't have much of a chance going to in-person developer meetups. My parents seem content to keep me stuck inside their house while having me pay rent monthly, so I cannot rely on them for funding or travel.This has obviously been taking a severe toll on my mental state, as I'm struggling to find work that pays me enough to allow me and my girlfriend to survive, let alone move in together. I'm pretty desperate for a job that pays half-decently, and due to my disability I don't think I could physically handle a minimum wage job, never mind the fact that it probably wouldn't be able to pay the bills where I live, around the Seattle area. I'm already barely earning more than minimum wage for where I live to begin with.If anyone is curious, [here's my GitHub page.](http://github.com/WistfulHopes)",

I generally love my job—I own features from backend to frontend, write my own Terraform, manage GCP resources, the works. It feels fulfilling to ship stuff that people actually see and use.The problem I’m experiencing is trying to get an internal promotion. I’ve been acting at a Senior level for a while. My manager pushed for my promotion last year, but the Director blocked it because they haven’t heard enough about me to deserve it and my manager cited \"people outside the team don't know me\" (I'm fully remote and introverted, don’t get a lot of opportunities to network). Now my manager wants me to rotate to another team for a quarter just to \"prove visibility\" before they consider the promo again. It feels like moving goalposts and political hoop-jumping, and hasn't been sitting well with me since.Recently, a recruiter reached out to me about a job at a late stage health tech startup, I went through the whole interview process not expecting to get it, but I did receive an offer. I negotiated it up and signed, but now I’m having intense buyer's remorse.* **Positives:** Senior title, good pay bump. Marketable tech stack.* **Negatives:** The work sounds like it could be pretty dry, mostly data processing and generating reports. No Greenfield development and I’d be working in a monorepo. I’m worried I’ll lose that spark I get from building new features for the website.* **Some weirdness:** I’d be reporting to a “manager” who is also an IC on the team. He’s never managed before and is new to interviewing. I’m worried he won’t have the clout to advocate for me or help me grow.Has anyone made a jump like this? Is reporting to a fellow IC on my team a massive red flag?I’m afraid I’m leaving a job I enjoy (mostly) for a place where I’ll be bored and stuck, just for money and to chase a title my current company is gatekeeping.",

I plan to take 2-3 years to finish the program then apply for new jobs once complete. I’m having some second thoughts about whether my time would be better spent working on personal projects relevant to my desired position instead of the degree. I have a pretty clear target area that I know I could work on side projects for, but I don’t know if this will be taken less seriously than certified courses. For anyone who has been in a similar position as me, do you think the degree was key for boosting your career? (I’m not worried about time commitment differences as I would be working the same in either case. The cost of the program is also not a factor.)Any advice is appreciated!",

Tech stack is mostly **.NET** (mix of legacy and .NET Core). I’m pulling in around **95k CAD TC** in a LCOL city (in the prairies) -- Hybrid position 1 day in the office. Did my CS degree at a top 3 Canadian university.The job is super stable, got good relationship with my team and my boss even sponsored my PR in 2023 (which I’m super grateful for). Future Projects are expected to be good (maybe closer to startup in terms of impact) but salary and my title might remain as is for years to come.But honestly, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m a bit underpaid, and on top of that, I’m pretty lonely here. While I have made friends with locals through sports activities, there's not a lot of community for people sharing my background (not from a typical immigrant country) compared to other prairie city I had moved from, and that’s starting to weigh on me.I’m thinking about moving to a different city perhaps BC, Alberta, Ottawa, maybe GTA. Ideally mid-to-large companies like banks, insurance or other legacy companies for stability. Planning to start applying early to mid next year since I need to stick around here for a few more months.Do you think I’ve got a decent shot at landing something in those cities? Preferably BC, AB or Ottawa. Any advice on timing, salary expectations, or companies to look at?**TL;DR:** Mid-20s, **5.5 YOE** (mostly .NET), making 95k CAD TC in a LCOL prairie city. Job is stable, good team, good projects but salary/title likely stagnant. Feeling lonely due to lack of cultural community. Thinking of moving to **BC, Alberta, Ottawa, or GTA** for better pay + diversity. Prefer mid-to-large companies for stability (banks, insurance, or legacy company). Planning to apply early/mid 2026.**Question:** Do I have a good shot at landing something in those cities? What are realistic salaries and companies to target?",

        "content": "Hi everyone!I'm 30, from Portugal, did a cs licence and master's and started working last year in a big 4, so I only have 1 year of experience doing data engineering. My goal has always been to be a versatile software engineer, I've always wanted to work with data, cloud, machine learning, devops (later in my career), qa and so on. But lately, my mind has been plagued with insecurities and I feel worried about my future. I'll try to provide as much context as possible.For starters, I have no idea where AI will take us and I'm starting to feel dependant on it after going through 4+ years without using it in college. The fun part of this field, for me, has always been to think and develop a solution to a problem, but I'm not a fast learner or fast thinker, and by the time I think of something, Copilot is giving me a much better answer in less than a minute. I don't know when and where to draw the line, when do I start to think \"Maybe I'm using too much AI now\" or \"I'm an engineer, I shouldn't be asking AI to help me solve this\"?Second, I feel like this field is starting to become a bit of everything, everywhere, all at once. There's constantly a new tech or stack to learn, then there's AI that you either embrace or refuse (with no clear winner here), then you also have to learn stuff from other subfields because they lay off people and you have to do the job of two, and the list goes on. I get home tired from +8h of work, I don't want to look at a screen and think \"Oh let's build a fun project or learn a new stack!\". I do try to get as much cloud certificates (aws, gc etc) as possible, since our company provides us the vouchers, but that's as far as I can motivate me to go.Then, I also feel like I'm trapped in this job because it's a project lottery and the market isn't looking fun for juniors. I'm working on building agents for our company and while this feels very up to date, I'm afraid it's only another hype that will fade with time and not get much use in the future. Somehow, due to the fact that I'm not coding much, I feel like I'll unlearn everything I've worked on for the past few years (and I did forget most of the stuff from college already) and then I won't have the required skills for better jobs in the future.I also really dislike the country I live in because of our extremely high rent prices and very low salaries (a 1bedroom apt is 50% of my salary right now). This makes me want to move to another country, but I don't know if it might be a good fit, if the market is also terrible there or if I even have a shot with all the competition.Bottom line of all of this is: **I never know if what I'm doing will help me grow and prepare me for a better future, and I don't know what's the right path to follow because I'm in constant doubt and uncertainty. I can't get motivated to work because I don't know if what I'm doing is meaningful to my future and I can't focus on one thing at a time.**Have any of you felt like this or have any advice to help me address this?",

Got laid off in 2017, but just as I was starting to look for a new job, my father unexpectedly passed away, and I had to step away from engineering to help support a family real estate business. I was never really passionate about the business, and frankly had to teach myself everything to make it work. I've been able to keep the business afloat, but just barely, and as I'm looking to get married and have a family soon, I know the income from that business just won't be able to support a family. So I've decided to sell the business and try going back to SWE. The problem is, from what I can tell, the job market is horrible, and it's even worse with an 8 year gap in my resume. My background was primarily as a Java developer, but my last couple years at the trading firm I did a fair amount of work in Spark, so I've decided to lean into the data engineering angle and have been teaching myself modern Spark and cloud computing to brush up on my skills in my free time. I know I will probably have to start back at a level 1 or maybe 2 role given my resume gap, and I've already sent my resume out to a few companies I thought might be a good fit through linkedIn, but have gotten zero calls back. I'm reaching out to the community here to see what everyone's advice is on what I should do to maximize my chances of getting my foot in the door. Should I look for recruiters? Take some sort of certification course? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

        "content": "Hello, I recently graduated with a CS degree, and think I need to develop a more long term plan.What my goals are:The past 6 months I have been applying to junior developer roles, but not getting any interviews.I did an informational interview with someone working public cybersecurity in the Operational tech security field, and they advised making a 5 year plan. I spoke with them because I am also interested in a cybersecurity career as well. While I enjoy writing software more, I feel cybersecurity will be a more secure career in the long term.The truth is that I will take any tech job I can get, for any salary above minimum wage. But I understand that I need to have more specific goals and a plan. So I’m leaning towards committing to cybersecurity, creating a 5 year plans. As for what area in cybersecurity, I don’t know, but I’m thinking DevSecOps or other software security roles.My understanding is that cybersecurity is not an intro role and I need to work on personal project + certifications -> help desk role -> IT role -> more cyber security focused role.There’s so many certifications out there, I was recommend ISC2 to start with by the person I spoke to. I’m a little nervous about how expensive most certifications are, and ISC2 has an annual fee. What have I done so far:I have a portfolio with 3 demos for apps I made , some using ML. For example I made a custom pipeline that predicts if someone will be approved a bank loan based on historical data. This portfolio probably won’t help if I pivot to cybersecurity.Any advice on creating a plan in general, or choosing a career path, or what certifications to go for with the path I described would be greatly appreciated.",

The big issue is that, while I work with the biggest bank in my country, I don't do any programming stuff. I feel my abilities are rotting away and while my goal is set on becoming a spring boot developer in the future since I work in the area of production microservices L2 so I am somewhat familiar with them. Yet, I would like to know what is the market like for freelancing.I have read that for Java Spring Boot developing it is one of the least requested since it is a lot of work that requires a lot of budget and time to develop and deploy applications. I am also not interested in something like Javascript nor frontend developing.My skills are in python and C++ but never done a project nor worked with a framework. Can you give me advice on which technologies are on demand and well paid when it comes to programming languages?I forgot to mention that in my current work almost all days, in reality, I am working up to 3 hours because the job is so relaxed from my side of microservices. So even if I don't end up able to switch to developing Java microservices in spring boot full time at least I want to use that dead time actually working on stuff and earning money from it.",

I started college in 2021, and my financial aid will likely be cut off after this coming spring. At this point, I still have 10 CS classes left (about 28 credits), which would require at least another year or more to finish.I’m considering switching to a Business Management major with a minor in CS, where I would have 8 classes left (about 11 credits) instead.For context, I recently got a tech-related internship this past fall, and my resume is very tech focused, mainly around data analytics. I’m comfortable with technical tools, but my preferred role after graduation is data analyst or a tech role that requires minimal coding, rather than heavy software engineering.Given the financial aid situation, time to graduate, and my career goals, I’m trying to decide whether it makes more sense to:•Push through and finish the CS degree, or•Switch to Business Management + CS minor and continue building technical experience on the sideI’d really appreciate any insight from people who’ve faced a similar decision or are working in data/tech roles. Was sticking with CS worth it, or did a business/analytics path work out just as well?This may sound all over the place. But thanks for reading. Any advice would be greatly appreciated",

It's been a combination of factors including two family deaths around the same time that's not helped motivation in early interviews so probably killed chances with the better companies that were hiring at the time, my being laid off around the intermediate / mid-level which is already short of recruitment due to those roles usually being filled internally, (edit:) and half the work I did being under NDA so I have to be stupidly vague with what I did (with the tech I used being too generic to even be worth mentioning).I have tried to apply to senior roles as my experience should qualify me, but the death knell there is I have experience in leading a team which most of them are looking for. And I'm being denied for junior roles because recruiters say I'm overqualified (which I kinda figured). In both cases I'm almost never getting to the interview stage, I've had less than 6 over the past year and all but 2 of those were in late 2024.In late December and late last week half the jobs I'm finding on recruitment sites are for frontend, which I have partial experience in from my last job thanks to the (frustrating) push for everyone to be full stack. At this rate I'm considering retraining or learning FE stuff and making the switch, but that feels like it could be just as difficult to find a job with when not working because I'd lack the pretence of \"experience\".Tldr; backend job market in the UK sucks, considering retraining in / learning frontend to improve my prospects.

        "content": "Hi all, I'm currently a junior in college. After dabbling in various areas that tech has to offer through internships and projects, I became interested in building the systems/infrastructure behind the AI/ML models that are in use nowadays. However, I couldn't find much information online on what this role even does because it seems relatively new and highly specialized. I am hoping to gather insight from industry professionals on things like:1. Is AI/ML Infrastructure basically just DevOps/MLOps? Or is it more involved (i.e. coding-wise, distributed systems, etc.)? 2. Could you explain what the day-to-day looks like? If you could also describe what a typical sprint (something like a new project task) looks like, that'd be great too. 3. Is a Master's/PhD necessary for this type of engineering? Personally, I am planning on attending my school's +1 Master's program, which (hopefully) will complement my knowledge/skills in this speciality. 4. On a related note... Is this role entry-level friendly? I.e. is it something that will be extremely difficult to break into as a new grad? If so, what would the career progression look like to eventually end here? 5. What type of courseload is most important? I'll be taking Distributed Systems next semester, Operating Systems in my senior year... It's admittedly quite \"late\" in my college career since I took a while trying to figure out what I wanted to do. These are recommendations that ChatGPT recommended to me but am seeking some further details from real experts and professionals.

Got hired at the end of first year for one of side projects of community member. Fell in love with coding and worked really hard through the summer. Afterwards got an offer into well-established YC-backed company and currently working there as Software Engineer.And honestly - I love every bit of it. But I see two very big problems at the horizon which am not sure how to tackle yet:\\- Working with AI is too much. Since I started my serious commitment on a very early stage kind of project - I got used to the principle of speed is the key. And because of that I did a lot of coding with AI (cursor). I didn’t cut it off correctly early enough, and now when I am trying to write code on my own - it takes much more time I feel like I am falling out if industry-needed pace. I can’t say that I am vibe-coding, because I am still very responsible for my code, and I know precisely how something is implemented, and I am not doing “Claude pls code feature” as well, but still like I am feeling that I won’t be able to write code if I don’t have access to AI instruments. So there’s my first question. How normal it is? How do you define an edge between AI slob and speed ups that AI can provide?\\- Vector of further development? I am trying to study the stuff beyond my actual responsibilities, and I feel like my next big choice is choice of supplementary skills: doing distribution (sales, marketing, PMF and all that kind of stuff) VS digging deeper into architecture, devops and deeply engineering kinds of topics.Argument of first approach for me are the fact that I can be more independent, but that’s not something I particularly like.Arguments for the second approach are the fact that I love it, but again I love it because I am able to move with fast pace because I have AI. Also, I am not sure how relevant those skills are compared to distribution (e.g Technical guy who can sell is much more desirable part of a startup than just deeply technical guy)Your feedback is very important to me and is truly appropriated",

Currently, I’m responsible for the administration, support, and implementation of two new enterprise applications across the organization.I’ve been leading the setup end-to-end, including:Working directly with the app vendors to configure Entra ID, SSO, and SCIMOnboarding and offboarding usersSupporting users with access and usage issuesCoordinating with 80+ group leaders to generate custom activity and spending reports for their teams (over 6,000 users total)To handle reporting, I built Python scripts (with the help of AI) that pull data from the apps’ APIs and sync it with Entra ID. I’m not a developer by background, but I have basic scripting knowledge and learned what was needed to get this working.On top of that:I created additional scripts for internal billingParticipated in multiple meetings with Security teams to evaluate and approve the appsActed as the single point of contact for vendors, security, group leaders, and end usersI’m essentially handling this entire project alone, from technical implementation to stakeholder management and ongoing support.I am struggling to find a \"name\" for this role in order to update my CV, since I am not a developer, DevOps, or anything related that I can identify with.(Made a similar post in another subreddit, IAM looks like )",

I took machine learning classes in college and also a databases class in college so I have some exposure but I've never worked directly in these roles yet. I subscribed to datacamp so I can practice the assignments and tests from them. I'm also wondering should I go back for my masters? What could I do to make myself more marketable for these particular roles?",

        "content": "am about to start applying to new jobs again after being at my first job out of school for 4 years. My question is this, if you apply for multiple SWE positions at a company and one recruiter gets back to you first and you start the process but fail at say the 2nd round, if another recruiter for the other position you applied to at the same place reaches out could you just start the process again and hope you get a better problem that you can solve. I am asking this because a few years ago I did this scenario where I went through one cycle and got to the 2nd round but did not pass, then that same week another recruiter for the other position I applied to reached out to start. Being the naive new grad I was, I thought I was being a good boy by being honest and telling the recruiter I had already gone through the process recently and if I could still proceed with his cycle. Obviously he did not let me lol. Looking back I am wondering if I should just keep my mouth shut and not said anything. I know this might vary per company depending on how generic early round interviews and if they keep you in a general pool and then narrowing the team at the end vs a place where each job posting going down separate cycles. I know companies have a cooldown period when you can apply again but I’m wondering if you fail early enough in the cycle could you test your chances again in this scenario.I would appreciate hearing peoples’ experiences on this, thanks!",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m late 20s now, psychology & data science degrees and considering a maths masters.Worked throughout education. Initially started as a IC analyst, later promoted to senior/engineer. I spent the majority of my time at that company in a hybrid technical/leadership role (5 years). Moved to a government department in 2021 as a data scientist, quickly promoted to leading the DS team and worked in senior DS leadership positions since, mostly management responsibilities with some technical data science work. At the moment I wear a lot of hats and am good at everything, but not a specialist in anything. Basically anything remotely linked to data becomes my remit. Plus, a lot of my time gets soaked up in HR issues & firefighting. so I can’t focus as much with being a technical specialist as I am spread thin although I’ve always wanted to progress as a data engineer. I have had a good career with executive level responsibilities and I am wondering if I should just fully pivot into pure leadership now, and maybe make it a goal to get a “head of” or director position in the next few years. I’m hesitant because I still feel fairly young and that I have more to give when it comes to engineering but I’m not sure what the best path is for me. It’s just becoming abundantly clear that I can’t do it all and I probably should narrow my focus. Interested to hear from anyone who made a similar decision and what swayed you.",
