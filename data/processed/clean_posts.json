I’d love to start a casual weekly call where we can talk data engineering, swap stories, and learn from each other.Over time, if there’s interest, this could turn into things like a textbook or whitepaper club, light presentations, or deeper dives into topics people care about. Totally flexible.**What you’d get out of it:*** Hearing how other people think about DE problems* Learning stuff that doesn’t always come up in day-to-day work* Getting exposure to different career paths and ways of working* Practical ideas you can actually use**Some topics I’m especially interested in:*** Performance and scaling* Systems thinking* Data platforms and infrastructure* FinOps / cost awareness* Reliability, observability, and ops* Architecture tradeoffs (build vs buy, etc.)* How data stacks evolve as companies growThis is mainly for early-to-mid career folks, but anyone curious is welcome. If this sounds interesting, reach out and we’ll see what happens.",

        "content": "In almost every company that I've worked at (mid to large enterprises), we faced many issues with \"the source of truth\" due to any number of reasons, such as inconsistent logic applied to reporting, siloed data access and information, and others. If a business user came back with a claim that our reports were inaccurate due to comparisons with other sources, we would potentially spend hours trying to track the lineage of the data and compare any transformations/logic applied to pinpoint exactly where the discrepancies happen.I've been building a tool on the side that could help mitigate this by auto-ingesting metadata from different database and BI sources, and tracking lineage and allowing a better way to view everything at a high-level.But as I was building it, I realized that it was similar to a lightweight version of a Data Catalog. That got me wondering why more organizations don't use a Data Catalog to keep their data assets organized and tie in the business definitions to those assets in an attempt to create a source of truth. I have actually never worked within a data team that had a formatlized data catalog; we would just do everything including data dictionaries and business glossaries in excel sheets if there was a strong business request, but obviously those would quickly become stale.**What's been your experience with Data Catalog? If your organization doesn't use one, then why not (apart from the typically high cost)?**My guess is the maintenance factor as it could be a nightmare maintaining updated business context to changing metadata especially in orgs without a specialized data governance steward or similar. I also don't see alot of business users using it if the software isn't intuitive, and general tool fatigue.",

It would almost be a no-brainer, since the software is massively useful but is still not widely adopted.Why hasn't this happened yet? Are there licensing restrictions that I'm overlooking?

All joins happen one after another on a unique customer ID.Most tasks run fine but after all joins any action like count or display becomes painfully slow or sometimes fails. I’ve already increased executor memory and memory overhead, tweaked shuffle partition counts, repartitioned and persisted between joins, and even scaled the cluster to 2-8 workers with 28 GB RAM and 8 cores each. Nothing seems to fix it.At first I thought it would be simple since the added tables are small. Turns out that the many joins combined with column renaming forced Spark to do broadcast nested loop joins instead of faster broadcast hash joins. Changing join types helped a lot.Has anyone run into something like this in production? How do you usually handle multiple joins without killing performance? Any tips on caching, join strategies, or monitoring tools would be really helpful. TIA",

        "content": "Currently, I'm interning in data management, focusing mainly on data analysis. Although I enjoy the field, I've been studying and reflecting a lot about migrating to Data Engineering, mainly because I feel it connects much more with computer science, which is my undergraduate course, and with programming in general.The problem is that I'm full of doubts about whether I'm going down the right path. At times, this has generated a lot of anxiety for me—to the point of spending sleepless nights wondering if I'm making the wrong choices or getting ahead of myself.The company where I'm interning offers access to Google Cloud Skills Boost, and I'm taking advantage of it to study GCP (BigQuery, pipelines, cloud concepts, etc.). Still, I keep wondering:Am I doing the right thing by going straight to the cloud and tools, or should I consolidate more fundamentals first?Is it normal for this transition to start out \"confusing\" like this?I would also really appreciate recommendations for study materials (books, courses, learning paths, practical projects) or even tips from people who already work as Data Engineers. Honestly, I'm a little lost — that's the reality. I identified quite a bit with Data Engineering precisely because it seems to deal much more with programming, architecture, and pipelines, compared to the more analytical side.For context, today I have contact/knowledge with:• Python• SQL• R• Databricks (creating views to feed BI)• A little bit of Spark• pandasI would really like to hear the experience of those who have already gone through this migration from Data Analytics to Data Engineering, or those who started directly in the area.What would you do differently looking back?Thank you in advance",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,I am building a databricks notebook that joins roughly 6 tables into a main table. Some joins require some of the main table, whilst other joins will use the whole main table. Each join table has a few keys.My question is what is the best architecture to perform the join without having an out of memory / stack overflow error? Currently I have written a linear script which sequentially goes through each table and does the join. This is slow and confusing to look at. As such other developers cannot make sense of the code (despite me adding comments) and im the main point of contact.Solutions tried:* I had tried to write a function that performs multiple joins using a while loop. However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error. Sometimes i get a driver error and the whole notebook fails to continue to run.* I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persisted. As such we had to roll back to the linear way i wrote before.* I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impact.* Caching after some joins but problem persists. Other information:* Small tables - row count roughly 50-100* main table - as of now row count roughly 50k* join type - left join on main table * All tables are already cleansed and are delta tables * Technologies: databricks, pyspark, ADF, ADLSSide question: I used to be a software engineer and now moved to being a data engineer. Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without? in terms of time complexity and clean code writing? My assumption is the former but after a few months of writing pyspark code i believe the correct answer is the latter? Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?",

This also works because we have the bronze and gold layer setup in BigQuery Storage itself and BigQuery works good for our analytical workloads. I have been learning Spark on the side with local clusters and was wondering what is typical data size Pyspark is used to handle ? How many DE here actually use Pyspark vs simply modes of ETL. Trying to understand when a setup like Pyspark is helpful ? What is typical dataset size you guys work etc. Any production level insights/discussion would be helpful.",

I have around four years experience as an analyst and almost a year in data engineering, but the role is extremely high-pressure and I've been burnt out for about the last 6 months, I'm just pushing hard to get through it. Note, I've spoken to my colleagues and they agree our workload definitly exceeds what the norm is in other companies, rather than this being a skill issue. I’ve been offered a six-month contract in a familiar area that is data related but significantly less stress and a role I have done before. I would earn my annual salary in 6 months and definitly get some mental health recovery, but I’m worried that stepping away from data engineering so early, especially given how fast the field and AI tooling are evolving, could make it difficult to re-enter as I would be unfamialir with the new tools / processes. I personally am quite worried about job security in the near to mid future and don't want to further damage my prospects. At my current role we are literally using and upgrading our AI tech stack on a weekly basis and it's hard enough to keep up while I'm in it, let alone if I leave the domain. All to say, with the constant improvements and upgrades in AI and essentially my current role shifting from programming and more to ideation and agent managment, would taking a break to make noticably more money and give me a mental health break be a bad idea due to the struggles of then re-entering the market. I'd appreciate any opinions, I'm all ears!Thanks all !",

        "content": "Hi everyone! I was recently fortunate enough to land a Data Engineering internship at Meta this summer and wanted to ask for advice on how best to prepare.I’m currently a junior in undergrad with a background primarily in software engineering and ML-oriented work. Through research and projects, I’ve worked on automating ML preprocessing pipelines, data cleaning, and generating structured datasets (e.g., CSV outputs), so I have some exposure to data workflows. That said, I know production-scale data engineering is a very different challenge, and I’d like to be intentional about my preparation.From what I’ve read, Meta’s approach to data engineering is fairly unique compared to many other companies (heavy SQL usage, large-scale analytics), and a lot of internal tooling. Right now, I’m working through the dataexpert .io free bootcamp, which has been helpful, but I’m hoping to supplement it with additional resources or projects that more closely resemble the work I’ll be doing on the job.Ideally, I’d like to build a realistic end-to-end project, something along the lines of:* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)* Extracting data from multiple sources* Building a DAG-based pipeline* Surfacing insights through a dashboard# Questions:1. For those who’ve done Data Engineering at Meta (or similar companies), what skills mattered most day-to-day?2. Are there any tools, paradigms, or core concepts you’d recommend focusing on ahead of time (especially knowing Meta uses a largely internal stack)?3. On the analytical side, what’s the best way to build intuition, should I try setting up my own data warehouse, or focus more on analysis and dashboards using public datasets?4. Based on what I described, do you have any project ideas or recommendations that would be especially good prep?For reference I am not sure which team I am yet and I have roughly 5 months to prep (starts in May)",

I'm basically the CTO and a generalist/developer/architect, and what I really lack in the data engineering space is someone to bounce my ideas off. So please feel free to poke holes in any of this.**Priorities*** **High** \\- Cost effective, low-code, avoid lock-in (eg OSS)* **Low** \\- Performance, real-time**Sources*** Shopify Plus (customers, products, orders)* GA* Xero* A subscription tool called SKIO with an AP**I****Why BigQuery**I find it pretty cheap if you are judicious about what goes in it. So for example we have about 150k orders per year and I don't need line items because Shopify does that deeper analysis really well. BigQuery would eat that up out volume.**Why Looker**I think Looker is very cost effective and can plug in lots of stuff. For eg I can have Spreadsheets for some data and join it in Looker to BigQuery.**Why AirByte**A big part of this is deciding on an ETL. When I started we were using Celigo but found them to be pretty inflexible on billing. It's just a good example of lock-in I want to avoid. So I've been testing the Airbyte Shopify->BigQuery connector and it seems to do what i need. While it has the commercial solution, I feel confident I can switch to the community (open source) version later if I wanted to self host an ETL (which i think is a good long-term strategy in this day and age).**Lock-in thoughts**We are a Microsoft/Sharepoint place and while I don't dislike Azure I'm not a huge fan of Microsoft. We happened to already have Looker and GA because our Shopify vendor preferred it, and the business has never questioned this. So essentially I've put a Google Cloud strategy around these tools, and adding BigQuery is a bit of a no brainer. Obviously there is cloud lock-in to Google here, but in the massive event of Google dropping Looker/BigQuery I reckon we would survive as a business since most of our operational stuff is over in Shopify.**Doubts**The Shopify analytics platform is insanely good. If I could add some custom data to it I wouldn't be here writing this post. But I don't think that's in their business strategy to be a generic BI tool.Unexpected costs are always a concern. Monitoring unexpected cloud costs, or regretting a SaaS product when you see \"Contact Sales for Pricing\" on some feature. I dunno if I can avoid that.",

But this has caused some issues with file locking / syncing when S3 Events are used to trigger Lambdas.As alternatives, I've looked at AWS Transfer Family Web Apps / SFTP - however this seems to require additional set up (such as VPCs or users needing to use desktop apps like FileZilla for access).I've also looked at Storage Browser for S3, though it seems this would need to be embedded into an existing application rather than used as a standalone solution, and authentication would need to be handled separately.Am I missing something obvious here? Is there a simpler way of doing this in AWS? I'd be interested to hear how others have done this in AWS - securely allowing internal users to upload files to S3 as a landing zone for data to be ingested?",

Note : There is no one in my team currently ( I am only one in the Data Team ) I have a setup a data pipeline in our company. Tools used:1. AirflowSnowflake (US region)PowerBI.Bigquery Flow: Raw Mobile App events (From Firebase) -> Bigquery -> Snowflake -> PowerBI (Entire pipeline is orchestrated by Airflow). All the transformations for creating One big table, Fct tables, aggregate tables will be done by Snowflake and stored in Snowflake itself. The powerBi is connected to the Agg data. The visuals are created on top of the data loaded (via Import mode) using the DAX in powerBI. The thing is our mobile app and some backed data (which will be used for joining along with the Mobile event data) has users data which is region specific. App will have users from different regions. I don't know so much knowledge about the compliance and all. But our founder said that that each country data should be stored in particular region. To avoid the issues due to the compliance, I have make these things in a way. There is one person (He is working in another company Apple(like a friend of my founder), will suggest some things like a mentor but he has not have much time to interact with me ), suggested for the s3 + iceberg. But I have so many questions like :1. Which tools to use ?If I have to process the data, some compute engines like there (Snowflake, Presto, Trino) is there. Do we have to setup each instance per region for processing each region data ? Guys, If you have anything to help me, i am open to hear. If I failed to explain my scenario to you, sorry for that.",

The problem is Power BI exports to PPT as images, so every small change means re-exporting the entire deck.

We've been building a tool that makes working with data extremely easy.Specifically focused on the ad-hoc / last minute analytics segment, and data science (although using it for data engineering is totally possible too).Some of the capability includes loading data from any source, cleaning, graphing it, writing raw SQL, exporting, etc.A while back I posted on this forum about our ability to preview parquet directly from the OS... We've taken that and expanded it into this!For those interested in the tech stack:1. C++ for internal processing engine + DuckDB, Swift + AppKit for UI2. Wrote our own custom caching engine, and SQL transpiler in C++. Transpiler takes DuckDB SQL and converts it into native SQL for full predicate pushdown (i.e. Athena, BigQuery, ClickHouse, Snowflake, Postgres, etc).3. Wrote our own graphing library from scratch, all GPU native using custom shaders.4. Wrote a custom Amazon S3 OS integration to replicate S3 buckets on Finder. Intercepts sys-level calls to reference remote data.5. Super limited use of AI code. i.e. no vibe coding. Claude is high as a kite. Can't deal with that.We've put a ton of effort into this, so hope you find it cool!You can check it out here: [www.cocoalemana.com](https://www.cocoalemana.com)Thanks :)[](/submit/?source_id=t3_1q8074h)",

The department is a mix of those with stellar academic records, random degrees and people like me who fell into the work - I've found a similar split at most organisations and businesses I've worked with or met at conferences.I've experience working with a ton of different systems and a variety of stakeholders both within the organisation and externally such as software companies, central government departments etc. to tackle complex operational problems.I started my career using basic SQL, Excel and VBA. Currently I'm using advanced SQL (including performance tuning, building pipelines and data warehousing), Python (mainly pandas, numpy and matplotlib), Power BI (with a great understanding of DAX and TMDL, plus I do some platform administration). I've a sound(ish) knowledge of stats, though we don't really using anything too advanced.

My employer has offered to put me through a degree apprenticeship (not sure how familiar people are with those outside the UK), with the Open University, a distance-learning university.Recently, I applied for ten BI/DA jobs in other companies (just to test my marketability) and was invited to eight, so I'm not worried at all about the immediate term in my current area of work, I'm just concerned about whether I'd have a place in DE over the long term?

I am not sure on how to approach optimizing this SQL snippet, challenge is that some of tables which I am using in joins are actually neater views themselves, so the thing becomes quite large.Here are the options I have come up so far:1. Materialising the nested view as it is used across multiple places, I am not sure if Spark caches the result for reuse or if it recomputes is every time but couldn't hurt to have a table?2. Try to find stages with the largest time and see if I can pinpoint the issue, I am not sure if the stage will provide enough hints to identify the offending logic any tips on what to look for in stages?

Essentially, the partner does a full table replication and we do cdc to only save the deltas since we already have the rest of the data from a prior replication. The vendor is not able to send us log based cdc.While we're building this out, I'm thinking ahead and thought about what happens if the data is wrong (vendor needed to fix something) or there's a bug in the cdc detection on our side. From the way this is built, we'd have to delete all data starting from when the bug was introduced and backfill day by day. This doesn't seem sustainable, and so I was wondering if there's a pattern I'm not aware of?The data is transactional and non-transactional. For some data, we'd need to know when something was inserted/deleted from a table, hence the day to day delta detection.",

I’m trying to decide which (if any) of these projects to showcase on my CV/portfolio/LinkedIn, and I’d love if you could take a very quick look and give me some feedback on which are likely to strengthen vs hurt my CV/portfolio. [**data-tech-stats**](https://github.com/simon-milata/data-tech-stats) ([Live Demo](https://dts.simonmilata.com/)) My latest project which I'm still finishing up. The point of this project was to actually deploy something real while keeping the costs close to 0 and to design an actual API. The DE part is getting the data from GitHub, storing it in S3, aggregating and then visualizing it. My worry is that this project might be a bit too simple and generic. [**Study-Time-Tracker-Python**](https://github.com/simon-milata/Study-Time-Tracker-Python) This was my first actual project and the first time using git so the code quality and git usage weren't great. It's also not at all something I would do at work and might seem too amateurish. I do think it's pretty cool tho as it looks pretty nice, is unique and even has a few stars and forks which I think is pretty rare.[**TkinterOS**](https://github.com/simon-milata/TkinterOS) This was my second project which I made cause I saw GodotOS and thought it would be cool to try to recreate it using Tkinter. It includes a bunch of games and an (unfinished) file system. It also has a few stars but the code quality still is still bad. Very unrelated to work too. I know this might feel out of place being posted on a DE sub but these are the only presentable projects I have so far and I'm mostly interested in DE. These projects were mostly made to practice python and make stuff. For my next project I'm planning on learning PySpark and trying Redshift / Databricks. My biggest issue is that I feel like the difficulty of DE is the the scale of the data and regulations which is very hard / very expensive to recreate. I also don't really want to make simple projects which just transform some fake data once. Sorry for the blocks of text I have no idea how to write reddit posts. Thank you for taking the time to read this. :)",

I know tha usually we have dim tables and fact tables but what i have observed is that would create one big table with say year fy 2026 repeating across. Is it because snowflake is cheap and can handle a lot of stuff that works?",

Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com* The 3rd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/* I do plan on updating the Udemy course, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.* **You're not too old to learn to code.

        "author": "ifoundacookie",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Post was longer than I expected, TL;DR: High-school level programming experience in Processing/Scratch/Python/Java and 4 weeks experience with C++ about 13 years ago when I was 14. Want to learn programming for game dev. Don't care that they're not entry level languages. Okay, I know, I know, neither of these are beginner friendly at all but honestly I dont care. Im just wanting to learn game dev and I want something I can use for logic that needs to be quick and efficient, like terrain gen, etc. I have some experience in the really basic shit like Processing, Scratch, and Java by taking comp sci in HS but I was an awful student. I also took a 4 week summer camp between my freshman and sophomore years of HS that was for learning simple game dev through C++ but it was REALLY basic and I just made a short 10-minute text adventure. That being said, I have learned about Rust recently and everyone fuckn loves it and I've seen people making some really interesting things with it using its extension for Godot. From my ignorant perspective, C++ seems like a good option to understand more what's going on under the hood, having to manually manage memory and shit, and also has much faster compile times (which ive already experienced when compiling Rust demos in Godot Jesus christ), as well as possibly better job prosepects and translates easier to other languages as I understand Rust is a fairly unique language. With Rust it seems like it's more annoying because you HAVE to handle your memory errors SOMEHOW because the borrow checker thing just doesn't let you fuck that up, as well as maybe being more difficult to understand because of its owner-borrower system or whatever its called, but the whole thing makes sense to me conceptually, not sure how easily I'll be able to implement it tho. (But it seems like it would at least be easier to debug, no?) I've watched videos on both and I haven't been able to find a great answer as to whether one would be better for a beginner. Again, I dont care to learn something more basic, I'm already going to be using plenty of GDScript so I will be learning a simpler language anyway so anything I just simply can't do at my skill level at the moment I'll just fall back on that till I sharpen up with Rust/C++.Appreciate any advice or insight into this question and sorry for the long ass post.",

But lately I have been feeling that I am honestly getting dumber. I feel like even the small amount of knowledge I had is fading away. I have been using AI to help me learn (but lets be honest, I have used it to generate a lot of code for me) and that made me lazy. I was getting frustrated with when AI wasn't doing what i wanted it to do and I kept asking and asking until it gave me a solution, not necessarily a good one. And I kept going.Has anyone felt the same way using AI? It honestly made me dumber. At some point I had to google the syntax for a for loop. And not that I was just blindly accepting all the code it generate. I was reading it, I was re-typing it (mindlessly), but at the end of the day I felt like I was loosing the little knowledge I have. This feel like the AA (Anonymous AI) rant. But I have been forcing myself to stop using AI. No code completions, no code generation. Just me, VSCode (which is also all about AI) and good old Google. I honestly feel a lot more satisfied when I write my own code and I enjoy that feeling of \"ah I got it working\".

        "content": "Yes, I know, Assembly isn't used much these days outside of a few cases and reverse engineering, probably easier to learn C or Python, etc. But I want to learn ASM because I've always been intrigued and for some of the stuff I want to do, I need to know how to read it.**Edit:** My goals are to be able to read assembly so I can disassemble, reverse engineer, or edit some games. The Playstation 1 and 2 use MIPS architecture, the Gameboy and GBC use z80, and most modern applications and games use x86-64, which is why I'm torn between the three.I don't have a computer science background and my career isn't anything close to CS unless you count working in excel. I also don't anticipate switching careers. This is purely something I want to do in mh free tkme. I understand basic computer concepts but don't know how to code or program. I've made a few game mods, I can look at code and change a thing or two, and I can locate some stuff in memory to freeze or edit via emulator or CE, but that's probably as close as I've gotten. Anyways, I am wondering if there are any great online courses or books I can follow that are good for people with little to no CS background? I'm torn between x86, MIPS, or z80, but leaning towards x86 since it seems more comprehensive and I would think going from CISC to RISC would be easier than the inverse. I rented the book *Assembly X64 Programming in Easy Steps: Modern Coding for MASM, SSE and AVX* from my library since that was all they had. Not sure how that compares to some of the other resources out there.",

        "author": "BrosVGK",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "so for context, when i was in first/second year of middle school, i meet some people who were good with pc's / know how to program. I talked to them a bit about it and it managed to get me into programming and learning about pc's and on and off for a few years, i would try and learn C# because i was curious to try and learn how to make a game, and i was into pc's because i wanted to know how pc's work (hardware wise, not software). Fastforward to graduating high school recently (i graduated in june). When it was time for me to pick my future career i decided i wanted to go to computer science (a bit off topic but i was also into music, specifically playing the guitar and wanting to learn about music theory, and i like to learn to draw) and even though i was into those other hobbies, i picked computer science because i thought i could make some decent money from it, however thats when things went down the hill. When i first started, things weren't too hard, i managed to understand some early stuff. I was learning C++ and general computer theory, and when it came to computer theory i was good at it, because in my mind it was easy. Then when November / December came, everything just didnt make sense. I couldnt even pay attention in classes because i just couldnt understand it and when i try and learning it on my own i still couldnt get it. It got pretty bad because i would cry many nights and being constantly stressed at me not understanding the subjects and that i didnt want to fail my classes. Eventually my school finally had christmas holidays and im still having them as im writing this, but yesterday or before yesterday (it was on jan 2) i got an email from two of my professors (one for programming and another for computer theory) where the computer theory would make a test on things that we learnt for a bit before christmas holidays and from my programming teacher where we would get a midterm on stuff we did from november / december. At that point i just started breaking down because i just dont want to go through that awful experience anymore of being constantly worried and stressed, feeling as if i was on the edge, and one screw up would ruin everything for me. So i guess what im asking is should i even continue my course or should i pick a different career for my life (i was thinking of maritime studies because my dad is an expert in maritime since he worked for 40+ years in it) at this point, im lost and i dont know what to do with my future.thanks for anyone who read the whole essay of a post. But to give a TLDR version: was into computers since middle school, graduated high school, got into compsci for my career, in the beginning understood the material but later i didnt get it, started having panic attacks and stress, dont know what to do.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I am trying to learn programming and have a question about frameworks/programming languages.I have made a simple HTTP-based API in both python (using fastAPI) and java (using Spring Boot).In fastAPI framework, I notice that I mainly write functions which are either passed in as parameters into other functions or called by other functions. To me, this makes sense from my perspective, or at least feels intuitive. I can literally see the programming \"primitives\" I wrote interacting with each other in my source code. For example, I build an endpoint like```python@APIRouter().get(\"/blah\")def get_blah(): return \"blah\"```then I must tell my main FastAPI() object about the routes using `.include_router()`. Nice. I can also somewhat imagine whats going on in my head, like the `APIRouter` object has some record of all the routes I defined via the decorator and that object is being passed to my `FastAPI()` object.Spring Boot, on the other hand, I notice that I create classes, and some of these classes are never instantiated! At least they're certainly never called in my source code. I can run my application with Gradle and the class I created that was never instantiated actually did something. E.g., I make this class```java@RestControllerpublic class TextController { @GetMapping(\"/texts\") public List getTexts() { return service.getTexts(); }}```but I never wrote \"TextController blah = new TextController()\" anywhere?Like, I feel more in control of my FastAPI application than I do with my Spring application? Do others feel like this? Do I just chalk up the framework differences to \"thats how the authors who designed each framework intended it to be\"?",

The learning and problem-solving is what’s fun for me.I guess I’m just not sure where to go from here. I like learning but there’s really no point in me spending a ton of time getting good at programming for it to give me nothing in return",

        "content": "Just wrapped up a month-long project using C++, SDL2, and ImGui. I set out to make a simple app that has the very basic features of Lightroom, but I quickly realized that architecture is a completely different beast than programming the logic. It only does the bare minimum of what I originally planned, and I’m struggling with the feeling that I should have pushed harder. But at this point, the passion for this specific codebase is gone, and I just want to move on.I learned a lot about the build process and package management, but the codebase ended up as a bit of a spaghetti mess. I’m at the point where I’ve learned enough to see exactly why my current design is flawed, which makes it feel impossible to keep working on it without a 100% rewrite.I underestimated how hard it would be to design the software. It took me a while to actually set all the dependencies up. Then came writing the pipeline for it to actually be usable. But with each thing I added, I realized another thing had to be fixed or improved. By the time I had implemented the basic features, I'd gone through countless rewrites. Despite my efforts to keep it as decoupled as I could, the codebase was never as clean as I had wanted it to be.I don't exactly regret making this project since I learned a lot from it. However, I feel like I'd feel a lot better right now if I put that effort elsewhere, or if I actually completed all the features I'd planned on implementing. But I just can't bring myself to work on it any longer. If I want it to be well made then I would have to rewrite the whole thing. It also sucks because as shallow of a reason as it may be, I was looking forward to having something to show off on my GitHub :(",

Just merge two already sorted arrays. def conquer(left, right): arr = [] i = j = 0 while (i < len(left) and i < len(right)): if left[i] < right[j]: arr.append(left[i]) i+=1 else: arr.append(right[j]) j+=1 arr.extend(right[j:]) arr.extend(left[i:]) left = [1,3,5,9,10] right = [2,4,6,8,11] answer = conquer(left, right) print(answer)The divide, however, is super complicated. I'm trying to understand what's going on line by line.... but it always trips me up. Perhaps it's the \"stacks\" (recursion)? Allegedly this is the code. def divide(arr): if len(arr) <= 1: return arr mid = len(arr) // 2 left = arr[:mid] right = arr[mid:] left_sorted = divide(left) right_sorted = divide(right) return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)What I understand so far is the obvious. We are storing the first half (left), and the second half (right) in arrays.But apparently, all the magic is happening here: `left_sorted = divide(left)` `right_sorted = divide(right)` `return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)` When I print those values, the output is`[3] [7]``[1] [9]``None None``[2] [5]``[8] [6]``[4] None``None None``None None` aaand I'm officially lost here.My brain is trying to run this line by line. But I can'tHow is it getting each element? How is it also running the method for each of them?it's calling divide() twice, back to back.Can someone help me write my own divide method? Maybe that way I can figure it out. Or at least a better explanation?At first I was going to skip it, but the udemy course does things in increasing difficulty. It went: Bubble Sort -> Selection Sort -> Insertion Sort -> Merge Sort (current), then after this is Quick Sort, which is also recursion.So I need to master this.....Thanks!",

        "content": "Hello! So I've recently been working on a simple test game with Monogame. After some trial and error, I made a collision detection system based on several parts:\\> under Scenes class, I load textures for obstacles in each scene and create a dictionary to map each scene to the obstacle textures to be drawn. Also created a dictionary to map each texture to its position.\\> in my Map class, I create a 2d array of zeros to represent terrain; then, a method loops thru the dictionary from Scenes, to place 1's on all array elements corresponding to the texture's width&height on the grid.\\> In the map class, I create methods like this for each direction, which are called in the main Update() method later when the arrow key is detected: (EDIT: position and tex1 in CanMoveL() refer to the player)         public bool CanMoveL(Vector2 position, Texture2D tex1)         {             bool check = true;             if (position.X == Xbounds[0]+10)             {                 return false;             }             for (int y = 5; y < tex1.Height-1; y++){                 if (terrain[(int)position.Y+y, (int)position.X +1]==2)                 {                     check = false;                 }             }             return check;         }Note: I know there are built-in detection methods in monogame, but I'm not really interested in refactoring in the best way possible, I just had the objective of figuring it out from scratch in a way that makes sense. But, if you have some ideas on how you would have approached it/whether my method is way too inefficient, I'd be happy to hear them!Mainly, I'm concerned about the loop that looks through each \"row\" of my character's height, seeing if it hits the obstacle when projected. I was thinking of Numpy style slicing but I couldn't figure that out in c#?Secondly, It seems like this method is kinda fragmented, with the scene textures loaded in Scenes, but the actual mapping of them in Maps. Should both those be in Maps?Thanks!",

I am thinking of maintaining of a registry which maps each key to its respetive table. However as I tried to see how this approach works for some schemas I noticed that many table use same fields which are also unique, which means we can have same sharding key for mutiple tables. We can use this try to groups such tables together in same shard aloowing for more optimised query result. However i am unable to find or think of any algorithm that can help me to find such fields across tables. Is there any feasible solution to this? thanks for help!",

During college, most of my coding experience was in JavaScript and related frameworks.When my company asked if anyone was interested in mobile development, I raised my hand and got placed into iOS. In the beginning, I honestly hated UIKit and Swift. Later, when my project moved to SwiftUI, I started enjoying Swift a lot more and became comfortable with iOS development.The problem is that I have a habit of constantly exploring other languages and frameworks that have nothing to do with my current job like Java with Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails, and recently even Rust. I enjoy learning them, but none of this directly helps me at work.At some point, I want to switch companies. Realistically, it probably doesn’t make sense to switch to a completely different role when my professional experience is in iOS.So career-wise, what’s the smarter move early on:1. Should I focus on mastering iOS development deeply and only learn new things when my role demands it?2. Or is it actually beneficial to keep learning multiple languages and frameworks alongside my primary skill?I’m trying to balance curiosity with long-term career growth, and I’m not sure where that line should be.",

My goal is to maximize code reuse (API services, and TypeScript interfaces) while keeping the build process efficient.I’m looking for advice on the following:* **Codebase Structure:** What is the \"standard\" folder hierarchy for an Angular monorepo to ensure \"Shared\" libraries don't become a cluttered \"dumping ground\"?* **Tooling:** Is it better to stick with native **Angular Workspaces**, or are there other tools I could use to automate this process?* **Best Practices:** How should I handle environment configurations across two different apps within the same repository?Any insights on folder structure or specific automation tools would be greatly appreciated :folded_hands_medium_skin_tone:",

I ran `bzip2 -t` to check it's validity and no errors were reported. The I ran`bunzip2 -k `to try to view the contents to see if there was anything I could glean from it, but that just displayed an encoded text version of the contents that wasn't much help. So I'm not sure how to proceed. As you can probably guess, this is the first time I've worked with a `bz2` file, and I haven't found much help on Google.

The LLMs understood parts of the project we've never seen before and were able to fix the issues with more holistic approaches.Much less skill is needed for solving problems that used to involve years of study. I'm worried the main three areas (coding, domain knowledge, system design) that made skilled workers more desirable will no longer matter. Now, workers can simply add the domain knowledge to the context window, use well-established system designs, and generate code adhering to standards with existing prompt templates.The knowledge barrier once attracted me to this profession because of the differentation from low skilled labor. I'm considering switching into a different career with more human judgement involved but it feels pointless. Now anyone, including unskilled workers, can automate their tasks well enough without manual coding.I would like guidance on what paths I should considering switching into, or topics of upskilling, if any, that aren't easily replaceable by unskilled laborers overseeing the work of AI.",

I don't think AI will eliminate software engineering, but I do think it'll change the number of people who need to it to achieve very good outcomes. With each iteration and vast amounts of training data, the AI models to get better - and honestly, I'm part of the reason, I have to hold my hands up and say I've used GPT a lot since it came out - it synthesizes anything on Google, SO, documentation, etc. so why not use it to get to the bottom of what I need to know way quicker?And I think this is the general consensus - AI will never do away with software engineering, software will always exist, but it will change who does it, and the number of those people.More relevant in 2026 though is offshoring. For better or for worse, I understand the rationale of offshoring labor, particularly junior positions. Companies exist solely to deliver profits to their shareholders, investing a lot of money into an \"unproven\" college graduate is far less appealing than investing that same amount of money into 3-4 new graduates.So as offshoring accelerates, and AI becomes better and better, I'm \"hiding\". I do my due diligence at work, and I learn what good software is.But no matter how many times I implement a strong observability backbone, no matter how many times I write CDK code and deploy to AWS, no matter how many times I implement authentication middleware, etc. - I have the same feeling that I'm on borrowed time.I'm \"hiding\" in the sense that there will be a time in the future, how soon, I don't know, but there will be a time when my leadership thinks, \"We don't need him anymore\" because I cost them too much, and my work can be consolidated into an offshore option or a senior engineer that is producing more with AI. It'll be a simple decision for them, and honestly I'll be the first to say that their intention aligns with the purpose of a business in the first place, which is to churn a higher profit.But until then, I have no choice but to hide, I can upskill and get as good as I want, and believe me I will try to, but there's going to be an inflection point where I can't hide anymore, and by then who knows what the world will look like.But do any other juniors sort of feel this way, this sort of existential dread, but also acknowledgement that that's sort of the way the cookie crumbles? In the meantime, I hope we can both be grateful for having a job at a time so difficult. Take care, my friends :)",

However, it has been much harder than I anticipated.Yesterday, I had a call with my team lead and another developer, the one who hired me and is essentially involved in everything (his cracked). They told me that my performance has been slow, especially during the last sprint, and that I’m very close to getting fired. They’re not the ones who make that decision, but they were passing the message along.The cracked one basically told me (unofficially): If I want to keep my job, I need to work on my free-time. According to him, there’s no way to both catch up and deliver expected work within the official eight-hour workday. I don’t think he’s being unreasonable or malicious, he is just a developer after all, he just wants to protect me. I’m willing to put in extra time, but the problem is that I’m also a university student. Realistically, I can only manage an extra two to three hours a day.This sprint fucked me up. It’s Saturday today, and I have homework due next week that I won’t be able to complete properly because I’m spending the weekend trying to avoid getting fired.I feel like I was hired at the worst possible time. The team was already behind schedule, management is panicking, and I’m expected to deliver at an unrealistically fast pace. I don’t like blaming others, maybe I’m just not learning fast enough, but this still feels off. From the start, it felt too good to be true, fully remote, good pay e.t.c. I have a feeling that it won't end well.",

Just in today's 1-on-1, he said I should take online assessments with other companies to assess my standing & any lacking/strong areas but \"to lack him know if I get any offer so he can help me evaluate if they are good or he can offer something better or match at the current company\". I have to preface we have a good working relationship & get along well in social & work settings although we don't interact or hang out after work. I am asking this because it does feel weird! I am leaning towards him being very caring & taking a genuine concern for my career & growth.What are you guys' opinions?",

That in-human connection is invaluable when networking. But the trade offs just seem to get larger each year and the difference between living in a tech hub / not seems to lessen too, opportunity wise.If we look at the primary reason for moving to a tech hub (I.e. Seattle, SF, NYC) it comes down to:- more job opportunities- ability to grow a larger networkWith the advent of online applications & speaking to recruiters virtually, many roles aren’t relegated to those living in a specific city anymore. There may be some preference from certain companies to choose locally, but that’s about it.Networking is a big one, but if you were really dedicated to building a solid network, you could do lots of cold outreach on LinkedIn and attend virtual conferences in the industry. Not saying it would be as effective, but the tradeoff of uprooting your whole life and paying a premium (higher COL) just to network a little more efficiently doesn’t seem to weigh in evenly.From people who have moved for these reasons, curious to hear your opinion.",

        "content": "So I work for a FAANG company as a SWE, 3 YOE, got promoted to mid-level 7 months ago and then switched to a chill team. The work is more boring than I expected coming from a fast-paced, cutting-edge team building brand new services leveraging AI agents to now maintaining legacy services written over a decade ago - very simple services but with high scale (millions of transactions per second).The path to senior engineer here is slim, maybe even non-existent because we already have one on the team and there isn't any real scope in terms of next-level projects for promo. My teammates are also great but not amazingly talented in the sense that there's not a lot for me to learn from them. The pace is slow and the work is quite mundane and nothing to do with AI - it feels like I'm missing the AI wave. So there's minimal career growth here.But apart from that... it's just really good compared to all my previous teams - really nice and fun teammates and manager, love just hanging out with them, we have lunch together everyday, go for outings once or twice a month, play games, talk about a lot of things outside work, the on-call load is very low, no pressure due to relaxed deadlines, excellent work-life balance, minimal meetings, flexible timings, the pay is great, almost guaranteed to be safe from layoffs.... it sometimes feels too good to be true after grinding for the past 3 years on multiple other teams. There's only like 2-4hrs of actual work a day..... and I even look forward to Mondays now (?!)But yet, after many months of relaxing after promo doing not much impactful/interesting work, the itch to do more and grow is back again, especially being young and single with a lot of time to dedicate to work, but I'm not sure if I want to leave something so good in every other aspect... it's hard to come across such gigs over the span of a career and maybe I should just enjoy the chill life while it lasts - but it feels like it'll last forever for this team :) this is like the true definition of rest and vest but maybe I'm too young for that already.So I'm planning to stay at least for a few more months, but not sure after that. I'm also interested in maybe going to a startup, but perhaps that's best to do once I have 5 YOE and can apply for senior instead of chasing promo here which is quite difficult irrespective of team. I could also try switching internally to a team with better work and better promo prospects but not sure if it's worth giving up all the good things here for career growth - vs. just rest and vest... what would you do in this situation ?",

To some people being able to banter with your boss is great, to me it just feels like unclear boundaries of what is acceptable to talk about, and so I don't feel comfortable saying anything personal. I feel like an outsider to group of friends. Every time I do pitch in it always feels like the conversation just dies. So I always end up being the quietest one in the group, because I have nothing to say. And so people rarely speak to me or know me. I can tell because people usually talk very straight and professional to me, and then very casually to everyone else. Now this wouldn't be a problem, except that the people who are more talkative have better rapport with higher ups, or get recommended more, and so I feel like I get passed over for projects. But I really struggle with casual talk in a professional environment. A lot of stuff in my team is based on \"tribal knowledge\". There are several people who were hired around the same time as me and I feel like they're already ahead of me, they seem to know the managers better, they seem to be more involved in what's going on in the company. Maybe I unintentionally come off as mean or cold. Definitely robotic. But I'm just nervous and never know what to say. If it has nothing to do with the exact specific task at hand my mind just completely blanks. I wouldn't be able to remember what my favorite movie was if asked. I just don't know what to do because this is always a problem for me. I've tried to learn how to \"small talk\" and it just feels really hallow. I've read a lot about it and it seems to line up with autism in the workplace but I've never been officially diagnosed and I wouldn't even know how I would bring that up in jobs.Anyway, just want to hear some advice or if someone has similar experiences.",

Prior to this company, I have always been a product dev - like I work on adding features to some microservice, testing it, etc. I have worked on large projects and have been responsible for the design and implementation, but they have all been based on things I had some experience on, or I had some point of contact with whom I could discuss ideas. At this company, I am not working on product. I am working on internal developer tools. For example, this team is instrumenting custom dev container solutions to create remote dev environments. This involves writing shell scripts, understanding daemons / processes. I had a few projects so far, but these have been relatively unrelated and disjointed. For example, I implemented a small improvement to some scripts. I also migrated some CI / CD pipelines from 1 vendor to another. These projects are also always consistently out of my experience. I don't know anything currently about working with daemons / processes and usually I don't have a point of contact to talk to. The work I am doing doesn't necessarily compound on previous work I've done for this team because its so random and disjointed, so its hard to build a mental model of specifically what we own, because I simply do not work on it. I just want to know if this is normal - as a senior SWE should I expect that I am consistently given projects where I have no domain expertise and no point of contact and I should just ramp myself up? FWIW, I did not lie to my manager about my experience. He was part of my interview loop and I was transparent since the beginning with him about my experience within reason. I have told him exactly the types of projects I have worked on.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "To give a little bit of context,I’ve been working at a small to midsize biotech startup for a few years as essentially the only SWE on my team (although kinda junior). Honestly, I’ve had regrets since joining, since the role didn’t match the job description, and I’ve been operating mostly solo with little direction until more recently.Right now I’m at my breaking point. I’m leading a large, org wide project that touches one of our core critical processes, and I’m doing everything: requirements gathering, design, implementation, data migration, refactoring other teams’ code, qa, documentation, project management, and coordinating with multiple stakeholders. Requirements constantly change, and feedback comes only after features are done, and I end up redoing a ton of work. I mention this pretty often to stakeholders but it still doesn't prevent them from mentioning something that should've been mentioned when I was doing the requirements gathering.Despite this, upper management thinks the project is taking too long and questions decisions without being involved, and can be pretty demeaning to the work that I've done so far. I’ve tried looping them into boards and channels, but it seems like they don't care to look at it and they jump straight to accusations. I've been holding weekly meetings to get everyone aligned and to communicate deadlines as well as providing updates in comms. The core team seems pretty aligned and my boss is empathetic and supportive, and they recognize the work that I do but leadership seems to have unrealistic expectations for our team compared to others. I'm not the only one who sees this favoritism; my boss recognizes it as well.I’m also juggling other requests on top of this and have been working nights and weekends for months now. It was manageable before and I was used to it, until a few months ago I dealt with some personal stuff which fueled the burnout and pushed me towards a mental breakdown and some ideation related thoughts. A week later, I tried to resume everything as normally as I could but I’m still burnt out; panic attacks, nausea, crying before work, the whole shebang. I took a two week break hoping it would help, but I came back dreading everything.To make it worse, leadership is tying my promotion to the success of this massive project, even though they’ve admitted it’s complex and high impact. Its a type of project that can affect all processes org wide if not executed well. I’m exhausted and feel stuck in a repeating pattern of dealing with the upper management talk and possibly gossip/backbiting from teams/management outside the core group. It's getting really frustrating having to deal with the barrage of questions coming in on the last minute by teams who weren't even part of the project group and now have stuff to say. I have a feeling many teams outside view our team negatively. My boss understands and relates to my frustration as well. Reviews of the company have been echoing similar sentiments of it being toxic, having poor/nonexistent management and exhibiting large amounts of favoritism.I’ve been seriously considering quitting for a while now and taking a break (even before this project). I have a lot in savings/investments, stupidly low expenses, and could get by for a while without being a SWE (maybe go into retail or something) while managing to save, but I’m scared given how bad the tech market is and don’t see it improving in 2026. So far, I've been trying to suck it up and disengage but its becoming increasingly difficult to do so with the snide comments here and there.Is it worth staying in a situation like this just because of the economy, or am I burning myself out for nothing? Or should I just wait it out and make them fire me, although its unlikely I get severance? I tried to prep for interviews, but I feel so burnt out that I can't even stand to look at code any more or have the energy to prep after working 12 hours. I feel like my mind is in a constant haze.",

Covering multiple phases and constant context switching takes a toll, especially as I get older.

Unfortunately, my current part-time job has had struggles with finances, leaving me unable to afford paying bills for myself and my long-distance girlfriend without posting on social media begging for donations, even with both of us having part-time jobs. I've been searching for a job as a programmer for 3 years now, with no luck due to the major crash in both the game development and general software scene.I don't have a degree, but I've taught myself programming over the last 5 years and have what I'd consider pretty decent knowledge for a junior. I have 5 years of C++ and Python and 4 years of C#. I'm also quite experienced in Unreal Engine, and to a lesser degree, Unity. Additionally, I am versed in x86 and ARM assembly, as I spend a lot of time reverse engineering binaries in IDA Pro/Ghidra/Binary Ninja. However, I'm struggling to find jobs that meet my relatively lower-level language experience while hiring a junior dev in terms of workplace experience. Game development and malware analysis are probably where I'd do best, and I could definitely handle general software engineering, but the game development scene is obviously fucked, malware analysis jobs are extremely hard to come by, and my skillset doesn't include web development yet. I'd be fine with learning on the job, but it seems that these days, job postings require experience in almost every aspect to begin with.I'm aware that contacts are usually the best way to get a job in this industry, but all of my job-related contacts exist in the game dev sphere, and no one's hiring for roles that I'd meet in that scene at the moment. I don't have much connection to people in general software engineering or malware analysis. I cannot afford to travel even close distance due to lack of funds and physical disability, so I don't have much of a chance going to in-person developer meetups. My parents seem content to keep me stuck inside their house while having me pay rent monthly, so I cannot rely on them for funding or travel.This has obviously been taking a severe toll on my mental state, as I'm struggling to find work that pays me enough to allow me and my girlfriend to survive, let alone move in together. I'm pretty desperate for a job that pays half-decently, and due to my disability I don't think I could physically handle a minimum wage job, never mind the fact that it probably wouldn't be able to pay the bills where I live, around the Seattle area. I'm already barely earning more than minimum wage for where I live to begin with.If anyone is curious, [here's my GitHub page.](http://github.com/WistfulHopes)",

For anyone who has been in a similar position as me, do you think the degree was key for boosting your career? (I’m not worried about time commitment differences as I would be working the same in either case. The cost of the program is also not a factor.)Any advice is appreciated!",

Figured I'd move to the US and try there since where I am seems not great. Plus I don't like the weather.I also went through some relationship troubles in July too and that ended too. Both things combined took a huge mental toll on my health and I was just out of commission for all of July and August.Started applying in the US in September and I've had some interviews (Mainly from people who reached out to me on LinkedIn. Rarely from applications themselves). A lot of phone screens that I never make past. Some technicals.I got a verbal offer in the beginning of October for a React Native position after 5 interviews but that ended up not working out since they paused hiring due to the economy. That hurt a lot and was a huge blow. Started from the beginning again. Interviewed with FAANG-adjacent for a iOS role and finished the entire interview process but then was rejected which was another blow considering I made it through it all.Got a interview and then another offer in the end of November for a contracting role for a year. Got my offer letter, and my TN visa and my SSN, just for them to lose funding for the role mid-December while I was waiting for my SSN to come in. I'm now absolutely just done. Mentally exhausted. Two potential jobs. I feel like luck is not on my side at all.I've always been not great a leetcode. I've been trying to do questions in both Python and Swift. Mainly easy questions, very few medium. 0 hard. It's insanely difficult and I feel like I suck at it.I feel like I'm also bad at interviews, I'm always stressed and anxious and just seem to forget things. Constantly need to be reviewing things. I think maybe my resume isn't great so I've added that as well. Honestly. I'm just done with life. Nothing seems to be working out and I need advice. I have a decent personality and I work well with others. I do enjoy the things that I do.Am I doing something wrong or is it really this bad? Is it normal to have offers rescinded like this or are they just changing their mind? Is there any thing I should do or change on my resume? It's tough to stay optimistic.Resume: [https://imgur.com/a/vRfNqJX](https://imgur.com/a/vRfNqJX)",

I'm a Sr Software Backend Engineer and I'm leading this one project. I have a thread pool that in production one of the queues randomly filled up and caused the rest endpoints to timeout. Why? No idea. How do I find out? No idea? It feels like our distributed system is so complex that no one knows. We had to severely limit the size of our thread pools because that is how the database is supposed to work most effectively. But if the thread pool queue is filling up what am I supposed to do? I don't see the stress on the database, but there are some errors that we weren't printing out that we are working on surfacing. Then I go to try to talk to other seniors about it or people above me and they kinda give me advice but in the end its me stuck looking through logs and talking to AI about what could possibly happen. I feel like our whole product and codebase is so confusing that no one really knows how to solve this problems. But since I'm the lead on this project, I have to figure it out. I wake up with so much anxiety about this project and just getting out of it. I wish I had someone to come help me and just tell me whats wrong, but I don't know. I have to lead a presentation on this soon and it just feels like I wanna give up. I'm not sure how to answer these questions. I need to get off of this project and maybe just distributed systems in general? I feel like I'm doomed to feel anxious about my projects. How do I get off of leading this sinking ship of a project?

I'm graduating with an unimpressive GPA (around 3.0) from a university that isn't well known for computer science (around #80 on the usnews list). I have no internships. The only CS-related experience on my resume is a couple semesters of frontend-focused undergrad research and a software position for a satellite lab at my school, where I haven't yet written a single line of code. My projects are mostly school projects, and nothing that would stand out too much. I do have several years of non-tech job experience, but I'm not sure how impressive that looks to recruiters.I've worked with most popular programming languages in some capacity (Java, C, Python, JavaScript, etc), but I haven't mastered any. I've also not done any Leetcode practice, so I wouldn't feel confident answering hard interview questions yet.As a freshman majoring in computer science, I really had no idea what I was getting myself into. Even though I was following along with the coursework, I always felt that I was a bit behind my peers in terms of internships, projects, and real-world CS skills. It's taken me too long to recognize how hard it is to find a job as a new grad, and I'm not sure where to go from here. Is it worth grinding for months trying to land a job in this field given how non-competitive my resume looks? Is there even enough time before I graduate? Or should I just switch fields? There's jobs out there that give $55-60k/yr, are much easier to get, and teach you everything you need to know. When I started college, I had dreams of making six figures working from home, but now I really just want to make a livable wage and not hate my job.Sorry for the bit of venting at the end, but any advice is appreciated. And for any freshman reading this, use me as a lesson of what not to do. Just going to class and being average in everything will not set you up for success in this field.",

What that boiled down to was training for certificates and joining meetings at 2am that just boiled down to \"any questions?\" Again I was desperate because I had never received offers while my peers in the field were already gaining experience in their own internships. So at one point I'm told I need to move out of my state which the job description never mentioned, so I tell them I can't and I leave. Since then it's been 2 years of me searching for entry level positions to try and start over but I rarely get interviews (once every \\~300 apps). Anyways, I see very negative opinions on Wipro and I'm worried that the reason why I rarely get interviews is because of my association with them. If that's true would it be better if I scrubbed it from my resume and left a 4 year gap? I'm not sure what I should do about this.",

I was never really passionate about the business, and frankly had to teach myself everything to make it work. I've been able to keep the business afloat, but just barely, and as I'm looking to get married and have a family soon, I know the income from that business just won't be able to support a family. So I've decided to sell the business and try going back to SWE. The problem is, from what I can tell, the job market is horrible, and it's even worse with an 8 year gap in my resume. My background was primarily as a Java developer, but my last couple years at the trading firm I did a fair amount of work in Spark, so I've decided to lean into the data engineering angle and have been teaching myself modern Spark and cloud computing to brush up on my skills in my free time. I know I will probably have to start back at a level 1 or maybe 2 role given my resume gap, and I've already sent my resume out to a few companies I thought might be a good fit through linkedIn, but have gotten zero calls back.

I am pretty sure that if I do an interview using the new framework, I will fail and never be able to write the tests on my own.I feel that if somehow I lost access to the ai tools, I'll not have the motivation to write on my own since I know the concepts, I know how to speed my development.It's like, I can't use notepad anymore because there are many advanced IDEs that will speed up my work.Apply the automated testing example to anything else.Bonus: I don't know how vibe coding works or how they handle large codebases since results from the ai tools must be reviewed, tested and modified. Are the vibe coding stories true or some lies?",

This role is pretty much on an internship level (requires you to still be in college, or graduated within the last six months), but is a full time position. It is in defense so I can see why they would probably prefer someone very new with little to no experience to train up for the long term. Anyways, what would a role like this expect of the new grad developer? I feel as though I am definitely qualified for what they need, but at the same time it seems like it would take almost a year or something to understand their code base. I have some sophisticated C++ projects, which include a game engine, but I feel like this most likely pales in comparison to this company's stuff.",

Though to me it feels like there is still very little organization going on here. Even though I am an SWE I. I am being asked to think of the big picture and make innovative contributions to the project (or I will have my employment terminated). The project currently revolves around signal processing which I have next to zero knowledge of. I am facing more issues with domain knowledge rather than software at this point. Am I just severely dropping the ball here somehow? Or is this how things frequently go in defense? My recent performance review complained about me not completing certain TODOs but when I went and ask my supervisors specifically what wasn't done, none of them could give a single example. The entire email I got basically felt like they said \"you suck, do better or you are fired\". How would you even measure what counts as \"making innovative contributions\" or looking at the big picture here? Is this unreasonable?",

I’m comfortable with technical tools, but my preferred role after graduation is data analyst or a tech role that requires minimal coding, rather than heavy software engineering.Given the financial aid situation, time to graduate, and my career goals, I’m trying to decide whether it makes more sense to:•Push through and finish the CS degree, or•Switch to Business Management + CS minor and continue building technical experience on the sideI’d really appreciate any insight from people who’ve faced a similar decision or are working in data/tech roles. Was sticking with CS worth it, or did a business/analytics path work out just as well?This may sound all over the place. But thanks for reading. Any advice would be greatly appreciated",

And I'm being denied for junior roles because recruiters say I'm overqualified (which I kinda figured). In both cases I'm almost never getting to the interview stage, I've had less than 6 over the past year and all but 2 of those were in late 2024.In late December and late last week half the jobs I'm finding on recruitment sites are for frontend, which I have partial experience in from my last job thanks to the (frustrating) push for everyone to be full stack. At this rate I'm considering retraining or learning FE stuff and making the switch, but that feels like it could be just as difficult to find a job with when not working because I'd lack the pretence of \"experience\".Tldr; backend job market in the UK sucks, considering retraining in / learning frontend to improve my prospects.

        "content": "**Update: I decided on NYC. Thanks for all the input!Update2: was able to negotiate for slightly higher base!**Hi all! I recently received a full-time offer at a company where I previously interned, but in a different org. The role is best described as analytics engineering (data pipelines, dashboards, some modeling).Offer details:* Base: \\~$105k (about 75% of the band)* Bonus: 10%* Role is listed as 0–2 YOE* No master’s required (I do have one)* Same pay regardless of location* Office options: West Hollywood (LA) or Midtown Manhattan (NYC)I need to choose a location fairly quickly and want to make a decision that makes sense for both lifestyle and long-term growth.# About me / context* Single, 25F* Early-career, no full-time experience yet* Strong academic background (T10 undergrad + top specialized MS; more math/data science, lighter formal CS)* Exploring whether to pivot further into AI engineering or SWE — I’ve built a couple of agentic systems recently and really enjoyed it, though I also recognize I may have only scratched the surface* Very arts-oriented and tend to feed off the energy of my surroundings* Concerts, performing arts, and creative scenes matter a lot to me outside of work* Love warm weather and the beach (would go multiple times a week)I’ve lived full-time in LA (\\~1.5 years) and part-time in the NYC metro area (frequent trips into the city). Toward the end of my time in LA, I started making friends and building more of a social life, but it still doesn’t fully feel like “home.” In contrast, I have longer-term roots in NYC (school, family, and other involvements over the past decade), even though I haven’t lived there full-time before.# How I’m thinking about NYC vs LAAfter looking closely at housing, one clear difference is space vs density:* In NYC, I’d ideally want to live in downtown Manhattan or downtown Brooklyn, which is meaningfully more expensive for the space you get. I’d absolutely need a roommate.* In LA, I could live very close to work in West Hollywood, with more space for the same money. I’d still want a roommate, but it feels less constrained.This doesn’t feel like a good-vs-bad lifestyle decision — more like a tradeoff:* NYC: less space, more density and stimulation, amazing energy, easier access to arts and ambitious people, diversity in industries* LA: more space, easier day-to-day life, amazing weather, and beach access, but sometimes feels slower or understimulatingOne thing I’m genuinely unsure about is whether NYC actually provides more motivation and momentum early in a career, or whether that’s more about finding the right community in either city. I don’t yet have a strong network in either place, so I’m aware my perception may be biased by who I’ve met so far.For future context only (not a third option right now): I’ve also spent a lot of time in San Francisco and could see myself there down the line, especially if I pivot further into tech — so future flexibility is something I’m thinking about — but this decision is strictly NYC vs LA.# Negotiation contextI’m also in the process for two other roles:* One might pay similarly, the other potentially more* Neither is likely to wrap up within the next \\~1.5 weeks, and I may need to sign this offer before thenThis current offer is the best fit in terms of work itself, but I’m unsure how to think about negotiation given:* I’m already \\~75% into the band* I don’t have full-time experience* I do have a master’s, which is more than the role formally requires# My questions1. Given everything above — my career stage, personality, priorities, and the work itself — which city would you choose for me: NYC or LA? Why?2. For people who’ve lived in both, how did each city actually affect your motivation, growth, and day-to-day energy early in your career?3. Negotiation: * Would you negotiate at all in this situation, given I can’t risk losing the offer? * If yes, when is the right time: after receiving the written offer, or only if another offer comes in (even after signing)?Thanks so much — really appreciate any insight. And I apologize for writing this with ChatGPT.",

I have a total of 4YOE.I’ve seen this place grow, contributed to its growth, and talked to stakeholders about next steps and actions (ideas) for how we can grow, interview processes, etc. Although the issue is our tech stack is quite…basic? No AWS or containers, a CMS, NextJs, some proxy software, tags/pixel work, and little tools here and there that aren’t really too popular.I’ve been wanting to level up to a better salary, and keep seeing LC. I struggle to get interviews, and when I do I feel like I fail to do LC but personally just don’t have time for that. For many reasons I’m looking at masters to switch fields, I don’t think I’m very good at what I do and just make it work.I’ve showed people my resume and they say it’s not horrible and I should be at least getting interviews due to my experiences at the place. With a lot going on I’m trying to either find a tech related job that’s not coding or level up my salary from another tech job.My question would be, is my only path to a better salary through LC? Is that like 80-90% of the industry/companies? I’m now looking for gigs in tech that’s not entirely coding (junior spots I guess and yes it would be a salary hit but might be better than staying still here), but still open to leveling up in coding positions itself, is all I can do to upgrade there just projects and leetcode? If I fail to do either is there no hope?",

Prior to that my experience was front end dev, QA testing and product management at a couple different startups. In other words I never reached senior status on any track since my roles lasted at most a year at each.These past 3 years I have been self employed occasionally dipping into my savings. I’m not a fan of this because it’s unsustainable and it will deplete my savings since the self employment income is unreliable.Anyway, I have been realizing that I need employment again but these past few months when I check the state of the tech industry it seems like mostly gloom and doom. Throw in how far behind I have fallen these past 3 years and I was already basically only at entry level position - I feel I am probably even more F’d inthe A then most of you guys.I’m hoping someone might help steer me in the right direction, knock some sense into me, or maybe provide a glimmer of hope of a “right path”.My goal:Become full time employed ideally remotely. Remote > Salary. My plan (6-12 month timeline):Get certified in Cybersecurity (studying on Coursera and other sources) and earn an AWS Developer Certificate (to refresh/relearn my prior knowledge).My expected outcome:Gain either an entry level job in Cybersecurity, a DevOps position, or hopefully even a QA role.Is this a legitimate approach or should I be doing something else? I’m open to any other path back into tech. Basically just need to get my foot back in the door and feel like this might be the most viable path.",

All I have is around 2 years of IT experience (service desk at school) and some web development experience I got from developing for a friends business. (Which I have included on my resume as work experience) I have some projects, but obviously am working on building better ones that align with jobs I apply for. I will have acquired Sec+ by the end of this month. (Will explain why I’m getting this cert) So I’m just wondering if I am too cooked for this field and should pivot to IT, or keep trying?My current fallback hopes are that with my 2 years of entry IT experience and Sec+ that I can at least land some sort of IT role and pivot to something better after that if I can find something that can sponsor me for a clearance. I want to know if it is a realistic goal for me to land something in software in the defense industry because I live in the DC area and I assume that these jobs will have a lower barrier to entry. With Sec+ and my experience, is this still an attainable goal? Or is the industry just too cooked for hoping that this is even an option anymore?I’ve also started studying for Aws certified cloud practitioner as recommended by my employed friends. Is this worth my time? It does seem like a very easy cert. I do have a decent network (many friends, mutuals and relatives in tech in my area), really thankful for that. I hope to utilize it as much as possible for referrals. I have done tons of resume review and I believe my resume is solid. I am also interested in getting into Tech consulting as that is a big field in this area. Can anyone give me tips for that? Side note - I am a US citizen, born and raised, and should have no problems with getting a security clearance. My questions: Are my goals still realistic?Should I change anything?Am I cooked?Anything else I should know? My plan now is to: 1. Apply aggressively for any entry level IT positions to secure some type of a fallback by June-ish and hopefully have some way of getting sponsored for a security clearance. 2. Also apply to defense software roles for the chance to go straight into my dream field. 3. Keep my skills sharp with Leetcode and projects TLDR: Am I cooked for software jobs? New grad. No internships in swe, 2 years entry level IT experience, Sec+",

        "content": "So, finally the vacancy I thought I had been waiting years for, has appeared. It's in a certain deep-tech field, on the crossroads of physics, embedded, and networks engineering. The vacancy itself is for embedded software.Problem is... while I have actual experience with the physics (down to the literal same kind of physical system), I _want_ to work on the control/embedded side of things. But I have no C++ experience, and they explicitly ask for that.Professionally, I've only worked in python. I've dabbled a bit in Rust, a tiny bit in C++, and embedded C. I've played around with microcontrollers for a bit, but there aren't really any projects I'd like to do here at home so I didn't stick with it. I'm just afraid that, if they somehow pick me, I will make critical mistakes very early on in the product development (as the <10th employee).The other thing is that, for me, it's _yet another_ startup in this field. I've worked at two similar startups now, where I've started bright-eyed and bushy-tailed only to absolutely f%%%ing hate it after 2-3 years. My first job was a very similar, very young startup, where I worked more on the physics-side of things. Given that it was a young startup and I was full of ideas, I worked myself to death. And in the 3rd year, due to that and the fact that I started disagreeing with the direction, I quit.My current job is at a more mature startup, on paper not a startup anymore now. Much better WLB, but the startup-like shenanigans are also getting to me here. Tons of technical debt, move-fast-and-break-things, poor communication because we've grown fast but not matured... everything is a mess and it's killing me.I don't know if I should apply. I actually know the founders/current employees (not super-close but I was a MSc student under one of them, and worked with 2 others during that time) and I'm honestly pretty good at interviewing, so I think I actually have a chance. But part of me just wants to get out of this startup life and the hype around this field. I feel like work has occupied my life far too much ever since my graduation.I just want to chat with you guys and ask, what would you do? What advice do you have?Edit: I realize the reason for this post may be a bit unclear. For context, I've actually really come to hate my current job and want to leave asap, but don't want to jump from the frying pan into the fire.",

Essentially, we would be creating services / integration layers in Node that are responsible for syncing Salesforce related onboarding data with the core services. And some front end work in React to manage that part.From what I heard in the interviews, I wouldn't be touching any proprietary salesforce stuff, as there is a separate salesforce team that handles that. There would be collaboration though if there are potential issues in the salesforce side, so I might have to occasionally look at some apex code when talking with the salesforce devs. I'm not too worried as long as I stay a software engineer and dont get roped into salesforce land, but in terms of future job searches I'm a bit concerned that if they hear 'salesforce integration' in the interview when describing a recent project they'll run for the hills.

Got hired at the end of first year for one of side projects of community member. Fell in love with coding and worked really hard through the summer. Afterwards got an offer into well-established YC-backed company and currently working there as Software Engineer.And honestly - I love every bit of it. But I see two very big problems at the horizon which am not sure how to tackle yet:\\- Working with AI is too much. Since I started my serious commitment on a very early stage kind of project - I got used to the principle of speed is the key. And because of that I did a lot of coding with AI (cursor). I didn’t cut it off correctly early enough, and now when I am trying to write code on my own - it takes much more time I feel like I am falling out if industry-needed pace. I can’t say that I am vibe-coding, because I am still very responsible for my code, and I know precisely how something is implemented, and I am not doing “Claude pls code feature” as well, but still like I am feeling that I won’t be able to write code if I don’t have access to AI instruments. So there’s my first question. How normal it is? How do you define an edge between AI slob and speed ups that AI can provide?\\- Vector of further development? I am trying to study the stuff beyond my actual responsibilities, and I feel like my next big choice is choice of supplementary skills: doing distribution (sales, marketing, PMF and all that kind of stuff) VS digging deeper into architecture, devops and deeply engineering kinds of topics.Argument of first approach for me are the fact that I can be more independent, but that’s not something I particularly like.Arguments for the second approach are the fact that I love it, but again I love it because I am able to move with fast pace because I have AI. Also, I am not sure how relevant those skills are compared to distribution (e.g Technical guy who can sell is much more desirable part of a startup than just deeply technical guy)Your feedback is very important to me and is truly appropriated",

I investigate the problem, identify the root cause, and often end up “acting as a phone”: passing the information to other teams that implement the fix or design change. Although I gain a good system-level view and am learning a lot about radars, I rarely design components, define interfaces, or write new code.But I feel like I’m stagnating.How do I move from debugging/analysis to greater technical ownership? Due to deadlines and team “silos”, it is very difficult to be the one fixing the bugs. In retrospect, was staying too long in support/maintenance a mistake? Am I overthinking this, or am I really stagnating?Thank you very much",

My parents let me know recently that they had connections to hand off my resume directly to a companies hiring board instead of needing to apply online. However, I am severely underqualified. The job listings aren't for new grads, stating at least 2+ years of experience listed in the job description. Furthermore, it looks like it requires intensive knowledge of C++ which I have dabbled in, but not exactly familiar with. The job is basically systems development, while I only have projects in app development. Is it even worth to apply? I am obviously severely underqualified for this position and I basically see this connection as useless currently. Would it be in my best interest to check out systems dev more in depth and wait for the next hiring cycle instead?",

That’s just not who I am and I don’t support the current administration. It seems like there are no entry level jobs as well. What’s going on? Is it the uprise of AI? What can I look for? I’m considering a masters in neuroscience. Thank you so much.",

I subscribed to datacamp so I can practice the assignments and tests from them. I'm also wondering should I go back for my masters? What could I do to make myself more marketable for these particular roles?",
