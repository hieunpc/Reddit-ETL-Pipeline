If you are *not* building LLM agents, what cool stuff are you actually working on these days?What is the most interesting thing on your plate right now?A weird ingestion challenge?Internal tools?Something that sped up your team?Some insane BigQuery or Snowflake optimization rabbit hole?I am not looking for PR answers. I want to hear what actual data engineers are building in 2025 that does not involve jamming an LLM between a user and a SQL warehouse.What is your coolest current project?",

        "content": "For every other data engineer or someone in higher hierarchy down the road comes to a choiuce of Apache Iceberg or Databricks Delta Lake, so we went ahead and benchmarked both systems. Just sharing our experience here.TL;DR Both formats have their perks: Apache Iceberg offers an open, flexible architecture with surprisingly fast query performance in some cases, while Databricks Delta Lake provides a tightly managed, all-in-one experience where most of the operational overhead is handled for you.Setup & MethodologyWe used the TPC-H 1 TB dataset  which is a dataset of about 8.66 billion rows across 8 tables to compare the two stacks end-to-end: ingestion and analytics.For the Iceberg setup: We ingested data from PostgreSQL into Apache Iceberg tables on S3, orchestrated through OLake’s high-throughput CDC pipeline using AWS Glue as catalog and EMR Spark for query.. Ingestion used 32 parallel threads with chunked, resumable snapshots, ensuring high throughput. On the query side, we tuned Spark similarly to Databricks (raised shuffle partitions to 128 and disabled vectorised reads due to Arrow buffer issues).For the Databricks Delta Lake setup: Data was loaded via the JDBC connector from PostgreSQL into Delta tables in 200k-row batches. Databricks’ managed runtime automatically applied file compaction and optimized writes. Queries were run using the same 22 TPC-H analytics queries for a fair comparison.This setup made sure we were comparing both ingestion performance and analytical query performance under realistic, production-style workloads.What We Found* We used OLake to ingest to Iceberg and was about 2x faster - 12 hours vs 25.7 hours on Databricks thanks to parallel chunked ingestion.* Iceberg ran the full TPC-H suite 18% faster than Databricks.* Cost: Infra cost was 61% lower on Iceberg + OLake (around $21.95 vs $50.71 for the same run).here are the overall result and our ideology on this-Databricks still wins on ease-of-use: you just click and go. Cluster setup, Spark tuning, and governance are all handled automatically. That’s great for teams that want a managed ecosystem and don’t want to deal with infrastructure.But if your team is comfortable managing a Glue/AWS stack and handling a bit more complexity, Iceberg + OLake’s open architecture wins on pure numbers  faster at scale, lower cost, and full engine flexibility (Spark, Trino, Flink) without vendor lock-in.read our article to know more on our steps followed and the overall benchmarks and the numbers around it curious to know what you people think.

        "author": "NeverheardofAkro",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Lately I’ve been deep diving into data governance because our \"wild west\" data stack is finally catching up with us. I’ve read a ton of dry whitepapers and vendor guides, and I wanted to share a summary of a framework that actually makes sense for modern engineering teams (vs. the old-school \"lock everything down\" approach).I’m curious if anyone here has successfully moved from a centralized model to a federated one?The Core Problem: Most frameworks treat governance as a \"police function.\" They create bottlenecks. The modern approach (often called \"Active Governance\") tries to embed governance into the daily workflow rather than making it a separate compliance task.Here is the breakdown of the framework components that seem essential:1.) The Operating Model (The \"Who\") You basically have three choices. From what I’ve seen, #3 is the only one that scales:- Centralized: One team controls everything. (Bottleneck city).- Decentralized: Every domain does whatever they want. (Chaos).- Federated/Hybrid: A central team sets the \"Standards\" (security, quality metrics), but the individual Domain Teams (Marketing, Finance) own the data and the definitions.2.) The Pillars (The \"What\") If you are building this from scratch, you need to solve for these three:- Transparency: Can people actually find the data? (Catalogs, lineage).- Quality: Is the data trustworthy? (Automated testing, not just manual checks).- Security: Who has access? (RBAC, masking PII).3.) The \"Left-Shift\" Approach This was a key takeaway for me: Governance needs to move \"left.\" Instead of fixing data quality in the dashboard (downstream), we need to catch it at the source (upstream).- Legacy way: Data Steward fixes a report manually.- Modern way: The producer is alerted to a schema change or quality drop before the pipeline runs.The Tooling Landscape I've been looking at tools that support this \"Federated\" style. Obviously, you have the big clouds (Purview, etc.), but for the \"active\" metadata part, where the catalog actually talks to your stack (Snowflake, dbt, Slack), tools like Atlan or Castor seem to be pushing this methodology the hardest.Question for the power users of this sub: For those of you who have \"solved\" governance, did you start with the tool or the policy first? And how do you get engineers to care about tagging assets without forcing them?Thanks!",

But what I'm seeing and doing right now is more of ticket solving / incident management, talking to data publishers, giving out communications about downtime, etc.I observed what other people were doing with the same or higher comparable role to me and what I observed is that, everybody is doing the same thing, which honestly stresses me out because of the sheer amount of proprietary tools and configuration that I'll have to learn but all fundamentally uses Databricks.Also, the documentation for their stuff is atrocious to say the least, its so fragmented and most of the time outdated that I basically had to resort on making my OWN documentation so I don't have to spend 30 minutes figuring shit out from their long ass confluence page.The culture / it's people is a hit or miss, it has its ups and downs in my very short observation of a month. It feels like riding an emotional rollercoaster because of the work load / tension from the amount of p1 or escalation incidents that have happened on the short span of a month.Right now, I'm contemplating whether if its worth to stay given the brutality of the job market or just find another job.

Discussing and ironing out grain and relationships between various tables helps with all of this. Often the initial assumptions don’t hold up and the modeling process helps flesh these edge cases out. It also gives you a vocabulary that you don’t have to invent inside your organization (dimension, fact, bridge, SCD, junk dimension, degenerate dimension, etc).I personally do not see OBT as much of a data model. It always seemed like “we contorted the data and mashed it together so that we got a huge table with the data we want” without too much rhyme or reason. I would add that an exception I have made is to join a star together and materialize that as OBT so that data science or analysts can hack on it in Excel, but this was done as a delivery mechanism not a modeling methodology. Honestly, OBT has always seemed pretty amateur to me. I’m interested if anyone has a different take on OBT. Is there anyone out there advocating for a structured and disciplined approach to creating datamarts with an OBT philosophy? Did I miss it and there actually is a Kimball-ish person for OBT that approaches it with rigor and professionalism?For some context, I recently modeled a datamart as a star schema and was asked by an incoming leader “why did you model it with star schema?”. To me, it was equivalent to asking “why did you use a database for the datamart?”. Honestly, for a datamart, I don’t think anything other than star schema makes much sense, so anything else was not really an option. I was so shocked at this question that I didn’t have a non-sarcastic answer so I tabled the question. Other options could be: keep it relational, Datavault, or OBT. None of these seem serious to me (ok datavault is a serious approach as I understand it, but such a niche methodology that I wouldn’t seriously entertain it). The person asking this question is younger and I expect he entered the data space post big data/spark, so likely an OBT fan.I’m interested in hearing from people who believe OBT is superior to star schema. Am I missing something big about OBT?",

        "author": "Hefty-Citron2066",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "hey folks, curious how others are tackling a problem my team keeps running into.**TL;DR:** We have data spread across Hive, Iceberg tables, Kafka topics, and some PostgreSQL databases. Managing metadata in 4+ different places is becoming a nightmare. Looking at catalog federation solutions and wanted to share what I found.## Our SetupWe're running a pretty typical modern stack but it's gotten messy over time:- Legacy Hive metastore (can't kill it yet, too much depends on it)- Iceberg tables in S3 for newer lakehouse stuff- Kafka with its own schema registry for streaming- A few PostgreSQL catalogs that different teams own- Mix of AWS and GCP (long story, acquisition stuff)The problem is our data engineers waste hours just figuring out where data lives, what the schema is, who owns it, etc. We've tried building internal tooling but it's a constant game of catch-up.## What I've Been Looking AtI spent the last month evaluating options. Here's what I found:### Option 1: Consolidate Everything into Unity CatalogWe're already using Databricks so this seemed obvious. The governance features are genuinely great. But:- It really wants you to move everything into the Databricks ecosystem- Our Kafka stuff doesn't integrate well- External catalog support feels bolted on- Teams with data in GCP pushed back hard on the vendor lock-in### Option 2: Try to Federate with Apache PolarisSnowflake's open source catalog looked promising. Good Iceberg support. But:- No real catalog federation (it's still one catalog, not a catalog of catalogs)- Doesn't handle non-tabular data (Kafka, message queues, etc.)- Still pretty new, limited community### Option 3: Build Something with Apache GravitinoThis one was new to me. It's an Apache project (just graduated to Top-Level Project in May) that does metadata federation. The concept is basically \"catalog of catalogs\" instead of trying to force everything into one system.What caught my attention:- Actually federates across Hive, Iceberg, Kafka, JDBC sources without moving data- Handles both tabular and non-tabular data (they have this concept called \"filesets\")- Truly vendor-neutral (backed by Uber, Apple, Intel, Pinterest in the community)- We could query across our Hive metastore and Iceberg tables seamlessly- Has both REST APIs and Iceberg REST API supportThe catch:- You have to self-host (or use Datastrato's managed version)- Newer project so some features are still maturing- Less polished UI compared to commercial options- Community is smaller than Databricks ecosystem## Real Test I RanI set up a quick POC connecting our Hive metastore, one Iceberg catalog, and a test Kafka cluster. Within like 2 hours I had them all federated and could query across them. The metadata layer actually worked - we could see all our tables, topics, and schemas in one place.Then tried the same query that usually requires us to manually copy data between systems. With Gravitino's federation it just worked. Felt like magic tbh.## My TakeFor us, I think Gravitino makes sense because:- We genuinely can't consolidate everything (different teams, different clouds, regulations)- We need to support heterogeneous systems (not just tables)- We're comfortable with open source (we already run a lot of Apache stuff)- Avoiding vendor lock-in is a real priority after our last platform migration disasterBut if you're already 100% Databricks or you have simpler needs, Unity Catalog is probably the easier path.## Question for the GroupIs anyone else using catalog federation approaches? How are you handling metadata sprawl across different systems?Also curious if anyone has tried Gravitino in production. The project looks solid but would love to hear real-world experiences beyond my small POC.",

Increasing memory to 12 GB helps a bit, but it is still random. I tried setting spark.kubernetes.memoryOverhead to 2 GB and tuning spark.memory.fraction to 0.6, but some jobs still fail. The driver pod is okay for now, but executors just disappear without meaningful logs. Scaling does not help either. On our cluster, new pods sometimes take 3 min to start. Logs are huge and messy. You spend more time staring at them than actually fixing the problem. is there any way to fix this? tried searching on stackoverflow etc but no luck.",

The optimization results in even a slower job than the unoptimized one.Have you ever faced this problem?

I didn’t even know the DE role existed. It really catched my attention, and I started studying every single day. I’ll admit I made some mistakes (jumping straight into Airflow/AWS, even made a post about Airflow here, LOL), but I kept going because I genuinely enjoy learning about the field.Two months ago I actually received two job opportunities. Both meetings went well: they asked about my projects, my skills, my approach to learning, etc. Both processes just vanished. I assume it’s because I have 0 experience. Still, I’ve been studying 4–6 hours a day since I started, and I’m fully committed to become a professional DE.# My current skill set:**Python:** PySpark, Polars, DuckDB, OOP **SQL:** MySQL, PostgreSQL **Databricks:** Delta Lake, Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines, Jobs, Roles, Unity Catalog, Secrets, External Locations, Connections, Clusters **BI:** Power BI, Looker **Cloud:** AWS (IAM, S3, Glue) / a bit of DynamoDB and RDS **Workflow Orchestration:** Airflow 3 (Astronomer certified) **Containers:** Docker basics (Images, Containers, Compose, Dockerfile) **Version Control:** Git & GitHub **Storage / Formats:** Parquet, Delta, Iceberg **Other:** Handling fairly large datasets (+100GB files), understanding when to use specific tools, etc **English:** C1/C2 (EF SET certified)# Projects I’ve built so far:– An end-to-end ETL built **entirely in SQL** using DuckDB, loading into PostgreSQL. – Another ETL pulling from multiple sources (MySQL, S3, CSV, Parquet), converting everything to Parquet, transforming it, and loading into PostgreSQL. Total volume was \\~4M rows. I also handled IAM for boto3 access. – A small Spark → S3 pipeline (too simple to mention it though).I know these are beginner/intermediate projects, i’m planning more advanced ones for next year.Next year, I want to do things properly: structured learning, better projects, certifications, and ideally my first job, even if it’s low pay or long hours. I’m confident I can scale quickly once I get my first actual job.# My questions:– If you were in my position, what would you focus on next? – Do you think I’m in the right direction? – What kind of projects actually stand out in a junior DE portfolio? – Do certifications actually matter for someone with zero experience? (Databricks, dbt, Airflow, etc.)Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",

The goal is to setup cost reports on AWS and GCP (and add yours from Cloudflare, Azure, etc.) and combine each of them and get a combined overview from all costs and be able to see where most cost comes from.There's a YouTube video for more details and detailed explanation of how to set up the cost exports (unfortunately, they weren't straight-forward AWS exports to S3 and GCP to BigQuery). Luckily we dlt that integrates them well. I also added Stripe to get some income data too, so have an overall cost dashboard with costs and income to calculate margins and other important data. I hope this is useful, and I'm sure there's much more that can be added.Also, huge thanks to pre-existing dashboard [aws-cur-wizard](https://github.com/Twing-Data/aws-cur-wizard) with very detailed reports. Everything is build on open-source and I included a `make demo` that gets you started immediately without cloud reports setup to see how it works.PS: I'm also planing to add a GitHub actions to ingest into ClickHouse Cloud, to have a cloud version as an option too, in case you want to run it in an enterprise. Happy to get feedback too, again. The dlt part is manually created so it works, the reports are heavily re-used from aws-cur-wizard, and the rest I used some Claude Code.",

Plus, since we are using GitHub codespaces, it's essentially free to run in the browser with just a couple clicks! If you don't want to use GitHub Codespces, you can run this locally via Docker Desktop.Bonus for loacal: Since Cursor is based on VSCode, you can use the dev containers in there and then have AI help explain code or concepts (also super helpful for learning).One thing I do want to highlight is that since this is meant for students and not production, security and user management controls are very lax (e.g. \"password\" for passwords db configs). I'm optimizing on student learning experience there, but it's probably a great starting point to learn how to implement those controls.Anything you would add?

Therefore, it is a great fit when you are DIY bare bones data engineering, and less so if you are relying on pre-existing tools *(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake).* For example, if you are data streaming in a more low-level manner.**Data Engineering examples:*** Stream data live off a Websocket and save it into \"**.arrow\"** or \"**.parquet**\" files.* Capture data in Minarrow, flip to Polars on the fly and calculate metrics in real-time, then push them in chunks to a Datastore as a live persistent service* Run parallelised statistical calculations on 1 billion rows without much compile-time overhead so Rust becomes workable**You also get:*** Strong IDE typing (in Rust)* One hit *\\`.to\\_arrow()*\\` and \\`.*to\\_polars()*\\` in Rust* Enums instead of dynamic dispatch *(a Rust flavour that's used in the official Arrow Rust crates)** extensive SIMD-accelerated kernel functions available, including 60+ univariate distributions via the partner \\`SIMD-Kernels\\` crate (*fully reconciled to Scipy*). So, for many common cases you can stay in Rust for high performance compute.Essentially addressing a few areas that the main Arrow RS implementation makes different trade-offs. **Are you interested?**For those who work in high performance data and software engineering and value this type of work, please feel free to ask any questions, even if you predominantly work in Python or another language*.* As, Arrow is one of those frameworks that backs a lot of that ecosystem but is not always well understood, due its back-end nature.I'm also happy to explain how you can move data across language boundaries *(e.g., Python Rust)* using the Arrow format, or other tricks like this.Hope you found this interesting.Cheers,Pete",

I’ve made due to this point, but haven’t had a mentor to ask some of my foundational questions that haven’t seem to go away with experience. My question is general, how do you test? If you are making a pipeline change, altering business logic, onboarding a new business area to an existing model, etc how do you test what you’ve changed? I’m not looking for a detailed explanation of everything that should be tested for each scenario I listed above, but rather a mantra or words to live by when I can say I have done my due diligence. I have spent many a days testing every single little piece downstream of what I touch and it slows my progress down drastically. I’m sure I’m overdoing it, but I’d rather be safe than sorry while I’m still figuring out how to identify what REALLY needs to be checked. Any advice or opinion is appreciated.",

First, I created a simple deployment pipeline in Fabrci UI and added parametrization using library variables. This apprach works, of course, but personally it feels very \"mouse driven\" and shallow. I like to have more control. And the idea that it deploys everything, but it will be in invalid step untill you do some manual work really pushes me away. Next I added a video about git integration and python based deployments. That one is much more code oriented and even \"code-first\", which is great. Still, I was quite annoyed because of the parameter file. If only it could be split, or applied in stages...Anyway - those are 2 videos I mentioned: Fabric deployment pipelines - [https://youtu.be/1AdUcFtl830](https://youtu.be/1AdUcFtl830) Git + Python - [https://youtu.be/dsEA4HG7TtI](https://youtu.be/dsEA4HG7TtI)Happy to answer any questions or even better get some suggestions for the next topics!

In my head I am building custom tables with SQL that have all the data we want aggregated and transformed so it's easier to report on. Intead of doing it every time in PBI.The world of data engineering is vast and I have just started. We are looking at Fabric because we already have Azure and use PowerBI. I know Snowflake is a good option as well.I just don't fully grasp the pros and cons of the two.

The .csv file has all the field names mashed together and it’s super messy but very small. My manager want us to keep a record of those data even though we dont need all of them. What I am thinking right now is using a lakehouse architecture. Bronze layer: we will have all the historical record, however we will define the schema of each type of JIRA issue and only allow those columns. Silver layer: only allowed curtain fields and normalize it during the load. When we try to update it, it will check if it already has that key in our storage, if not it will add, if it does, It will do a backfill/ upsert. Gold layer: apply business logical along with the data from sliver layer. Do you think this architecture is doable?",

I often needed help from an AI model but did not feel comfortable sharing certain parts of the code because of sensitive names and internal details.Between the feedback from this community and my own experience dealing with the same issue, I decided to build something to help.I created an open source local desktop app. This tool lets you hide sensitive details in your code such as field names, identifiers and other internal references before sending anything to an AI model. After you get the response back, it can restore everything to the original names so the code still works properly.It also works for regular text like emails or documentation that contain client specific information. Everything runs locally on your machine and nothing is sent anywhere.

We are considering the open lineage format because it is vendor agnostic and would allow us to use a range of different visualisation tools. Part of our design includes a processing layer which would validate, enrich and harmonize the incoming lineage data. We are considering using data bricks for this component, and following the medallion architecture and having bronze, silver and gold layers where we persist the data in case we need to re-process it. We are considering delta tables as an intermediate storage layer before storing the data in graph format in order to visualise it. Since I have never worked with open lineage json data in delta format, I wanted to know if this strategy makes sense. Has anyone done this before? Our processing layer would have to consolidate lineage data from different sources in order to create end to end lineage, and to de duplicate and clean the data.

The request is as below“We are planning to automate and integrate AI into our test laboratory operations, and we would greatly appreciate your assistance with this initiative. Currently, we spend a significant amount of time copying data into Excel, processing it, and performing analysis. This manual process is inefficient and affects our productivity. Therefore, as the first step, we want to establish a centralized database where all our historical and future testing data—currently stored year-wise in Google Sheets—can be consolidated. Once the database is created, we also require a reporting feature that allows us to generate different types of reports based on selected criteria. We believe your expertise will be valuable in helping us design and implement this solution.”When i called for more information i was told, that what they do now is store all their data in tables on Google sheets and extract the data from there when doing calculations (im assuming using python/google colab?)Okay so the way I understood is:1. Have to make database2. Have to make ETL Pipeline?3. Have to be able to do calculations/analysis and generate reports/dashboards??So I have come up with combos as below1. PostgresSQL database + Power BI2. PostgresSQL + Python Dash application3. PostgresSQL + Custom React/Vue application4. PostgresSQL + Microsoft Fabric?? (I'm so confused as to what this is in the first place, I just learnt about it)I do not know why they are being so secretive with the actual requirements of this project, I have no idea where even to start. I'm pretty sure the \"reports\" they want is some calculations. Right now, I am just supposed to give them options and they will choose according to their extremely secretive requirements, even then i feel like im pulling things out of my ass, im so lost here please help by choosing which option you would choose for the requirements. Also please feel free to give me any advice on how to actual make this thing and if you have any other suggestions please please comment, thank you!",

        "author": "Jazzlike_Middle2757",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**I am being asked to do the following:**Replicate a \\~3000 line view from our ERP into Snowflake. This view calls other views which calls other views. The total number of views within this view is at least 100 (not counting the nesting). And the amount of nesting is anywhere from 2-6 levels deep to get to the base table from the views I have documented. This main view also calls about 300 packages as well. This views are used mainly in the where clause of this query. This view is related to sales, stakeholders are looking for at most a couple thousand dollars difference in total sales between the original view and the replica. My non-technical manager and the data analyst think that we could narrow down the difference by eliminating where clauses that are useless or provide little filtering. There are 100s of where clauses.I am a part-time employee, full-time student. My only support right now is a data analyst that does not code. I do all of the coding. My non-technical skip wanted this completed in July. Back then we were still building out the pipelines to get our data into Snowflake. We didn't even have data analyst. **I have suggested the following to my manager and data analyst:**1. Make a replica of the view from the base tables without all of the where clauses as a fact table. Identify a composite surrogate key from the view and import those columns as a dim table. Do a join between on the dim table and fact table. 2. Our second set of pipelines are doing transformations (joins, dropping columns, mappings) between the data lake (in parquet files) and our Datawarehouse in Snowflake. These transformations are done in Python using our orchestrator. My suggestion instead was to bring all of the base tables we needed into Snowflake without any transformations, copy-and-paste the query from Oracle and slowly work on replacing views with base tables. Both suggestions got rejected. The first was due to them wanting to have transparency on the logic and rules being done. The second due to them thinking this would add more time for the project and effectively making the previous work redundant. Edit: I am a novice in data engineering so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

More context, in dimensional modeling we have facts and dimension, facts are not connected to other facts, only to dimensions.. so say I have two fact tables 1 for ecommerce sales and 1 for store sales, I can't output how much we sold today for both tables as there's no direct relationship, but the relation between both tables and calendar makes me output how we sold individually. even AI fails to do the link and as my goal is reporting I need to the option to output all my facts together in a report.

For accessing the VPN i received a openvpn profile and credentials. The Airflow workers themselves have access to public internet and are not locked inside a network.Now im looking for a clean and robust approach. As im the sole data person i prioritize low maintenance over performance. disclaimer: Im def reaching my knowledge limits with this problem as i still got blind spots regarding networking, please excuse dumb questions or naive thoughts. I see two solution directions: a) somehow keeping everything inside the Airflow instance: installing a openvpn client during DAG runtime (working with docker operator or kubernetespodoperator)? --> idek if i got the necessary privileges on the managed instance to make this work b) setting up a separate VM as a bridge in our cloud that has openvpn client+proxy and is being accessed via SSH from the airflow workers? On the VM i would whitelist the Airflow workers IP (which is static).a) feels like im looking for trouble, but i cant pinpoint as im new to both these operators. Am i missing a way easy solution?The data itself i will probably want to fetch with a dlt pipeline pushing it to object storage and/or a postgres running both on the same cloud.Cheers!",

        "content": "Hello everyone! I was wondering if anyone here could help me knowing what tools I could use to get usage metadata of Fabric Power BI Reports. I need to be able to get data on views, edits, deletes of reports, general user interactions, data pulled, tables/queries/views commonly used, etc. I do not need so much cpu consumption and stuff like that. In my stack I currently have dynatrace, but I saw it could be more for cpu consumption, and Azure Monitor, but couldnt find exactly what I need. Without Purview or smthn like that, is it possible to get this data? I've been checking PowerBI's APIs, but im not even sure they provide that. I saw that the Audit Logs within Fabric do have things like ViewReport, EditReport, etc. logs, but the documentation made it seem like a Purview subscription was needed, not sure tho.I know its possible to get that info, cause in another org I worked at I remember helping build a PowerBI report exactly about this data, but back then I just helped create some views to some already created tables in Snowflake and building the actual dashboard, so dont know how we got that info back then. I would REALLY appreciate if anyone could help me with having at least some clarity on this. If possible, I wish to take that data into our Snowflake like my old org did.",

All of a sudden, there is 1 value (or maybe hundreds of values) that are NULL for userid (out of millions). We have to change userid to be nullable or use an unknown identifier (-1, 'unknown') etc. This reduces our DQ visibility and constraints at the table level. so then we have to set up post-load tests to check if missing values are beyond a certain threshold (e.g. 1%). And even then, sometimes 1% isn't enough for the upstream client to prioritize and make fixes. the issue is more challenging bc we have dozens of clients and so the threshold might be slightly different per client. This is compounded bc it's like this for every other DQ check... orders with a userid populated but we don't have the userid in users table (broken relationship).. usually just tiny percentage. Just seems like absolute data quality checks are unhelpful and everything should be based on thresholds.",

I started my career in Jan 2021, now almost have 5 years of experience in Data Engineering.This is my 3rd firm I am currently working with which I joined around April this year at 28+ LPA fixed pay scale. Skills: Snowflake (DW and Intelligence) , DBT, SQL, python, ADF, Synapse, Python, Azure Functions, ETL/ELTI stayed in first firm for almost 1.5 yrs, in second for 2 yrs 10 months. And now with current firm for 7 months. My real learning happened while being in the second firm , up-skill on a lot of things, dealt with clients and what not, basically was in a consulting role. With the current switch, it’s a big MnC in healthcare with better employee policies than the previous firms I had worked with. The problem here is the type of work I am doing is of no use, not even upto the level of the previous employer. Just writing SQL transformations on DBT as ELT is already dealt by FiveTran, low code - no code tool. This is making my learning curve go down and I am really worried about my career as we see AI being involved in every domain and a downward learning curve at this moment in time is not acceptable for me. Even I do learn a few more tools say Databricks, pretty similar to synapse , implementations come up as a problem. Need your guidance from those sitting at senior roles or have passed through similar situations in the past.",

Looking for input from DEs/SWEs on how transferable this work is, whether the comp is normal for NYC, and what questions I should ask before deciding.Hey everyone, I’m looking for some candid input from folks in data engineering and software engineering.I’m currently in a strategy/operations role at a tech company while working through the MCIT program (Penn’s CS master’s for career switchers). My long term goal is to be a SWE. I recently interviewed for a Data Engineer II position at a healthcare tech company, and im trying to evaluate whether this role would be a good stepping stone to SWE or if I should just leverage my degree and build projects to make the switch. I’d appreciate any honest advice or experience people have.Here are the key details:Background / motivation* I’ve worked strategy consulting and it has led to a good paying career but I don’t care about strategy in all honesty. I dislike the politics to get promoted, work is quite boring where im learning nothing new* I like consulting in the fact that I had to learn a new industry everyday, but TBH I couldn’t deal with 15-16hr workdays just to learn more* I love the technical side and building things which is why I considered SWE about a year and a half ago (I just expected the market to be better by then lolz) Comp* Base salary: $105–115K (Remote but I live in NYC)* Other factors are TBD as I haven’t gotten the formal letter yet, just verbal and what the job description outlines* I currently make 155k base and TC ~180k so it would be a pay cut for this roleTeam / Org Structure* The role sits in the data - analytics org, not the software engineering org* DEs partner with analytics engineers, ML/data consumers, data scientists* I would not be in the analytics engineering track or an analyst, but they would be my stakeholders* No direct SWE involvement as far as I can tellTech + Responsibilities* Mostly Python + PySpark on Databricks* AWS and Azure* Both streaming and batch pipelines* Medallion architecture (bronze/silver/gold layers)* ADF wiring + pipeline orchestration* File ingestion + transformations + schema enforcement* Some framework or pipeline component building, but unclear how deep the engineering side goes* Not much SQL involved, which surprised me, but they emphasized if they were asking for SQL it would be for more analysts vs engineersMy goals / questions:My ultimate target is a technical heavy role that still pays well, like SWE or backend, but I’m also open to becoming a stronger DE if it meaningfully raises my chances of SWE transitioning.Any insights on the following would be helpful:1. Does this sound like a DE role with strong engineering exposure that can help facilitate a SWE transition? 2. How transferable is this experience toward SWE or backend engineering later?3. For those who started in DE and moved into SWE, what allowed that transition?4. Is $105–115K base realistic for NYC in a mid-level DE role, or does that seem low?5. Would you take this role if your long-term goal leaned more toward SWE?6. Anything I should ask the hiring manager or my internal referrer to get more clarity?I’m not trying to bash the role or Data engineering, I’m genuinely trying to understand if this would meaningfully advance my pivot or if im better off staying in my current role and continuing to work on transitioning directly. Any honest input from experienced DEs or SWEs would really help. Thanks!",

It’s a local-first scraper that hits Reddit’s JSON endpoints directly to structure the data.The Architecture:Ingestion: Python requests with a rotating User-Agent header to mimic legitimate traffic and avoid 429/403 errors. It enforces a strict 2-second delay between hits to respect Reddit's infrastructure.Transformation: Parses the raw JSON tree, filters out stickied posts/memes, and extracts the selftext and top-level comments.Analysis: Performs keyword frequency mapping (e.g., \"Excel\" vs. \"Calculus\") against a dictionary of 1,800+ terms.It outputs and generates a structured JSON dataset and uses reportlab to programmatically compile a PDF visualization of the \"Reality Gap.\"I built it like that cuz I wanted a tool that could run on a potato and didn't rely on external cloud storage or paid APIs. It processes \\~50k threads relatively quickly compared to browser automation.Link with showcase and Repo : [https://mrweeb0.github.io/ORION-tool-showcase/](https://mrweeb0.github.io/ORION-tool-showcase/)I’d love some feedback guys on my error handling logic for the JSON recursion depth, as that was the hardest part to debug.",

All data lands in S3 first, and Dagster processes it from there.The data follows a 3-tier hierarichal pattern. (note: the field names have been changed)* Each `EQP_Number` contains multiple `AP_Number`* Each `AP_Number` has 0 or more `Part_Number` for it (optional)https://preview.redd.it/20m26hc0ow2g1.png?width=1297&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f3aa452890a6e899815899ee9acf0129126f176&height=222Example file list: EQP-12_AP-301_Part-1_foo_bar.csv EQP-12_AP-301_Part-2_foo_bar.csv EQP-12_AP-302_Part-1_foo_bar.csv EQP-12_AP-302_Part-2_foo_bar.csv EQP-12_AP-302_Part-3_foo_bar.csv EQP-13_AP-200_foo.csv EQP-13_AP-201_foo.csvMy current idea is to use a 2-dimensional partition scheme with dynamic partitions for `EQP_Number` and `AP_Number`. But I’m concerned about running into Dagster’s recommended 100k asset limit. Alternatively, I could use a single dynamic partition on EQP_Number, but then I’m worried Dagster will try to reprocess older data (when mew data arrives) which could trigger expensive downstream updates (also one of the assets produces different outputs each run so this would affect downstream data as well).I’d also like to avoid tagging processed data in S3, since the client plans to move toward a database storage/ingestion flow in the future and we don’t yet know what that will look like.What partitioning approach would you recommend for this? Any suggestions for this?",

They are also archiving this data from landing zone and moving to archive zone using data pipeline and copy activity for the files which completed loading.

On top of that, being new means I don't have the experience to be able to accurately tell whether something is hard or easy, which made things even more obviously dumb.And NOW I finally realize that, all I had to do was first cover the base case scenarios (like learning how to build a basic page that navigates around other pages) and then come up with something that I want to build, and start stumbling around 99% of the time trying to figure out how to build it. Obviously that would mean spending more time googling, reading articles, stackoverflow etc. than actually writing code. Duh! It's the first time I do most of the things required.So you think at this point \"okay bro, now you know how people learn by building projects and connecting the dots to make functional software, congrats\". But no amount of knowing about it saved me from the fundamental power fantasy of tutorials! Because that's what following the 10th tutorial in a row is about: Consuming the solution to problems someone else stumbled onto, in order to feel like you're making progress fast.I'm such an idiot.",

The second part was a technical screening with two backend developers. They showed various technical terms on the screen, one by one, and asked me to explain them: things like API, REST, microservices, encoding vs. encryption vs. hashing, some CLI commands, DOM, XML/JSON/YAML, and so on.The thing is, I’ve been working with these concepts for over three years. I use them regularly, and I understand them in practice. But I really struggled to \\*explain\\* them clearly. I couldn’t put into words what I actually know how to do. It made me feel like I completely bombed what should have been simple questions.Since I’m self-taught, I’m wondering if this is just a gap in the theoretical knowledge you’d typically pick up in school. I already deal with imposter syndrome, but this interview made it feel a lot worse.I haven’t studied specifically for technical interviews before, but after this experience, I feel like I should.Has anyone else gone through something similar? Any advice for improving this kind of theoretical knowledge?",

Nothing too big, not full-on projects, just exploring concepts. The thing is, I feel a bit stuck because I don’t have a lot of project ideas to apply what I’m learning. And honestly, I’m not sure if “learning by doing” is the right approach for me right now. It feels like there’s a huge emphasis in programming circles on just jumping in and building stuff, but in other fields like medicine or other branches of engineering, you spend a lot more time on theory before you start doing anything practical.So I’m curious to hear from you all: Did you have a moment where you finally felt confident enough to start building things? What was your breakthrough? And how did you get over that feeling of “I need to know everything before I start”? I’d love to hear your stories and get some advice on taking that step into actually building something real or even contributing to open source.

I used InterviewCoder for some of those sessions because it gives structure instead of chaos. It forced me to slow down, think out loud, and understand my approach instead of just clicking through problems. Weirdly enough, I improved faster with less stress. I feel like half of interview prep is just learning to be calm and organized, not solving a million questions. Wish I realized that sooner",

Problem is, we just got into reading and writing .txt files, and because my coding folder is on Google Drive, the directories are all messed up and my code can never find those files.My entire coding tab on VSCode is saved on Drive. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get that back onto my SSD so the directories work normally again. I've tried downloading the files from Drive but that doesn't seem to help. Any advice would be amazing, thank you.Edit: a friend FaceTimed me and helped me figure it out! So for some reason, when I tried to move the folder to my desktop or onto my local drive, I would get an error message. But what *did* work was ctrl+x on the file and then pasting it onto my desktop. Still not sure why I couldn’t move it, but that solved the problem and all of my code now exists on my local drive!Thank you to everyone for your help, as soon as this assignment is done I’m going to start learning git",

When I ask AI it says you need these ones and I feel like a idiot. I dont know how people before actually got answer to what they needed.

Now I’m thinking of diving deeper into Python, but I’m not sure which tool is the best long-term fit.If you were starting fresh today, would you stick with Claude, go with GPT-4/5, or try something else entirely? I’ve also seen people mention Sweep AI for more “project-aware” help inside IDEs, but I haven’t used it enough to know if it’s better for beginners.Does AI help, or does it get in the way of actually understanding the basics?",

I ended up writing a comprehensive guide covering 25 different algorithms, including:- The Classics: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick.- The Modern Standards: Timsort (used in Python) and Introsort (used in C++).- The Weird Ones: Pancake Sort, Gnome Sort, and the chaotic Bogo Sort.",

I alone have built over 40 page templates (in the last 2 years) for this site at this point, and I don't work with anyone because only one other person codes, and it's my boss, who I am senior to with this kind of programming. Truthfully, I hate it. I hate web development, and I hate doing this day in and day out. I was just sort of forced into it, and now it's destroyed my passion for the field. I could go on about why I hate my current job, but I'll move on.If the job market weren't demotivating enough, I'm so exhausted from work that I don't want to sit at my own computer at home, which makes learning so difficult. I remember during my first Python class, I was fascinated by a simple function that told you the total length of all sides of a shape based on the shape and length of one side. I tinkered with that and other code so much and never got tired of it. Now I'm sick of the thought of code, and that makes me sad because my dream is still to get into the gaming industry. The idea of not getting in makes me want to cry.I want to reignite that love I had for coding. I want to get back into it and find that love for tinkering and understanding how things work (I'm actually very good at learning through reverse engineering. It's how I learned everything I know about web development.) Is there a game or something that teaches code, particularly C++, in a way that is different and fun? I've been trying to work through an Udemy class that is actually taught very well, but I keep running into that block because it's just mostly watching someone code, taking notes, and then doing a couple of exercises throughout the chapter. It's just another class.And please, don't tell me about how difficult things are out there. I already know, and I need to be motivated, not have what little of a spark that's left put out.",

Right now, anyone who comes in sees the same progress and data. Obviously, it's not ideal if I want real users...I currently use SQLite, but plan to move to PostgreSQL. What would be the best way to start recording the progress of each user separately? Do I put a user ID on all tables or is there a cleaner, more scalable way to organize this?Any tips, tricks or experience you have would be great. I want to keep it simple but without getting into problems in the future.",

I based my Dissertation I did a software development project.For this project I basically attempted to mirror what the dev team at my place of work did. It was a Full Stack project:.Net C# BackendREACT frontendMVP Design PatternSQL Server ExpressORM (Microsoft Entity Framework Library) for interacting with the databaseThis burnt me out. Due to also working at a company that did not believe in work-life balance, I ended up rushing this project and the dissertation. Granted although not every feature was working perfectly, it did work. And yeah... I passed the module (and burnt out after a final month of finishing work at 5pm and coding or writing dissertation till 2am every day).Initially my tutor was very against me using this technology stack. As none of it was covered by the Open University. As well as pulling this off I was teaching myself C# from scratch, REACT from scratch and ORM from scratch (I shamefully admit, I had to ask chatGPT a few questions regarding that).Anyway, fast forward a year or so, and I am finally building a portfolio, as being in a more inf orientated job really does not suit me.So this week I started learning Flask. I actually have tried the very tutorials I have now completed previously and to be honest it confused the hell out of me. However... after my ordeal with C# and .Net, damn this just seems easy and straight forward. I would even say I am enjoying it.Anyway this weekend, I will be refactoring my Tic Tac Toe project to Flask and touching up the Vanilla HTML/CSS frontend I have already made (albeit zero functionality). And yeah.... I am going to need to start taking GitHub more seriously (ie a Readme file).I know this adds no value to any thing and is not even a question. But I was dreading Flask based on my experience with C# and .Net. Someone even told me recently that I should not have done what I did for my Dissertation Project and it was wayy to ambitious, but whatever.... I passed.",

I just finished building my first app, developed the design myself and used symfony to build the app (i'm lacking in backend dev...) and most of the code was written by AI. I give directions, i know what feature to describe and how to technically build it using the rights terms, the right prompts and asking for the right things. But not typing the code myself makes me feel like i'm heading straight into a wall. I want to learn hard, started to learn vue js by myself and how to use components. But in the end i always reach for AI as to dev a feature faster. I'm afraid i won't make it far in the pro world if it keeps going. Do you guys have any recommendation for a guy who wants to dev for a living, mostly frontend without being own by Cursor or Claude ? What's the ideal roadmap to balance things....

I realized how behind I am compared to my peers since I have only completed school courses, which are very theoretical and more so like \"fill in the blanks\" type of projects (at least up until now). I can write pages of math proofs for sorting algorithms but I can't code for the sake of my life.Because of this, I accepted a job offer as a data analyst for 8 months. It isn't what I want to pursue since I want to pivot more into the SWE side of tech, but I'm taking it just so I have some time off from school to self-learn programming and build some projects before I get back into school (and also to network since it's a very, very large company.) I feel like I can't contribute much to my course projects. Also, my college is very well known for CS/ AI and I feel like I'm not utilizing my opportunities enough due to how useless I am.With that said, with my co-op coming up soon, I need some advice on where I can get started and the best way to go about this most efficiently. I know python and java in terms of syntax, I know all the structures like loops and stuff, but I haven't coded any projects before. I know R and SQL as well but that is useless.I think I can commit about 3-4 hours per day on average for the next 8 months (I will still be taking a calculus proof course + a data structure class on top of full time work, for the sake of 3rd year courses prequisites).Any advice will be helpful! I am a bit stupid but I am willing to put in the work to catch up to everyone. It definitely is overwhelming starting from zero haha, there's so many resources, so many terminologies, so many languages out there... I'm hoping I would find the most efficient way so I won't be wasting my time. Hopefully I'll be able to build some complex project by month 5. Thank you :)",

        "content": "I’ve been experimenting with LinkedIn’s mini-games recently, and I got curious about how some of the puzzles actually work behind the scenes. A few of them felt like they relied a bit too much on trial and error, so I turned that curiosity into a small side project. I built a browser extension that reads the puzzle when you open it, figures out the pattern, and then gives hints or can even solve it automatically. Right now it only works with the “Zip” puzzle, but I’m planning to expand it as I go.While building this, I ended up learning way more than I expected. I got a much better understanding of how Chrome extensions are structured, how to use content scripts to interact with a page, and how to scrape and interpret the DOM in a way that doesn’t break when the site loads things dynamically. I also had to figure out how to design simple pattern-recognition logic, handle communication between different parts of the extension, and work through a bunch of timing issues that I’d never really run into before. Publishing it taught me how the Chrome Web Store process works too. Overall, it was a fun reminder that small projects are often the best way to learn things you didn’t even know you needed.If anyone wants to take a look or offer feedback, here’s the extension on the Chrome Web Store:https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/linkedin-puzzle-cracker/immohpcmpcbpfbepgkjacopkajnllpak",

I mainly only took mostly math theory courses(lin alg, probability, random processes), and I feel like it really didn't work for me to have so little exposure to any practical things. I feel like I was exposed to some mathematical programming in Matlab and a lot of proofs.My bachelors was in computer science, but for electives I took quantum/math(stuff like number theory), and I was mediocre at it--so I didn't have exposure to any SWE electives/ lack of time investing in programming.I spent a lot of time looking at hard things without having a foundation nor specialization, and I struggle to be practical in getting things done, how to break down projects, how to learn things.I am trying to be consistent with Python projects for data science roles, but I think I choose things too big in scope and I end up really lost on how to build out a project on my own. For example, I am trying to build a Python CLI that uses models I downloaded for inference. I have written out the processing logic for predictions on paper, but I get lost in managing multiple python files, how to organize my functions, how to choose the structure of my data, how to handle the logic for the inference pipeline. I have trouble not jumping around everywhere between my files, and I guess I read more Python than I write it myself. **I feel like I spend weeks just reading and never doing anything. I am good at concepts, but not writing the code.** I am trying to go for \"data science\" roles, but I only sometimes worked in Jupyter notebooks using sci-kit learn models or implemented the math for some algorithm in a singular python file. I am a little lost on whats the best way to get better programming for data science. What is the best thing I can do to maximize my chance of getting a job at this moment and learn to be more practical?",

However when I run it on Ubuntu on my laptop it has a tendency to 'swallow' records or even loop endlessly for larger amounts of records (50k and above, maybe a bit below too), it happens very frequently, about half the time if not more often. still works fine for smaller amounts though. To check I installed WSL on my laptop too (I have dual boot) and it ran fine and dandy there too. What could possibly be the reason behind this? g++ version on Ubuntu and WSL is the same, so is the block size.I've handed in my code already so what's done is done on that front. It is a bit of an odd situation though so idk.Edit: It was somehow the matter of the mktime() function, for some reason on native Ubuntu it occasionally returned different time_t values for tm structs with identical valuesEdit: It was actually somehow the matter of my laptop.

For that, I need to design a collection system that reliably gathers publicly available thread metadata from Reddit (titles, timestamps, comment counts, etc.) without breaking any API rules or putting load on the infrastructure.I’ve tried two approaches so far. First, the official Reddit API, but my application wasn’t approved. Second, I tried using a scraping service, but that returned consistent HTTP 403 errors, which I assume are anti-bot protections.Before I build the full system, I want to choose the right engineering approach. My constraints are long-term stability, strict rate limiting, predictable failure behavior, and minimal load on external services. Nothing related to bypassing anything; I just want a clean and reliable pipeline.The options I'm evaluating are: building a pipeline around the .json endpoints with strict rate limiting and retry logic, using something like Apify to handle scheduling and backoff, or creating a hybrid setup that treats external data sources as unreliable and focuses on resilient architecture, caching, and backpressure.From an engineering point of view, which approach tends to produce the most maintainable and fault-tolerant system for long-term public-data collection?I’m not trying to gather private info or circumvent restrictions. This is strictly a systems-design question about building a predictable, well-behaved pipeline. Any advice from engineers who have built similar systems would help a lot.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I've been re-learning 68000 graphics programming using the Hatari emulator and the vasmm68k compiler and ran across a fairly disappointing limitation of the BSET instruction.The 320 x 200 ST video memory buffer is laid out in sets of 4 words to hold 16 pixels per set where the color palette index bit 3 of pixel 0 is the 1st word's most significant bit. Bit 2 of pixel 0 is in the 2nd word's most significant bit and so on. Pixel 1 is the OR of all the 2nd most significant bits of the 4 word set, kapish? The next 16 bits across are held in the next 4 word set in ram.Why didn't they simply place adjacent nibbles in memory to represent the pixel's palette index? Perhaps the decision was based on how the hardware draws the additional resolution modes where the number of words for the 4 color medium resolution mode is reduced to 2 and the highest resolution, monochrome is just one word. Interesting, they might have been able to support an 8 bit palette color index with 8 words allowing for a blocky 256 colors @ 160 x 100 resolution. So anyway I was happily coding along doing BSET.W D5,(A0)+ to set a specific bit in word 0 thinking I could automatically work word 1 next then move on to word 2 and so on and was puzzled when the compiler said, no my friend, that is not allowed!What? What's not allowed? I pulled up the BSET specs and sure enough, BSET only supports an opcode extension of byte or long. Drat! So now I have to do an ADDQ #2,A0 after each word manipulation.I'm still in awe of the 68000 instruction set though, what a thing of beauty....

I get 85% of my work done between 9am - 1pm, im sure the majority of these people are like that. I just cant for the life of me understand why they don't just leave?

I’m trying to figure out if anyone has found a good exit path or ideas for transitioning into something more stable. Analyst roles interest me, but even then, despite being comfortable with SQL, I keep hearing that I “don’t have enough experience,” which is frustrating.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Background: Mid 2022 bootcamp grad. Got a job as a mostly frontend developer for 65k. Was there for \\~1.5 years, after our big project, they laid off about 1/4 of the company.Just had an 8 round interview process, I thought there wasn't a chance. Got the call, they said it was an easy decision for them and I signed the offer for 115k today. I'm over the moon.So what worked / didn't workApplying:Had 3 referrals, none turned into interviews. I think the value of referrals have gone down dramatically in the last couple of years and that a lot of companies stopped giving referral bonusesI didn't get a single entry / jr level interview. I think the no cs degree hurt for those roles, so many say 1-2 YoE so I thought I was a shoo-in, nahMy success rate fell sharply after 6 months unemployment. Success rate improved dramatically (only for mobile positions) after publishing a personal project (this was about a year into unemployment, I had a single interview in months 6-12 and it didn't go past hiring manager)No interviews from linkedIn job apps, despite targeting same day postingsgot 2 interviews from hiringcafe and an ai auto fill extension (simplify)I went in-person and dropped off a resume to two local companies that I saw had openings. One gave me an interview (50% success rate, you were right Grandpa)The mobile position I got, came from linkedIn. I stumbled across the tech lead of a local company posting about the opening, there was no linkedIn job posting. I messaged him about my app and he said he tried it out, liked it and wanted to interview me.I think the other 2 or 3 came from hackernews, again, where I was talking directly to somebody technical about my app.I tried linkedin premium and messaged a ton of hiring managers / recruiters, nothing came from thoseI had 6 or 7 interviews in the last year and a half, all above my last role. Was definitely unprepared for the first few, feel I went from jr. to mid level while unemployed.But yeah, highest success rate was finding local companies and contacting somebody who was technical (and part of the hiring process) about what I was working on Technical Interviews: I was grinding leetcode for a bit but found it not to be worth while (past getting comfortable with mapping and array, obj, string manipulation). I did have some coding challenges but they weren't leetcode mediums or hards, either can you fetch data, format / display / style it or a leetcode easy to see if you can code (though I didn't interview at major companies). I did have two system designs interviews earlier on that I wasn't prepared for. And one later on that I knew was coming and spent a week cramming for. Did really well in that and moved to final round but didn't get job. My recent interview didn't have a strictly system design round but a lot of topics I had studied did come up in conversation and I'm glad I was able to talk on themAnother thing that was a huge help was I was MUCH less stressed about the recent interview. I thought I wasn't going to get it, was working as a bartender so had money coming in, might as well see where it goes and try to learn something. Most of the interviews I had when I was deep into unemployment, I would get 2-4 hours of sleep the night before because I was so stressed. Somehow, the night before this company's technical, I had planned on doing leetcode all night but I was strangely tired, thought I wasn't going to get the job anyways and didn't want to waste my night off doing coding problems. I ended up conking out hard way earlier than I typically go to bed and had the best nights rest I've had in two years. I truly don't know how it aligned that way but being well rested was way more valuable than a couple more leetcode problemsBehavioral interviews:The 3 companies I interviewed with - post releasing my app - were much more interested in my app than my previous role. They were all for mobile positions.I also started keeping an interview prep journal that had 6 star stories (and what questions they could be used in) as well as all other questions I've been asked in interviews (and had a separate tab for system design notes)I would often get a \"how's your week going\" question at the start of interviews. Early into unemployment, I thought, 'I don't want to waste their time', and just say something like, 'It's been a good week, have been looking forward to this interview.' and let them jump into it from there. After it happened a few times I realize they want to see if they can have an actual, casual conversation with you. So in these last few interviews, I always made a point to spend literally a minute, 2 max, chatting. Just something like an event that weekend I was excited for. The recent interview the guy had mentioned having a kid, the next interview I asked what his kid was dressing as for HalloweenThe other thing that was a big help was the CEO really liked me. I really didn't understand the company's industry, so I spent a couple of hours with ai learning about it, making sure I knew some basic terminology, read articles about the company, and had actual, non fluff questions, about the company and the industry for the CEO. In the middle he mentioned being surprised by the questions65k -> \\~27/hour -> 115k Again, absolutely over the moon. Very excited, will be working hard to make sure I continue to grow and never go through such a grueling unemployment periodTl;dr Try talking to technical people directly. Look local. Have some system design knowledge. Build something with users. Be well rested and sociable. Be able to talk about the company, past being a developer. Good luck to those searching and be easy on yourself, it's hard out there.",

Companies are slapping the FDE title on sales engineering work because it sounds cooler and attracts better candidates.How do you tell if it’s fake? Look for quota, OTE, or commission structures - that’s sales, not engineering. Check if the role reports to Sales/GTM instead of Engineering. If responsibilities focus on demos and deal closure rather than production deployments, or you hand things off after the contract signs, it’s not real FDE work.In short, read the job description, dont just base everything off the job title.",

We also surprisingly don’t do layoffs, we’ve never had layoffs even when oil hit negative during covid.I currently have 4 years of experience in software and before that I was an electrical engineer with 4 years of experience. I’ve been with this company for almost 4 years now.Right now I’m currently a Senior within the company but probably out in the market I’d be considered a mid level. I’m working my way up in the company pretty quick and I have a good relationship with my manager. I believe within 3 years I’ll be at a manger role with my TC somewhere around $350k.In terms of the work I do, it’s a variety of backend work from API development, to ETL’s, managing database schemas/SP’s, and working with real time data. The tech stack on the backend is mostly Python with a little bit of .NET, I’ll be dabbling in GO soon as well for our realtime data calculations from RMQ. On the database side I’ve pretty much worked with every sql/nosql database you can think of. I’ve been thinking about my long term career growth. I’ve seen posts about people making 500k - 1m TC and would like to work towards that. I’m absolute dogshit at LC, however at work I’m able to architect out solutions for new projects and solve issues quickly. I would say I still have room to grow here, I’m still learning new things and have the freedom to introduce new technologies. Wondering what I need to do to prepare for that next big jump?

I'm making 200k, I have health insurance, my boss is nice, and yet still I may have just completely fucked it up.Basically, here's the situation: I'm on a small team with just me and my boss. We use an in-house office software with a built-in chat and email, but 99% of the time we just use the chat or talk face-to-face.However, the office software sucks. If you don't use it for an hour, it disconnects without any notification. While you're disconnected, chat messages get sent to email, and don't display in chat when you log back on. The home page displays new email notifications, but only some of them, not all of them. I thought it only filtered automated messages, but I was VERY wrong.This week my boss was on a business trip. He was still working in my timezone though so we could talk. I was waiting for some details in the chat, but either I was logged off or he just emailed it directly. Either way, no notification.The day after he sent it, I had a day off I scheduled in advance. While I was out, he forgot I had off and sent me an email. Same thing, no notification.Two days later, I got a message from him. While he'd remembered I had a day off, he was still extremely pissed that I hadn't seen his emails. He said it was the bare minimum act of communicationAdmittedly, it feels like he'd be right at most other companies, but we'd always used other means of communication. Before he left, he even gave me his phone number saying it's how I should contact him if he wasn't online to recieve chat messages, completely overlooking the email.Regardless, my contract is supposed to be renewed soon, and now I'm worried it won't be. I'm not sure what to do to hopefully avoid being shitcanned.",

        "content": "Just in case this would be useful to anyone as a datapoint...**About me:**- US Citizen- Graduated in 2022 from an average state school you may or may not have heard of - 3 YOE at the time of job hunting, all at one SaaS company in SF (+ 2 internships) - Full time experience was all backend development, and I did lead a larger project at my last company so I used that as a talking point in interviews - Located in San Francisco, looked to the entire Bay Area for my search. Wasn't open to relocation outside the Bay but that didn't seem to matter thanks to the AI boom... **Gearing up:**Total time from interview prep to first offer: 3 months (beginning of May 2025 to end of July 2025)Resources used: Paid for neetcode and the design gurus grokking system design course, and studied them meticulously. Already had LC premium and used that for specific companies. Didn't really do mock interviews because I was an interviewer myself at my last company and already had a ton of practice being on the other side of the table. **Applications & Interviews:**NOTE: All numbers are approximate and may be off by 5 or less, especially for interview counts. I didn't meticulously track everything. Number of applications: ~250 sent by me. However, I also got reached out to a lot and pretty much all of my interviews came from recruiters coming to me first, so I can't create a reliable Sankey diagram! I only used 2 referrals from my network and got ghosted by those companies anyway. Mostly targeted full stack roles at mid-late stage startups (Series C+), with the occasional big tech interview if they reached out to me first. Had 35 recruiter screens -> 32 first round interviews -> 14 second round+ interviews. Many of the first rounds were during my first few weeks studying, I used them to get my feet wet and didn't stress too hard over rejections. 14 second+ turned into 2 offers, 5 rejections, and I canceled 5 final rounds & 2 first rounds myself after signing. I had ~100 individual interview blocks total, according to my calendar. (not 100 companies, 100 interviews). **The offer I took:**- Series D unicorn healthcare startup, fully remote in SF Bay Area (with the option to go into the office whenever I want, or not.) Big upgrade over my previous hybrid job!! - Mid level / level below senior - $195,000 base salary ($20k raise over previous job), and some ISOs that I don't consider real money. - Full pivot into full stack from my previous 100% backend role(The other offer was $200,000, upleveled from junior to midlevel and hybrid in SF, but it was SaaS and I was tired of SaaS, plus they told me some stuff about the future direction of the company that I didn't quite like.)**Insights & Tips**1. I got asked a lot less Leetcode and a lot more \"practical\" coding, like writing API endpoints, parsing JSONs, and even writing basic websites from end to end.2. Around 3-4 interviewers encouraged AI use during the coding interviews. 3. LinkedIn pushes recently updated profiles to the top of recruiter searches, so every Sunday I would log in and make some minor change to my profile like adding a period, changing a word, etc. Then I would wake up on Monday with a full inbox. 4. I went back and replied to all the recruiters and startup founders that had emailed me in the past 6 months. Some were still hiring, others weren't. One very kind startup CEO still chatted with me for 30 minutes and offered to pass my resume on to his founder friends, nothing came of it but he gave me good advice anyway. 5. I interviewed on top of my day job by doing interviews 8-10 am, working 10-5, and then interviewing again 5-6. I didn't take a single \"sick day\" which I'm super proud of lol. Companies with an East coast presence were open to interviewing me as early as 7 am.6. As for how I pivoted to full stack with little to no frontend experience, YOLO I guess? The project I led had a small amount of frontend, and when I had fullstack interviews I did React crash courses and followed along. I got to the point where I knew what to look up for frontend, because most interviewers let you Google stuff on the spot if you look like you know what you're talking about, and just need to double check something etc.",

The pay cut is huge, but it seems way more stable, good hours, and good benefits. The tradeoff is it’s probably slower pace and not cutting edge.What I’m stressed about:•If I take 65k after making 129k, am I shooting myself in the foot long term?•Is it actually realistic to go back to higher-paying private roles later ?•For those who went public sector: did your skills keep growing, or did you feel like you stalled out?If you’ve gone from private → public (or back), how did it affect your career, pay, and stress?In my situation, would you take the 65k for stability, or keep holding out for something closer to what I was making before?",

If you want to get a job you have to be excited for it. You have to see yourself enjoying it, you have to go to the interview and show excitement and learn about the role, practice for the interviews, learn about the companies.I find myself finding jobs constantly that I KNOW I would be great at, that I am very qualified for, and would be really fun if I got them. 99% I either never hear back after applying or get rejected. I have to keep thinking about whether or not I will like a job while applying so I know I am applying to jobs I want, but man it sucks never actually getting to see any of it through.The worst is when you go through interviews. In my experience they usually are not very truthful, they'll give you praise throughout the interview, drag you along through multiple rounds, over a month of interviews. Then right when you feel like you have a chance, poof, ghosted. This has happened to me many times.I just don't know how much longer I can go through this process of interviewing with a company for a month or more just to be ghosted. Hell, I haven't had a company formally decline me after going through multiple rounds of interviews in YEARS. They all just ghost me now.I just want to get my life back, man.",

        "content": "I’m in my 40s, currently working as an SDE2/Senior-level engineer at a big tech company. Compensation is solid and the work is technically interesting. The flip side is the usual big-tech stress: reorganizations, shifting priorities, constant pace, and the general feeling of volatility.I’m considering an offer for a “Principal”-level role in local government IT. The job is stable, unionized, slower paced, and has a predictable schedule. The work looks more enterprise/ERP-focused and nowhere near as chaotic as big tech.My concerns are:Whether I’m actually ready for a Principal role: I’ve operated at a mid-to-senior IC level, but I haven’t formally held a Principal title before. I’m worried about stepping into Principal-level expectations in a new domain and whether I’ll be able to perform at the level the role requires.Getting pigeonholed: Government IT tends to have slower-moving tech and more specialized enterprise systems. I’m concerned that if I spend years there, my skills might narrow and limit future private-sector options.Long-term compensation ceiling: Government positions have fixed salary steps and a hard cap. Once you hit the top step, raises are basically cost-of-living adjustments. In private tech, there’s still room for higher comp and growth.I’m trying to balance a more stable and predictable lifestyle with the risks of taking on a bigger role, potentially narrowing my skillset, and reducing long-term earning potential.If anyone has moved between private tech and government IT, especially mid-career or at a senior level, I’d really appreciate hearing how it affected your career, confidence, and quality of life.",

I'm significantly underpaid for my experience and degree (MS in CS + certs) right now, and I'm paranoid that long tenure looks like I'm either stuck or coasting.

I currently have \\~4 YOE and am a US citizen (I know this helps when evaluating risk)1. **Work** \\- Both companies have what I think are interesting work. I put embedded-specific details here for those are interested, but they both feel equally cool - [Embedded Software vs Board Support Package : r/embedded](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1p44co2/embedded_software_vs_board_support_package/). Meta would be more high-level / specific product work while Qualcomm is a more general role where the work will touch many of their products across their portfolio. This makes me wonder if working on a niche application like AR glasses would be better/worse for long-term career development2. **Location** \\- Meta would have to be in Sunnyvale while Qualcomm is in San Diego. I currently live in SoCal so I would have a preference to stay here, but I can't deny that there seem to be more opportunities in NorCal. Nonetheless taking Meta would require moving / establishing things in a new location3. **Culture** \\- I've been hearing bad things about Meta / Reality Labs, but I'm not sure how true they are since I've been relying on anecdotes from Blind (which is admittedly a negative community). I'm sure Qualcomm has its own pitfalls (e.g. offshoring), but I haven't heard of anything to the severity of Meta's current reputation with stacked ranking and PIPs4. **Compensation** \\- Both roles are pretty accurate to their grades on levels.fyi. Qualcomm would be a senior engineer role in San Diego while Meta would be E4 role in SunnyvaleAny advice would be appreciated. I know having the brand name of Meta on a resume does wonders for a career, but I want to make sure I have as complete of a picture as I can.Edit: since there was some interest in the comments:* Meta (Sunnyvale) - 193k + 100k RSU/year + 35k sign on* Qualcomm (San Diego) - 147k + 43k RSU/year + 35k sign on",

I don’t know if it’s my imposter syndrome holding me back or if I’m genuinely confused. Financially, I earn the same as a senior would according to job postings I’ve seen however at my company I’m a mid level. I don’t feel senior because the senior at my company has a lot more knowledge than I do… there’s only one senior dev in my company so he’s who I’m judging myself against when I think of a senior engineer. So I guess my question is, what makes an engineer senior? (Not just years of experience because I have come across engineers with 1 year of experience 5 times claiming they have 5 years of experience, if you know you know)",

But I understand that’s not even the TC so it’s not really a 1:1 but is there a way to know the min I would be offered without actually seeing the offer?Fwiw I do check Glassdoor and it seems kinda inaccurate bcs I compare my and my coworkers salaries to what the site says for my company and it’s not as accurate as I would imagine",

And the layoffs happened for many other reasons, than AI.Then theres AI and LLMs. Probably a hot take, but I wonder if new graduates don’t get hired, not because of bad recruitment experiences, but because many of them are incompetent. The crazy amount of cheating that is happening in those classrooms is shocking.Last bad not least, the AI will replace you talk. I know few senior devs and they laugh this off, as some had the idea that we eventually become hybrid engineers, where you combine your skills with AI to provide new and better software solutions.I didn’t research about the vibe code community yet, is this worth looking into or is this just plain AI slop but for code, at this point?Your further insights will be appreciated.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm a senior software engineer at a FAANG-adjacent company, \\~8 YoE having come from a mid-size startup and then a FAANG company for several years. Been at this company about a year - first manager was amazing, probably the best manager I ever had and most of the team agrees. He left a few months in to me joining and a manager from a sister team took over. At first it was thought to be temporary but now it seems there's no plans to backfill. Basically from the get-go she decided she didn't like me. About 2 weeks into her tenure a change I launched had to be rolled back and from that moment on she's decided I was no good. She was on PTO and then out of town for over a month and basically had no 1-1s with me or most of the team during that period and didn't show up to meetings, but then threatened to hit me with a Below Meets rating for very unclear reasons. I worked my butt off to try to reverse this and just get a Meets, but even since then it's been confusing and nightmarish. Every 1-1 with her has been filled with \"feedback\" and it's gotten to the point where now I'm getting anxiety attacks just at the thought of meeting with her. She never asks me what I'm doing or how I am, just launches straight into feedback on how what I'm doing is wrong or how I'm messing up. It's never technical feedback of course, it's always vague, behavioral feedback. The thing is, I'm a pretty engaged member of the team, I speak out quite a bit and I'm opinionated and try to be helpful, but I can never be clear what she actually wants. The kicker is her feedback is contradictory - a few months ago it was \"be on slack more\" and then recently it was \"you're on slack too much\". Things like that. One time she finally asked me what I was doing. Her feedback was that she had no idea and that I should be better about surfacing my updates - put the updates in JIRA, write them in the standup updates, surface them in our weekly meeting, as that's what she looks at. I then shared my screen and then showed her: I had put my updates in my JIRA tickets for the week, I had written full and clear standup updates, and I had shared my latest project in our weekly meeting when she was out. She then goes \"Oh okay thanks\". She rules on infighting and fear - asking people for feedback on each other, always making it feel like she's trying to build cases against people, etc. I know I could be biased so I thought it was just me. However, a few months into this, I talked with other people on my team and learned she was the EXACT same way with them, albeit arguably a bit harsher with me. I then heard stories about how her last team at the company entirely disbanded cause of her and that she had gone through the same thing of threatening to downrate someone immediately after becoming their manager with another girl. The final straw came recently when the most senior guy on my team recently got fired by her. I was working very closely with him - he was well-respected, been at the company for over 10 years, etc. But after he got fired I found out from him that what he went through was the same as me but worse - she gave him a below meets after 1 meeting with her, kept giving him constant, nitpicky, negative feedback for months with no clear expectations or guidance to improve, and then had HR show up to a meeting with him and threatened PIP or quit. I could give more specific examples but you get the picture. I guess first of all I just wanted to vent. Second, I wanted to know - is there any chance this could still just be me exaggerating this in my head, or is this on her at this point? Like, I'm not slacking at work, I produce work constantly, I even worked until 10pm last Friday night just out of fear. Is this normal? What is one supposed to do in this case? Is this just the state of the industry right now? Ultimately I've decided to try to look internally for new roles and also start interviewing externally, but I know that's going to take several months and I'm really stressed at the thought of having to deal with this and study for and do interviews. Like, just the thought of having to interact with her alone gives me stress and anxiety (I've never felt like this at a job before) and I don't know how to make it through. On top of that, I have kind of a side hustle I wanna dive into, it doesn't make much money right now but I haven't been able to give it my all the last few months cause of this situation, and I'm wondering if I should just go into that now or put that more on hold while I look for a new job. Thanks for listening.",

        "author": "NigoDuppy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I’m trying to figure out when a salary increase actually justifies giving up a very comfortable setup. I officially have a 5-day/week job, but because my manager and I work remotely and are in different countries with different weekends, I’ve effectively been working 4 days a week for the last 1.5 years with a 3-day weekend. The work is simple, mostly Power BI dashboards and Power Automate flows for upper management, with nothing deeply technical or challenging. The problem is that the job is *too* comfortable. I’m not learning much, and I worry that future cost-cutting (I work in corporate) or AI could replace me since the work is so basic.Because I essentially work 4 days (32 hrs/week), my hourly rate is higher than it would be in a typical 5-day (40 hrs/week) job. For example, if I took a job with a 50% salary increase for a 5-day schedule, it would end up being only about a 20% increase in hourly pay after adjusting for the extra day and hours I would work. So I’m stuck asking myself if a 20–25% hourly increase really worth giving up a 4-day WFH lifestyle?I’m a CS graduate, but I ended up in this role because the job posting was labeled as Software Engineer. It turns out the only real engineering work was rewriting a legacy system using the Power Platform. After that, it turned into pure dashboards and Power Automate flows on the business side because my manager believed upper management liked fancy, colorful reports that were tangible and made their lives easier.Before this job, I was studying AWS, Terraform Linux, and getting into Kubernetes, but I haven’t touched any of that in a year, and I feel like I’m falling behind. If I stay in comfort, I risk stagnating, but at the same time I don’t really know where I can go from here, or what percentage increase in salary or hourly rate is worth leaving this job. Also, my company is a large corporate, and one of my goals is to work abroad. I checked their internal positions offering relocation, and almost all of them are either pure engineering or management roles. I don’t think it’s realistic for me to apply to any of these in my current position unless I sharpen my engineering skills, as management is still a pipe dream given that I’m still junior with only about 2 years of total experience.So essentially my questions boil down to:1. What kind of pay increase would make you give up a 4-day WFH job? Is 20% hourly increase enough? That’s already roughly a 50% increase in total salary.2. Should I pivot to a technical path like cloud infra/DevOps, which I plan to study over the next 6 months, or is there a well-paid path using my current skills? Would transitioning to data engineering instead be a better? Is it realistic in that timeframe?",

        "content": "Context: I am a software engineer working at a company that was recently acquired. Currently make 135k. My current company is being merged into a larger parent company and there were some recent layoffs. Management has signaled these will not be the last, and there will be more next year after a 'discovery' phase where they figure out what can be integrated into the parent company's existing software and what cant. Sometime after that (undisclosed time), there will be an RTO to a different city (I am currently WFH). We are currently mostly working on documentation + support work instead of new features. This has resulted in me going on a job hunt.I have three options:Offer 1: 165k base salary, 15 days of PTO (WFH). Working on a recently started project modernizing a legacy system (like, lots of logic in stored procedures style legacy) to python / AWS, immediate team and manager seem really nice. \\~20 engineers total in the tech department.Offer 1 Cons: Company has been owned by private equity for the past 7 years, has 2.7 stars on Glassdoor, mentioning lack of raises, leadership shifting priorities, and layoffs / reorgs, position was a backfill.Offer 2: 145k base salary, 30k equity in company, unlimited PTO (Mostly WFH, in office \\~2 times per month). Management seems fun (like, trips to Cancun type stuff), really interesting and exciting IoT style work with golang. Company was a Series A startup a few years ago, but is rapidly growing now with lots of customers and doesn't need funding anymore.Offer 2 Cons: It would just be me and 1 other engineer who is on a contract (my position would be full time) and may or may not convert to full time. The tech side of the company just started and is still a very 'early startup' environment, so I would have to juggle Project Manager + Software Engineer responsibilities. Could be fun, could also be super stressful, especially if the other engineer who seems like would be 'firewall' for the rest of the business leaves after his contract was up.Option 3. Take neither offer and stay at my current company and keep looking and hope i dont get laid off before i find something better. I have been getting a consistent amount of interviews each month. Seems like the laid off employees at my current company got 2 months severance at least...What are y'all's thoughts?",

        "content": "I'm Canadian. I have a BSc in Psychology. This is my first time posting in a CS subreddit so please let me know if this is not the right place for this question.I've been thinking of switching into CS and finally decided to apply to schools with lots of Co-op opportunities. So far I've applied to bachelor's in UToronto (waiting), Waterloo (i may not meet eligibility requirements as a graduate), UBC (waiting; 20-month 2nd degree program) and UOttawa (got in). I prefer getting another bachelors since the schools I've picked comes with a good (rigorous) curriculum and a very good selection of co-op options as well as decent hiring rates post-studies. I want a strong, guided foundation even though I've done a little bit of everything by myself out of curiosity and interest (C++ in university courses, Python in high school, JS, html, CSS, AI/ML, Data Science). However my parents think it would be better to get a CS masters directly instead of \"wasting time\" doing another bachelors. The problem is well-reputed schools in Canada don't seem to offer masters without cs or related undergrad. The schools that do offer this option seems pointless to me because the market is already saturated and I feel like I would just be doing it for the sake of having just any CS related education. Plus they don't seem to offer any of the benefits that bachelors does (Co-op for eg). Clearly I'm biased towards doing a bachelors but I don't want to be close minded. I wanna know if I should consider masters as an actual option right away. My main focus is that my education shouldn't look like a drawback to potential employers, and there should be a better chance of employment. (Also I've read multiple times that strong portfolio and CS-based projects makes you a good candidate and that you don't need formal education but I honestly don't think I can be impressive enough pull that off. I'm willing to put in the work but I also need some structured learning before I can build my portfolio. Plus CS degree is a part of the mandatory requirements for a lot of job listings that I see so I don't want to be ineligible or automatically screened out for good opportunities)So what should I do? CS Masters without Bachelors or CS bachelors. **TLDR**; Are the chances of landing a job with a CS masters without CS bachelors the same as having a CS bachelors? I know landing a job in general would be hard but which offers me a better chance?",

The latest Anthropic model announcement pushed me further in that direction, especially after seeing developers say they barely write code now and reading some pretty dramatic predictions about software engineering not existing in a few years from actual Anthropic developers (yes I realize they stand to gain a ton by having people believing this, but I don't know if I have the luxury to hand wave it away).I am having a hard time seeing a long-term future in this field, which might be influenced by the fact that I am not currently working in it. Still, if I truly believe there is no future for me in this industry, then I need to plan for that possibility. Right now I am thinking that if I do not land a software job by summer 2026, I will go back to school for another engineering discipline, most likely power or mining.Until that point (maybe just so I can say that I tried, or because I want to feel less horrible about the student debt I accrued getting this degree), I'm gonna be grinding a ton, trying to land something. If that doesn't work out, then I'm likely gone for good from the industry at this time next year.I would appreciate any advice from people who have dealt with this kind of uncertainty or who have thoughts on whether setting a timeline like this makes sense. Obviously I cant sit around and hope for the best forever, especially when the clouds on the horizon look darker and darker.",

        "content": "I started as a new grad at Amazon back in mid-July and am still there. But I’m honestly feeling really worried about my performance. My manager never addressed any particular issues with my performance when we met 1:1 a few months ago (we never had a 1:1 since), but I was still worried. For every task I’ve been given so far, there’s a point where I don’t know what to do after I try figuring out myself and have to ask for help. I have been asked to give ETAs fore and can my very loose estimations were always less than how long it actually took to finish tasks since I barely know what I’m doing. There had also been an instance where I messed up the deployment for some of my changes, and my teammates had to help me rollback. One of the tasks I had been working on were supposed to be finished before this past week, but I couldn’t since the changes were more involved than I initially realized because of differences in the service between non-prod and prod (whereas it worked in non-prod where I had been testing prior). Teammates also had to step in again for that. I’ll even try reading through docs our team has to try to get a better sense of things, just for things to still not click. I know I’m supposed to properly ramp myself up within 2 more months, and I’m worried that I won’t be able to. There was a new task I was working on today, and once again, I got stuck on it and don’t know what to do. I was really hoping to make some progress during the weekend so I can finish it ASAP, but…I guess that isn’t happening anymore.At this point, I feel like I should probably cut my losses and focus more energy on getting a new position since people are saying that there’s another layoff in January, and I heard that my organization was going to be impacted. I don’t have any other ground of suspicion of getting laid off, but another intern I knew had gotten laid off during the first wave when he started a few months before me, and I’m one of the least experienced people on my team. Either that, or I’m guessing getting PIP’d. I was wondering if anyone happened to have any advice for what to do.",

I casually searched for around 5-6 months, really only applying to things that looked interesting, or any interesting recruiter reach out.My Results:[https://i.imgur.com/gjJvgQ5.png](https://i.imgur.com/gjJvgQ5.png)*Note: these are a bit general numbers. This happened over a few months, so might be +/- one or two things I forgot about*In general, I was pretty selective. I had a few dozen recruiter's message me, but only took 10 or so calls. Most were from in office startups that I had no interest in, or non tech companies which I wasn't really interested in.Some notes on my search\\- I make around 220k base at my current position, so any job needed to match that number (TC-wise anyway) \\- I preferred remote, but for large public tech companies, was open to moving. But any startup needed to be remote (Unless something like OpenAI, etc, which of course didn't happen) \\- Needed to be at least a tech forward company \\- I only responded to first party recruiters \\- I refuse to do take-home assessments \\- I didn't do any interview prep for any of these, so my failure rate was a bit high\\--In terms of general hiring vibes, I'd say the biggest difference was in the recruiter/HM screens, much more selective there, probably due to how easy it is to AI generate a reasonable looking resume now. I've pretty much never been rejected at that stage, but did end up getting rejected a couple times from HM's after the recruiter screens.Likewise, a few companies also wanted to do take home assessments before even going to the normal techs screens. I immediately dropped out from those (I hate take homes personally)Other than that, the general feeling was pretty similar from other times I've been on the market.",

(I don't count the random calls out of nowhere as they're either scam job training or they hang up after realizing I don't have years of experience). I have no confidence I'll ever be able to get out of jobs like that (if I'm working full time in some random back breaking job I won't have time or energy to interview or do anything else, and upward mobility doesn't exist, and once recruiters see my resume with a dead end job on top they will reject immediately because a guy with actual skills wouldn't be forced into a job like that). I'm also not physically strong or sociable so jobs like that would probably kill me after years in them. And it would mentally destroy me too, what's the point of trying at all in school or in general if I can only get a useless dead end job?I feel so useless, I know I should be spending every day applying to 100+ places and doing useful projects but I'm not very motivated to? I've actively tried to force myself into it, deleting video games off my computer and archiving the folders for most of my useless projects but I kind of relapsed and did more work in those, but I should know those projects are going to absolutely nothing for me useful. I need someone to push me around so I can finally delete them and move onto something that will actually help me. They have no impressive metrics so there is nothing to put in resume bullet points. No recruiter is going to be impressed by an ugly indie rpg prototype or a garbage chess engine that's 100x slower than the stuff you can already get out there. And neither of those projects have a massive CI/CD pipeline or use expensive cloud servers or use Docker or whatever else is on the long list of technologies that are mandatory nowadaysI just don't know what to do? I need to get a good job at some point but it's feeling more and more impossible? This time of the year might be really bad for hiring also, but I feel like I can't wait months to get a job or else it looks like I'm unhireableResume wise it is pretty unimpressive but I'm losing motivation to try to make \"impressive\" things, I haven't been able to come up with any \"useful\" project ideas that justify me paying money for an enterprise level server for something (found somewhere that said that real projects have to use enterprise level things, free servers are for useless toy projects). I can't \"make something I'm interested in\" because the things I'm interested in are all useless, I need to only work on useful things which means I can't pick something that I like to work on, I have to only work on something that will help me and not just play all day. I don't feel like I'm skilled enough to make a project useful and impressive for a specific company since they have their own experienced developers, who am I to think that I can surpass all of them combined? (Plus even if I spent months on a project like that what's to say their recruiter just rejects me before even seeing the project, or the company just rejects me anyway because they flat out aren't hiring low experience people?)",

Has the role name in the offer and everything, but was placed on the QA Automation team. At first, I did not know much, except that it's not liked, so I gave it a couple weeks, got some tasks, and I realized that I don't like this work at all, it isn't fufilling and I miss development work. I tell this information to my boss, about how the role is misleading and how I want to switch and be given tasks, and if it's possible to switch and they said it can happen, but it takes time and that someone did that after working in qa for a couple years. So, this isn't a good situation for me, I don't want to be stuck doing this work forever, then struggle later getting a dev job. Even hearing the word QA is becoming a trigger word for me, because there's that seperation between being qa and being a dev, and I am not considered a dev. It sucks knowing that after 4 years of grinding CS work, and doing full-stack projects, that you spend your time running tests and trying to find bugs, but don't get to fix them. Since i only worked here 2-3 months now, should I include this in my resume when I am applying, or pretend it dosen't exist and just apply without it? Also has many people had this issue happen to them? I know it's not the end of the world, but it makes me anxious knowing each day longer I am here, the more I feel like I am settling and i can do better. So I decided to just bite the bullet and start back on applying, but I just want to know whats the best thing for me to do. Thanks for reading.",

        "content": "Hello, everyone.I need your help picking a book to expand my knowledge in fundamentals of computer science.I am a mechanical engineering major, and about 3 years ago I decided to switch careers and learn programming. Thing is, while doing this, I focused more on hands on knowledge that will help me find a job, not fundamentals. I started with Harward's CS50 course for some basics, then learned Java and Spring, basics of SQL and Git, and then a bit of data structures and algorithms. After about 8-9 months, I landed a job and started working.Currently, I am feeling that I missed a lot of fundamental topics and I would like to cover the blank spots before I can further improve. I have no problem understanding any technical topics, I have always been a good student, and math/physics/engineering was always my forte.I feel like I need to cover the following topics: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networking and Database Systems. I understand that all of these topics are broad enough to cover several books by themselves, but reality is, I don't have that much time to dedicate to studying each topic.Hence, I would like a recommendation of a single book (preferably, but it can also be a video course) that would give me an overall knowledge on all of these topics, so that when the need arises, I would at least know where to look for more detailed info. What I am looking for, is a book for self-taught programmers like myself, to cover some of the more glaring blank spots, that would also give enough fundamental knowledge so that I can later dive deeper into any specific subject.Thanks for reading and your help.",

However, I really enjoyed my time with B (can't understate this enough), and I know the hours would be considerably better (at least 1h30m less than A, daily).B is also a much bigger name, and has a couple particularly deep strengths which could enable me to seriously upskill and pivot back to finance if I wanted to. TC grows steadily year-on-year; I think £150-160k TC by year 4.On the other hand, I suspect that As comp would grow similarly fast, and probably skews towards big bonuses in particularly good years. I also feel like it'd also set me up well to join a tier 1 firm (say Citadel, DE Shaw).Anyone been in a similar situation? If so, how would you weigh in on this? Would really appreciate any advice.",

I studied Computer Science and graduated with a decent GPA in 2022.After finishing uni, I joined a company which was tech-adjacent. We sold educational robotics products like robots / drones / submarines etc. It was very cool work, but I did not actually program these products for the most part. In my second job, it was completely out of our field, I worked with hotels and sold food products.Along the way I have gotten experience and picked up many skills with lots of diversity but little mastery. I have done pretty much every function of a business (except actual cs work) you could imagine to a junior-mid level including but not limited to Operations Management, Accounting, Sales, Marketing, etc.This has one one hand I believe has made me quite a well rounded individual which is a jack of all trades, but naturally, I am a master of none and my identity as far as my career is concerned is very much all over the place with no one clear goal.I left my most recent job due to a change in management, and now I am on the hunt for a job again. My first reaction is to want to get into Data Analytics as I did this in University, enjoyed it and I feel that it is in demand. My second reaction is to do something like Business Analytics as this leverages my business knowledge and tech knowledge but the downside is that it is not very tech heavy. Failing both of these, I believe I could pivot into a project management role.With the above context about me, what do you think my next steps should be? I am hoping to get up to speed and clean off the rust in the next month to try and get a job after the new year. If anyone could provide insight or even redirect me to something I might be missing that would be much appreciated. Thank you for the help!TLDR:- CS Graduate 2022- Worked unrelated jobs 3 years- Lots of experience in other business related roles but not CS- Looking for a job now back in Data Analysis / Business Analysis / Project Management",

I'm willing to rerecruit for ft as i would like to be in NYC for ft for personal reasons. Duolingo NYC is extremely unlikely and Doordash seems somewhat more possible. Currently what's most important to me are:* Exit opportunities/res value if have to rerecruit* Career growth if ft at those companies* Stability and future aspects of the company* WLB (worried about burning out at DoorDash if I get a bad team)Insights?",
