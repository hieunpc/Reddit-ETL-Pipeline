        "content": "I started working this job in mid 2019. Back then, data lakes were all the rage and (on paper) sounded better than garlic bread.Being new in the field, I didn't really know what was going on, so I jumped on the bandwagon too.The premises seemed great: throw data someplace that doesn't care about schemas, then use a separate, distributed compute engine like Trino to query it? Sign me up!Fast forward to today, and I hate data lakes.Every single implementation I've seen of data lakes, from small scaleups to billion dollar corporations was GOD AWFUL.Massive amounts of engineering time spent into architecting monstrosities which exclusively skyrocketed infra costs and did absolute jackshit in terms of creating any tangible value except for Jeff Bezos.I don't get it.In none of these settings was there a real, practical explanation for why a data lake was chosen. It was always \"because that's how it's done today\", even though the same goals could have been achieved with any of the modern DWHs at a fraction of the hassle and cost.Choosing a data lake now seems weird to me. There so much more that can be done wrong: partitioning schemes, file sizes, incompatible schemas, etc...Sure a DWH forces you to think beforehand about what you're doing, **but that's exactly what this job is about**, jesus christ. It's never been about exclusively collecting data, yet it seems everyone and their dog only focus on the \"collecting\" part and completely disregard the \"let's do something useful with this\" part.I understand DuckDB creators when they mock the likes of Delta and Iceberg saying \"people will do anything to avoid using a database\".Anyone of you has actually seen a data lake implementation that didn't suck, or have we spent the last decade just reinventing RDBMS, but worse?",

Airbyte was interesting because of the open source angle and we liked having control, but self hosting added a whole new category of things to maintain which defeated part of the purpose for a small team. Matillion felt more oriented toward transformation than data ingestion which wasn't quite our primary use case.Precog had more reasonable pricing and less operational overhead, though their documentation could use work and the UI takes some getting used to if you're coming from fivetran's polish. Each has tradeoffs depending on your scale, team size, and needs. Happy to answer questions about specifics.",

I've been tasked with modernizing data infra to move 200+ data pipes from ec2 with worst possible practices. Made some coordinated decisions and we agreed on dagster+dbt on AWS ecs. Highly scalable and efficient. We decided to slowly move away from redshift to something more modern.Now after 6 months I'm half way through, a lot of things work well. A lot of people also left the company due to restructuring including head of bi, leaving me with virtually no managers and (with help of an analyst) covering what the head was doing previously.Now we got a high-ranked analyst from the larger company, and I got the following from him: \"ok, so I created this SQL script for my dashboard, how do I schedule it in datagrip?\" While there are a lot of different things wrong with this request, I question myself on the viability of dbt with such technicality of main users of dbt in our current tech stack. His proposal was to start using databricks because it's easier for him to schedule jobs there, which I can't blame him for.I haven't worked with databricks. Are there any problems that might arise?We have ~200gb in total in dwh for 5 years. Integrations with sftps, apis, rdbms, and Kafka.

I work on this project with a senior dev with 10+YOE.A lot of my work on this project feels like I'm reinventing the wheel. My senior dev strives for minimizing dependencies to not be tied to any package which makes sense to some extent, but we are only really using a standard API library and pyodbc. I don't really deal with any business logic and have been basically recreating an ORM from the ground up. And at times I feel like I'm writing C code, like checking for return codes and validating errors at the start of every single method and not utilizing exceptions. I don't mean to knock this senior dev in any way, he has a ton of experience and I have learned a lot about writing clean code, but there are some things that throw me off from what I read online about Python best practices. From what I read, it seems like SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Prefect are popular frameworks for creating ETL solutions in Python. From experienced Python developers: is this approach — sticking to vanilla Python, minimizing dependencies, and using very defensive coding patterns — considered reasonable for ETL work? Or would adopting some standard frameworks be more typical in professional projects?",

I am looking to develop AI skills that will complement my Data engineering expertise and not looking to completely move away from data engineering. How should I approach this? I love my data engineering job but also have FOMO in terms of AI",

I'm about 5 months into my job and I feel horrible and terrified; I really like the people that I work with and the energy that they give off but I think that I need to find a new job because I don't think this work is for me because I find it repetitive, frustrating, and anxiety inducing.I really tried understanding the work that I do by working all throughout December and New Years just to get a footing on some of the applications we are supporting but I get so frustrated because learning and understanding the technologies of the application and how we investigate them is so limited that I am forced to ask and or set a meeting with a senior instead of finding it on my own using some guide or written documentation. I also find it frustrating that sometimes when I ask a question to different people (whom have been with the team for more than a year) only for them to give off different answers.Our documentation is so scattered its stored on individual or group OneNote, confluence, excel, azure dev ops, some obscure SharePoint, and sometimes pdfs that were just being shared or sometimes not even shared (for reasons beyond my understanding). On the bright side, they are pushing towards a more unified and reliable way of storing documentation. I get anxious answering to users / operations manager because honestly, I'm scared that what I'm saying is absolutely wrong or something I assumed, so every time I have to ask someone to verify what I'm saying.I also feel misled with my title of being a data engineer and doing specifically only investigation and escalation to other teams and it feels more like a support rather than a DE (and this is for the whole team, there will be no touching of pipelines / code or actual data).On some positive note, I got my AZ-900 and AI-102 (planning for more) and I constantly try to better myself by taking advantage of the free learning sites of the company and now starting some side projects. Given of what I am experiencing, is this my cue to find another job ?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So, I'm learning data engineering core principles sort of for the first time. I mean, I've had some experience, like intermediate Python, SQL, building manual ETL pipelines, Docker containers, ML, and Streamlit UI. It's been great, but I wanted to up my game, so now I'm following a really enjoyable data engineering Zoom camp. I love it. But what I'm noticing is these tools, great as they may be, they're all higher level abstractions of like what would be core, straight up, no-frills, writing raw syntax to perform multiple different tasks, and when combined together become your powerful ETL or ELT pipelines. My question is this, these tools are great. They save so much time, and they have these really nice built-in \"SWE-like\" features, like DBT has nice built-in tests and lineage enforcement, etc., and I love it. But what happens if I'm a brand new practitioner, and I'm learning these tools, and I'm using them religiously, and things start to fail or or require debugging? Since I only knew the higher-level abstraction, does that become a risk for me because I never truly learned the core syntax that these higher-level abstractions are solving? And on that same matter, can the same be said about agentic AI and MCP servers? These are just higher-level abstractions of what was already a higher-level abstraction in some of these other tools like DBT or Kestra or DLT, etc. So what does that mean as these levels of higher abstraction become magnified and many people entering the workforce, if there is going to be a future workforce, don't ever truly learn the core principles or core syntax? What does that mean for us all if we're relying on higher abstractions and relying on agents to abstract those higher abstractions even further? What does that mean for our skill set in the long-term? Will we lose our skill set? Will we even be able to debug? What do all these AI labs think about that? Or is that what they're banking on? That everybody must rely on them 100%?",

It was only a year contract and mid way I applied to grad school for Data Science. At the beginning of my program I also started a Data Engineering Apprenticeship, it went on for almost the whole school year. I completed my first year with great grades. That summer I started a summer internship as a “Systems Engineer“. The role was in the database team and was more of a “Database Admin“ role. This is where the story takes a dumb turn. I’ll never forgive myself for having everything and letting depression ruin me instead.At the beginning of my internship I had 3 family deaths and I spiraled. I stopped trying at work, was barely doing things just to get by. I remember even missing a trip to a data center that my team was going on. I isolated myself. I even got a full time offer in the end and I never responded to the email. I wasn’t talking to anyone. 2nd year started and I started to attend but stopped eventuall. I should have dropped out but I couldn’t even bring myself to type up an email. I just failed and didn’t re-enroll. I moved in with my brother bc I wasn’t taking care of myself. I essentially took a year off, which consist of me getting help. After about a year of the fog dissipating, I finally felt ready to try again. I’m not re-enrolling in school bc I’m pretty sure my GPA tanked, and I realized DS isnt my passion, I REALLY REALLY enjoyed my DE apprenticeship and constantly using SQL in my database role. All that said, I have been job searching for about 8 months now. Which totals to 1 year and 8 months since my last “tech” role. This looks so so bad on paper. What would you guys do if you were me? How would you go about making yourself marketable again? I am applying for very low level roles bc I think that’s they only thing I qualify for right now; data entry w SQL, Data Reporting, Data Specialist, etc. TLDR: I had my career going in a great direction towards DE and let depression ruin everythin. Almost 2 years later I am trying to rebuild but I am unmarketable. What would you do to get back in the DE career path?",

No driver visibility, silent failures, or i find out hours later something broke.I know foreachRDD body runs on driver and the functions i pass to mapPartitions run on executors. Thought uncaught exceptions should fail tasks and surface but they just get lost in logs or swallowed by retries. The streaming batch doesnt even fail obviously.Is there a difference between how RuntimeException vs checked exceptions get handled? Or is it just about catching and rethrowing properly?Cant find any decent references on this. For Kafka streaming on EMR, what are you doing? Logging aggressively to executor logs and aggregating in CloudWatch? Adding batch failure metrics and lag alerts?Need a pattern that actually works because right now im flying blind when executors fail.",

I have a project management, product management and analytics background but no open source. I know graphanalytics was used across the massive Panama papers dataset, but never used that technology myself.I’d be happy to contribute in whatever way possible.If you think it could help and I any way and have any resources (time, money, knowledge) and want to contribute - ship in! What would we need to get going? Could we get inspiration from the way “open source” projects are formed? Maybe the first step would just make the files a little easier for everyone to work with - downloaded and transformed, classified by llms etc? Code that does that needs to be open so that the raw data is traceable to the justice.gov file. Thoughts?",

I finally setup clickhouse locally. But before that I was trying out duckdb. And even though it worked great in performance. Realised how it doesn't have much concurrency. And you had to rely on writing your code around it. So decided to use clickhouse. Is that the best solution for working with larger tables where postgres struggles a bit? I feel like even well written queries and good schema design could have also made things work in postgres itself. But we were already on redshift so it was harder to redo stuff. Just checking in what have others used and did I do it right. Thanks.",

This is very compute-intensive so I am thinking it is optimal to just pull data nightly and fed it into a data warehouse we would own. This would also play nice with our other smaller ERP/CRM softwares we need data from.The data jobs are fairly small.. I would say like 20 tables/views with \\~5000 rows on average. The question is what data warehouse to use to optimize price and performance. I am thinking Azure SQL server as that looks to be $40-150/mo but wanted to come here to confirm if my suspicion is correct or there are any other tools I am overlooking. As for future scalability considerations… maybe 2x over the next year but even then they are small jobs. Thanks :)",

        "content": "I’ve been digging into the recent news about Fundamental AI coming out of stealth with their Nexus model (a \"Large Tabular Model\" or LTM), and I have some doubts, I wanted to run by this sub.context: we have LLMs for text, but tabular data has always by tree-based models (XGBoost/LightGBM). Nexus claims to be the \"first foundation model for tabular data,\" trained on \"billions of public tables\" to act as an \"operating system for business decisions\" (e.g forecasting, fraud detection, churn).I have doubt regarding the data standardisation, unlike text, which has a general structure, business data schemas are the messy. \"Revenue\" in Company A might b \"Total\\_Sales\\_Q3\" in Company B. Basically relationships are implicit and messy.If businesses don't follow open standards for storing data (which they don't), how can a pre-trained model like Nexus actually work \"zero-shot\" without a massive, manual ETL work?I've been trying to map where Nexus sits compared to what we already use:1. Nexus vs. Claude in Excel: Claude in Excel (Anthropic) is basically a super-analyst. It’s a productivity tool. Nexus claims to be a predictive engine. It integrates into the data stack (AWS) to find non-linear patterns across rows/columns automatically. It’s trying to replace the manual modeling pipeline.2. Nexus vs. Deep Learning Architectures (TabNet / iLTM): TabNet (Google) is an architecture you train \"yourself\" on your specific data. It uses sequential attention for interpretability (feature selection). iLTM (Integrated Large Tabular Model - Stanford/Berkeley) seems to be the academic answer to this. It uses a hypernetwork pre-trained on 1,800+ datasets to generate weights for a specific task. It tries to bridge the gap between GBDTs and Neural Nets. LaTable: This is for generating synthetic data (diffusion).Questions for the community:1. Has anyone actually tested a \"Foundation Model\" for tabular data (like Nexus or the open-source iLTM) on messy, real-world dirty data?2. Can an LTM really learn the \"schema\" of a random SQL dump well enough to predict fraud without manual feature engineering?3. Is this actually a replacement for ETL/Feature Engineering, or just another black box that will fail when Column\\_X changes format?",

During that time I was passed over for promotion of senior two different times, likely because of new team leads that I have to start over with. I’m currently at a career crossroads, on one hand I have an offer letter from a company that has since ghosted me (gotta love the government contracting world) since September for a Junior DE role at a higher salary than what I’m making now with promise to be promoted and trained within 6 mos.My current org is doing a massive system architecture redesign and moving from Databricks/spark to .net and servicing more of the “everything can be an app”. Or so they say, you ask one person and it’s one thing you ask another and it’s completely different. That being said, I’ve been stepping up a lot more and the other day my boss asked if I’d be interested in moving down the SWE path. Would love to have some others thoughts on this, TLDR: Continue to stay with current org moving to .Net and away from Data Engineering or pursue Company that has ghosted since September but sent offer letter.",

I don’t see a bright future there any longer but the role is well paid and fully remote.One of my options will likely be a team lead role. The job is for a regionally recognized software company that works in the finance space. It’s likely similar to a data engineering and architect role with some management of some junior developers. The role will be more corporate and pays roughly the same after the year-end bonus but will require being in-office twice a week.The other option is a senior data engineering role at another smaller startup that just raised some capital. It’s better paid but will require being in-office three times a week. Overall, the leadership team is strong and everyone on the team seems very down-to-earth.What would you guys lean towards?

I've been wondering, the capacity would break only if i do a pull during the day. What if i create an application that would incrementally keep loading the data into blob as and when it appends in the raw tables? And also, if there is any way that i can tap into the capacity metrics of the database to ensure that the pull happens only when the utilization is below 40 percent, then that would be brilliant too. Any SAP experts here, please help me out. This would change a lot of things for me.As far as I've checked Debezium cannot be used. Now i can keep polling on the transaction tables, but that doesn't seem to help me in anyway. It could be counterproductive. Is there anything else i can use?Thanks in advance",

        "author": "Lastrevio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "For instance, does a star schema actually reduce redundancy in comparison to putting everything in a flat table? Instead of the fact table containing dimension descriptions, it will just contain IDs with the primary key of the dimension table, the dimension table being the table which gives the ID-description mapping for that specific dimension. In other words, a star schema simply replaces the strings with IDs in a fact table. Adding to the fact that you now store the ID-string mapping in a seperate dimension table, you are actually using more storage, not less storage.This leads me to believe that the purpose of database normalization is not to \"reduce redundancy\" or to use storage more efficiently, but to make updates and deletes easier. If a customer changes their email, you update one row instead of a million rows.The only situation in which I can see a star schema being more space-efficient than a flat table, or in which a snowflake schema is more space-efficient than a star schema, are the cases in which the number of rows is so large that storing n integers + 1 string requires less space than storing n strings. Correct me if I'm wrong or missing something, I'm still learning about this stuff.",

At its core, it is a PTY Shell wrapper written in C++Some of the current features are:\\- The ability to add some extra info to your standard \"ls\" command, the \"ls\" formatting, and your terminal colors are fully customizable. It is able to scan and output thousands of folders information in an instant. It is capable of scanning and estimating how many rows there are in your text files, without causing any delays, for example estimating and outputting info about .csv file with 21.5 million rows happens as fast as your standard 'ls' output would.\\- The ability to query your databases with automatic recursive .env search\\- Ability to run the exact same functionalities in remote sessions through ssh. This works by deploying a safe remote agent transparently to your session.\\- Easy setup and will prompt you to automatically install missing dependencies if needed\\- Has a lot of configuration options to make it work in your environments, in your style\\- Tested rigorously for safetyEverything else can be found in the READMEI will keep on updating and building this project along my B.

        "content": "I am evaluating the ingestion strategy for a SQL Server DWH (using dbt with the sqladapter, currently we only using stored procedures and wanna set up a dev/prod environment for more robust reportings) with a volume of approximately 100GB. Our sources include various Marketing APIs, MySQL, and SQL Server On Prem Source Systems. Currently, we use Metadata Driven Ingestion via Azure Data Factory (ADF) to load data directly into a dedicated SQL Server Bronze DB.Option A: Dedicated Bronze Database (SQL Server)The Setup: Ingestion goes straight into SQL tables. Dev and Prod DWH reside on different servers. The Dev environment accesses the Prod Bronze DB via Linked Servers.Workflow: Engineers have write access to Bronze for manual CREATE/ALTER TABLE statements. Silver/Gold are read-only and managed via CI/CD.Option B: ADLS Gen2 Data Lake (Parquet)The Setup: Redirect the ADF metadata pipelines to write data as Parquet files to ADLS before loading into the DWH. Tho, this feels like significant engineering overhead for little benefit. I would need to manage/orchestrate two independent metadata pipelines to feed Dev and Prod Lake containers. But I will still need to somehow create a staging layer or db for both dev and prod so dbt can pick up from there as it cant natively connect to adls storage and ingest the data. So i need to use ADF again to go from the Data in the Lake to both environments seperately. At 100GB, is the Data Lake approach over-engineered? If a source schema breaks the Prod load, it has to be fixed regardless of the storage layer. I just dont see the point of the Data Lake anymore. In case we wanna migrate in the future to Snowflake or smth a data lake would already been setup. Even tho even in that case I would simply create the Data Lake „quickly“ using ADFs copy activity and dump everything from the PROD Bronze DB into that Lake as a starting point.

Coming from the ETL/ELT design, where ADF pipelines and python notebooks in databricks are reusable: Is it possible to design an Azure-based Integration Platform that is fully parameterized and can handle any usecase, similar to how a Data Platform is usually designed?In Data Management Platforms, it is common for ingestions to have different “connectors” to ingest or extract data from source system going to the raw or bronze layer. Transformations are reusable from bronze until gold layer, depending on what one is familiar with, these can be SQL select statements or python notebooks or other processes but basically standard and reused in the data management as soon as you have landed the data within your platform.I’d like to follow the same approach to make integrations low cost and easier to establish. Low cost in the sense that you reuse components (logic app, event hub, etc) through parameterization which are then populated upon execution from a metadata table in SQL. Has anyone got any experience or thoughts how to pursue this?",

Here’s some highlights of our systems and team. \\- Data is ingested mostly through Informatica (I know there are strong opinions about it in this community, but it’s what we have today) or integrations with S3 buckets. \\- We use a Medallion style architecture, with an extra layer. (Bronze, Silver 1/basic transformations, Silver 2/advanced transformations, Gold).\\- We have a small team, currently 2 people with plans to expand to 3 in the next 6 - 9 months. \\- We have a Dev Snowflake environment, but haven’t used it as much because the data from Dev source systems is not good. Would like to get Dev set up in the future, but it’s not ready today. Budget is limited. Don’t want to pay a bunch, especially since we’re a small team. The goal is to have a location where we write our SQL or Python scripts, push those changes to Bitbucket for version control, review and approve those changes, and then push changes to Snowflake Prod.

To create views based on the timezone\\_bridge\\_dim and bring those in the semantic models and create the relationship between all the date keys. But my semantic model is Direct Lake on OneLake and the views don't even show up to select them and I don't want to use DirectQuery because is less performant. I also read about a solution in PowerBI to create duplicate tables in the semantic model. But I don't quite find the steps to do that and if I understood correctly, is going to work again only with DirectQuery. Did you encounter this problem in your modelling? What solution did you find? Also, the performance is so different from the Direct Lake vs Direct Query? I know I started this thread targeting Microsoft Fabric, but i think this is a common problem in modelling the data.

What I can’t understand is how this works when I switch to using hash keys - which are ultimately very random non-sequential strings. If I try to group my micro partitions by hash key value it will force the partitions to keep getting recreated as I “insert” new hash key values, rather then something like a “date/customer” natural key which would likely just add new micro partitions rather than updating existing partitions. If I add date/customer to the fact as natural keys, don’t expose them to the users, and use them for no other purpose then incremental loading and micro partition organizing— does this actually help? I mean, isn’t snowflake going to ultimately use this hash keys which are unordered in my scenario?What’s the design pattern here? What am I missing? Thanks in advance.",

        "content": "Good morning everyone,For context I was a functional consultant for ERP implementations and on my previous project got very involved with client data in ETL, so much so that my PM reached out to our data services wing and I have now joined that team.Now I work specifically on the data migration side for clients. We design complex ETL pipelines from source to target, often with multiple legacy systems flowing into one new purchased system. This is project work and we use a sort of middleware (no-code - other than SQL) to design the workflow transformations. This is E2E source to target system ETL.They call us data engineers but I feel like we are missing some important concepts like modeling, modern stack and all that. I’m personally learning AWS and Python on the side. One thing that seems to be interesting is that when designing these ETL pipelines is that I still have to think like I’m coding it even though it’s on a GUI. Like when I’m practicing Python for transformation I find it easier to apply the logic. I’m not sure if that makes sense but it feels like knowing how to speak English understanding the concept and then using Python is like learning how to write it.Am I a data engineer?? If not what am I :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: this is all new for me and I’m looking for advice on where I can close gaps for exit ops in the future.This is all very MDM focussed as well.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,I need some professional ideas on how to stage data that has landed in our ADLS bronze container to our Azure SQL Server on VM (or Azure SQL Database) which is functioning as our Data Warehouse. We have two seperate environemnts dev and prod for our Data Warehouse to test changes before prod deployment end-to-end.We are using DBT for transformation and I would like to either use smth like the \"dbt-external-tables\" package to query the ADLS storage (using Polybase under the hood I assume?). Define the Tables, columns and data types in the sources.yml and further stage those. I wouldnt need any schema migration tool like Flyway/SSDT I assume? I could just define new colums /tables in dev and promote successfull branches from dev to prod? Does anyone have experience in this? Also would incremental inserts be possible with this if the Data Lake is structured as bronze/table/year/month/day/file.parquetOR using ADF to copy the data to both prod and dev environment metadata driven. So the tables and columns for each environment need to be in some sort of control tables. My idea here was to specify tables and columns in dev in dbt's sources.yml. And when promoting to prod a CI/CD step would update the prod control tables with the new columns coming from the merged dev branch, So ADF knows which tables/columns to import in both environments. For schema migrations from dev to prod I would consider either SSDT or Flyway. I see a better future using Flyway as I could rename columns in Flyway without dropping them compared to SSDT. In SSDT from what I read I would just specify the final DDL for each table and rest is taken care of through the diff in the BACPAC file.",

        "author": "Prudent-Newt-7603",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "We’re currently running our data warehouse on SQL Server on an Azure VM and only have a single production environment. We want to move to a proper DEV/STAGING and PROD setup so we can test changes safely before promoting them to production.At the same time, we’re also introducing Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) as a central landing zone for raw data. Instead of ingesting directly into SQL Server like we do today, data will first land in ADLS in partitioned Parquet format (for example `/bronze///year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/`). From there, it would be loaded into SQL Server. This should give us better control, allow replay/backfills if needed, and make it easier to keep DEV and PROD consistent.Historically, most of our transformations were implemented using stored procedures directly in SQL Server. As things have grown more complex, this has become difficult to maintain and version properly, so we want to move transformation logic into dbt to get proper version control, modularity, and lineage.The main challenge we’re facing is around ingestion and schema management. dbt assumes that the source tables already exist in the warehouse, but in our case those bronze tables need to be created and updated first, including handling schema changes like new tables or columns.Since PROD will be locked down (engineers shouldn’t be able to write to it directly), we need a controlled way to manage and promote schema changes from DEV/STAGING to PROD. We also need a reliable way to ingest data from ADLS into both environments, either incrementally or as full reloads, without maintaining everything manually.Right now, we see two main options:**Option 1:** Use a migration tool like Flyway? to manage bronze table schemas via version-controlled migrations. ADF would then load data from ADLS into those bronze tables in both DEV and PROD, ideally using a metadata-driven approach.**Option 2:** Use external tables (there is apparently a dbt-external-source tables package that could handle that directly within the dbt repository) over ADLS and let dbt read directly from the data lake and materialize bronze or staging tables itself using incremental models. This would reduce the amount of ingestion logic in ADF, but we’re not sure how well this works with SQL Server on an Azure VM, especially around incremental loads, schema changes, and operational stability. Also given that the data is organized as `/bronze///year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/` would that even work as a pointer? Any help would be great!!",

Seemed reasonable. I had no idea what I was about to walk into.The first two hours were fine, I knew requests and BeautifulSoup from a tutorial. Then the site started blocking me and I had no idea why. Then I figured out rotating headers but the data was inconsistently structured across different listing types and my parser kept breaking in ways I couldn't predict. Then I realised I hadn't thought about where to actually store anything. Then I had to learn a bit of scheduling to make it run automaticly. Every single step opened three more questions I didn't know existed an hour earlier. I finished something working after about two weeks and it was genuinely one of the best learning experiences I've had, but I think the reason \"just build projects\" feels useless as advice is that nobody tells you the project will completley fall apart four times before it works and that is the actual point. If someone had told me upfront that constant breakage is the mechanism and not a sign I'm doing it wrong I would have panicked so much less in week one.

        "content": "We (/u/anishathalye, /u/josejg, and /u/jonhoo) returned to MIT during IAP (January term) 2026 to teach a new iteration of The Missing Semester (https://missing.csail.mit.edu), a class covering topics that are missing from the standard computer science curriculum.Over the years, the three of us helped teach several classes at MIT, and over and over again we saw that students had limited knowledge of tools available to them. Computers were built to automate manual tasks, yet students often perform repetitive tasks by hand or fail to take full advantage of powerful tools such as version control and IDEs. Common examples include manually renaming a symbol across many source code files, or using the nuclear approach to fix a Git repository (https://xkcd.com/1597/).At least at MIT, these topics are not taught as part of the university curriculum: students are never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that should be simple. The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing ecosystem that could make students’ lives significantly easier both during school and after graduation (most jobs do not formally teach these topics either).To help mitigate this, the three of us developed a class, originally called Hacker Tools in 2019 and then renamed to Missing Semester in 2020 (some great past discussion here: https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/eyagda/the_missing_semester_of_your_cs_education_mit/). Over the past several years, we’ve seen the course translated into over a dozen languages, inspire similar courses at other universities, and be adopted by several companies as part of their standard onboarding materials.Based on feedback and discussions here and elsewhere, along with our updated perspective from working in industry for several years, we have developed a new iteration of the course. The 2026 edition covers several new topics such as packaging/shipping code, code quality, agentic coding, and soft skills. Some things never change, though; we’re still using this hacky Python DSL for editing our multi-camera-angle lecture videos: https://github.com/missing-semester/videos.As always, we’d love to hear any feedback from the community to help us improve the course content!—Anish, Jon, and Jose",

Here's the kicker though: **there are actually terms for this and why building is so crucial**. Now, it's an adjacent field, but these terms also apply to how programmers think... The terms are: [mathematical maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity), ***mathematical insight***, and [mathematical intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_intuition). It's crucial to tell you--or whom it may concern--exactly what they are.***Mathematical Maturity*** is basically someone's experience with math, *especially mathematical understanding that is not directly taught*. Mathematicians seriously have to grind math problems because being instructed by teachers only goes so far. You gain more maturity via repeated exposure. Grinding enough problems over and over again makes you reach ***mathematical insight***.***Mathematical Insight*** is where you have that \"Aha!\" moment, that \"oooooh, that's what that does\". This happens when you \"build stuff\" or solve problems. This happened with me stuck in \"OOP hell\"... After finally applying it in an appropriate way (instead of Animal -> Dog -> Labrador) and applied it to different things, I gained a deeper understanding of it that I could **never** get from a tutorial. Mathematical insight can't be directly taught. You grind problems/build stuff to get that \"Aha!\" moment.***Mathematical Intuition*** is where you've grinded the concept so much, it's apart of your repertoire. You don't even need to think of \"how\" it works because you upped your mathematical maturity and insight through applying what you've learned, *instead of watching tutorials;* therein deepening your understanding. This also helps with you understanding the range of projects you can do. It's just a matter of \"how to logically structure \\[insert program\\]\".That's basically it. \"Building stuff\" actually makes these programming concepts stick in your mind. The reason I posted this is two-fold: 1.) It would, hopefully, get someone out of a rut and 2.) Give those who say \"build stuff\" a few terms that can exactly describe how crucial it is... For anyone in the industry/do this professionally... What are your thoughts on this? All criticism is welcome",

I’m currently a father and at 30, I don’t have time to waste anymore. I need a clear path to employment.​Where I am now:​Doing Boot.dev (loving the hands-on style) for about a week ago. Logic, loops, and terminal work are coming back naturally.I'm investing around 6-10 hours a day on this.​Working through Python/Go modules, but questioning if this is the \"safest\" bet for me.​My three questions:​I’ll be honest—I’m not a math pro. I like systems logic, but complex calculus or advanced statistics kind of turns me down a bit (I could still learn and refresh my memory, if necessary)1) Is Python backend development \"math-heavy\" in the real world, or is that only for AI/Data Science? Would Java be a safer \"low-math\" haven for me? 2) Is it worth pivoting to Java now to avoid the high saturation of Python juniors, even if Java feels \"stricter\" and a bit more difficult to get into?3) Should I stick to the Boot.dev course, learn OOP and DSA in that course, and then switch? What do you suggest? They have Linux, SQL and git courses.​My Goal: > I want to reach a Junior Backend role (Chilean corporate or INTERNATIONAL remote) where I can actually grow, as soon as humanly possible. (Of course aiming to work in a position that I like)​Thanks for any career advice. Just trying to build a stable future for my kid.TL;DR: 30yo, Chile. CS Degree in 2018. Wasted 7 years in a dead-end, unrelated job. Now \"speedrunning\" a comeback via Boot.dev. I want a Backend role ASAP, but I'm worried about \"Math traps\" in Python and market saturation.",

The story explicitly stated it would exclude the core parts of the codebase, so I was confident I could wrap it up quickly.However, it turned out to be the \"tip of the iceberg.\" There was no way to complete the task without touching the entire application and refactoring core logic. The 2week sprint is ending soon and I still have error in integration testing and need to debug.I think my “people” manager and teammate still in the “black box” and might questioning why taking me so long for a “small” ticket. I’ve been quiet about it in standups because I wasn't sure if the task was genuinely big or if I was just bad. But I have just reached out to my direct tech lead recently and confirmed this is “a lot” and I’m on the right track.I’m a front end leaning full stack but hired as a backend engineer. I’ve already stayed up until 3am several nights trying to bridge the gap. Any advice to bridge the gap faster and handling people manger expectation?Add on:Thanks everyone for the advice. I’ve learned a lot.Just to provide some additional background: I reached out to the Senior Tech Lead very early in the sprint to confirm the scope, but I didn’t ask to formally edit the story. I expected the team had acknowledged the issue, but the Senior Tech Lead wasn’t in stand-up last week, and it seems the people manager wasn’t aligned either.I didn’t expect it to take this long. I can handle the business logic, but errors keep coming up during unit testing and integration testing because the changes touch a large portion of the codebase, if that makes sense.I originally applied for a full-stack role but was placed as a Senior Backend engineer, so I’ve been a bit concerned about expectations — specifically, whether I’m expected to handle something like this entirely on my own.",

Any advice for those of us past junior level but struggling to find the knowledge to become a senior?I hear often that senior roles require a greater understanding of company goals and cross team functionality - I understand the importance of that - but I am purely just asking about the technical level and how to gain that in depth knowledge of systems and tools.Thank you so much!",

I will act as the project manager and senior advisor by guiding development, offering mentorship and unblocking any issues that come up. The final result will be an open source project that you can use in your portfolio. The group will be run like a real life software company. You’ll learn how to work in an agile environment, do code reviews, build pipelines, how to develop a real life product with a team, and more. **About you**:The ideal candidate is someone who has little to no professional experience but is eager to learn and break into tech. Must be at least 18 years of age. Must be willing to put in at least a few hours per week, and must be friendly and kind.**About me:** I am a senior software engineer who has some time on his hands after working for a very successful startup that was acquired last year. I was self taught and leaned on others online heavily to learn early in my career and would like to pay it forward.Leave a comment or drop me a DM if you’d be interested in a program like this.",

But idk if those are actually good or just shortcuts that'll bite me later.I'm not a complete beginner to coding - did some python and javascript stuff before - but never built an actual mobile app. Would it be better to just dive into the native android stuff or should i look at some of these easier platforms first to get something working?What path would you guys recommend for someone who wants to actually learn properly but also not spend 6 months before having anything to show? Also any tools you recommend that can help me get a quick MVP built would be very helpful. Ty in advance!",

Freedom of choice, experiences, opportunities.The problem is that I'm having a lot of difficulty being consistent with my studies.Even sleeping 6 or 10 hours a day, when I sit down at my laptop to study, I start to feel very sleepy. This only happens specifically when I'm studying, when I'm learning new things; it's like something very exhausting for my brain, even if it's a minimally difficult code for a beginner. I break it down into small parts to help me understand how everything works and progress, but even then it seems difficult.It's like I'm living far below my potential. I want to be more disciplined, more obsessed, more ambitious. Sometimes I think it would be easier if I were like a machine that just executes, doesn't feel, doesn't get tired, doesn't doubt, just acts.Then I start to doubt my ability, that maybe I'm not capable, that maybe I won't be able to achieve what I want. And that frustrates me a lot, because at the same time I believe in myself and then the bad thoughts come, that if I'm going to live a miserable life, it would be better to just die and not be here anymore.Has anyone ever gone through something similar?How did you resolve it?Any advice or experience regarding these two questions would be very welcome.Thank you for reading this far.",

        "author": "normantas",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Preface. I have 4YOE as backend engineer. I use Azure with some tiny experience with React + TypeScript when I worked in teams that had some React components or a webpage. I have used RabbitMQ and Mass Transit with PostgreSQL.I still can't wrap my head around why use Message Brokers (MB). Sometimes I find their use. You have an API and a pods for long jobs. The ones that take at least few seconds. So let's say API takes in a massive file and does a request for a long calculation operation which queues a task to the Pods.Where my issue falls is when the operation is short so giving it to a message broker does not seem to make sense. It feels a lot of times it is not worth to create the logic for message brokers.I was reading about making a URL shortener. One person said if you want metrics you will want to use a MB to log statistics and usage. Why not just push the request locally on same instance of a service just different process/thread. I do not thing logging statistics take that much resources? Would it not slow down giving the request and add costs for running 2 services instead of one? A lot of programs nowadays run on 1 thread and just use the async/await pattern as creating a new process is costly.The primary values I find in message brokers:1. Separation of intents and simplifying services. So basically microservices. Though a lot of people are moving to \"modular monolith\" structure where you create a new service when it is needed.2. Orchestrating long running tasks.3. If you have few seperate services on same machine, some MB can read the RAM data and reuse it which lowers the memory usageand speeds up the process by not sending the data but just re-reading the same data from RAM.4. There is probably a case of improved Horizontal scaling.Both can be done with an API (without the use case of RAM), though API adds some bloat but so do message brokers and not sure if managing something more complex is worth the investment. I guess also small benefit of some MB is sequentiality of tasks or in case the process fails, it stores the tasks. Though not all MB do that.It just creates me lot of confusion (as my writing is probably all over the places so the confusion is shown). To me it has tradeoffs though I see a lot of people putting MB where they can instead of evaluating if it is worth it.Can someone give me good project ideas, examples to master the value of MB? Message broker usage is so far and wide and sometimes I do not understand why not just have an API that is closed to external traffic?I'll give an example of a project I think could use MB: A web Crawler. There is a crawler that collects web pages. Fills the queue with URLs and the Workers consume the URLs and extract data. That is how I would do a basic crawlers for data collection. Data collection like metadata, Urls can take multiple DB queries and such so it can take up to 100ms on a massive page. Though I have to take into account if the Web Crawler can't do the same. If the added time for sending the request take a while. Why use workers? I just add more time to work by sending the request and waiting for it to be consumed.",

Without the external structure of a classroom, I find it nearly impossible to maintain consistency. On the other hand, I recently tried a bootcamp, but I couldn't finish it. The combination of rigid deadlines and my tendency to procrastinate (classic ADHD paralysis) meant I fell behind and couldn't catch up.**My situation:*** **Long-term goal:** I want to get a University degree, but that is a long-term project for my current life situation. I want to start learning *now* so I’m prepared when I finally enroll.* **The struggle:** If a course is too \"go at your own pace,\" I lose focus. If it has high-pressure deadlines without face-to-face interaction, I burn out.* **What I’m looking for:** Are there specific resources, platforms, or study methods that provide \"soft structure\"? Perhaps something gamified, or communities that offer body-doubling/co-working sessions for beginners?For those of you with ADHD who are now working as devs: How did you bridge the gap between \"wanting to learn\" and actually \"doing the work\" before you had the structure of a formal job or degree?Thanks in advance!",

But that's not entirely related to what I'm interested in.I was wondering if there are books which offer relatively deep explanations of RTOS systems, communication protocols (TCP,UDP,CAN,SPI,I2C,Uart, etc) - and maybe even introduction to circuit boards (as I have to read those schemas quite often at work). I had found this: [CircuitSymbols](https://electronicsclub.info/circuitsymbols.htm) \\- but I'd like to know if there was a book I could read on the topic as well.As for my background - I have a degree in software engineering. But when it comes to practical sw development, my college had primarily taught us web technologies. I happened to get a job as an embedded sw dev and realized I like it a lot more - so I'd like to improve.Basically - I have a background in high-level software development but would like to read books to become a better low-level developer.Edit: Thank you for your answers, everyone!

Why is there polling in the first place? Tbh it feels like it will always be more efficient to give callback instead? Is there a case where polling is actually better in terms of performance or when they can do something callbacks cannot do?3. I get that this can get pretty annoying and harder to debug and complicate stuff if the amount of additional calculation is insignificant, but wouldn't using some sort of design pattern like observer be able to just remove the additional amount of complexity while keeping the implementation simple?",

The idea is to have three roles: customers who can browse products, add them to a cart and place orders, stores/restaurants that only see and manage their own orders and products, and in-house couriers who get assigned deliveries and update their status through a mobile-first interface (likely a PWA).I want to avoid reinventing basic e-commerce logic, but I also don’t want to be locked into a heavy platform that fights against delivery-style workflows. I’ve looked at Bagisto and similar full platforms, but they feel very e-commerce-centric. Lately I’ve been considering Laravel with LunarPHP (core + Filament admin) and building the store, courier and dispatch logic on top of that.Does LunarPHP sound like a reasonable foundation for this kind of project, or would you recommend a different stack or approach? I’m mostly interested in starting with a clean architecture that can scale later.Thanks!",

        "author": "MindlessAssistance52",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi,So I am at chapter 21 of the book, and the author has finished building a \"add/subtract unit\" part of the CPU. https://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter21/My confusion is about the subtract part of the arithmetic unit. When we start a subtraction, we use the opcode \"10\", which forces a CI of 1 for the two's complement operation. (Which ends up giving something like A + B inverted + 1) This is done for the first pair of bytes for a multibyte number. Afterwards, the next pairs are treated using the Opcode of \"11\".The actual CY In has no effect at this stage (Opcode 10), so the only things we are left with are the first part of the sum and a potential Carry out.Previously, the author built something called a \"triple byte accumulator\" which was a precursor (https://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter20/) where when doing a subtraction using two's complement, if you had a carry out generated during the operation, it would end up being used in the middle byte part, and if the middle byte sum ended up producing a carry out as well, it would end up being used in the high byte part of the operation of the 24 bit number.Now, the author, for some unknown reason to me, has introduced two \"XOR gates\" at the input and ouput of the arithmetic unit. He doesn't mention anything about them besides : > This is a little different from the circuits shown in the book in that the values of both CY In and CY Out are inverted for subtraction. (The entry in the lower-right corner of the table on page 322 should be inverted CY)In the book, at the point where I am, nothing is mentioned as to why or what is done with those inverted signals.During addition (Opcodes of 00 or 01), those XOR gates have no effect whatsoever as if they did not exist. When subtraction/\"addition in two's complement\" is done, they do invert the Carry out signal of the adder ... but here is the strange thing:if my adder produces a Carry output of 1 , the XOR transforms it to 0 ... and when this tranformed signal is used in the next part of the operation for the next pair of bytes, the XOR gate at the input \"undoes\" the 0 so we end up having a raw bit of 1 ... as if nothing actually happened. The same logic happens if my carry output produces a 0, it is transformed to 1, and when it is fed back to the CY In, the XOR gates undoes the effect and we end up with a 0 again as the input to the adder.Clearly, then, those gates are not affecting the function of the actual \"subtraction\" and everything is functioning as I would expect it to. My question then would be : why exactly is the author adding those two XOR gates?The only reason I could think of is those inverted signals are going to serve some (unknown) use later on, but outside of that I can't really think of anything else.Any help or guidance would be much appreciated...",

The game runs entirely in the console (on Linux especially) and includes some features of the original LUDO app as well as the full game rules. It also includes a new mode called \"No Mercy\". This project was a fun way to combine my C programming skills with game logic. I’d love to share it with the community and get your thoughts or suggestions for improvement.You can ask me whatever question you like about it, or just try it out and give feedback whether it's about the gameplay or the code itself. I'm sorry if the code lacks comments, it's just that I never comment my code, and when I wanted to share it, it was too long for me to comment out the lines, so I'll put the blame on me(also I didn't want to use AI to help me on the code or the comment). If you have question please put it in the comments.And this is the github url: [https://github.com/Awkward-Fellows/LUDO](https://github.com/Awkward-Fellows/LUDO) I'm open to criticism",

        "content": "Hello everyone,I’ve been thinking for quite a while about designing a loop-centric programming language, and during my research I came across the theoretical LOOP language associated with Dennis Ritchie, who has always been one of my biggest inspirations.The project I’m working on is called Gamma Loop. It’s a transpiled language, with the transpiler written entirely in C. The idea behind this choice is to keep the toolchain lightweight, portable, and fast, while still leveraging mature C compilers for optimisation and broad platform support. The goal is not to compete with mainstream languages, but to explore a minimal, loop-driven design that could be useful for specific niche or experimental applications.Conceptually, I’m focusing on making iteration the central abstraction of the language. Rather than treating loops as just another control structure, the idea is to build the language around them as the primary computational mechanism. The syntax is intentionally minimal and structured, and I’m aiming for clarity over feature density.At this stage, I’m mainly interested in feedback from a theoretical and language-design perspective:1.Does a loop-centric paradigm offer meaningful conceptual advantages?2.Would such a design be interesting from a computability or formal methods standpoint?I’d really appreciate any thoughts, criticism, or references.",

        "content": "I have been researching on what I can do to get the full stack development and came across a course on full stack Python development in Thane. Python is easy to get going with, but once you venture into backend code, frontend fundamentals and frameworks and hooking all this together, it starts to look like a very different ball game. In my experience, syntax is not the issue of most of the beginners, rather how everything makes sense in an actual project. One day you find yourself learning Python the next day you are working with web frameworks, routing, APIs, and databases. When a person is guided by a haphazard combination of guides, they usually become confused as there is no definite way of the interrelation between the parts. Other learners that I interviewed indicated that a structured curriculum with real-life examples and project aided a lot in confidence and understanding. Some of them stated that they felt such a state of clarity during their time in Quastech IT Training and Placement institute, Thane, particularly when basics were interconnected with the building of actual applications. I have not yet done my research and have not set realistic expectations yet, before investing both time and money. To students who have taken a full stack course in python - which aspect of it did you find most helpful when getting started: projects, backend fundamentals or frontend to backend connectivity?",

I’ve learned Python up to functions, studied some Git and GitHub basics, and I keep my exercises organized in a public repository. I’m trying to build discipline and consistency early.However, I keep seeing discussions about AI replacing developers, market saturation, and how competitive tech has become. That makes me wonder:* How does the market really look for someone starting in the next few years?* What should I focus on while in college to become employable?* Is building projects more important than certifications?* What would you recommend someone my age to prioritize right now?I’m willing to put in the work — I just want to make sure I’m moving in the right direction.Thanks in advance for any advice.",

I don't remember any of itI picked AoPS because it's offline - I'm a hobbyist with computers, my day job needs and a good bit of my free/study time keep me offline - and problems-based from the ground up. But after getting frustrated with the mathematical thinking, specifically just treating numbers and such for their own sake, I'm looking for one, *maybe* two, books that still fulfill those criteria. Get me from the floor - shit, the basement... - up to the level where I can learn what I need to on the fly. So far, heard that Lang's book really isn't for guys like me. Things like Lehman's *Mathematics for Computer Science*, Knuth's *Concrete Mathematics*, and other \"intro\" materials are always recommended in this situation, but they seem to presuppose fairly bright, mathematically able folks - again, not me. Far as I can tell, Stroud's *Foundation Math* might be it. But I'm here for your recommendations; please, fire away!",

        "author": "sharjeelsidd",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm genuinely curious. Years ago, whenever a company announced it was offshoring engineering work, people would roll their eyes and say, \"Oh, when will they learn?\" Guess what. They've learned and come back with better execution. The assumption has been it would backfire, Time zone gaps, miscommunication, quality issues, and lack of ownership would eventually make companies regret the move. Back then, that argument had weight. High-level technical work depends on speed, tight feedback loops, and shared context. It wasn't easy to coordinate complex engineering across continents. But over the last two decades, US companies have consistently invested in talent pipelines in places like India, the Philippines, and Brazil. What started as cost-cutting experiments turned into long-term infrastructure. The quality gap has narrowed. With Zoom, Slack, Jira, GitHub, and real-time dashboards, accountability is no longer the barrier it once was. Work is visible and there are tons of tools in place for checks and balances before code gets deployed. Add AI to that stack, code review tools, copilots, automated testing, and suddenly the difference in execution shrinks even more. Offshore teams are no longer turning out to be unreliable. They're writing code with AI and increasing velocity. Product strategy and client-facing roles are still staying in the US, but a large portion of engineering execution, the high-paying core, is increasingly moving out. If a company can get comparable output at a fraction of the cost, the incentive is obvious. How are US developers supposed to compete in that environment?",

The funniest part is that the system supposed to replace those awful coders is built by the coders themselves.Perhaps it’s time us coders focused on replacing someone else's job instead of their own. I like the idea of replacing CEOs and managers by creating a solution that uses AI and an internal integration layer to make the best possible decisions. By combining all available company data, market data, and projections, it would make CEOs and managers mostly irrelevant (except, maybe, for some PR). This would ensure only founders or the board are needed, while the best executive decisions are made via an AI management layer.I think this is an inevitable part of management anyway, but I must admit I do like the idea of disrupting the people who can't wait to replace the people whose work they know nothing about.Anyway, I have over 15 years of development experience across multiple fields. If this sounds like something fun to build, if for nothing else, just to be able to start making posts about how all CEOs and managers will soon be replaced by AI, then get in touch.",

I have ignored this part of our environment thinking I would never have to deal with it, working almost entirely in C++ and C#. The documentation in the code is spotty at best, documentation for the language is spotty at best, and online resources are nonexistent. As best as I can tell the entire user base is three guys in Amsterdam and us. No source control exists. The syntax is like some sort of mashup of COBOL and Pascal. I hate everything about it. Oh and it's connected to what's essentially a flat file database shoehorned into SQL Server and where normalization isn't a thing. Foreign keys? Never heard of them. Also, our entire accounting system is run by this application. I know nothing of accounting.I don't have too many years left in my career but this is not how I want to spend them. And at my age and having been at the same place for nearly a quarter of a century I have no idea who would hire me. I was given the opportunity a while back to buy into the company as a partner, but I declined since it seemed like mostly just more aggravation plus I'm actually fairly nervous about the financial health of the company. And while that was the right call, I now feel like I've aged out of the industry. On the plus side I'm fully remote and the pay is fair if not spectacular so I could also just try to run out the clock and hope I outlast the company if they go under.",

I intend to pursue careers in areas such as project management/planning and consulting, not necessarily technical-heavy roles.Every time I see posts of other students who realise they don’t like programming in CS in these subreddits, almost all the comments tell them to switch majors and that there’s no hope for them if they continue to pursue CS. I mean, aren’t there many other jobs or fields they can do as well with a degree in CS? We dont necessarily have to pursue SDE/SWE-esque roles and leetcode all day?I’ve personally done 3 internships before and none of them relate to coding so I’m just wondering what’s this sentiment about being told to switch majors if one is not good at programming. I disagree with that statement and IMO there’s so much to CS than just programming. Feel free to disagree and enlighten me if i’m wrong.",

The upside is that I’ve gotten broad experience across the entire software lifecycle: building features, fixing bugs/hotfixes, writing tests, doing code reviews, managing CI/CD, handling releases (dev/prod + mobile builds), planning, etc.. I’ve learned a lot and have had a lot of ownership. We are trying to do everything according to best practices, if we can.The downside is that I’m significantly underpaid for the scope of work, and the company has become increasingly chaotic. A few months ago I realized I should probably move on.Recruiter outreach has been decent (a few LinkedIn messages per week), and I’ve started applying and studying to fill in gaps. Still, I’ve been feeling oddly demotivated and worried that starting at a messy startup might hurt my long-term prospects.Still, I feel pretty demotivated and I’m not sure why. I’m hoping that my experience and time are on my side, and that sooner or later I’ll end up at a better company. I know, some people can't even get experience, so I'm glad for that at least. One thing I’m sure about is that at this startup I gained experience that I would have had no chance of getting at a large company, so I’m happy about that.**So the main question of this post:** are there people here who started at a “shitty” or low-quality company and later made it to FAANG or just built a solid career overall?Would appreciate hearing some success stories or perspective from people who’ve been in a similar spot.",

The engineering leadership has explicitly asked engineers to **not write code manually** their stand is to perform every aspect of development via cursor only. Bug analysis, technical design ( hld or lld), code implementation, test case design , tests implementation everything is forced via cursor. The JIRA timelines are set as such that even if you want to go through code manually or want to write code manually you won't be able to and their answer is to use cursor to do analysis and everything. Cursor usage is tracked and people with highest usage are awarded ( literally). I want to understand how to navigate this shift. Skills of understanding or writing code doesn't seem to matter now or learning different tools ( like docker etc etc )or tech stacks seems futile.

I know every start up will be different, but the general theme seems to be more pressure and more hours. 2 questions for anyone why has made the jump from big tech to startups: why did you do it?

At the very least, you're a much safer bet than some random applicant who hasnt even cleared the first technical interview yet. The only reason I can think that this wouldn't happen is if they discover some serious deficiency or red flag in you, but I'm guessing that that's not the case with most people who get rejected after a final round, most people got rejected because there was someone else who was just a little bit better (I'm making an assumption there so feel free to challenge that assumption if you think I'm wrong).The reason I ask is because I've made it to multiple final rounds in the past few months and got rejected, but most of these companies are large companies with many very similar positions.I'd be interested to know the thoughts of those with hiring experience.",

Here's what I'm using:- Obsidian for long-form notes and connecting ideas. Meeting notes, technical learnings, and project retrospectives go here. The linking between notes is genuinely useful.- Willow Voice for quick voice capture. If I just solved a tricky bug or made a design decision, I talk through my reasoning for a couple minutes and drop the transcript into Obsidian later. Faster than writing and I capture more of my actual thought process this way.- GitHub issues/PRs for code-specific decisions. I try to be thorough in PR descriptions because future-me always thanks present-me.- Todoist for daily task tracking. Just a dumping ground so nothing lives in my head.- A daily standup note in Obsidian. 3 bullets: what I did yesterday, what I'm doing today, blockers. Takes 2 minutes, saves me from blanking in standup.The voice capture part was honestly the missing piece.

        "content": "So I tagged this experienced, but my own impostor syndrome makes me question whether that's accurate or not, so I hope my background gives some insight. For context, I'm a \"senior\" software engineer at a unicorn startup building ML accelerators; I personally am on the training framework team. I've been here a little over 6 months at this point. I spent my first 3 years out of college as the first employee at a tiny aerospace startup, then 1.5 years working on automated fruit sorting before getting laid off and being out of a job for 10ish months. When I got this job, I felt so grateful to be employed again. However, now at the six month mark, I'm struggling with something of an existential crisis. For the first time in my career, I don't feel any sort of connection to my work, and I'm working without any sort of drive or passion. My previous jobs, I felt like there were real stakes, not just numbers on an investor's sheet. I like the people I work with quite a bit, but at this company, like many others I'm sure, the LLM bug is *strong*. Frequently when you have a question, someone's answer is \"have you asked Claude?\" It's maddening to me. I cut my teeth on actual research and engineering, so when I had questions, I had to hit the books. Now I'm...supposed to ask a neural network-powered auto-summarizer. Combine these things with the constant drumbeat of people saying \"we're automating ourselves out of a job\" and it really is wearing me down. I genuinely disagree with that sentiment, I know there'll continue to be a need for software engineers. But all of those things put together has me really questioning my place and my career choice, whether or not I'm betraying my own ideals, etc. I started working on my master's at my last job, and I find myself wondering what the point of this degree will even be once it's done, just because of how everything looks and sounds right now. To anyone out there with more experience than me, I'd really appreciate your advice on navigating this. I recognize that the LLM part in particular is a pretty sizable paradigm shift that we're all dealing with, but I have to imagine some of this sounds familiar to some greybeards out there. Thanks so much for reading my ramble, hope to hear from you.Signed,A Lost Engineer",

After graduation, I stayed in that country for 9 months. During that time, I was doing bike food delivery to survive while applying to jobs full time, networking on LinkedIn, and reaching out to engineers and recruiters at companies I wanted to work for.I made it to final interview stages multiple times. But got- Ghosted after technical assessments.- Ghosted after final rounds.- Rejected with generic emails.Fresh out of university, I only had one unpaid frontend internship. I realized that probably wasn’t enough. So I doubled down.I started learning backend, then discovered DevOps and cloud. I genuinely loved it. I invested money I barely had into certifications and learning materials. I passed:-AWS Cloud Practitioner-AWS Solutions Architect Associate-CKA-KCNAI know it's not impressive.I built projects. Documented them. Kept applying.At one point, I got into a graduate program at a big company. Passed the assessment. Completed the internship. Submitted extra documentation no other applicant was asked for. Then they told me they couldn’t offer full time because the law changed and they wanted permanent residents.Shortly after that, my visa expired and I had to go back to my home country.I struggle with Major Depressive Disorder all my life, so my energy and consistency aren’t always perfect. But I kept pushing anyway.Recently, I made it to another final on site round. At the end, I asked the tech lead what I could improve. He said technically he had no comment and that I clearly knew what I was talking about. He just suggested I follow CNCF on YouTube to stay updated.Two weeks later, generic rejection. No feedback. I even asked politely. Nothing.I tried freelancing on Upwork. But I burned through 100 connects. with no responses.Now I’m working remotely as a real estate agent from my home country. I never imagined working in sales. I still want to work in tech. I still want to work in cloud or DevOps. But I’m exhausted and confused.What hurts the most is seeing people I personally know, with weaker profiles, landing roles or making money freelancing. I know comparison is unhealthy, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m doing something fundamentally wrong.At this point I’m wonderingWhat would you do in my position? what is it that I'm missing.",

Is 2.5k USD okay for \"Senior C# SQL Developer Remote Latam\"?Context: 10 years coding as hobbyist (not for companies). Got a couple projects in production making some extra cash monthly. Moved from Venezuela, trying to enter IT industry now. (I know, sounds crazy)I'm clearly not a junior, but not really a senior either. I tried CS in 2011, quit due Venezuela chaos, went self-taught while working to survive.Applied as Full Stack .NET Software Engineer (9 years .NET doing: CLI apps, Worker Services, Web APIs, Blazor Server/WASM, even a bit of IoT with ESP32). My main project has been online for 8 years straight, niche market, but no scaling budget (that's why I'm looking for job).Is it a mistake applying as Full Stack SE .NET? Should I stick to backend and mention Blazor as skill instead? My projects uses Blazor for FE but I see almost 0 offers for Blazor out there.I tried 30 applications last week, got 1 interview tomorrow for a small US company that needs a \"Senior C# SQL Developer\", remote, 2.5k/month (I'd happily take it as first professional job).They want: Sr C#/SQL, Azure is a plus, good English required.EFSET says I'm C1/C2 but honestly I'm not sure, never took any courses in my life, yet I've spoken with some friends via discord and they understood me just fine so I guess I'm going to be fine here.I know the Azure basics (Key Vault, VMs, Azure SQL with Entra ID). No certs yet.But I fear I'll fail the technical interview because it's been years since I solved any DSA/leetcode, never worked with real distributed systems in my life. I've built my apps with layered architecture, used EF Core, handled race conditions with semaphores, but never touched Kafka/RabbitMQ/CQRS in production and my projects never hit 1k users. Handled JWT for auth most times and my own auth system as I never hit so many users.So... my question: Does a small company paying 2.5k remote really expect leetcode mastery? Or maybe just \"can you build features and not break things and pass the following basic DSA excercises\"?Also: Should I switch to Backend only and keep Blazor as skill? Feel like I wasted 3 years learning Blazor instead of React/Angular since jobs are rare to find with Blazor. Maybe I get better or more offers with C# only and not look like a jack of all trades, master of none.I want to enter the industry and once inside, keep building my skills and finally try to apply for better positions after some years. I can live with 2.5k USD a month for some years.What should I expect in technical interview? What to refresh today?Thank you for readng! I tried to summarize it all with AI, btw I'm trying to use AI to help me when I get stuck and it has been useful to be honest. I have no idea if mentioning the use of it is a problem when applying.",

I ask \\*how\\*I've grown a lot in this career, I know how to push back and assert myself. I've come to expect companies to ramp up pressure (even without deadlines, just constantly hammering with wanting something ASAP). I've come to expect tech debt to keep climbing unless I sneak it in here and there on other tickets.But I guess I am tired of it?I'm trying to \"not care\" but I just won't? I want to do a good job and write good code. So abandoning that and putting out lackluster results both scares me and feels like a betrayal to my core needs as a person. Plus it feels so reckless when I know that pressure will just end up with my colleagues instead of me. Or I worry that I'll come off badly to the customer (despite assurances from my manager that I'm very good at what I do and that I'm valued). And I KNOW that companies play ball this way, with manipulating emotions for benefit. I KNOW it's fascist bs...I just don't know what to do anymore about it.I dunno... I've also never quit without prospects lined up. I'm interviewing, people contact me without me needing to reach out and that's cool... But to be brutally honest, I am not sure if I should stick in this career if I can't figure out how to \"not care\" enough to resolve this pressure problem.Esp with all this AI bullshit... I feel it has gotten esp worse with that. I've done my part to communicate the problems and have been grateful my colleagues express similar concerns... It feels good to reclaim some power and remind them (and me) that you don't have to accept this BS and that if you can push back on it then you absolutely can and should.But it's hard despite that not to unsee the writing on the wall and not feel like I'm wanted... Because if places were willing to ship slop and horrific tech debt into prod before, now they can just do it for free. And now one of our customers wants a discount if the engineers don't use AI in their daily workflow. Like... that's a sinking ship for sure, and I worry it's not the only place working that way.Anyone have some advice on this?Or am I in denial, and maybe dropping out is the best choice atm?Trying to identify maybe where I am seeing this in black and white, because there are plenty of people doing fine in this industry too, and I don't want to doompost because it may not be helpful. Most of the assignments I have had have been with larger private companies, which has me wondering if a smaller private company or government job would have less pressure and be a better fit?I am in Europe, and I have savings...so not really worried financially. But my mental health is far far far more urgent and suspect I've hit burnout (or will soon).",

Due to financial commitments, I cant just quit my job so I need to work to pay the bills and study in my spare time. What are your advice in regards to ways to pivot my path? Thinking out loud getting a masters degree seems like a good idea but my concerns are : 1. Does it actually make a difference without internships? 2. It requires 3 letters of recommendation and it has been so long I dont think any of my professors even remember me or are even teaching to be able to ask for letters recommendation specially since back then there were not many internships or school projects for me to actually have more meaningful interactions with them. I also have only maybe 1 or 2 manager recommendations I may be able to acquire from work. Any advice is much appreciated.",

I haven’t touched a line of code in 2.5 months and just got assigned the most absurdly simple defect ticket which they pointed to 3 story points.

Not a single interview.I tried every summer in college to get an internship but never secured one. My work experience is 2 years youth CS tutoring, and then 1 year CS grading for my university.I accumulated a good few website projects, unity games, and a portfolio throughout my time at uni, (both personal projects and for school).I am lucky to not have any immediate obligations that require more than I have saved up, however my mental health has taken a serious decline in the last 2 months as I'm not doing anything other than sending out applications that are met exclusively with rejections/ghosts. Because of this, I'm considering (and have been told by peers/family) getting a job doing anything (like warehouse or grocery store work) just to not be going insane. I'm worried if this will hinder my chances in the long run. I feel as if my best odds are the sooner I am to college, if I'm not getting CS experience from a job. Really just unsure what to do, looking for advice, thank y'all.",

I'm interested in cybersecurity, back end development and desktop apps/system development.I'm on the older side and I'm mentioning this because getting a good position is a priority for me. I understand the market is tough right now but regardless, getting hired as fast as possible is what I'm aiming here, while still focusing on something that interests me.Despite mentioning system development, I know that stuff is way too advanced to have as a first job/internship, so in reality I'm struggling between the 2 other options.I've seen opportunities for internships in cybersec in my country, but most people say that the path in this career is way longer and the ideal is to start as a helpdesk and get experience and whatnot, so I'm kind of at a loss on what to do.For the purposes of getting employed, should I just focus on backend tech stacks or trying the cybersec route would be worthy it, too? And if I do pick up back end, could I transition to sec in the future? Would that be viable?Just as an added info: I'm not trying to \"get rich quick\" here. As fast as possible depends on how much time I have available to study and how much effort I put and it could be a long time, I get it. The questions I'm asking are just to have a better grasp of the career paths in the bigger picture. Thanks for the help.",

        "content": "I’m a frontend engineer. I’ve been doing frontend for like 10 years now and feel very competent when it comes to actually developing software *on the frontend*. I’ve received lots of positive comments on my frontend code basically anywhere I worked, but it seems to not be that highly valuedHowever, I’ve always felt like I struggled in my career. Although I was ostensibly hired as a frontend engineer, I often find that I’m assigned to sort of ancillary projects. For example, I worked at (big company) and I think I barely even touched the frontend code and spent the majority of my time doing operational stuff and infrastructure. I felt I spent **far** more time being what effectively amounted to a SRE, which I didn’t feel particularly competent atAt this company, I occasionally pointed out that there were some things that were more difficult or tedious than they needed to be. As an example, the i18n had tons of problems; if you didn’t add translations using a **very specific, multi day process**, then the entire site would crash. One day, someone on the team triggered this bug, causing a huge problem. I brought up to my manager that this kind of bug is not normal. I offered to perhaps fix it, and offered multiple “levels” of fixes, with the most minimal being a 2 line change that’s forward-facing so at least it wouldn’t happen *again*He said I had no idea what I was doing, said I was lying on my resume, and told me whatever I learned in the past doesn’t matter here because this company is simply **better** than whatever companies I worked at before. He said he didn’t want to hear me talk about it again. He instructed me to “document the process” of adding a string to the i18n. It almost seemed like the frontend was so flimsy, they didn’t want anyone to touch it unless *absolutely necessary*.On the same note with that i18n, I noticed that the plurals were… all just wrong. People would have strings like “10 user(s) online”. I told them that this doesn’t work in other languages, and they asked me to prove it was actually a problem. I went through the spanish translations and pointed out at least 20, and a couple extra in other languages. I proposed using a built-in \\`Intl\\` library, and they said I was way overcomplicating things and that I still haven’t proved there’s a problem because they “don’t speak any language other than english” and “didn’t understand what was wrong with the spanish translation”. I didn’t really know how to respond; I showed them in google translate using “el angel” and “los angeles”, but they kept insisting I was making problems where none existedWhenever I talk to anyone at work about anything, it feels like I’m expending “good will tokens”. Like even just asking a simple yes/no question will take a week of work to earn back. I reeeeeally don’t like talking to anyone I work with, at any company I’ve been at. I can’t tell if I’m doing something wrong that’s pissing people off, so I try to lay low and do nothing wrong. Whatever technical skills I have seem more or less worthless these days, honestly. Sure, give me a ticket and I’ll get it done very quickly with thorough unit/integration/e2e tests before the deadline… but… **something** is gonna go wrong after that and none of that will matterI’m just wondering, is this what it’s like for most people, or is it like… genuinely me that’s the problem?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey,I graduated with a CS degree two years ago, and have been working for 1.5 yrs now in an SME.The first year was fairly typical. There were some web development projects for a client, where I was a junior dev in the team doing fullstack. Although there was some crunch, I got to learn a lot of skills hands-on.The last few months however, the company has begun to lay off most devs. There's 3-4 devs on this product, and what concerns me is that we're now building it pretty much entirely with tools like Claude and Antigravity aiming to get it done fast. Granted, the lead is experienced and knows his fundamentals very well, and he did lot of the development himself before I came onto the project, so the project is likely not a lost cause.I'm mainly concerned about my own career growth. Don't get me wrong, I use Claude, ChatGPT, Antigravity a lot when I'm stuck, and try to learn the concepts from there.But I feel like I don't really learn as much about the fundamentals, languages and frameworks used, etc. when I just spit prompts to Antigravity to fix errors, build this or implement X feature - and for that to be the development process. I don't know if it'll be good for my career development in future. I kind of have to vibe-code for now though, since deadlines are tight and I'm expected to be 10x more productive with AI.The working hour expectations are a secondary thing - there's been periods throughout of working on weekends, after hours, maybe public holidays. I think that's a give-or-take thing though, where I've got to set my own boundaries. Besides, my friends in other industries seem to have it worse.Therefore, I'm kind of considering looking for another software dev job where I have the leeway and time to do things more manually and learn skills better. Heck, pivoting and being a BA is something I've been interested in doing for a while now. But how widespread is kind of AI usage in other companies? If many companies are doing this, maybe I shouldn't rush into things.Any advice for me to proceed from here? I've also got a side project going on, if that helps.Thanks!",

        "content": "I am panicking about my future because opportunities seem so tight these days, and I think it is unfair. Here is my story. I am a 23-year-old software developer from a third world country. I graduated from a top university with a good GPA (3.9/4) in 2024. I interned at two machine learning software companies before I graduated. I also took an interest in LeetCode problems and solved over 1000 of them. Now I work for a mid-tier trading firm as an Odoo developer with a not-so-great salary. I was brought up in a family where math was considered very essential for a good career. As a result, I am good at math. My high school science fair projects were often applications of machine learning I discovered independently. I wrote a bunch of manuscripts on math topics throughout high school and college. This is all to say I am passionate about math, and being good at it is really a core part of my identity. I feel like I have an advantage here. Not many people identify as a \"math person,\" whereas I prefer jobs where I can do more math. My educational background is good enough, and I have an okay history of work experience. The reality is I am earning less than $1/hr, and better-paying entry-level jobs are impossible to find these days. The worst part is I am not doing something as meaningful as I want. I despise this phase of mediocrity, but I don't know what to do about it. I feel like a failure because people (including me) expected I would be in a good position in life by now, but I am nowhere near there. The point of the post is that I am lost. Maybe I was wrong about my expectations, and I invested too much in a skill that is no longer as relevant. So I am curious what people suggest I should explore with my skill set. PS: Academia is not an obvious choice for me because it doesn't pay remotely well where I live, and I am applying for opportunities abroad, though that also seems a long shot. There are not many open positions for software developers other than web developers here so I am open (prefer) remote roles.",

You can do great in a few interviews and slip once, and you’re out. Then comes the worst part: “feedback.” Most companies either ghost or send a generic template like “Your profile was impressive…” with nothing you can actually improve. They never tell what actually went wrong.How many of you have dealt with this recently or are in the middle of interviews right now? What did you hear back, if anything? What would real feedback look like to you?I'd love to learn your experience and maybe offer some insights on how to better yourself for future rounds.",

An IT help desk role popped up less than a day ago in a nearby town, I was the second applicant, and it is at a software development company. They build custom apps for clients and stuff. They have software developer jobs posted on their site, but it is all senior level; albeit not many people have applied.Is this a decent move to see if I can land this entry IT role, automate some stuff on my day to day, hang out with the developers, and network with them? They use Laravel which I haven't used at all, so I would definitely have a talking point; I always enjoy learning new things. I would obviously take it slow, since jumping in and a week later you are worrying about software development may set off red flags.Idk, at this point I have dedicated my life to tech, and only see any purpose pursuing software development.

        "author": "iGanti_",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I just graduated from a state university in December, 2025. I started my CS degree in August 2021, and did pretty well in my classes until I had a mental health issue and resulted in me failing a bunch of classes. It forced me to use my summers to catch up on those classes so I never got the chance to do any internships. For me at that point I just wanted to graduate and get me degree. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my career but I liked programming ever since HS so I tried to focus on that. I took a bunch of electives around it like Full Stack in C# and doing a capstone where I made my own project with a couple other people. I hated it. I could never get over the OOP hump of just abstraction over abstraction. It never clicked with me. However, since my university's CS department was so behind in today's tech, our project was just a CRUD machine so I just got through it and passed the class. All of my classes were like that more or less. For my Mobile App dev class, our project was a Wordle Clone. For my Databases class, our project was a simple Flask and SQLite CRUD program. Looking back on all of my classes in CS, I never learned anything useful. Yeah, I have strong soft skills like problem solving and recognizing patterns, but I never learned any marketable skills. And I understand a CS degree isn't the same as SWE but what am I supposed to do now? Fast forward two months after graduating and I have no impressive projects or career experience. I tried to teach myself React and Javascript since we were never exposed to that in school and I'm so lost. I keep hearing BUILD, BUILD, BUILD but I don't even know where to begin. All of my theoretical knowledge of SWE is just a soup of classes, data structures, and OOP but I can't apply it. Maybe I'm just used to having professors give me a structed course and steps to learn but I just can't teach myself. I don't even know what I want to learn. Front-end, back-end, app dev, full stack, the list goes on. I decided last month that I wanted to create a full-stack app using React/Typescript/Firebase that connects local musicians together through a social platform allowing them to find others who share the same musical taste as them. For example, if someone who doesn;t know about the local music scene around them they could create an account and list the instrument they play, experience, and what music they like. And then others could find them on this site and message them and arrange a meet. I thought this would be a cool idea and I could show recruiters or whoever. Since I had no experience building anything at that scale with Auth, Email Verification, Rate limiting I used Claude Code to help me design it. Obviously I'm not a vibe coding monkey since I have the theoretical and programmer brain from my CS degree but I still had no idea what I was actually coding. I could see a chunks of code and understand it how it does a specific function but going line by line I didn't know what it actually did. But after a couple weeks I got a MVP, rough documentation of the systems, and rigorously debugged and tested it. And it works. Yeah there's some rough spots and the CSS/design isn't the best but it works. The thing is from this project I just learned how to do system design and product management. I created a product and got an output but I never understood the middle part, the actual programming. And now I finally understand that I just hate programming and it isn't for me. So now I'm having a career crisis (I haven't even started my career yet) and scrambling to find out what I need to do. The data world seems interesting so I started to lookup what it means to be a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and AI/ML Engineer. From what I understand, everything past a Data Analyst is heavy programming so I don't want to do that. I know intermediate Python and basic SQL and little bit of Excel so maybe Data Analyst is something I should do? I messed around with Pandas and CSV files and I like how I can see trends from just mounds of data. I also kinda like Stats and Prob in college but idk. I would like to pivot to become a Data Analyst but idek where to begin. Do I get a cert like the IBM Data Analyst or is that a waste of time. I just want to learn.",

Ever since I did my second semester spring I have come to the belief that this major has become more taxing than interesting. I think honestly it is because I went into college after high school without a plan and have based on halo scripting skills believed I could maybe make some habit out of it. Freshmen year was undeclared so really I went into it 2nd year (except for a intro to CS). I have learned basic C++ logic along with discrete, matrix I and calc I. By second semester I ran into data structures, webdev frontend and intro to AI (it was not just those 3 but those were the CS classes).My college offers core classes, and honestly it has gotten to a point that without them I probably lose it because it seems I am just sick and tired of the major and was incredibly burnt out. Reckon despite the grades I got being pretty good like As and Bs I still just sick of the major. First semester junior was not so bad but now in my second I got Backend Webdev, Programming Languages and Software Architecture and it has gotten to a point where I am really questioning if this major is worth anything.Other things to note, I have 3 minors (math is freebie I technically get that regardless) but I have one in History and Theology for the sake of not losing it. They are not at all a problem for me it is just for a break from code. I also seem over the years been very good at being creative with code like stories and whatnot (Data structures we made a text based RPG and the story plot took me 5 minutes to make) along with webdev having like the vision for it.I just wanna know more or less, based on those out there in job fields already is just having a bachlor's degree worth it anymore. I keep hearing about how bad the job market is and well honestly I just believe I am in it to get the degree and then just get out there doing some form of job instead of just school.

HR just doesn't understand my slightly autistic ass, they don't care, they're blind to actual skills in my opinion. There's lot of shit on both sides of hiring and I fkin hate the state of things.Full disclosure: I am working on a product with slightly unconvential approach to getting hired, I want to validate if I am just weird alone in my ways or if some others do the same. I am not selling anything to be clear. I want to understand how you operate.I’m exploring whether there’s a better, more transparent way for tech job seekers to deal with this. I mean I've seen some hackers put together pretty elaborate automations to getting hired. Please brag what are your methods? If this is too long, just tell me what you think about first question* **Do you bookmark companies you’d love to work for and check their careers pages?** like on their domain/ATS page ... **(nope, yes manually, yes via automation, etc.)*** How often is timing an issue for you? do you learn you're not one of the first to apply and they tell you they already chose somebody? do you ever manage to apply seconds after job is posted?* When you apply, do you track applications yourself (Notion, spreadsheet, Airtable, notes, specific product for agnostic job tracking?), or do you rely on the job platform you applied on?* If you knew a company had a reputation for ghosting 70% of applicants, would you still apply? how valuable would you consider this?* Would it be useful to see aggregated stats like: * median response time * % of applicants who got any reply * % who got feedback after interviews (not rants, just numbers)* **What’s the biggest BS in tech hiring right now? One thing that consistently makes you angry, tired, or cynical.*** If tools already exist that actually solve some of this cleanly, please tell me.

I was told repeatedly in the email that \"This is not negative!\". I was also told that I'm one of three people in the entire company that they've done this for. The \"goal\" according to them is to help ME and to.make things easier for ME. They will take the survey results and create a learning plan for me. Embedded in this email where they kept repeatedly saying \"This is NOT a bad thing!\" was a small snippet that mentioned \"planning for my succession\". What I'm trying to figure out is, how does this help ME? My team needs more resources, and that would help me a lot. The company could pay me more, but I'd take more resources over more money - anything that would help me to not work 80 hours per week. We have a very flat structure and there's no path upwards for me. Besides that, I don't think I'd want to go any higher in the supervisory chain. My next level would be director, but it would likely result in more responsibilities with no more pay.I'm not worried about the feedback of my subordinates or peers. I'm a bit worried about one C level guy who seems to want to hurt me for some reason. And maybe this feedback will help me become a better leader. But I'm not convinced that there's not some ulterior motive, as the company itself is pretty rotten Ex: They fired a guy on Tuesday and HR held an online meeting with our office telling us why people getting fired was a \"good thing\". I'm sure the single dad who was already underpaid felt that way as they walked him to the door with his box of stuff.So, should I worry about this? Is this good, bad, or neutral?",

I looked back at about a year of my food delivery transactions and grouped them by weekday and time. the highest order day was monday afternoon. Honestly, it’s probably not even hunger it’s just cognitive depletion. By 7 or 8pm after a full day of decisions, opening uber eats or DoorDash removes one more decision from the stack and that seems enough. Seeing it laid out visually made it seem like predictable burnout window instead of poor discipline.

They have their own local models apparently.When I heard \"the language won't matter\" I saw a huge red flag, almost cancelled right there, but I need the job so I just went \"ok, alright, you're right\". I truly doubt anybody can debug \"any language\" without understanding it deeply.I'm taking this because it's my first option, but this caused me some noise tbh. I think this company fell into AI hype hard and doesn't understand it, trying to implement AI where is not needed (migrations, etc). But I can adapt.Good stuff: HR mentioned quarterly performance reviews (\"how do you feel, what to improve, etc\") which sounds decent despite bad Glassdoor reviews.Next steps he told me:* Psychometric tests (personality, english, basic logic) - done* Technical interview (no leetcode, no coding, just some \"advanced\" questions to determine my level) - this scares me tbh.* Reference check to validate CV historyQuestions:1. What kind of technical questions for C#/SQL should I expect? Company does software solutions/migrations for other companies, they have about 500 employees, Azure + .NET stack. They said basics of Azure is fine, not in-depth knowledge needed. How to prep? I feel like I don't know sh!t but also feel like impostor syndrome talking.2. About my references: They want contact from \"*previous company*\". But as I said in my previous post, this wasn't a company officially registered, it was a personal project I ran with some friends in the US for 7+ years. Even during the interview I said it but the guy didn't care or didn't listen carefully. My take is to be truly honest here in the next contact I get from them, I don't want to get the job lying, if I'm not a good fit, they should consider this and just don't hire me. Or if they hire me, maybe is because they don't care.Anyways, the problem is they're assuming I worked in a small company but it was never legally registered, not even as LLC. My friend did register an LLC but that was a year ago, not related to me at all. If they dig they'll see the LLC registration date doesn't match my 8 years timeline. So I guess I can't use that.They said it's \"*to comply with regulations and just a formality*\" to confirm I worked there the time I said.Best I can do is give them number of my co-owners (they financed it, not tech guys, but can confirm project existed 7+ years). Profits were low, was side project for them, main income for me, now the project is closing as I was the only one maintaining it and basically is not even an extra income now.I can't just not talk about this because this project is where I learned almost everything I know now today. Yet I fail when it comes to Distributed Systems, I never used Kafka, nor RabbitMQ in my life, didn't even needed, I know the concepts but only that...So, how deep do US companies dig on references? Just phone call/email or more in-depth? How do they check my background? I was in Venezuela for all those years, I have like 2 years in this new country (LATAM anyways), banking system is crap there in Venezuela so I used mostly Binance to hold money. But I know for sure this is not formal and looks terrible.Really lost here. If you think I should avoid this company to dodge legal troubles, let me know.EDIT: I'm trying to sell myself as a Mid Level, not Senior per se (although I don't mention it at all) because as I haven't worked in teams ever, I know I'm not a real senior. The project is 100% real, is online and I can talk about it all day long, I designed every single part of it and it's running smoothly so far, but almost no clients because it's very niche and scalating it would require a lot of money that I current don't have.",

        "content": "After graduating with my BS in Comp Sci in 2024, i took a non tech related job, being an Assistant Project Manager with a company that does construction. After a few months, I began creating internal tools for the other APM's to automate workflows, over time i began doing this for other departments and have now turned my job into a hybrid role as a Solutions Engineer/APM (a title i gave myself). Most of these automated workflows work largely the same, React in the front end, Python/Flask back end and all this is hosted on AWS so everyone in the company has access. These tend to be more simple things like spreadsheet manipulation using pandas, or doing OCR analysis on documents and sending that info to our construction management software using their API. Also have been trying to implement the OpenAI API whenever i see fit, i feel like companies are looking for these skills more and more. What i want to know is how can I use this experience to transition into the next stage of my career? I am planning on moving to the Boston area in about 1.5 to 2 years. Should I be looking for \"solutions engineer\" roles in that area and is this a growing job market? Would it be hard to transition into traditional SWE? I love the idea of doing full stack development for a startup, that sort of environment really excites me but i dont know if its feasible. I will also be graduating with an MS in CS at the end of this year so maybe that will help. I just want to be able to find a job out there.",

        "content": "I intern at a large company, and I'm expecting to get an offer from my team and another team when I graduate soon. However, I am still looking around in case things don't work out. I used to be obsessed with wanting to do simulation development since I started college but for the past while, I've been open to exploring other fields to learn as much as I can.There is someone that I networked with a long time ago that works at the same company I do and does XR work. They reached out to me recently saying there might be a position for me on their team, so I should send my resume and cover letter to him. I eagerly did and was excited about the potential opportunity to finally get the job I've wanted for a long time. I asked a few questions about the work including which part of the work site they worked in, and they said, \"Everything is 100% remote - WFH\".I would have been excited for the job to be remote a few years ago, but my mind has changed since then, and I feel like I would go insane if I stayed at home all the time. Two things that I really like about my current position and being in-person are:1. I've been dreading the thought of just staring at a computer screen for the rest of my career, but my current position is focused on hardware, so I get to be more hands-on and move around.2. I want to climb the corporate ladder, and because the team I work on is big (and there are just a lot of people at the work site in general), I'm always meeting new people and networking. I also believe you can connect with people more in person than over a teams call/chat behind a screen.I feel like if I were to work remotely, I would lose both of these things; I'd be stuck staring at a screen all day in my house, and I can't socialize with anyone except my team, which would be through teams calls and messages. I don't have any friends or coworkers that have similar experiences (working remotely vs in-person, climbing the ladder remotely, etc.), so I'm hoping people here have some insight to share. And, I'm not just concerned about this specific position, but any remote position in general. Am I limiting my mindset and there really are endless possibilities with remote jobs that I'm just not seeing? When I graduate, I plan to get involved in social activities like doing intramural sports, pursue hobbies like BJJ and learning instruments and languages, and travel.",

He said a good portion of their summer interns get return offers at the end of their program and they absolutely intend to do the same going forward.I don't mind the work, and I don't mind doing that full-time if I do happen to get a return offer BUT I am still a programmer at heart and I would definitely prefer a job or internship that has me writing code, be it traditional SWE or agentic AI or traditional ML.If I do get the role and I don't have any other offer, I will take it.
