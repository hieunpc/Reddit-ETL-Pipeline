        "content": "I've been thinking about how companies are treating data engineers like they're some kind of tech wizards who can solve any problem thrown at them.Looking at the various definitions of what data engineers are supposedly responsible for, here's what we're expected to handle:1. Development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data2. Producing high-quality data and consistent information3. Supporting downstream use cases4. Creating core data infrastructure5. Understanding the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, AND software engineeringThat's... a lot. Especially for one position.I think the issue is that people hear \"engineer\" and immediately assume \"Oh, they can solve that problem.\" Companies have become incredibly dependent on data engineers to the point where we're expected to be experts in everything from pipeline development to security to architecture.I see the specialization/breaking apart of the Data Engineering role as a key theme for 2026. We can't keep expecting one role to be all things to all people.What do you all think? Are companies asking too much from DEs, or is this breadth of responsibility just part of the job now?",

There is so much more I could do would have wanted to do. Heck I have just been in one domain also.My company lately have been asking us to prepare datasets to feed to agentic AI. While it answers the basics right it still fails at complex things which require deep domain and business knowledge.There are several prompts injected and several key business indicators defined so the Agent performs good ( honestly if we add several more layers of prompt and chain few more agents it would get to answer come hard questions involving joining 6+ tables as well)Since it already answers some easy to medium questions based on your prompts the headcounts are just slashing. No I am good at what I do but I won't self proclaim as top 1%. I have very strong skillset to figure things out if I don't know about it. A coworker of mine has been the company for 6 years and didn't even realize how to solve things which I could do it ( even though I had no idea in the first place as well) . I just guess this person has become way more comfy and isn't aware how wild things are outside.Is there anyone actively considering goose farming or something else out of this AI field ?There is joy in browsing the internet without prompts and scrolling across website. There is joy in navigating UIs, drop downs and looking at the love they have put in. There is joy in minimizing the annoying chat pop that open ups at the website.And last thing I want to read is AI slop books by my fav authors.There is reason why chess is still played by humans and journalist still put heart out in their writing. There will also be a reason human DE/DS/DA/AE would be present in future but maybe a lot less.What's the motivation to still pursue this field ? I love anything related to data to be honest and for me that is the only one. I love eat and breathe data even if I am jobless now because of AI first policy my company has taken.",

        "content": "https://i.redd.it/fsa3dtvkfrgg1.gifHello all!I'm new in this subreddit! I'm a Data Engineer with +3 years of experience in the field.As shown in the attached image, I'm making an ETL simulator in JavaScript, that simulates the data flow in a pipeline.Recently I came across a Linkedin post of a guy showcasing this project : [https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival](https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival)He made a little tower defense game that interactively teaches Cloud Architecture basics.It was interesting to see the engagement of the DevOps community with the project. Many have starred and contributed to the Github repo.I'm thinking about building something silimar for Data Engineers, given that I have some background in Game Dev and UI/UX too. I still need your opinion though, to see whether or not it is going to be that useful, especially that it will take some effort to come up with something polished, and AI can't help much with that (I'm coding all of the logic manually).The idea is that I want to make it easy to learn Apache Spark internals and distributed computing principles. I noticed that many Data Engineers (at least here in France), including seniors/experts, say they know how to use Apache Spark, yet they don't deeply understand what's happening under the hood.Through this game, I'll try to concretize the abstract concepts and show how they impact the execution performance, such as : transformations/actions, wide/narrow transformations, shuffles, repartition/coalesce, partitions skew, spills, node failures, predicate pushdown, ...etcYou'll be able to build pipelines by stacking transformer blocks. The challenge will be to produce a given dataframe using the provided data sources, while avoiding performance killers and node failures. In the animated image above, the sample pipeline is equivalent to the following Spark line : `new_df = source_df.filter($\"shape\" === \"star\").withColumn(\"color\", lit(\"orange\"))`I represented the rows with shapes. The dataframe schema will remain static (shape, color, label) and the rendering of each shape reflects the content of the row it represents. Dataframe here is a set of shapes.I'm still hesitant about this representation. Do you think it is intuitive and easy to understand ? I can always revert to the standard tabular visualisation of rows with dynamic schemas, but I guess it won't look user friendly when there are a lot of rows in action.The next step will be to add logical multi-node clusters in order to simulate the distributed computing. The heaviest task that I estimated would be the implementation of the data shuffling.I'll share the source code within the next few days, the project needs some final cleanups.In the meanwhile, feel free to comment or share anything helpful :)",

This is exactly the stack I need to master for my future career steps.•The “Catch”: The fixed base salary offer is 12.5% lower than my current base salary in consulting.•Variable: There is a 10% variable bonus (performance-based), which brings the total package closer to my current pay, but the guaranteed monthly income is definitely lower.My Plan / Strategy:1.Tech: Acquire deep expertise in Databricks and Data Engineering (highly in demand).2.Domain: The role focuses on Digital Performance / E-commerce, which seems valuable.My Questions for the community:1.Does taking a 12.5% step back on base salary seem justified to gain the Databricks expertise + the stability of an internal role?2.Is it risky to accept a “Senior” job title that pays below market rate for that level, or will the title itself be valuable on my CV in 2 years?3.Has anyone here taken a pay cut to pivot technically? What was the ROI after 2-3 years?Thanks in advance for your advice!",

DuckDB on local storage is 3-10x faster than cloud platforms2. BigQuery scans 4x more data than Athena for the same queries3. DuckDB + remote storage has significant cold start overhead (14-20 seconds)---## The Setup**Hardware (DuckDB tests):**- CPU: AMD EPYC 9224 24-Core (48 threads)- RAM: 256GB DDR- Disk: Samsung 870 EVO 1TB (SATA SSD)- Network: 1 Gbps- Location: Lauterbourg, FR**Platforms tested:**Platform | Configuration | Storage:--|:--|:--DuckDB (local) | 1-32 threads, 2-64GB RAM | Local SSDDuckDB + R2 | 1-32 threads, 2-64GB RAM | Cloudflare R2BigQuery | On-demand serverless | Google CloudAthena | On-demand serverless | S3 Parquet**DuckDB configs:** Minimal: 1 thread, 2GB RAM, 5GB temp (disk spill) Small: 4 threads, 8GB RAM, 10GB temp (disk spill) Medium: 8 threads, 16GB RAM, 20GB temp (disk spill) Large: 16 threads, 32GB RAM, 50GB temp (disk spill) XL: 32 threads, 64GB RAM, 100GB temp (disk spill)**Methodology:**- 57 queries total: 42 typical analytics (scans, aggregations, joins, windows) + 15 wide scans- 4 runs per query: First run = cold, remaining 3 = warm- All platforms queried identical Parquet files- Cloud platforms: On-demand pricing, no reserved capacity---## Why Is DuckDB So Fast?DuckDB's vectorized execution engine processes data in batches, making efficient use of CPU caches. Combined with local SSD storage (no network latency), it consistently delivered sub-second query times.Even with medium config (8 threads, 16GB), DuckDB Local hit 881ms median. With XL (32 threads, 64GB), that dropped to 284ms.For comparison:- BigQuery: 2,775ms median (3-10x slower)- Athena: 4,211ms median (~5-15x slower)---## DuckDB ScalingConfig | Threads | RAM | Wide Scan Median:--|:--|:--|:--Small | 4 | 8GB | 4,971 msMedium | 8 | 16GB | 2,588 msLarge | 16 | 32GB | 1,446 msXL | 32 | 64GB | 995 msDoubling resources roughly halves latency. Going from 4 to 32 threads (8x) improved performance by 5x. Not perfectly linear but predictable enough for capacity planning.---## Why Does Athena Scan Less Data?Both charge $5/TB scanned, but:- BigQuery scanned 1,140 GB total- Athena scanned 277 GB totalThat's a 4x difference for the same queries.Athena reads Parquet files directly and uses:- **Column pruning:** Only reads columns referenced in the query- **Predicate pushdown:** Applies WHERE filters at the storage layer- **Row group statistics:** Uses min/max values to skip entire row groupsBigQuery reports higher bytes scanned, likely due to how external tables are processed (BigQuery rounds up to 10MB minimum per table scanned).---## Performance by Query TypeCategory | DuckDB Local (XL) | DuckDB + R2 (XL) | BigQuery | Athena:--|:--|:--|:--|:--Table Scan | 208 ms | 407 ms | 2,759 ms | 3,062 msAggregation | 382 ms | 411 ms | 2,182 ms | 2,523 msWindow Functions | 947 ms | 12,187 ms | 3,013 ms | 5,389 msJoins | 361 ms | 892 ms | 2,784 ms | 3,093 msWide Scans | 995 ms | 1,850 ms | 3,588 ms | 6,006 msObservations:- DuckDB Local is 5-10x faster across most categories- Window functions hurt DuckDB + R2 badly (requires multiple passes over remote data)- Wide scans (SELECT *) are slow everywhere, but DuckDB still leads---## Cold Start AnalysisThis is often overlooked but can dominate user experience for sporadic workloads.Platform | Cold Start | Warm | Overhead:--|:--|:--|:--DuckDB Local (M) | 929 ms | 881 ms | ~5%DuckDB Local (XL) | 307 ms | 284 ms | ~8%DuckDB + R2 (M) | 19.5 sec | 1,099 ms | ~1,679%DuckDB + R2 (XL) | 14.3 sec | 496 ms | ~2,778%BigQuery | 2,834 ms | 2,769 ms | ~2%Athena | 3,068 ms | 3,087 ms | ~0%DuckDB + R2 cold starts range from 14-20 seconds.

BigQuery and Athena also minimal (~2% and ~0%).---## Wide Scans Change EverythingAdded 15 SELECT * queries to simulate data exports, ML feature extraction, backup pipelines.Platform | Narrow Queries (42) | With Wide Scans (57) | Change:--|:--|:--|:--Athena | $0.0037/query | $0.0064/query | +73%BigQuery | $0.0284/query | $0.0282/query | -1%Athena's cost advantage comes from column pruning. When you SELECT *, there's nothing to prune. Costs converge toward BigQuery's level.---## Storage Costs (Often Overlooked)Query costs get attention, but storage is recurring:Provider | Storage ($/GB/mo) | Egress ($/GB):--|:--|:--AWS S3 | $0.023 | $0.09Google GCS | $0.020 | $0.12Cloudflare R2 | $0.015 | $0.00R2 is 35% cheaper than S3 for storage. Plus zero egress fees.**Egress math for DuckDB + remote storage:**1000 queries/day × 5GB each:- S3: $0.09 × 5000 = $450/day = **$13,500/month**- R2: **$0/month**That's not a typo.

        "content": "I run the data department for a small property insurance adjusting company.Current ETL pipeline I designed looks like this (using an Azure VM running Windows 11 that runs 24/7):1. Run \\~50 SQL scripts that drop and reinsert tables & views via Python script at \\~1 AM using Windows Task Scheduler. This is an on-premise SQL Server database I created so it is free, other than the initial license fee.2. Refresh \\~10 shared Excel reports at 2 AM via Python script using Windows Task Scheduler. Excel reports have queries that utilize the SQL tables and views. Staff rely on these reports to flag items they need to review or utilize for reconciliation.3. Refresh \\~40 Power BI reports via Power BI gateway on the same VM at \\~3 AM. Same as Excel. Queries connect to my SQL database. Mix of staff and client reports that are again used for flags (staff) or reimbursement/analysis (clients).4. Manually run Python script for weekly/monthly reports once I determine the data is clean. These scripts not only refreshes all queries across a hundred Excel reports but it also logs the script actions to a text file and emails me if there is an error running the script. Again, these reports are based on the SQL tables and views in my database.I got my company to rent a VM so all these reports could be ready when everyone logs in in the morning. Budget is only about $500/month for ETL tools and I spend about $300 on renting the VM but everything else is minimal/free like Power BI/python/sql scripts running automatically. I run the VM 24/7 because we also have clients in London & the US connecting to these SQL views as well as running AdHoc reports during the day so we don't want to rely on putting this database on a computer that is not backed up and running 24/7.Just not sure if there is a better ETL process that would be within the $500/month budget. Everyone talks about databricks, snowflake, dbt, etc. but I have a feeling since some of our system is so archaic I am going to have to run these Python and SQL scripts long-term as most modern architecture is designed for modern problems.Everyone wants stuff in Excel on their computer so I had a hard enough time getting people to even use Power BI. Looks like I am stuck with Excel long-term with some end-users, whether they are clients or staff relying on my reports.",

        "content": "Hi big brothers, I am an entry level ETL developer working with Snowflake, Python, IDMC, Fabric (although I call myself data enginer on linkedin, let me know if this is ok). So, my background has been in data science and I have explored a lot, learned a lot, worked on a lot of personal project including gen ai. I am good with Python coding (solved 300+ leetcode), SQL and great intuition such that I can learn any tool thrown at me. So, I got hired at a SBC and they got me into ETL development. I can see based on the tasks I have got so far and things people around me are doing, I wont be doing anything other than migrating etl pipelines from a legacy tool (like SAS DI, denodo, etc.) to modern tech like Snowflake, IDMC, Fabric. Is this okay to be considered for an entry level data engineer? If yes, then should I try to leave in 1 year of exp or is it safe to stay for 2 years and is the market ready to hire someone like me? Also, how do people upgrade themselves in this domain? Also, the tools are the backbone of this domain, how do poeple learn them even though they have not worked in any project around them in the job, I mean based on my exp, it is little difficult to learn them without actually working on them and way easier to forget? Do people usually fake the tool exp and then learn on the job? Also, when I have 1 year of exp, what are the expecations from me? Also, should I start working on my system design knowledge? My aim is to leave etl and get a proper data engineering job within next 12 months. Pls try to answer and also give any advice you would give to your younger etl dev brother.",

I built it after getting frustrated with every existing open source option:* Sentry is great, but it doesn't know what a dag\\_id is. Errors get grouped weirdly and the UI just wasn't designed for data pipelines.* Grafana + Prometheus feels like it needs a PhD to set up, and there's no real Python integration for error analysis. Spent a week configuring everything, then never looked at it again.* Airflow UI shows me what happened, not what went wrong. And the interface (at least in Airflow 2) is slow and clunky.What Granyt does differently:* Stack traces that show dag\\_id, task\\_id, and run\\_id. Grouped by fingerprint so you see patterns, not noise. Built for DAGs from the ground up - not bolted on as an afterthought.* Alerts that actually matter. Row count drops? Granyt tells you before the CEO asks on Monday. Just return metrics in XCom and Granyt picks them up automatically.* Connect all your environments to one source of truth. Catch issues in dev before they hit your production environment.* 100% open source and self-hostable (Kubernetes and Docker support). Your data never leaves your servers.Thought it may be useful to others, so I am open sourcing it. Happy to answer any questions!",

When something breaks, figuring out what was supposed to be true is not that obvious.We just released Soda Core 4.0, an open-source data contract verification engine that tries to fix that by making Data Contracts the default way to define DQ table-level expectations.Instead of scattered checks and ad-hoc rules, you define data quality once in YAML. The CLI then validates both schema and data across warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, DuckDB, and others.The idea is to treat data quality infrastructure as code and let a single engine handle execution. The current version ships with 50+ built-in checks.Repo: [https://github.com/sodadata/soda-core](https://github.com/sodadata/soda-core) Release notes: [https://soda.io/blog/introducing-soda-4.0](https://soda.io/blog/introducing-soda-4.0)",

Here's an example from one of our pipelines:\\- a job runs hourly in UTC\\- logic is \"process the next full day of data\" (because predictions are for the next 24 hours)\\- the run at 03:10 UTC means different day boundaries for clients in different timezonesDelayed ML inference events complicate cutoffs, and daily backfills overlap with hourly runs. Also for our specific use case, ML inference is based on client timezones, so inference usually runs between 06:00 and 09:00 local time, but each energy market has regulatory windows that change when they need data by and it is best for us to run the inference closest to the deadline so that the lag is minimized.Interested in hearing about other data engineers' battle wounds when working with incremental/schedule/timezone conflicts.",

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Have you seem this kind of stuff documented in a way that you really enjoyed? Any personal suggestions?PS- In case anyone gets excited: No, I'm not reproducing documentation that vendors already provide.

        "content": "\\*\\* repost because it was mistakenly removed twice. Mod approved I'm currently working in a role similar to a product manager, but leaning more toward the engineering side. While I currently earn an ok wage (working in the EU and coming from a third world country), I feel like I don’t really see myself working in this line of work forever, and I don’t see strong career/wage progression here.While looking for a possible career shift that could play to my strengths, I stumbled upon analytics engineering/data engineering. A lot of articles and people I’ve read on gave me the impression that it might be possible to break into the field without having a degree specifically in the area (I have a degree in materials science and if my impression of this is wrong then sorry). Btw I basically dont have any programming or analytics background except the limited amount of time I had with Matlab.My question is:1. Do you think this will still be true in the coming years? Considering that I’m currently working full time and can only learn in my spare time after work, I don’t plan to break into DE immediately, as I know that’s basically impossible. But maybe breaking into data analytics or analytics engineering could be more realistic and doable?2. I'm currently starting with SQL and then plan on moving to Python, Git, some visualization tools and then dbt and cloud warehouses. Is this a solid plan or are there any other stuffs I should take into account? Any tips on typical mistakes that one can do early in these phase that might hinder/slow down my progress?3. What are your best resources for learning and for having a decent roadmap or plan to become a data analyst, analytics engineer, or data engineer? I don’t mind paying for a course if it’s worth it. So far I'm using SQLBolt, w3schools, thoughtspot for their free courses as a start. Are there websites where I can practice writing SQL queries a lot? Any youtubers who make quality videos?There is also the worry of AI coming in and disrupting the future job market but that is a topic that probably is gonna derail my questions here so lets skip that for now.I know no one can really predict what the future will be like, but I’d love to hear perspectives and experiences from people who have been in the industry, or even those just starting out.Thank you for reading and your help!",

The ATS does not expose any historical information from the regular endpoint, historical data NEEDS to be exposed via “Data Stream” API.Now, I guess my question is for best practice, should the data stream api be used to update the applicant data table with the candidate data, or have it kept separate and only add rows to a table dedicated for streaming?

        "content": "As title. **When** ***shouldn't*** **we go through the efforts of building a dimensional model?** To me, it's a bit of a grey area. But how do I pick out the black and white? When I'm giving feedback, questioning and making suggestions about the aspects of the design as developed - and it's not a dim model - I'll tend to default to \"should be a dim model\". I'm concerned that's a rigid and incorrect stance. I'm vaguely aware that a dim model is not always the way to go, but *when is that?*Background: I have 7 years in DE, 3 years before that in SW. I've learned a bunch, but often fall back on what are considered best practices if I lack the depth or breadth of experience. When, and when *not* to use a dim model is one of these areas.Most our use cases are A) Reports in Power BI. Occasionally, B) Returning specific, flat information. For B, it could *still* come from a dim model. This leads me to think that a dim model is a go-to, with doing otherwise is the exception.Problem of the day: There's a repeating theme at work. Models put together by a colleague are never strict dims/facts. It's *relational*, so there is a logical star, but it's not as clear-cut as a few facts and their dimensions. Measures and attributes remain mixed. They'll often say that the data and/or model is small: there is a handful of tables; less than hundreds of millions of rows.I get the balance between *ship now* and *do it properly, methodically, follow a pattern*. But, whether there are 5 tables or 50, I am stuck on the thought that your 5-table data source *still* has some business process to be considered. There are *still* measures and attributes to break out.EDIT: Some rephrasing. I was coming across as \"back up my opinion\". I'm actually looking for the opposite.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I wanted to check something we’ve been seeing in my company with AWS Glue and see if anyone else has run into this.We run several AWS Glue 4.0 batch jobs (around \\~10 jobs, pretty stable workloads) that execute regularly. For most of 2025, both execution times and monthly costs were very consistent.Then, starting around mid-November/early December 2025, we noticed a sudden and consistent drop in execution times across multiple Glue 4.0 jobs, which ended up translating into roughly \\~30% lower cost compared to previous months.What’s odd is that nothing obvious changed on our side:* No code changes.* Still on Glue 4.0.* No config changes (DPUs, job params, etc.).* Data volumes look normal and within expected ranges.* The improvement showed up almost at the same time across multiple jobs.Same outputs, same logic. Just faster and cheaper.I get that Glue is fully managed/serverless, but I couldn’t find any public release notes or announcements that would clearly explain such a noticeable improvement specifically for Glue 4.0 workloads.Has anyone else noticed Glue 4.0 jobs getting faster recently without changes? Could this be some kind of backend optimization (AMI, provisioning, IO, scheduler, etc.) rolled out by AWS? Any talks, blog posts, or changelogs that might hint at this?Btw I'm not complaining at all , just trying to understand what happened.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone! Long-time listener, first-time caller. I have an opportunity to offer some design options to a firm for ingesting data from an IoT device network. The devices (which are owned by the firm's customers) produce a relatively modest number of records: Let's say a few hundred devices producing a few thousand records each every day. The firm wants 1) the raw data accessible to their customers, 2) an analytics layer, and 3) a dashboard where customers can view some basic analytics about their devices and the records. The data does not need to be real-time, probably we could get away with refreshing it once a day.My first thought (partly because I'm familiar with it) is to ingest the records into a BigQuery table as a data lake. From there, I can run some basic joins and whatnot to verify, sort, and present the data for analysis, or even do more intensive modeling or whatever they decide they need later. Then, I can connect the BigQuery analytics tables to Looker Studio for a basic dashboard that can be shared easily. Customers can also query/download their data directly.That's the basics. But I'm also thinking I might need some kind of queue in front of BigQuery (Pub/Sub?) to ensure nothing gets dropped. Does that make sense, or do I not have to worry about it with BigQuery? Lastly, just kind of conceptually, I'm wondering how IoT typically works with POSTing data to cloud storage. Do you create a GCP service account for each device? Is there an API key on each physical device that it uses to make the requests? What's best practice? Anything really, really stupid that people often do here that I should be sure to avoid?Thanks for your help and anything you want to comment on, I'm sure I'm still missing a lot. This is a fun project, I'm really hoping I can cover all my bases!",

Im not the good data admin so I'm relying on devs team that 'it is what it is' and it's pissing me off because it's ridiculous.But my main-main problem is that it's laggy even though we (5 people) are the only data consumers. It will be laggy af when clients will start using it and going above Medium warehouse on dbx will be costly and this cost will be undefendable because ROI will be way too low.Thanks in advance!",

        "author": "Spooked_DE",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,I have inherited a pipeline where some of the inputs are reference data that are uploaded by analysts via CSV files.The current ingestion design for these is quite inflexible. The reference data is tied to a year dimension, but the way things have been set up is that the analyst needs to include the year which the data is for in the filename. So, you need one CSV for every year that there is data for.e.g. we have two CSV files, the first is *some\\_data\\_2024.csv* which would have contents:|id|foo||:-|:-||1|423||2|1|the second is *some\\_data\\_2021.csv* which would have contents:|id|foo||:-|:-||1|13||2|10|These would then appear in the final silver table as 4 rows:|year|id|foo||:-|:-|:-||2024|1|423||2024|2|1||2021|1|13||2021|2|10|Which means that to upload many years' worth of data, you have to create and upload many CSV files all named after the year they belong to. I find this approach pretty convoluted. There is also no way to delete a bad record unless you replace it. (It can't be removed entirely).Now the pattern I want to go to is just allow the analysts to upload a singular CSV file with a year column. Whatever is in there will be what is in the final downstream table. In other words, the third table above will be what they upload. If they want to remove a record just reupload that singular CSV without that record. I figure this is much simpler. I will have a staging table that captures the entire upload history and then the final silver table just selecting all records from the latest upload.What do we think? Please let me know if I should add more details.",

My stack of tools, for now, is Python (pandas), SQL, Excel, and Power BI. I'm still learning about all these tools, but when I'm actually working on my projects, I don't exactly know where SQL would fit in. For example, I'm now working on a project that pulls data of a particular user from the Lichess API, cleans it up, transforms it into usable tables (using a OBT scheme), and then loads it into either SQLite or CSVs. From my understanding, and from my experience in a few previous, simpler projects, I could push all that data directly into either Excel or PowerBI and go from there. I know that, for starters, I could clean it up even further in pandas (for example, solve those NaNs in the accuracy columns). I also know that SQL does have its usefulness: I thought about finding winrates for different openings, isolating win and lose streaks, and that sort of stuff. But why wouldn't I do that in pandas or Python?[The current final table after the Python scripts; I'll be analyzing this. I censored the users just in case!](https://preview.redd.it/uywee59py4gg1.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=1188c1819ed4115924fbefc9285b217a61109fe6)Even if I wanted to use SQL, how does that connect to Excel and Power BI? Do I just pull everything into SQLite, create a DB, and then create new columns and tables just with SQL? And then throw that into Excel/Power BI? Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I've been trying to wrap my head around it ever since I started learning this stuff. I've been practicing SQL on its own online, but I have yet to use it on a real project. Also, I know that some tools like SnowFlake use SQL, but I'm wondering how to apply it in a more \"home-made\" environment with a much simpler stack. Thanks! Any help is greatly appreciated.",

So I am doing that. Tldr: If your repo is public or you are working on frontends - any secrets you hardcode into checked in files ever are compromised and can be used by anyone at your expense. Once a secret hits a public repo (github and others), scraper bots will likely grab it within minutes. Removing it from the repo at a later point doesn’t help - git history is trivial to scan. Git is meant to be easily reversible. That goes for your 'chore: delete api key' commit as well. If the key was ever committed to git on a publicly accessible repo, assume it’s compromised.Likewise, all frontend code runs on the client. Anything in frontend is public. Frontend is never a place for secrets, not even temporarily. If a secret was ever committed there, burn it immediately.The only fix is rotating the key on the provider side so the old one stops working and will no longer be accepted.

Maybe we still need to review it, but this technology has only just been born.Honestly, all of this has left me deeply depressed. It's an emptiness I don't know how to fill. I wish I could continue studying and learning something new every day, but all the time there's news, people on the internet spreading catastrophic information about the end of the profession, the uselessness of code, demotivating learning and encouraging the massive use of AI.I've been working in the field for 4 years, but all the excitement and motivation about it died completely after all this. All I want is to have that energy again, or to go to another area where I can do the same. I tend to become obsessed and dissect everything about a subject, but after 4 years of doing only this, I don't even know where to begin if I were to move on to something else. This has been a terrible time in my life. Studying programming, languages, operating systems, servers, it was everything to me, and I didn't want to do anything else.

I was looking at programming from a flowchart perspective- I.E questioning how in the hell people keep track of all these branching paths stretching out into infinity- but a quick convo with chatgpt cleared that up IMMEDIATELY. There is no flowchart with infinite branching paths, and there never was. It was ALWAYS a straight road with occasional detours that lead back to the main path!

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": ">TLDR: I built a Git course that runs inside your code editor (VS Code, Cursor, and friends), so you learn Git by using it in real dev environment. It's well-designed and illustrated. Link: [https://gitbybit.com](https://gitbybit.com/)---Hi folks! My name is Alexander Shvets. People know me best as an admirer of raccoons and the creator of Refactoring.Guru.Today I'd like to show you the project I've been working on for the past two years, it's [GitByBit](https://gitbybit.com).# Who is it for?The course will be most helpful for three groups of people:* **Developers who “use Git” but mostly as a black box.** You know a few commands, but you want to actually understand what you’re doing.* **Builders returning to code** (PMs, designers, ex-devs) who now use AI tools for prototypes and internal tools, and need their Git muscles back.* **Hobby coders and beginners** who want a practical, confidence-building path from zero to “I can work with Git.”# What makes it different?I designed [GitByBit](https://gitbybit.com) as a modern way to learn Git (if we can still say so about a project that doesn't use AI, ha-ha). It's story based, you learn about everything gradually, one concept built upon another. This course is also hyper-focused on practice: building muscle memory for commands, using real Git, real IDE tools, etc.That's possible because of the unique format: the course is integrated right into your code editor (assuming it's VS Code, Cursor, or any of the clones). It can also be run online via GitHub Codespaces. This format allows it to achieve some pretty cool things:1. **Real Git, editor and terminal.** You're always using real stuff! Once you finish the course, you're literally one shortcut away (Open New Window, Ctrl+Shift+N) from applying everything you've just learned about Git in your next project.2. **Instant feedback.** The course can check the results of your actions, explain errors, suggest workarounds, etc. You don't have to jump between a web page with instructions and the terminal, or search for explanations of cryptic Git errors. It's all in one place.3. **Respects your time.** The content is presented in bite-sized chunks, which helps you keep focus and stay engaged. No endless videos you have to sit through. The main course can be completed in one sitting, in an evening.4. **Gitopedia.** While progressing through the course, you build your personal in-editor Git reference, unlocking bits of supplemental material: deep dives into concepts, detailed explanations of commands, best practices, etc. These bits go into your personal knowledge base, a thing I called Gitopedia. You can pull up the Gitopedia as a separate tab in the editor, or arrange it to be opened in parallel at all times. It also serves as a map of what you've learned so far.5. **Illustrated.** There are cool handmade [illustrations](https://gitbybit.com/blog/0005-illustrations)!# What's covered in the course?There are two parts.**1. The FREE main course, focuses on Git essentials**: things that you need to know to work on your personal projects. Setting up and configuring Git, working with the terminal, the staging area, commits, branches, history, remote repos, etc.The course teaches Git in terminal first, but also shows how to achieve the same thing via graphical user interface of the editor.Apart from learning the Git itself, you also get insights on using the terminal effectively (navigating history, using autocomplete, etc.), learn about software release cycle, semantic versioning, licenses, best practices and more.**2. Optional paid add-on** (extra practice and team workflows; free course stands on its own):* Selective staging and resetting changes.* Different ways to clean up the repo or ignore unwanted changes.* A detective scenario where you investigate project crashes using git history and git blame.* A deep dive into merging/rebasing branches.* And my favorite: the full GitHub pull request workflow, from forking someone's repo to updating it according to the maintainer's demands, and the eventual merge.# Next stepsI'm considering translating the course to several languages, but I'm not sure which ones yet. Spanish, almost certainly. Let me know if you think yours should be in the list.Enjoy and have fun! :red_heart:",

        "content": "I’ve just started a university program in data science engineering (not that similar to CS in the US, more math heavy and less programming etc). I started this program because I like math and analysis and I thought data science would be a reasonable career choice. There’s obviously a bit of programming, and the problem is that we barely get any help and it’s constantly way above our level. We have assignments each week. The assignments aren’t very fun either, it’s just ”sort this list using this algorithm” or something like it. So the thing is, I feel like I would like programming a lot more if I didn’t constantly have to do it under pressure and above my own capacity. So are there any small projects I can do to find it more fun and not just something that I have to do? We use Java btw.EDIT: I’m not planning on becoming a developer/programmer. But since I will have to do programming for at least four years I would like to enjoy it more, that’s all.",

I don’t know if I’m supposed to keep doing this until someone magically finds me or if I’m doing it wrong.Is networking just talking to people online? Is it internships? Is it Discord servers?

Other than that, either I don’t attend or the lectures don’t happen because the professors don’t take them.The problem is that I feel I waste a lot of time with my friends. After the first lecture, we spend most of our time playing online games like BGMI or FF. They don’t seem very interested in coding, but I already have a little background. I am doing web development and planning to start DSA. I have also done some reverse engineering in apps and a little bit of app development and cybersecurity.Spending an hour with them is fine, but when I waste 2–3 hours doing nothing and then go home, I feel like I’ve wasted my day. I have a PC at home, but I feel exhausted by the time I reach home. I always think, why not utilize college time instead of wasting it? But I also feel like my friends should do something productive too.One semester has already passed, and now I’m confused about what I should do.",

The issue is that she has **no prior Computer Science background** at all, yet she’s now doing A-Level.She also never asks questions. I’ve noticed she zones out quite a lot, but when I gently address it, she denies it. I try to engage her with prompts, guided questions, and encouragement, but I don’t get much back.At this point I’m wondering:* Is this a confidence issue, a foundational gap, or just passive learning?* Am I expecting too much too quickly?* Would it help to switch to **Python first**, build problem-solving skills and logic, then come back to C#?* Or should I slow C# down even more and focus purely on micro-tasks and repetition?I genuinely want to help her succeed, but I’m feeling stuck and unsure if my approach is right. Any advice from CS teachers, tutors, or devs who’ve seen this before would be really appreciated.Thanks in advance :folded_hands:",

Like everyone else got it but me, yet I managed to survive more than 3 years in this job market.Now im in this new company for three months now, they are the kind of small companies that wanna ship fast no matter what. So you have no time to make architectural decisions or planning. The type of company where requirements are discussed in each daily and can change trillion of times then they question your skills when deadlines are missed. I cant leave though because I need the money and the market is just scary to be jobless. How can I improve in this environment. I started to use ai heavily to the point where I wait for claude code limits to reset so I can keep working. Even though I used to work without ai at all. I will changz companies if I find a better alternative but a better company will ask for a good developer who knows architecture and software design. Not a coder who survives using ai tools. I still ship, and im not against using ai. But when I try to work without it I struggle with the basics even. Any advice is much appreciated",

My usual approach is to first try to solve the problem on my own and then - even if I succeed - watch a YouTube video with deeper explanation to gain better understanding of the problem. Recently, I worked on [LeetCode 778: Swim in Rising Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/). It was a bit different from the problems I had solved before - I hadn't worked on this kid of problems yet. Although I managed to solve it successfully using a min-heap strucutre and a graph traversal algorithm. But it was something new for me, I had never used them two together. If you're an advanced programmer, when you hear a min-heap and graph traversal, you probably know what it means - but I didn't. Only when I was watching an explanatation of the optimal solution on YouTube, I realized that I had actually implemented a Dijkstra's algorithm - an algorithm invented by one of the greatest figures in computer science history. So even though this algorithm was created many decades ago, I was very excited that my analytical and problem-solving thinking process naturally led me to the same solution as Dijkstra's solution many decades ago. I'm sure that wouldn't happen if I was solving LeetCode blindly, learning only patterns. I wish every programmer feel this kind of moment from time to time to stay motivated on the path of learning!",

        "content": "I've been a floater so far. I've dabbled with a handful of different languages (python, ruby, java, c, c#, js) mostly because I was curious about what this programming thing was all about. My curiosity is growing significantly. I started solving basic problems with some scripting languages (sorting files with python, made some VERY BASIC selenium web automation scripts with java etc) and I really enjoyed it. I want to take it one billion steps further, however I don't know what direction to take it. In some ways, because I dont know what I don't know - as in there are a lot of programming professional domains that probably exist that I don't even know of. There are lots of languages and learning resources I probably don't know of. (I only know of the few big recommended ones like freecodecamp, odin, cs50 etc)With only a few exceptions, I'm pretty open minded to where I want to take this. I want to learn about data structures, algorithms and general design patterns and all the things professional developers eventually grow into. However to WHAT I apply these to? I have no idea. Here's what I know: I have no interest in traditional web development - especially front-end work. I tried to force myself to like it but I can't. (which is kind of a shame, because even traditional desktop applications are essentially getting deprecated in favor of cloud based web apps.) The biggest thing I think I'm mostly looking for is a language or technology stack that a) Has AMPLE resources to help someone go from beginner to contributor in a fairly streamlined fashion, b) interesting open source projects I could eventually try to contribute to and build experience working through the workflow of contributing to a team based project and c) something that has some kind of remote employment culture attached to it. (I live in a very remote part of the world and all current and future employment relies on remote work unless I want to climb an oil rig or hunt polar bears.). <--- stretch super longterm goal / bonus pointsThings I am curious about:* c# / windows desktop application development (whether this is even a thing in 2026 and beyond I have no idea)* c and systems / OS level programming (under the hood nuts n' bolts is incredibly interesting. Would love to learn how an OS works, whether it's windows or linux.)* MUD's / text based multiplayer games. See /r/mud for what I mean. I think these are interesting learning vehicles to get involved in. They stress OOP, classes, networking and efficiency while also working on what is probably a very legacy codebase. (some of these mud's have been online for 30 years!)* the ruby language in general - yeah I know I mentioned webdev as things I don't like, but ruby as a standalone scripting language is a beautiful thing. I would have strong interest in delving way deeper into it. (What are the odds rails devs can get by without giving a crap about the front-end? lol)I'm an older dude, so building dedicated desktop applications initially sounded interesting. (so probably c# .net windows apps in visual studio). I dont know if there's any professional demand for this stuff long term however these days. I'm from the Winamp/ICQ/Napster era so that's where my brain immediately went :D. I was looking at the TIOBE index for inspiration, but I think all it does is create FOMO so I stopped. Got overwhelming. Anyways, while I sit in this meeting listening to people blather on about quarterly financials, I thought I'd post this to solicit some ideas or feedback for where I could consider aiming my thirsty brain at. Thanks so much!",

Im a student and I’d like to get some up-to-date opinions on the state of Spring / Spring Boot in 2026 and looking forward, especially regarding job market demand, long-term viability, and industry trends.I have professional experience with TypeScript, mainly in the modern frontend/backend ecosystem but i felt that the lack of strong structure, the huge dependency ecosystem, and how fast tools and frameworks change can make it easy to feel “lost”, even on medium-sized projects. Because of that, I’m looking to move toward something I think is more serious, structured, and predictable in the long run.I narrowed my options down to C# (.NET) and Java (Spring / Spring Boot). At first, I was leaning toward C#, partly because several indexes (for example, TIOBE) show C# growing while Java appears stable or slightly declining. I also had the impression that the .NET community is larger and more “welcoming”.However, when I looked at the actual job market, the number of openings requiring Java + Spring (at least in my region and for remote positions) seemed significantly higher so i started learning it.i Would like to know the point of view of people that works with Spring/Spring boot, things such as:How do you see Spring/Spring Boot in 2026 and over the next 5–10 years?Is it still a solid choice for backend systems?Do you see it losing relevance compared to .NET, Node.js, Go, in the long run?From a career perspective, is Java + Spring still a good way to progress?I’d really appreciate your insights, thanks!",

I previously had a system where I basically separated a scenes class, containing what inanimate textures and sprites each scene needed, a map class, which cointains objects' positions, an animations class, with the bulk of sprite textures, and of course the main game class which runs in a loop. The other files were kinda interdependent, and in scenes I had key dictionaries that bound each texture to its position, so that Game would know where to draw it. Just now, I switched to a class-based version, where characters are just their own class, complete with position, animation, name, etc. So each one is a 'package' with more different types of data, but kinda usable as-is in the Game file.I did this because I got the impression the first way might become too fragmented, but actually I kinda liked the separate dictionary-version too. What do you think? Is the class-based one more standard, or is it better to separate by function like with my first version?Thanks!",

The record would be saved into the databse regardless. I’m leaning toward:* Payment Service owning idempotency and orchestration* Transfer Service staying stateless and focused on money movementBut I’m curious how this is handled in real production systems.Any insights would be appreciated!",

I'm in UK. Is it worth the additional work and stress? There's so many different things to learn when it comes to web development, and I have no idea what to start off with. I feel like javascript is good, I'm 20% way to completing https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-subtraction and am learning a decent amount. What about typescript, python? Which one is best for frontend? Since i think focusing on frontend is best at the start and see how i feel about expanding into backend/fullstack..I do however have a game's degree in modelling & animation, but there are basically no jobs for games out there, if there are any, it's so hard to get into that I have 0 chance. So I'm unfortunately moving industry. But with a game's degree, and not a computer science degree, which is what i should've gotten, it's going to be so much harder to get a job, isn't it? Considering my degree is more design and art, rather than technical programming as well. Any advise? I genuinely feel bad for 1: doing a shit degree when i should've done computer science and 2: for wasting time on games... When front/back end and fullstack developers make way more money as well from what i've found.,Any help would be appreciated.Cheers",

Should I double down on backend by going deeper into more production-oriented concerns like security basics, deployment, logging, and performance? Or is it better to start adding a minimal frontend (for example, React) and build small full-stack projects just to exercise the backend end-to-end?Also, with all the AI hype around lately, it’s hard to tell what actually compounds long-term versus what’s just noise. From your experience, what would you prioritize focusing on next at this stage?Would really appreciate your perspective",

With backend work, I’m very comfortable modeling data, writing logic, designing APIs, and structuring systems. But when it comes to building components, structuring state, wiring templates, and making everything feel “right” in a frontend framework, I feel lost and slow.For those who also came from a backend-heavy .NET background:* How did you approach learning Angular (or any modern frontend framework)?* What mental shift helped you the most?* Did you focus on design, component architecture, or just brute-force building projects?* Any specific learning path or advice you wish you had earlier?I’d really appreciate insights from people who’ve been through this transition.",

Encoding is CPU-heavy, and handling uploads + DB + requests + encoding on the same machine clearly doesn’t scale. It’s obvious now that it needs to be split across multiple servers.**Current flow*** User uploads a video* Server encodes it to HLS (M3U8 + segments)* Encoded files are stored on Cloudflare R2* The app serves the HLS stream from R2 to the user dashboard/player**What I’m trying to achieve:**I want a seamless fix, not something where files are constantly uploaded/downloaded between servers. I don't want thousands of millions of class A / B operations.

I was already employed, so I was searching pretty casually and really only taking interviews for things that sounded interesting.I had a couple requirements in my search, so I generally rejected anything that didn't meet these.* Remote preferred, would have been willing to relocate, but would have have to be for a big tech like offer.* Needed to be a base of 180-190+.* Preferred public companies* Tech, or at least tech forward company* I generally reject any take home testsGeneral Info (This is all a bit rough number's wise, I didn't keep super exact metrics):* 30 cold applications -> \\~10 of which turned into initial HR interviews* Around 45 recruiter reachouts that I thought might be promising -> I rejected over half of those for various reasons.* Got Hiring Manager rejected from about 10, not sure on the exact ratio of cold applications to recruiter reachouts there.* Went to 15 tech screens, general mix of LC and more general coding tests.* I didn't do any prep at all, so I failed quite a few there and ended up taking 4 onsites.* Failed 2 onsites, got 1 offer frozen, and accepted the last offer which I just startedNotes:The general interview process/difficulty was about the same as I have experienced in the past. I had a general mix of leetcode like questions and more general coding questions. The offer I accepted asked mostly LC style questions, though there were more practical questions asked as well.HM's seem to be more picky and quick to reject. I've never really not gotten through to a tech screen from an HR screen, and I got HM rejected a few times over this process.I hope this might be helpful to anyone during their search.

Im right at the finish line, I can finally rest knowing i worked my ass off to get away from the shitty work situation i had previously and I can start working in a new domain, new interesting tech for more money. i feel like i did exactly what i set out to do.I’m not in interview form, haven’t touched systems design or DSA in months. I had the recruiter call, told them i have an active offer, and they said they’re accelerating the interview timeline cuz of that. Given all that, i’m probably gonna bomb this first round technical algorithms interview i just scheduled.But, when a tier 1 company calls like this i know you have to pick up the phone. i know this is a rare opportunity. i’ve never interviewed for a company with this much “prestige” either. Football analogy: I’ve been playing for West Ham, I got an offer to play for Liverpool, but now Real Madrid is calling.So: is it even worth interviewing ? even if i think im just gonna flop big time. Should i just let them know that id love to keep in contact and that this is unfortunate timing? Do i only get one shot at this ? why do i imagine that this is like life or death like im gonna get black listed at Databricks if i fail this right now. Or do i put my head down and grind my life out for these next couple weeks, potentially get an offer, and have to go through the messy rescinding and all that. I’m just lost on what I should do. I just feel like i deserve to just chill out. But i feel like i can’t catch a break.I’m painfully aware that this is an extremely privileged and amazing problem to have. i’m aware that the worst they can say is no, and i learn from the experience and i just have another job lined up anyway. But I just wanna know what others would do. Just given the context of being out of interview form and just needing a break from the countless weeks spent practicing studying and interviewing.Interview or don’t interview.**Edit**: straight up, this is lowkey one of those anxiety fueled posts where you just need validation lmao. at least myself 5 hours ago did. i’m ready for them to give me an NP hard problem and call it a day :face_with_bags_under_eyes::call_me_hand:",

        "content": "Man, I’m feeling cooked and shitting bricks and could use some real talk. I’ve never been so stressed until now. Been at a bank since Aug 2020 right out of college. Spent \\~4.5 years as a Data Warehouse Dev/Architect doing architecture, pipelines, ETL, querying, reporting — stuff I’m actually good at.In March 2025 I internally transferred into an Observability platform role to upskill and mainly cus I was underpaid on my old role. I was very upfront in interviews(with my manager, tech lead and architect) that I didn’t have deep experience in their tech stack, but they still hired me cus they liked me and gave me \\~30% base bump.Before applying I spoke to my skip and I was told I’d be doing architecture, data onboarding, detection/alerting, reporting, optimization. Reality: it’s a ton of platform admin + production fire-fighting. Constant ops, constant pressure, and not what I naturally thrive in.The team lives in reactive mode. Seniors help when I ask, but they’re overloaded, so real mentorship barely exists. I still get work done, but the environments are complex and full of dependencies outside my control, so some stories roll across sprints. I even took the training courses they recommended when I joined, and somehow that annoyed the scrum master because it slowed delivery.Year-end review came back Meets/Meets, but here’s the kicker: my current manager is retiring and the scrum master becomes my new manager. That’s what’s making me lose sleep. His feedback: deliver faster, work more independently, stop leaning on seniors, pick up “harder” tasks, no multi-sprint rollovers. He literally called some of my work “protective tasks” and said anyone should be able to pick up any story.Had a recent 1:1 two days ago where scrum master(new manager)he basically said, “Now that you’ll be reporting to me, I have expectations.” Faster output, constant upskilling, more ownership. None of that is crazy, but the tone felt like a spotlight got turned on me overnight. I’m the only junior internal hire on the team and I already feel the difference in how he treats contractors vs me. It feels less like coaching and more like evaluation.Honestly? It feels like the early stages of a PIP setup: watch closely, raise the bar, document gaps, then decide.The problem is also fit. Long term, I don’t want to be a platform admin or ops firefighter. I’m way better at architecture, data pipelines, analytics engineering, ETL, and strategy. This role is draining me mentally and killing my confidence.So now I feel like the clock started and I got 6 months until mid year.On one hand, I can grind, overdeliver, and try to survive under the new manager. On the other, I should probably start aggressively interviewing and pivot back into data engineering / warehouse roles before this turns ugly.The area of solace I have is I’ve got financial runway if shit hits the fan (have $710k NW) but I don’t want to waste months proving myself in a role I don’t even want.1)How do you tell if stricter expectations are normal vs quiet PIP prep?2)If you sense the clock started, do you grind harder or job hunt immediately?3)Anyone here move from platform/ops back into DE/warehouse successfully?4)What would you actually do if you were me?Appreciate any real answers.TL;DR: Internal transfer into observability platform role turned into ops/admin + firefighting. New manager coming in, raising expectations, feels like spotlight/PIP risk. Role mismatch + stress. Grind to survive or start interviewing now?YOE: 5.5Age: 27Salary: $145kNW: $710k",

I tried scrambling for another but with finals approaching and anyone who could help me being unavailable because of again COVID or being to busy preparing for finals as well I was SoL.I graduated, hoping that maybe later on I could get another internship once things settled down but with my payments quickly starting, having no car of my own and about $2000 in my bank I had to move back in with my parents.I have a local job as a casino cashier that I've been working for about 4 years now, things are stabilizing and I have all my non federal student debt paid off and a decent vehicle of my own now. I have been thinking about my degree and how I've stagnated by not working for 4 years straight and basically not done any practice or studying either, its been to busy and hectic for me to focus on that especially with a volatile home life to deal with. Both of my brothers are in and out of jail or prison often and are hard alcoholics and unfortunately my mother refuses to put a restraining order on them so my home life hasn't been conducive for me to focus and think about all this.I'm not sure what to do at this point though, can I put myself through boot camps/refreshers to catch up? I'm almost considering going back to college because I was also supposed to graduate for CS in my program but had to focus on Web because of funds running out.Any advice on where to go at this point is appreciated, whether I should to to recover and pursue a career in web developing, go back for a year to get a CS degree (that's about how many credits I need), or perhaps try a different career all together?",

Decisions are already made, timelines are fixed, or “this is how we’ve always done it” wins out.It creates a weird dynamic where seniors are expected to be accountable for outcomes, but not actually empowered to influence the decisions that shape them.I don’t think this is always malicious, sometimes it’s inertia, politics, or pressure to ship — but it feels inefficient and demotivating.For those who’ve been on either side:* Why do you think this happens?* Is it a leadership issue, a culture issue, or just a reality of scaling teams?* What have you seen work to actually leverage senior experience effectively?Genuinely curious to hear different perspectives.",

He’s apparently a “AI leader” but he has no technical background, no relevant degrees or experience just years in leadership and now an AI thought leader. I get properly unclear expectations and vague asks. If I ask for further information, I’m being told “we’ve already discussed that” or shot down and acting as if I’m causing trouble. He has a vision of a business wide dashboard and has asked me to deliver it asap. He wants me to produce a power bi dashboard with all visuals without giving me access to any datasets or business reports. I’ve pushed back and said I can make a mockup using test data but it needs business information to be robust and viable. I might think of datasets the business doesn’t have access to etc. He refused and said I need to outline the datasets first. I need to list all the data I need, he will then go and ask for the data. But he’s the one who wants this data, I’m not the one driving this, it’s his vision. Whilst I’m used to driving projects and working with ambiguity, he wants essentially a super dashboard and is judging me on the outcome with giving no direction other than “business wide”. To me, it’s not the done thing to produce the visualisation before the data gathering and development phase. Anyone dealt with similar before? I’m just thinking there’s no way I could deliver something that meets his expectations.",

They don’t actually reflect skill levels, and hiring managers tend not to actually care about them once the interview process begins.* View B: They’re a measure of general competency and a candidate’s willingness to put in effort to learn. They’re a tiebreaker when other qualifications are roughly equivalent.For people who have experience hiring or interviewing software engineers:* Do AWS/Azure/GCP certifications actually factor into your hiring decisions at all?* What level of career progression do you think certifications become irrelevant to hiring or consideration, or do they remain relevant no matter what?* Have you seen any correlation between certification holders’ performance on the job?* If you had two candidates that were comparable in terms of experience, would a cert ever be the deciding factor?I’m not asking if certs are a good tool for learning. I’m specifically asking if it actually affects hiring decisions in a meaningful way, particularly when compared to actual project or production experience.Would love to get some real-world perspectives rather than theory.

It took me about a month to get set up because there was no one to onboard me; I basically had to figure everything out on my own, and there were some really niche things about the system that weren't documented properly. Actually, their entire documentation is a mess and not very helpful. It also took like 3 weeks for them to give me access to everything I needed.I've been stuck on a few issues for months, and it's driving me insane. These issues are direct symptoms of how the system was built. Initially, the system worked fine, but the way it was built is now causing a bunch of long-term problems to arise. I'm trying my best, but as soon as I fix one thing, another issue pops up. My boss and our clients don't really understand this, and they basically blame me for everything. I feel so overwhelmed right now. I've been trying my best, but I feel like it's not good enough. I've been working through nights and on weekends to try to resolve these issues, but it's like an endless cycle because more issues keep popping up. They also want me to do a full QA assessment every time I test, and that takes time.I've tried to explain to my boss that I'm just one person and that there is only so much I can do, but he doesn't care. They basically want me to do the job of an entire team while paying me below average for what a developer makes. I also mentioned to my boss that we should hire another developer or a consultant to help with the workload, and he told me that in order to do that, they would have to cut my salary by at least 45%. By their logic, they hired me to do a job, and if I need extra help to do that job, then it's going to have to come out of my pay. I'm trying my very best, but they make me feel like I'm incompetent and that I'm not even trying at all. They told me that I should be able to do this and more. I am actually questioning my skills right now. I don't know if I'm just a bad developer or if I'm being gaslighted by them.",

I hope this is useful for someone# CS Student 4-Year Plan## Freshman Year* Join 1-2 clubs related to your major. My recommendation is to pick a general engineering one and a more niche technical one (e.g. SHPE + Robotics or NSBE + Cybersecurity)> **Note**: If you attend school online or your school does not have active clubs, you still need to network with people in person. Look for local tech meetups for your chosen programming language, tech stack, or the local makerspace. Pick 2 and show up often and be active* Pick 1 programming language and follow an in-depth tutorial or book such as Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, or a Learn GO with Tests* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Make a resume and a LinkedIn profile## Freshman -> Sophomore Summer* Get a part-time job, anything will do* Practice more for your chosen programming language## Sophomore Year* Be more active in the same 1 - 2 club(s). Join event committees, help setup at events and show up frequently to events. Aim for a leadership position when elections are next held* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile. By the end of sophomore year you should have on your resume: a part-time job, some relevant coursework, 1-3 programming languages and some technologies, and active participation in a student organization* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely (slacks, a dress shirt and dress shoes can be had at Walmart). Take 5 - 10 printed copies of your resume with you and make it your goal to hand out all of them to recruiters. The point is to get accustomed to talking to professionals## Sophomore -> Junior Summer* If you got an internship, congratulations you are ahead of the curve. If not get a part-time job, anything will do* Fill in gaps as necessary (Git, SQL, basic cloud stuff, HTML & CSS, Unix CLI, basic networking)* By now you should have taken a Data Structures and Algorithms class. Time to start LeetCode. You don't have to go too crazy if you are consistent. Pick 2 days a week for ~1 hr: * **Day 1**: Watch an instructional video, attempt a problem, watch the solution video, then write the code for the solution * **Day 2**: Attempt a problem (30 mins for Easy, 45 mins for Medium, 1 hr for Hard). If you can't solve it in time, watch the solution video, then write the code for the solution. If you have more time, attempt another problem * **Repeat**: Continue with Day 2 until you run out of problems on a topic. Then start again on the next topic from Day 1 Check out NeetCode 250 for a list of problems organized by type, ordered from least to most difficult, with solutions## Junior Year* Be active in the same 1 - 2 club(s), hopefully this time in a leadership position. Try to get a leadership position during officer elections* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects. Take resumes and be dressed decently (clean shirt and pants with no holes). Recruiters sometimes do interviews* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile. Make sure to have a professional headshot. Obtain 500 connections by the end of the year. Add folks in you classes, in your student orgs, and at hackathons* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely. Take 10 - 30 printed copies of your resume with you and make it your goal to hand out all of them to recruiters. You NEED an internship this upcoming summer* If you have the money, go to a national conference so you can try to get an internship (e.g. SHPE, NSBE, Grace Hopper, WICSE, IEEE, etc). Dress nicely, take resumes, add people on LinkedIn* Start looking for internships in August. The goal is to get out 2+ applications out EVERY day. Don't just apply in your city, apply nationally## Junior -> Senior Summer* Do your internship and do it well. Dress nicely, ask questions, do your best work, add folks on LinkedIn. You are trying to get a return offer## Senior Year * Be active in the same 1 - 2 club(s). If you already had 1+ leadership positions feel free to take a break this year if you like. If you have not gotten a leadership position and you have not had 1+ internships you NEED to have a leadership position senior year* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, I graduated about a year and a half ago, coming up on 2 years now. Trying to break into the CS job market has felt like a complete anomaly to me. For the first while I was putting out applications left and right, though I have admittedly slowed down and tried making fewer but more tailored applications. This strategy has at least lead to a few interviews, even making it to second stage interviews. Alas though, still ending in rejection.In the meantime I have managed to get a job at a local place with benefits and worked my way up in the past few years. While the pay isn't great and doesn't pay nearly enough to move out of my parents house, its enough income that I can afford car bills and paying chunks off of my (relatively small) student loans. Thank god for scholarships.The root of my problem though is that I'm losing motivation in the job hunt, I feel like I didn't truly understand what I was getting into going in CS. Originally I started college for Phys/Astro which was something I was extremely passionate about. Unfortunately I faced serious burnout in my courses and dealt with a pretty rough episode of depression coming fresh out of the COVID era. While I was able to keep up a nice GPA I was absolutely miserable. Then I discovered programming for the first time through some of my courses!I finally found a new thing that I was passionate about and enjoyed doing, I love math, I love applying concepts learned in tangible ways and programming felt like that to me. Sadly though I didn't really understand the scope of what I was getting into, I just saw the fun new things I was learning because learning has always been one of my favorite things to do. Now I'm sat here just having turned 25 last week with absolutely no idea what to do next. I've had to move a bit over an hour from my girlfriend and friends because I can't afford to live in the area I consider home anymore. I've considered pivoting to something new but attending \\*more\\* school really just isn't in the cards for me at the moment besides potentially some night classes at my local community college. Even then I'm not sure what I'd pivot too and I don't want to do the blind rush into something like I did last time since that's what got me into this mess. Many of my favorite things that I believe I would enjoy as a career don't pay nearly enough to live comfortably with the economy (US) being what it is right now and things don't appear to be changing positively.I guess my question then is just, where do I even go from here? I feel like there are both 100 directions and absolutely none. I'm sitting in a dead end hole that I dug in the middle of an open field with no clear way out.",

All I want is finish my bachelor and I don't even know if I want to keep pursuing a master in AI, Maths or comp. science, or just start working. In my background I have a gold medal in National Olympiad in Informatics and silver medal in National Cybersec Olympiads, I have never tried Maths Olympiads even though I would have loved to.I'd like the idea of working one year, saving some money and then going to ETHZ, but I feel like if I start working then it's going to be very hard to go back to studying, and also IF I manage to find a job that allows me to save enough to live 2 years in Zurich.I don't really have big projects or work experiences in my cv, mainly I have taught cybersecurity, especially cryptography, in my uni, but that is it.Do you think I should focus heavily on training my interviewing skills, like going back to competitive programming and learning maths like IMO?I love these things as hobbies, but right now I find it incredibly hard to concentrate and lock-in, so I don't know if it would be a waste of time, or if I would increase my chances to actually achieve my goals.",

It seems that all that equivalently matters.It seems that the learning path just became twice as long and there is just so much more to keep up with.I have heard from some experienced developers that learning your immediate tech stack well is no longer a good time investment as AI will be so good and will just guide you there, do the work for you; however, I have trouble believing that.",

I’ve got about \\~3 years of experience, and I’ve been working as a full stack developer on a DoD project, so I do have an active security clearance (secret level).I started as a campus hire making $65k for this big defense consulting company, and after a few raises I’m at $79k now. No bonus though (my company doesn’t pay bonuses at my current level, which is some BS...). Also no promotion so far as they keep saying the market is bad, even though the company used to promote campus hires within 2 years just a few years before. I’ve been basically fully remote the whole time, which has been the best part about this job honestly.But yeah… things are getting worse. They’ve been slowly cutting people, and now they just eliminated our entire team (the project is going to end some time in February), so we’re basically being told we need to find other projects internally. I’m definitely not quitting without something lined up, and I’ve already started sending my internal resume to other teams inside the company. But at the same time, I feel like I should start looking outside too since i feel i can get paid more if i switch jobs...So I’m curious, how’s the cleared job market right now? I’m currently living in a MCOL city, and I’m willing to relocate if the company offers relocation assistance. I know the job market overall is pretty rough right now. Any advice would be appreciated.",

        "content": "To not make it extremely long yet also consice enough...I'm a recent CS major graduate, and I managed to land a role very shortly after graduation (aka. zero actual work experience) as a \"game dev intern\" at a software company (they're not a game studio, they're mainly vehicle-oriented), basically making them a simulation for cars.The internship is 6 months, and during these months, I'd been working on my own in this project, with the only additional help is just insight from my supervisor, but other than that, I built everything myself from the ground up.Now I'm mainly a game developer, just regular Unity/Unreal stuff, with some knowledge with graphics APIs like OpenGL and DirectX, but that's pretty much it. On the job however, the actual \"game dev\" part is like 40%, maybe 35% of the project. The rest is system configurations on platforms, bash scripting, networking and front-end, and recently robotics too. All of that was not only way outside my main working field, but also no one else in the team is able to help me with the project.About two months ago, deadlines started approaching, and with them, much more pressure and extremely long days, especially since I, as an intern, was responsible for this project that should be presented at some big \"conferences\". And of course, wouldn't you expect it (even though I'd have loved achieving it and being proud of it), I failed every single deadline. Too many moving parts of it and with the typical managers' requests, made me even more burnt out. The \"internship\" is 5 days/40 hours a week, full on site, with no options for days off. And more than once, I had to (not by my choice, but it did sort of help once) go on weekends to catch up.Eventually, about a month ago, I reached a state of burnout where I'm simply not even doing the bare minimum of a job to not get fired anymore, I couldn't be bothered. Even though the job pays so well at this level, the pressure made me terrified of staying any longer at the company.Am I right to feel that way or do I need to \"toughen up\"?Edit: I forgot to mention, we have paid access to AI agents so they handle all the heavy duty I barely write code myself anymore. But still, even with them, it's become quite exhausting working like a senior yet being an intern.",

They said me you have never used CI/CD or Agile frameworks, maybe you skills are sharpen, but your soft skills are low because you always work alone.I think they are right. However, I do not know what I can do for solve it. If I send my CV to junior jobs, I am overqualified. If I send it to mid-level they rejected me because I do not have relevant experience. Also, If I have luck and they led me to participate in the process, The manager is going to reject me because I do not have real experience in the area.I am a loop. I am overqualified for some jobs, but in others, i am underqualified.P.S. My english is not my mother language. So, maybe I made a lot of grammar mistakes.I wanted to attach my CV, but it's not possible. So, I left this [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/1qntvaz/i_want_a_honest_cv_review/)",

I know production engineer is less well known but it seems like I can focus on more of the swe side of the things if I really try to pivot. currently in team matching, focusing strictly on New York.i’m honestly leaning towards Bloomberg because of the stability. they have a good reputation for \"no layoffs,\" and in this market rn..., the peace of mind feels like a huge weight off my shoulders.but I know Meta has more brand \"clout\" and potentially higher TC over time. as for the PE role, I’ve heard it's less \"pure SWE,\" but I’ve been told that if I’m proactive, I can focus heavily on the development side and eventually pivot if I want.a few specific questions:is the \"stability\" at Bloomberg worth the potential \"slower\" career progression compared to Meta’s \"up-or-out\" culture?i’ve already done matching interviews with Infra in Ads and AdsML. has anyone worked in these orgs in NYC?are there specific teams or orgs within Meta NYC known for being more \"chill\" or having better WLB? I’ve heard Ads can be high-pressure since it’s the revenue engine.for those at Meta, how easy is it actually to pivot from PE to SWE later on if I decide I want to be 100% product-focused?would love to hear from anyone who has faced a similar choice or has recently worked at either office.

I get very excited to start the projects but then I end up losing interest. This didn't really ever hinder my internship performance or anything, but it has been frustrating because I feel that I like programming but still always lose interest. I don't know if it's the lack of structure, the fact that I often work alone, or some sort of mental condition but it happens often. I'm just wondering if anyone else has felt this way but improved after graduating?

I also have certifications in SEO and GA4. I am currently working my way through \"The Web Developer Bootcamp\" by Colt Steele so I can round out my resume with JavaScript, React, SQL, Node, MongoDB, etc. I also plan to learn Figma to Webflow as soon as possible and have a deep-dive JS online course waiting to be completed. I know I still have a lot to learn if I want to do front-end development and will eventually get around to building a few websites to include in my portfolio.I am wondering however without an actual CS degree what my chances are of actually getting my foot in the door as an entry-level developer? **Do recruiters actually care about CS degrees when you have an adjacent degree, some real-world experience working with developers, and a strong beginner portfolio?** A part of me wonders if I am wasting my time with these online courses and should instead transfer my Associates credits to finish my BA in CS.Tldr; I studied graphic design in college but have experience as a website administrator and CMS at my current job.

I've always tried to create a strong sense of structure and organisation within systems in whatever role I've been working in, regardless of the industry, and found myself being drawn to IT/Tech because of the way my brain works and enjoys the nature of work.Eventually, I'd love to move into Cloud/DevOps and be responsible for the stability of networks within an organisation, and after my degree, I'd like to pursue an Integrated Machine Learning Systems Master's at UCL to expand my knowledge and skills to move into MLOps at some point in the future. Hoping to make a meaningful contribution to an industry where my mind seems to be suited for possibly becoming an innovator in the field, or assisting teams with making major advancements in Machine Learning in an Engineering role, possibly even with embodied Ai when robotics begins to become more prevalent in society from 2030 onwards.I possess a strong sense of emotional intelligence, the ability to present and communicate with stakeholders in non-technical terms, and a proven ability to work with and effectively manage teams of others. These traits are proven in my previous work experience as a freelance designer and my years in hospitality management, working in some of the top venues in London.Some questions:What should I avoid doing? What can I highlight from my candidate profile? Is there anything else I should do to strengthen my profile? Is this enough for me to apply for entry-level IT jobs in help desk or other role? What kind of salary can I expect to receive in my first role? I had a minimum bar of 26k, but would ideally like to get 28k+ How would progression look over the next 3 years as I self-study and study for my part-time degree",

This is my 2nd job as a software engineer, my first role was in a factory, and it is more of a IT support role for their internal web software. Background of me, i have degree in electrical engineering and i am a bootcamp career switcher into SWE.In my previous role, there was no SDLC going on and most of the work is user requested bug fix or small feature improvements, and it was mainly recorded on excel sheets. There was no sprints, scrum or whatever, and i am usually the only person working on the code. Now i have changed company due to the previous one being slightly outdated, and this new company is alot more modern. They have 2 week sprints and work in agile team with daily standup, and have alot of SWE working on the same app. I am taken aback by the amount of tasks there is, and the very strict protocols about resolving tickets, sprints, proper SDLC, git branching and merging, and code reviews. Now i am feeling some imposter syndrome, not sure if i will be able to fully contribute independently to the work. I know some people will say, you passed the interview so the company know your level before selecting you. But it doesnt help that almost all the engineers in the team are senior with CS degrees and know indepth what they are doing, and i am feeling lost all the time. It has been a few days since i started, this imposter syndrome is getting to me and affecting me at work slightly, making me doubt myself all the time.Is this normal?

        "author": "Gjallock",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I’m coming to the end of my bachelor's in CS from WGU and have a decision to make. For context, this is where I’m at.I’m 24. I have an associate's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from a local community college, which helped kickstart my career as an automation engineer. For those who aren’t familiar, an automation engineer, in my case, is responsible for the automation of manufacturing equipment. I’m way oversimplifying here, but the job entails developing and troubleshooting specialized controllers that typically use non-traditional programming languages. Principles remain largely the same, so there is definitely a huge skill overlap between programming and the ever-growing need for more advanced computer systems for control and data acquisition in manufacturing. Today, I have about 8 years of full-time industry experience (4 as an engineer) and am almost finished with my bachelor's in CS from WGU.I started my CS program at WGU to check a promotion box in my current career. Still, I've always had a nagging fantasy of moving into a software engineering position or a similar role. With that in mind, what would be the wisest choice for me for a master's program?WGU affords me time, which is very important to me right now. My current position demands a lot of my time, and I never know when I might get called in to work. I am 24/7 on-call site support and the lead for my team, which means even on my “off” weeks, I’m still supporting the juniors. It’s a lot. OMSCS appears to be a much more rigorous workload AND schedule, but carries much more prestige. My main question is for folks who are already in the software engineering field. How much does that prestige matter for \\*me\\*? Do you feel my experience is relevant enough, or would I be filtered out immediately? I’m currently making around 105k base in an MCOL city, but am also worried about starting pay. I will be receiving a roughly \\~7% raise this year and expect around \\~10-15% the following year with a promotion. That puts my base at about 125k by the time I assume a master's program would wrap up. Would I be shooting myself in the foot by expecting a significant pay drop to make this transition happen?I’m hoping someone else has been through a similar path, but I’ve found my situation to be pretty unique and am struggling to find good resources as I don’t have a single connection within the tech industry. Thank you for any insight you can provide!",

        "content": "Today is beginning of my third week in my new job as a junior SWE. While I am beyond grateful and happy to have achieved this goal of mine I’m feeling confused and lost.I am on a small team of developers in a large company where I have one other dev who works directly on my area of focus: we are the backend team of a large application development team. I assumed this would be my go to person/senior. However this person does not give me tasks or really communicate with me at all. If I ask questions they answer them, but they delegate nothing to me nor have they taken anytime to explain how our services work-basically our only communication we have is if I reach out with a question. I am okay with working independently and figuring things out but it feels super weird to sit in silence and to wonder what I should be doing besides familiarizing myself with our codebases.I finally managed to suggest something small to do to them, add some additionally error handling to an api + some unit tests and they just said go ahead and submit a PR and I’ll review. The PR hasn’t been reviewed yet after 4 days. I have a manger that is the manger for the whole dev team but not technical, and he told my priorities should be getting api x working, which it is and then to begin work on brand new service.We don’t use JIRA or anything of the sort either. Has anyone been in a situation like this before? Am I being paranoid as it’s still so early into my new job? Any advice would be appreciated!",

        "content": "The title. Basically to sum it up, I just graduated with a bachelors in CS with a focus on video games, but my curriculum was very disappointing and barely actually focused on game development. I didn’t get a single internship throughout my entire experience in university because the vast majority of them were for cybersecurity students and none of them were related to what I wanted to be doing. My classes also burned me out on coding and made me lose my passion for it. Now I’m at a point where I’m still burnt out and I’m lost on what I should do for a career. I’m hesitant to try to break into the game industry right now because I know it’s competitive and very underpaid, so I’m considering working on my own indie game on the side while doing something else as my main job.The problem is I don’t know what to do as a main job now that satisfies my creativity, doesn’t hurt my brain, and pays enough to make a living off of. I’m thinking about something like web development or UI/UX design but I’m not sure if those fields are too competitive (or being too easily replaced) to be worth it. I’m someone with an eye for visual design and I also have skills in digital art, but I feel like I’m not at a point with my art where I think it’s professional enough and I don’t have any kind of professional portfolio yet.And yes I know I probably should have been working on side projects to build a portfolio while still in university, but I was burnt out constantly by my classes and didn’t recover from that burnout even during breaks. Maybe that’s a sign of a bigger issue, I don’t know. I do know I suffer from perfectionism that prevents me from starting things, even things I want to do.Any advice, tips, or insight would be appreciated. I want to move forward and get “unstuck” so I can properly start my adult life.I’m in the U.S. by the way if that’s relevant, in a very rural area, not a big city.",

I want a new job at my dream company (google/meta/anthropic/JS/etc) and I'd want to do that this year, which requires focus on LC an Sys Design. That's fine. However, lately I've been interested in learning full stack development (I have always been a backend dev at big tech / unicorn, never did front-end or built e2e apps), so I would love to learn some front-end and start building out my own projects. At the same time there is a big push for understanding AI / ML (not just deployment MLOps but actually understanding model architecture). RAG and all that stuff I can conceptually understand but I feel its more valuable to build projects with RAG, vector databases, running local models on limited hardware, etc. I know that Google/Meta/Anthropic/JS/etc is my primary goal so I feel that I need to focus on LC / Sys Design first before worrying about anything else. But I haven't shaken the feeling the more time I spend on that, the more behind I am on actual skills - Full stack, AI, etc. and frankly I have more interest in full stack dev AI stuff than I do on LC, but I know LC is needed to get the job I want.",

        "author": "OkMetal220",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "When I started as a freelance web developer, I thought the language or framework I used would make or break my chances of landing clients. I quickly learned that none of that matters at the beginning. Clients don’t care if you’re using Django, React, WordPress, or a page builder, they care if your work actually solves THEIR problem. And that mindset shift changed everything for me.Most beginners focus on tech... “Which framework should I learn?” “What looks more professional?” “What will make my portfolio shine?” But the reality is that your clients are thinking in pain points, not code. They notice when their website doesn’t bring leads, when people leave too fast, or when it looks unprofessional. If you approach your projects solving problems first, the tech becomes secondary. That’s exactly where your focus should be.There’s so much more to learn early on than programming itself. Understanding website structure, UI and usability, conversion principles, performance, and even SEO matters far more than writing perfect code. A simple example is the navbar. It doesn’t matter if you build it from scratch or use a drag-and-drop tool. What matters is knowing what its goal is, why elements go where they go, and how it influences user behavior. That’s what actually delivers value to clients.Many new developers feel like using WP or another simpler platform is “lesser work.” That’s only true if you forget your goal. Freelance web development is about outcomes, not code. Clients want results, and if a WP site or a simple landing page solves their problem faster, cheaper, and more reliably than a custom stack, they’ll be happier. Your job is to focus on real solutions, not trends.As your freelance career grows, you’ll eventually take on bigger, more complex projects that require custom code or advanced frameworks. But starting simple accelerates your growth. You ship faster, gain experience solving client problems, build confidence, and gather references without being bogged down in unnecessary complexity. Personally, I built over 20 WP sites across different niches before moving to Django, then layered React later. Starting small didn’t hold me back, it gave me a foundation.At the start of your freelance journey, the tech stack is never the bottleneck. Understanding the client’s problem is. Choose tools that let you ship quickly, learn continuously, and deliver real value. Stacks/trends will change but the ability to solve real problems is what will carry your freelance career forward.",
