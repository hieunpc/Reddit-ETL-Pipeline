YAML for Docker, dbt configs, random CI settings. I have done it before, but when I need it again my brain is blank.\\- I get overwhelmed by a small list of fixes. Even when it’s like 5 “easy” things, I freeze and can’t decide what to start with.\\- I ask for validation way too much. Like I’ll finish something and still feel the urge to ask “is this right?” even when nothing is on fire. Feels kinda toddler-ish. \\- If I stop using a tool for even a week, I forget it. Then I’m digging through old PRs and docs like I never learned it in the first place.\\- Switching context messes me up hard. One interruption and it takes forever to get my mental picture back.I’m not posting this to be dramatic, I just want to know if this is common and what people do about it.If you’re a data engineer (or similar) with ADHD, what do you struggle with the most? Any coping systems that actually worked for you? Or do you also feel like you’re constantly re-learning the same tools?Would love to hear how other people handle it.",

        "content": "Hi DEs,And the people using Fivetran..We are experiencing a huge spike (more than double) in monthly costs following the March 2025 changes, and now with the January 2026 pricing updates.Previously, Fivetran calculated the cost per million Monthly Active Rows (MAR) at the account level. Now, it has shifted to the connector (or connection) level. This means costs increase significantly — often exponentially — for any connector handling no more than one million MAR per month. If a customer has multiple connectors below that threshold, the overall pricing shoots up dramatically.What is Fivetran trying to achieve with this change?Fivetran's official explanation (from their 2025 Pricing FAQ and documentation) is that moving tiered discounts (lower per-MAR rates for higher volumes) from account-wide to per-connector aligns pricing more closely with their actual infrastructure and operational costs. Low-volume connectors still require setup, ongoing maintenance, monitoring, support, and compute resources — the old model let them \"benefit\" from bulk discounts driven by larger connectors, effectively subsidizing them.Will Fivetran survive this one? My customer is already thinking about alternatives.. what is your opinion?",

How much can I reasonably expect to be paid if I were to move to a different position?3. What should I seek out opportunity wise? Is it worth staying in DE?

        "content": "hello. After 6 years of working in data analytics with NGOs, I transitioned last year to a data engineering role. I was hired for the position because I have decent python/ SQL while every other technical person uses R or Excel. My manager, who worked in big companies, worked with big 4 consulting, and taught data engineering at university, is the lead of our data unit. we are expected to centralize survey data across multiple countries and different Humanitarian contexts. The problem is my manager is not taking the lead on any work related to this objective, strategy or implementation. He spent 9 months doing nothing but small contributions to an internal R package, correcting data tests for new hires, and organizing meetings. while I found myself doing tool discovery and teaching myself DE from the ground up. for now I have managed to. write a data ingestion pipeline with dlt, orchestrated with GitHub actions running via docker on azure. But I am getting frustrated as I am not getting the technical guidance, not the strategic Vision for the project. I feel like our progress is too small, and eventually someone from the senior team (who are not data engineering knowledgeable) will notice and fire us. I asked him multiple times to push back on menial small tasks , and he does for a while then goes back to the same shtick. The one time I managed to engage him in the implementation of the pipeline, he fixated on dlt getting 'seemingly' stuck at the load phase, took 3 weeks experimenting.. only for me to take on the same task and write a report in two days about how the issue is that our postgres instance runs out of IOPS quickly during initial loads and the slowness has nothing with dlt or my implementation. I am asking for guidance on how to make the best out of this as I am certain I cannot make the move to another job any time soon .",

So why am I falling over on the world's simplest pipelines. 10 million customer dataset, approx 10k product catalogue, product data in one table, transaction data captured from a streaming source daily. One of the bullet points is \"The marketing team are interested in tracking the number of times an item is bought for the first time each day\" explain how you would build this pipeline.Already covered flattening the nested JSON data into a columner silver layer. I read how many times an item is bought the first time each day as \"how do you track first occurance of an item bought that day\"The other person in the chat had to correct my thinking and say no, what they mean is how do you track when the customer first purchased an item overall. But then Im reeling from the screw up. I talk about creating a staging table with the 1st occurance each day and then adding the output of this to a final table in the gold layer. She says so where would the intermediate table live, I say it wouldn't be a real table its an in memory transformation step (meaning Id use filter pushdown and schema inference of the parquet in silver to pull the distinct customerid, productid, min(timestamp) and merge into gold where customerid productid doesn't exist. she said that would be unworkable with data of this size to have an in memory table, and rather than explain I didnt mean that I would dump 100 million rows into EC2 RAM, I kind of just said ah yeah, it makes sense to realise this in its own bucket. But im already in a twist by this point. Then on the drive home I'm thinking that was so dumb, if I had read the question properly its so obvious that I should have just explained that I'd create a look up table with the pertinent columns, customerid, productid, firstpurchase date. the pipeline is new data, first purchase per customer of that days data, merge into where not exists (maybe a overwrite if new firstpurchasedate < current firstpurchasedate to handle late arrival). So this is eating away at me and I think screw it, im just going to email the other chat person and explain what I meant or how I would actually approach it. So i did. it was a long boring email (similar to this post). But rather than make me feel better about the screw up Im now just in full cringe mode about emailing the chatter. its not the done thing. Recruiter didn't even call for a debrief. fml chat = view of the int",

Almost all openings have spark,pyspark and python as bare minimum with snowflake. On top of that some included azure data factory and kafka as well.So how do i approach this?

I write data science style procedural code and like to inspect and muck with stuff every step along the way otherwise I feel blind. It feels as I am in a live debugger. Even when I write an api, I have to take that function in a jupyter notebook and run it there and copy paste and go back and forth etc. I personally dislike functions as well unless neccesary and there's reuse required. I am not sure what to do but seems like in real ides there's tools like debuggers and interactive window which helps with this. But just wanted to learn from others how can I write clean software style code where I can still not lose visibility of the data. Thanks guys.",

        "content": "I work at a company with a fairly mature data stack, but we still struggle with environment management and upstream dependency changes.Our data engineering team builds foundational warehouse tables from upstream business systems using a standard dev/test/prod setup. That part works as expected: they iterate in dev, validate in test with stakeholders, and deploy to prod.My team sits downstream as analytics engineers. We build data marts and models for reporting, and we also have our own dev/test/prod environments. The problem is that our environments point directly at the upstream teams’ dev/test/prod assets. In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing. That is expected behavior, but it makes downstream development painful.As a result:* We rarely see “reality” until we deploy to prod.* People often develop against prod data just to get stability (which goes against CI/CD)* Dev ends up running on full datasets, which is slow and expensive.* Issues only fully surface in prod.I’m considering proposing the following:* **Dev:** Use a small, representative slice of upstream data (e.g., ≤10k rows per table) that we own as stable dev views/tables.* **Test:** A direct copy of prod to validate that everything truly works, including edge cases.* **Prod:** Point to upstream prod as usual.Does this approach make sense? How do teams typically handle downstream dev/test when upstream data is constantly changing?Related question: schema changes. Upstream tables aren’t versioned, and schema changes aren’t always communicated. When that happens, our pipelines either silently miss new fields or break outright. Is this common? What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?",

        "content": "Afternoon folks, long time lurker, first time poster. I have spent some time recently getting up to speed with different ways to work with data in/out of Apache Iceberg and exploring different analytics tools / visualisation options. I use Cloudflare a lot for my side projects, and have recently seen the 'Beta' data platform products incl. the idea of https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/. So, I decided to give it a go and see if I can build a real end to end data pipeline (the example is product analytics in this case but you could use it for other purposes of course). I hope the link to my own project is OK, but it's MIT / open source: https://github.com/cliftonc/icelight.My reflections / how it works:\\- Its definitely a beta, as I had to re-create the pipelines once or twice to get it all to actually sync through to R2 ... but it really works! \\- There is a bit of work to get it all wired up, hence why I created the above project to try and automate it. \\- You can run analytics tools (in this example DuckDB - https://duckdb.org/) in containers now and use these to analyse data on R2. \\- Workers are what you use to bind it all together, and they work great. \\- I think (given zero egress fees in R2) you could run this at very low cost overall (perhaps even inside the free tier if you don't have a lot of data or workload). No infrastructure at all to manage, just 2 workers and a container (if you want DuckDB). \\- I ran into quite a few issues with DuckDB as I didn't fully appreciate that its single process constraints - I had always assumed it was actually a real server - but actually it seems to now work very well with a bit of tweaking, and the fact it is near Postgres capable but running on parquet files on R2 is nothing short of amazing. \\- I have it flushing every minute at the moment to R2, not sure what this means longer term but will send a lot more data at it over coming weeks and see how it goes. Happy to talk more about it if anyone is interested in this, esp. given Cloudflare is very early into the data engineering world. I am in no way affiliated with Cloudflare, though if anyone from Cloudflare is listening I would be more than happy to chat about my experiences :D",

GCP + Databricks), or keep a broader skill set across multiple tools, and are certifications worth it at this stage?Any feedback is appreciated, especially from people who moved from legacy/enterprise stacks into modern data platforms.",

I've been in my most recent role for 3 years and I realised at about the 2 year mark that I was about as senior as I could get in my team and was not learning anything new - simply applying my extensive experience/knowledge on the field to providing solutions/analyses for stakeholders.That realisation combined with a live demonstration from Snowflake on the agentic future of analysis got me looking for the next logical career step. There is a data engineering secondment opportunity in my org that will likely be made permanent, so I really need to knuckle down and decide.Over the last year, the most enjoyment that I've had has not been when providing any insights, but in building data models for reports and in creating small tools using Streamlit/Python to help stakeholders/team members self-serve and reduce friction. The tool-building component is what I found the most enjoyment in because it was all new with a steep/rapid learning curve. Creating the actual permanent BI reports is also interesting and rewarding, but less engaging because there's generally less of a problem to solve there. What does everyone find the most engaging about their role in data engineering?I don't actually have any formal training or experience in working in an ITIL system as I've always operated under a merchandising/marketing team structure, so I'm not sure at all how I'd go with a more rigid structure and more rigid processes. Has anyone moved in a similar fashion from a more \"fast and loose\" team to a more structured/process-heavy team? What are the pros/cons there?And finally, what does everyone find the most frustating about data engineering? From my brief exposure to the teams that handle it, I imagine that it would be stuff like; undocumented data sources and trying to find the correct joins, validation and constant data quality checks, getting clear answers from a BA on the requirements so that you can create an efficient schema/model.",

I'm thinking of creating the user-day summary table first and building user metrics and daily metrics on top of that, all being incremental models. Is this a good approach?2. I might need to add new metrics to the user-day summary down the line, and I want it to be easy to: a) add these metrics and apply them historically and b) apply them to dependencies along the DAG also historically (like the user\\_metrics table). How would this be possible efficiently?3. Is there some material I could read especially related to building models based on event-based data for product analytics?",

Everything is working as intended but I am confused about how to truncate and insert daily loads. I have a schema for the 25 tables and how they fit together but I'm unsure how to read it from an ingestion standpoint. It works by the main tables loading 45 past dates and 45 future dates every day. So I can remove that time chunk in the truncate task and then reinsert it with the merge task using streams for each. The other tables \"fork\" out from here with extra details to do with those events.What I'm unsure of is how to interact with data that is removed from the system, since this doesn't show up in the streams. Ie, a staff time sheet from 2 weeks ago gets changed to +30 minutes or something. In the extremity tables, there is no dates held within.If I run a merge task using the stream from that days ingestion, what do I use as the target for truncate tasks?What is the general thought process when trying to understand how the schema fits together in regards to inserting and streaming the data rather than just making models?Thanks for the help!",

Finally, I need to chunk all the .md files correctly so that they can be used with our future chatbot.I've created a Python script with Claude to chunk several files into a doc; it works on my local LLM and LanceDB but... I don't know if what I'm doing is correct or if it respects standard layouts (is my YAML correct, things like that). I want my data base to can be \"futur proof\" and completely standard for later use.I'm not sure if my question is appropriate here, but I would be grateful for any tips to help with this kind of data management. It’s more about knowing where to start than having a complete solution at the moment.Thanks ! :) EDIT :  For the moment, it's only for theoretical knowledge; there is no mention of our client info.

        "author": "SmallAd3697",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have built data engineering solutions (with spark) in HDInsight, Azure Synapse, Databricks, and Fabric.Sometimes building a solution will go smoothly; and other times I cannot even connect to my remote resources. In Fabric the connectivity can be very frustrating. They have a home-grown networking technology that lets spark notebooks connect to Azure resources. The interface is called \"Managed Private Endpoints\" (MPE). It is quite different than connecting via normal service endpoints (within a VNET). This home-grown technology used to be very unreliable and buggy; but about a year ago it finally became about as reliable as normal TCP/IP (albeit there is still a non-zero SLA for this technology, that you can find in their docs.)The main complaint I have with MPE's is that Microsoft is required to make them available on a \"onesie-twosie\" basis for each and every distinct azure resource that you want to connect to! The virtualized networking software seems like it must be written in resource-dependent way.Microsoft had asked Synapse customers to move to Fabric a couple years ago, before introducing many of the critical MPE's. The missing MPE's have been a show-stopper, since we had previously relied on them in Synapse. About a month ago they FINALLY introduce a way to use an MPE to connect our spark workloads to our private REST APIs (HTTP with FQDN host names). That is a step forward, although the timing leaves a lot to be desired.There are other MPE's that are still not available. Is anyone aware why network connectivity doesn't get prioritized at Microsoft? It seems like such a critical requirement for data engineers to connect to our data!! If I had to make guess, these delays are probably for non-technical reasons. In this SaaS platform Microsoft is accustomed to making a large profit on their so-called \"gateways\" that move data to ADF and Dataflows (putting it into Fabric storage). Those data-movement activities will burn thru a ton of our CU credits ... whereas making a direct connection to MPE resources is going to have a much lower cost to customers. As always, it is frustrating to use a SaaS where the vendor puts their own interests far above those of the customer. Is there another explanation for the lack of MPE network connectivity into our azure tenant?",

I want the events emitted from Glue ETL jobs during regular pollung operations. We only have about 500 jobs running a day, and so I’m not sure large, expensive tooling is justified.I also considered using lambda to write these events to S3. This seems like overkill too, because it’s a whole lambda boot and process per event. Not sure if this is unsafe for some reason as well, or if it risks corruption due to (e.g.,) non-serialized event processing?What have you done in the past? Should I just bite the bullet and introduce Flink to the ecosystem? Should I just accept Lambda as a solution? Is there something I’m missing, instead?Ive considered Marquez as well, but I don’t want to host the service just yet. Right now, I want to start preserving events so that I have the history available for once I’m ready to consume them.",

        "content": "I’m trying to decide what to learn next to make myself more competitive in my job search and would love some feedback. After \\~5 years of professional experience, I think there are two main areas where my background is weaker than what a lot of current data engineering roles expect:1. Cloud – I have some foundational certs in Snowflake and Azure, but no real hands on professional cloud experience. My previous roles were mostly on-prem.2. Common industry standard tools – Things like Spark, Airflow, and dbt, which show up constantly in job descriptions.I’m looking at a couple of learning paths that would be pretty time-intensive, so I’m trying to pick what will give me the most ROI. Right now I’m debating between:1. Going deeper on cloud with a data engineering focused cert (leaning toward the AWS Data Engineer cert to diversify beyond Azure/Snowflake).2. Spending time learning Spark and Airflow (or similar other tools) and building a realistic ETL pipeline I can put in a public repo—possibly even deploying it in the cloud with a real cluster as second step.For a bit more context: I’m targeting mid level IC roles. I’m confident in my Python and SQL and feel good on data fundamentals (currently reading *Fundamentals of Data Engineering* as a refresh/gap fill). I’ve been getting some interviews, but mostly with companies that don’t yet have data engineers or don’t fully understand the role. Ideally, I’m trying to land somewhere with an established data team and the chance to learn from more senior engineers.Which would you prioritize first? Or is there something else you’d recommend focusing on instead?",

And you don't have to search around trying to find repos or youtube videos giving you personal project ideas. There is already is massive library of built ideas you can look at, the chrome extension web store!! For example:* Security (input sanitation, rate limiting, actual useful cache management). * Cloudflare, which can be useful for several of the above (they have many great COMPLETELY FREE products available).* Performance and the value of keeping your bundle size small.* Also non-tech skills like competitive research, marketing, consistent branding, etc.* Bonus points if you use a framework like [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) to make your extension available on Firefox.* Setting clear acceptance criteria / deliverables and completing them within a timeline. * Added bonus: chrome/cloudflare give you a bunch of data/analytics about usage for free, which can be extremely gratifying to see real people logging in and using your tool.I've been there, building personal projects to bolster your resume can be a hard and sometimes exhausting task.

This of course clashes against the principle of \"comments should explain why something is there and not what it's doing\".Many open source projects I see, from my perspective, have little to no code comments where I think they would help. I understand the point of self-documenting code but if a few comments would have sped up comprehension rate by 3x then what would be the harm?The only strong counter-agument I could think of against lots of comments is that it could be used as a crutch to write bad code but I'm not sure.I guess the most extreme form of my question would be \"what would be the harm for a project to have many useless comments if we can just quickly skip over them?\"",

The issue I ran into was that the \"docs\" if you can even call them that are so confusing and the code just doesn't work with my stack, cause my stack is react, typescript, nextjs and I chose the setup for nextjs and it was all code in js so in my mind I was thinking I could just easily fix the type issues and that was going to be it but it didn't work like that, there were no type issues it was other errors that there docs had no help with. So how am I supposed to fix this when with API's its not like other problems with crud where its usually just giving the issue to you, like every website I look at to setup stripe its completely different code across all those websites. So what I'm trying to ask is how do you learn API's cause googling has done nothing for me, and I've used AI to try to help me and gotten nowhere cause I've heard that somehow stripe is one of the easiest API's for beginners to work with. I've also heard that all API's have the same structure so getting over that initial learning hurdle is the hardest but how true is that?",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Before you read this is just my experience from using Codecademy as a $200 a year paying user (https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/penguingnop). I probably will get flamed for this.. and it's fine. My view is probably shared with like 10 people or whatever.So I subscribed to Codecademy's $200 a year Pro plan in September of 2025, I excited to learn React and backend technologies. And before subscribing a few days later, I did some free courses and thought they were decent. But when I finished the Lua course, I realized I didn't learn loops.. Like who the hell teaches Lua without loops? (Maybe when you're reading this there was a new update)But I brushed it off thinking, \"Hey, it's probably because it's a free coursee\", though I was disappointed.After subscribing, I started taking their React course and felt completely lost. Like why this scaffold/file system? Why was I suddenly dropped into a dir with files that aren't even jsx? But I did spend a few more hours on it.. and I gave up. The biggest problem I have with this is that the course teaches React v18 to people **NEW to coding**, but why would a new dev want to learn outdated React? Another big issue is that they don't use modern standards like Vite. Like they use some custom project structure, how is that supposed to benefit learners? It also doesn’t use Vite, or even explain how `index.html`, `app.jsx`.. I mean, `app.js` work. New learners are dropped into a dated custom structure with near zero context. And if it wasn't clear what the issue was:- Teaching React v18, which is 4 years outdated- Not explaining the files or file system- (Personally) Not using modern build tools like Vite, and scaffold like create@viteI then tried the Frontend Career Path, hoping it would make me much better at frontend. I stopped at 29%. The teaching style felt like multiple concepts crammed into single lessons, and outdated YouTube videos from like 4+ years ago. Like, at least use a good camera, mic, and lighting for tutorials, and keep them updated. Most, if not all videos I saw were low quality laptop recordings with crap audio, spoken from heart, crap webcam, and an unconvincing tone. The tone feels like they're at gunpoint forced to sound happy. It's just so depressing.After quitting the frontend path, I tried the backend path. It was slightly better since the JavaScript was ES6+.. sometimes because they still use `require()`. It shouldn't matter though since it's just JavaScript... except they teach backend tools that've evolved a lot since they made the course. if anyone completed the course, it'll be like a kid who traveled back in time to learn what was \"modern\" in that time, NodeJS 17 and whatever ExpressJS they had, by the time the kid comes back to the present day, he'll see that tons of things has changed. And paying $200 a year for outdated content feels terrible. And that money matters to me, 200 is a lot even if it's just yearly.I've sent a few emails to support, but the replies are all the same generic response from Colleen:```Thank you so much for sharing your feedback! We're constantly working to improve our curriculum based on the feedback that we receive from our customers. I'll be sure to pass along your note to the curriculum team for review.```I'm not sure if Colleen is coping and pasting emails or actually doing anything. When I get responses like this, I feel like they don't give a damn. It feels like the engineers and people over at Codecademy are either lazy or barely working.I regret the purchase, worst of all I have to go through support to get a refund, but after multiple identical replies from Colleen about 'passing feedback along,' I have absolutely NO confidence in getting a refundThis whole experience has demotivated me. When I subscribed, I had light and excitement in my eyes. Now I'm so demotivated that I'm starting to think about others who might feel the same.So.. to end this, here's my advice to Codecademy: Keep courses updated, invest in engineers wellbeing, get a proper studio for tutorials, and make coding fun again. People who come to you rely on you, so it is your responsibility to make sure what they learn is updated, well paced and not cramming 10 topics in a lesson, and not \"AI INTERVIEW!!!\"I'm probably the first to say this, and probably one of the very few who feel this way..And to anyone reading this, please share your story. I'd love to hear from you and I'll try my best to comment on your experience or just \"comments\"",

I tried automated tests that validate openapi specs against endpoints but that broke constantly when people changed response formats. One team even hired a technical writer specifically for api docs and she quit after 6 months because keeping up was impossible.The worst is when external partners email saying your docs say this endpoint returns X but it actually returns Y and I have to admit yeah sorry our docs are wrong, or when new devs join and spend days confused because the docs describe an api that hasn't existed in that form for 8 months.Some companies seem to have this figured out, like stripe's docs are always perfect. How do they do it? Is it just throwing money at the problem or is there some system that actually works for keeping API docs synced with reality?",

What I generally find is that I have the right idea, I am just not implementing code in the correct order, or I miss something basic that feels like a 'duh' moment. My question: As a beginner, is it more important that I understand why my code isn't working after looking at the solutions, rather than being able to solve the problem myself? Should I spend more time trying to resolve these problems? I feel like, as someone starting out, it would be a waste of time to spend hours stuck, rather than learning from my mistakes.",

I have read the crafting interperters book and tbh the implementation of creating files on the go doesn't really look that appealing (might just be me tho).

Now before this I was fine learning Python and honestly it was kind of fun making basic scripts and mini-games. But now, the past two weeks I have basically been bashing my head against the wall with web development. The barrier to entry level is very high for a beginner like me. I usually approach youtube tutorials to always get ahead, to 'dissect' them and break them down whenever I don't understand it to the fundamentals. What I wasn't prepared for was the huge amount of studying, like web architecture, learning other languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, full stack development, APIs, Databases, Flask, Bootstrap and all of this Web Dev jargon I never knew about before I stepped into this. The point is, I've spent 80% of my time basically studying on paper everything, and 20% actually coding anything for like the past 2 weeks.I expected a level of frustration but these days it's been a test of will and patience. It's become suffocating having to sit on my desk for two to three hours everyday for the past two weeks, and not feel a sense of progress towards my goal. I'm constantly learning without a way to practice or test the limits of that knowledge. And when things go wrong in a way I don't understand (like a bug), in a language I have no control or little knowledge over, it's very difficult to fix without feeling angry or lost.So my question is, did I overestimate myself here and skipped a few too many steps approaching web dev? I still want to at least make a basic CRUD web app, this is one of my primary goals. What do I do now?",

I originally did this to support LeetCode practice. I've recently decided that I want to do backend engineering .Right now, I'm trying to maximize my chances of getting a job postgrad. With Python, I can start backend development immediately using a framework like FastAPI or Django and focus on learning backend concepts rather than spending time learning a new language and its syntax.My main question is whether Python plus a backend stack is still a solid path to a backend engineering role without significantly limiting opportunities. If Python meaningfully limits backend roles, I'm open to switching now to something like Java. However, if Python is still viable, sticking with it would let me make faster progress since I wouldn't need to relearn syntax and tooling. I'd appreciate any advice on whether sticking with Python or switching languages would be the best move given my situation.",

A display server has nothing to do with networking: it is the name of the program in Linux that allows you to write code using a graphics library (qt, gtk) instead of directly making OS calls to draw raw pixels on the screen. Linux without a display server is still capable of drawing on a screen. Just try installing raspberry pi os lite and then plugging it into a monitor, you will still get output.\\- So I want to learn how to make linux system calls and learn C by working through two advanced books, culminating in a project where I make a simple game that only uses direct system calls and writes directly to the screens frame buffer, pixel by pixel, for output.My experience:\\- 15 years of hobby programming, mostly C# and Python.\\- Have finished a few games in godot. Nothing to write home about\\- Maintain my own simple, static, website with a simple email form.\\- I have done some C++ (out of practice, if i was ever actually in practice) and I am not terrified of pointers.My want: Create a graphical Missile Command clone on a headless linux installation, using only system calls, the C library, and possibly some GPU thing (opengl, vulkan) if applicable without a display server/actually necessary.My plan:1) Learn C by working through Modern C (Jens Gustedt)2) Learn Linux programming by working through System Programming in Linux (Stewart Weiss)3) Build the missile command clone.My questions:\\- Does this goal sound feasible for someone with no CS degree and barely any math (trig can be hard)?\\- If so, is this a good plan to get to the goal?\\- What would you change or add?",

It’s called Kuse Cowork — an experimental, local-first AI cowork / agent workspace inspired by Claude Cowork, but with a different set of tradeoffs.The core idea is simple: BYOK by default (your own API keys or local models like Ollama / LM Studio), a pure Rust agent backend, local files stay local, and commands run in isolated Docker containers. It’s cross-platform via Tauri (macOS / Windows / Linux), supports extensible “skills” for real workflows (docs, PDFs, spreadsheets), and has MCP built in for tool integration. No hosted inference, no proxying — everything runs on your machine.It’s still early and pretty rough in places, so I’m mostly sharing this to get feedback. Does this approach to local agent workspaces make sense? Are skills / MCP the right abstraction, or is this over-engineered? Any obvious security or UX red flags?

I’ll keep details anonymized.- Junior software engineer- one year of experience- currently at a 60 people cybersecurity startup- in a team of just me and intern and ceo who manages us but is absent for the most of the time. (there is no technical mananger who checks our work.)I accidentally ran a destructive command (rm -rf) on a live production server and it wiped the application/services. (I thought I was in a test directory, but it turns out I was in the root folder when I ran this command) This is a non-critical system (news aggregation site for enterprise customers which get 50 views) and thankfully there is no user/customer data involved and the core product is mostly unaffected by this. Here’s the situation:- No backups or snapshots (confirmed by IT/infra)- No practical recovery path (IT says restore is not possible)- Production drifted from git (repo is outdated vs what was actually running) Turns out people have been working on the live server without commiting anything on git- Access controls were weak (multiple people had access; no guardrails/approvals except ssh'in into the server)- Knowledge transfer/runbooks are incomplete, so “what exactly was on prod” is fuzzy. Current plan: rebuild using the outdated git repo as the baseline. That likely means we can get a working version back, it would be extremely outdated and all the work we did since then will be lost.My manager, who also happens to be the CEO of this company, is extremely upset and said he’s “never seen anything like this in his 20 years as an IT person,” and is threatening termination and potential legal action if it isn’t recovered. I know I made a serious mistake. I’m trying to focus on restoration for now (We are 50 percent complete)Most importantly, how do I cover myself legally? Any advice",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Yesterday, a major company reached out to me on LinkedIn asking if I'd be interested in having a chat about a role they were hiring for. We had a 20 minute screening call which went well, but I was on the fence about it due to the tech stack and the requirement to always work from their office (train journey for me while I'm fully WFH in my current job).At the end of the call, I was told to expect an email that would outline the next steps in the process. I opened the email and saw that I was required to complete two HackerRank assessments.I immediately decided just to withdraw myself from consideration for the role. I spend my time building software, developing games and properly improving my abilities and experience as an engineer and as an architect of high-quality software. I don't have time to grind HackerRank challenges, and why should I? It's a terrible indicator of someone's ability as an engineer, and I've reached a point in the job hunt where I just can't bring myself to sit through these pointless algorithm challenges (that'll never be used in the role) anymore. I also consider it to be a bit of a red flag - if they're evaluating candidates through their ability to memorize algorithm challenges, I don't think that bodes well for the quality of their engineering teams.I sent a message on LinkedIn saying:Hi [Redacted], I've decided to withdraw myself from consideration for the role. I feel that HackerRank assessments don't align with my approach to software engineering. As I build my career, I’m looking to join a team that evaluates talent through real-world tasks and the approach they take to solving problems. Thank you for your time, I hope you're able to find the right candidate for the role. Regards,[Redacted]Has anyone else reached this point? Anyone else just outright refusing to participate in such a hiring process? I'm not sure how much this will limit my options, and I may well be forced to swallow the pill and revoke my stance, but I felt it was the right thing to do. I told a couple of colleagues about it and the consensus was \"good for you\", and that they wouldn't complete them either - but they're further along in their career (senior level), while I've been in the industry for 3 years full-time (and 2 years part-time while at university).TLDR; Refusing to do HackerRank challenges during hiring process, can't bring myself to do them anymore. Is anyone else refusing this? What are your thoughts?",

        "author": "philosograppler",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I haven’t posted on this subreddit before, but I’m at a point where I really need some outside perspective on what to do next.I’m based in NYC and I’ve been working as a software engineer for about six years. I originally got into this field because I wanted to learn to code so I could build my own ideas and maybe start something one day, but I haven’t really acted on that goal the way I thought I would.For most of my career I was at a large Fortune 500 company. I was there for five years and then lost my job due to restructuring that turned into mass layoffs. Right after that I traveled a bit and then started job searching. It felt endless. Once I got interview-ready again it still took about six months to land another role.I thought I finally found the perfect fit. It was a hybrid role at a startup events company where I’d be a Senior SWE working across web and mobile. I joined a newly formed AI R&D team as the first hire. Since the team was brand new there was no PM, no designer, and no scrum master, so it was mostly just me working directly with my manager, who had also just been promoted into management.From the beginning things felt messy. Deadlines were vague and product goals kept shifting from sprint to sprint. Then the CEO fired the cofounder, suddenly changed the company from hybrid to mandatory five days a week in-office, and later fired one of the two engineering managers.Not long after that I was let go for “performance reasons,” despite never being put on a PIP. When I try to be honest with myself about what they might be referring to, I can only point to two things. One was the CEO being upset that I was late to an all-hands meeting, but I didn’t even know it was happening because my manager forgot to put it on my calendar when I first joined, so I arrived about 30 minutes late. The other was a deadline to switch our product over to a different API endpoint that supported local testing. My manager wrote the backend for it, but the environment I needed to test in was constantly tied up by other engineers, so I moved onto another priority and that pushed the API switch back.A big part of the frustration is that I was building on top of backend code my manager had basically stitched together quickly, and it didn’t follow basic REST principles. The delay on the API work wasn’t only about me moving slowly. There was technical debt and there were delays and blockers that were out of my control too. I’m not saying I did everything perfectly, but when they let me go and I asked what specifically was wrong, the only answer I got was “poor code quality.” I can’t shake the feeling that once our team started missing deadlines, my manager needed someone to blame, and I ended up being the easiest target for the CEO.I was only there for five months, and getting let go like that has really messed with my confidence and mental health. Now I don’t know what the right move is. Part of me wants to jump back into applying immediately. Another part of me wants to finally take this as a push to work on my own startup ideas. Right after this happened, I swore I’d do everything I could to make sure I could work for myself eventually, but I’m not fully confident I can actually bring one of my ideas to life.On top of that, I have ADHD, and I’ve always had this constant background feeling of underperforming or that I’ve forgotten something important. This whole situation has made that a lot worse, and it’s hard not to spiral into those thoughts.If you’ve been through something like this, how did you decide what to do next? Would you focus on getting back into a stable job first, or would you take a risk and try to build something for yourself?",

I would’ve been okay with everything but recently, one of the higher ups said that they’re tracking how many hours we work in the office, the time we come to the office, the time we leave the office, and there’ll be consequences for everything - which is kind of unreasonable considering that we attend meetings with other regions very early in the morning, work on releases very late at night and respond to incidents and downtimes during the weekends from home. We’ve made this job our life but they make it harder every day and don’t pay us much either.Anyways, I luckily got an interview call from Netflix. It’s a remote role, my pay is going up significantly and everything looks perfect on the surface. So, if someone worked/works over there, how is it really like working remotely as an SDE at Netflix? What’s the catch? Are remote workers more likely to get laid off or get plateaued on their salary growth compared to the ones who go to the office every day? How’s the pay growth like in general on the base salary every year as there’s no bonus? How well do they honor the unlimited paid time off policy? How many vacation days do y’all take every year? How’s the parental leave policy and do they honor it well (my partner and I are planning to have a baby next year)? What do you think about the health insurance they offer? Are there any signs of remote roles becoming fully in-person anytime soon?",

None of the work actually feels that intellectually stimulating rather code X, read documentation, documentation is hot shit so ask devs, dev refers you to someone else, finally get an answer, update doc, test code (which takes hours), run into a failure in testing so I have to restart the process changing something, so on and so forth.I don’t want to leave as this is still a pretty cushy well paying job but I want to learn how you all deal with frustration. I feel like a lot of the work is more annoying than challenging and rarely feel like I am learning something transferable or using logical skills.I have been putting in more effort to have a life outside of work and not expect too much from a job other than money but I still find most of my 9-5 me being confused and annoyed and I get really grumpy afterward.

Called “Today, I did it.” Basically enter within a field different activities you did for the day, run that though an ai api to quantify that action in numbers and spit it back out.

It definitely aligns with how I feel today, because I’ve been in a mental standstill for a long time now, and trying to push throughI guess my ultimate questions are:1. What are my options on getting back on my feet?2. Is programming completely out of the question at this point?3. What fields could I possibly pivot to with a computer science degree?4.

        "content": "I’ve been working as a backend engineer for around 2 years now, and lately I’ve been feeling pretty disengaged.Most of the work feels like *gluing things together*: APIs, ORMs, queues, configs, cloud services, etc. Even when it’s “complex,” it often feels like complexity from coordination rather than depth. I don’t feel like I’m learning fundamental ideas anymore, just new tools and patterns.I tried branching into AppSec thinking it would be deeper, but honestly it felt even more shallow lots of checklists, scanners, and “best practices,” with limited opportunity to really understand systems at a fundamental level (at least in what I’ve seen so far).Now I’m questioning a few things:* Is this just what industry software engineering feels like after the initial learning curve?* Am I just not going deep enough in backend (databases, distributed systems, performance, internals)?* Or should I pivot and focus more on computer science–heavy areas (OS, compilers, networking, databases) either through a role change or serious self-study?I don’t hate programming, but I miss the feeling of wrestling with hard problems instead of wiring services together. Curious if others felt this around the 2–3 YOE mark and what paths helped:* going deeper in backend?* moving to infra / systems / performance?* Masters and Phd (Academia)* or just accepting that most jobs are like this?Would appreciate perspectives from people a few years ahead of me. I come from a third world country so it might be an issue too. I do not see much capable SWE and the problems we are solving is just bs or easy things. Also most SWE have no real depth no cs foundations just vibe coding.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi all,Apple is my dream company and I have been practising very hard for the interviews. I currently work at one of the big banks, graduated from a top 10 CS uni (no 1 in country) and have 2.5 years of professional experience. Life there is good, I get along well with colleagues and we like each other, but my goal has always been to get into a big tech company. The bureaucracy and nature of a bank really stifles engineering i feel, hence my decision to transfer. I simply felt Apple is the pinnacle of engineering standards and I would want to learn from Apple instead.Recently, I had the interview with the hiring manager for the first round and he seemed really disinterested in me early on, but not necessarily from the start. His body language shows it, he would rock his body back and forth. He asked me only resume-focused questions and just asked one simple technical question which i got correct and then ended the interview.I was quite taken aback because when i sit for interviews at the other major tech companies, I had expected a rigorous technical questions but it wasnt the case for Apple which felt really strange to me. Then, yesterday (2 days after my interview) my status on the applications portal showed in the 'Archived' state.To add on some context, I feel it might have been my work experience. I am relatively early in my career but have a few short stints of about 1 year each and I am only 10 months in the bank.Also, in the bank, we dont have root access and i read in big tech they tune kernel parameters for the hyper-scale traffic, use /proc for troubleshooting as it has less overhead and has more info like we can see what version of binary its run, spread out interrupts alongside cores (RSS), etc. So, my Linux professional experience is clearly not stellar tho i know a lot of theory from reading.When i described some stuff to the hiring manager specifically about our disaster recovery process, i am guessing it could feel really different and strange to him that we have to take screenshots and failover abruptly (not canary) and other stuff but that is simply the protocol of the bank.I would appreciate any advice from you all on my situation. If you were an interviewer / hiring manager , why would you behave the way the Apple Hiring Manager did to me during my interview ? I have been very polite throughout but sth about my interview he was probably dissatisfied. Maybe I rambling away or what not ?Thank you to this awesome community in advance and you all have a great week ahead!",

        "content": "As titled. Software engineer with 5 yoe at a unicorn, I've been with my current company for about 2 years now. I had a life-changing event that happened in my family before my graduated. As a result, during the initial couple years of my career, I was very ambitious and set for faang/unicorn level pay. I pushed and pushed and pushed myself, even though I did not want to. I felt like that was when I developed this chronic fatigue and burnout about work. Anyway, I did not stop, until I got into my current company, and I felt satisfied that I got what I wanted.Since then I felt like I got out of survival mode, and somehow without fear, I started hating my job more and more. About a year into my current job, my burnout was so bad, to the point that I couldn't bring myself to work more than 1 hour a day no matter how hard I tried. I sat in front of my laptop during nights and weekends but I could not get any work done, it felt like my brain shut down. I ended up taking a sabbatical for three months. I took the time and travelled to Europe and did not do anything but to spend time with my family for three months.After I came back, everything was so much better. I felt better about work, I was way more productive and I could function as normal. Sure I still didn't like working, but I didn't hate it and I could tell it was different than the period I was burnt out.Fastforward to today, a year from my last sabbatical, I feel like the burnout is slowly creeping back. It's been 2 weeks now and I've been extremely unproductive. I feel like I can't get things into my brain, I can feel that it is similar to the burnout I had last time, but fortunately a bit better. I seriously don't know what to do. My company has good wlb, great engineering culture, tc is a bit above faang level. I feel like I have nothing to complain, yet i hate my body for feeling this way. I think the root cause is that this place is a very fast-paced and high growth company. I don't work long hours by any means, but the work is very challenging and expectations are high. There are pros and cons to this, I feel like my work has meaning, i get rewarded, but sometimes it's very very draining. I feel like it's sucking the life out of me. I don't know what to do. I don't hate CS by any means, but this level of mental efforts does not seem like it's something I wanna do with my life. Maybe I want to coast. Maybe I'm ungrateful, maybe I want the pay but not do the work. i feel like I'm slipping and spiraling a bit downwards mentally.Any advice is appreciated.",

        "author": "LongjumpingPage6168",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, like the title, I don't understand the point of online coding assessments that major companies give on HackerRank, CodeSignal, CodeVue, etc. that we have to do on our own, while being proctored with camera and microphones on. I am OK with technical interviews with another engineer where we can code together and I can communicate my thoughts, processes, and my knowledge while programming. However, what's the point of stupid online assessments that major companies shove down our throats? You tell me that I have to do these proctored online assessments without any access to Internet (I cannot search for syntax or anything related to the coding problems) and I have to program with the camera and microphones on, and I cannot talk or look at anywhere else during the assessment because I'm afraid they would cause me of cheating. No one would hear me communicating my thoughts or processes during coding. And if I cannot pass all test cases within the time limit, I'm automatically eliminated from the hiring process, and my application would be thrown away, all of my past work experiences, skills, and projects I have gained over the years would be useless for them. And even if I pass all the test cases, I can still not move forward due to other reasons.People said that I have to do LeetCode, and I have practiced on my own for years on both LC, HackerRank, CodeSignal,... and solved over 100 problems... I also reviewed all data structures and algorithms again, but at the end, what's the use? Even when doing coding assignments in classes my professors allow us to search online but why cannot I search anything during these stupid assessments? And you know that most of us cannot pass these assessments in this way. So, I fear that even if I do 1000 to 10,000 LC problems the result is still the same, when I know that the companies only care if I pass all the test cases in these coding assessments.And funnily, I got my first part-time web developer job on campus, and my first IT infrastructure internship at a Fortune 500 multi-industry company without any LeetCode-style interviews. Especially in the hiring process for my first internship program, I only had to go through phone screen with a recruiter, and a behavioral interview with the IT manager where we discuss about my projects and past experiences, and within a week, I got hired for the program. But now, I did not get the return offer from the company so I have to do all of these LC over again with no hope.I feel like this is the only thing that fails me to get the full-time career I need after my graduation in May 2026. The other things like resume, networking, communication, interview skills, I am still learning and improving everyday, but these assessments feel hopeless to me. Just thinking about how I can be unemployed after graduation drives me crazy and makes me feel so embarrassed.And I've heard some people said I can skip these assessments with referrals. Is this true? I have friends who are working in these companies and I used to work with some of them, or we had little interactions but we're still in good terms. How do I reach out to them in a professional way to get the referrals? Can someone tell me? I'm out of options.",

        "content": "Inspired by a [previous post](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1or3gyj/my_experience_interviewing_in_2025_with_5_yoe/) from a few months back.Sankey diagram: https://i.imgur.com/sYt3l2y.pngSome terms:* Withdrawn = I withdrew from the process, due to lack of interest for moving forward, or for timing* Rejected = They rejected me and communicated so* Ghosted = They did not respond (either to the initial application or after any rounds had been completed)* Outreach = They reached out to me via email (cold, to my personal inbox) or referral (someone I used to work with connected me with the founder/recruiter)Some tidbits about my profile:* I've worked exclusively at small-to-medium startups, anywhere between Seed and Series C* Based in San Francisco, open to remote or hybrid roles* Current base in the range of 230-250k* Currently employed, with tenure 4 years* Full stack SWE looking for full stack / frontend roles* This is my third time doing a serious job search of this manner.* Total YOE = 7Been at my current company for over 4 years, and looking to leave to find new challenges and more interesting work. Outside of that I was pretty happy at my job and would not have minded if I didn't get any offers (other than the obvious blow to my ego).Almost all of my jobs were applied through Welcome To The Jungle, formerly Otta. I responded to a few recruiter email reachouts, but only if the recruiter worked directly for the company, rather than for a third party. I did not apply to any companies as practice; I only applied to companies that I genuinely wouldn't mind working for and whose salary range was within at least what I was making now, or more.Almost all companies followed a pretty standard process - recruiter call, technical screen, hiring manager screen, onsite. All companies did not ask any leetcode or brainteaser questions (I did my best to filter those companies out). One company had an online assessment before I talked to anyone, and a take-home later in the process that took ~10 hours. I had fun doing the take home and did not mind the time it took.Preparing for my interview was pretty straightforward. Because I was targeting companies with no leetcode, I did not prepare for coding assessments at all. I did well on interviews that required me to write code (save for one, where I flubbed due to a misunderstanding of the problem / incorrect assumption as it was based on a real-life product). For system design, I used the free versions of HelloInterview (I did not pay for membership like the other post), but I did have an existing lifetime membership for GreatFrontEnd for FE system design. I did not find it that useful for the interviews I encountered.For scheduling interviews, the majority of them were scheduled from 6AM-9AM PT (east coast morning), or (2PM-6PM PT) (west coast afternoons), depending on where the company was located.For the companies that I got rejected, I think my weakest area was for sure system design questions, and doing technical deep dives of my work projects. Two of the five companies that rejected me provided detailed feedback, which I appreciated and understood their perspective. Some rejections were purely tactical errors on my part.In the end (just before new years), I accepted a remote role for +20% base, and a lot more equity than my current role. The role I accepted was one where I was most interested in the company anyway; both offers I received were from companies I would've been happy joining. The entire process took a little less than two months from the initial offer being sent, to me accepting an offer.Happy to answer any questions.",

Now, with a wedding and housing goals coming up in 1-2 years, I’ve had a massive wake-up call. I just realized how much these things actually cost, and I feel like a fool for starting so late.I’m deeply regretful of my past negligence, and I’m determined to fix this. I’m ready to grind 20-30 hours a week outside of my main job to hit my savings goal as fast as possible.I’d love to hear from anyone who has successfully made significant money on the side:* Market Reality Check: For a backend dev with 7 YOE, is it realistic to aim for a consistent $2k-$5k/month through side gigs right now? Or is the market too saturated?* Where to look?: I’ve only worked in stable full-time roles, so I’m new to the freelance world. Where can I find high-quality, short-term gigs?* Efficiency: Given my stack (Node, Java, Python), what’s the most \"time-efficient\" way to generate immediate cash flow? Something else?* Life Lessons: What would you say to a 25-year-old who just woke up and realized he’s behind?I’m ready to work harder than ever to make up for lost time. I just want to make sure I’m running in the right direction. Any advice or harsh reality checks would mean a lot. Thanks!",

I’m no longer a SWE and am a Frontend dev coder.But I want to get back on track into truly learning the ins and outs of systems, feel like an engineer againMy question is, where do I go from here?Dice into deep Backend? Go over OS and networking courses again? Build a project and learn on the go? If I do that, what do I learn first? I know for a fact I’ll start with becoming an expert on Linux and terminal (I know terminal but could be much better since my job doesn’t require that much terminal knowledge)But from there onwards, any recommendations as in order and things to learn that will make me go from simple coder to Software engineer that knows exactly what is going on in a complex system?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I could use some grounded advice from people who have been through a reset.I have \\~4 years of experience (mostly Data Engineer / Data + backend-ish work). About 6 months ago I resigned from my last job because I was completely burned out. I did not plan the break well, and honestly I have not done much “serious” productive work since then. Most days have been at home recovering, and going down rabbit holes like tech news, trying new dev tools (Claude Code, Codex, etc.), tinkering, but nothing consistent I can show.Now reality is hitting. I need to land a job in the next few months. The gap is making me anxious, and that anxiety is making me freeze.**Target roles:** Data Engineer / Backend (Python) - most of my work was involved on GCP. **Stack I’ve worked with:** GCP (BigQuery, Dataflow, Pub/Sub, Vertex AI, Cloud Storage), MLflow, Python + SQL, streaming + batch pipelines, CI/CD.I know the default answer is “grind LeetCode + system design”, and I am doing some of that. But I feel like I’m missing something important about how to restart properly.I’d really appreciate advice on things like:* If you took a break or had a gap, what helped you come back and get hired?* Should I focus on DE roles again or pivot to backend/SWE? (I’m open, but I want the fastest path to employability.)* What’s a realistic plan for the next 8–12 weeks that actually improves interview outcomes?* What do recruiters/hiring managers in India care about most when they see a 6 month gap?* Any suggestions for 1–2 “resume-worthy” projects that are actually useful (not a toy) and can be finished quickly?If it helps: I’m not trying to make excuses. I messed up the structure of the break, and I own that. I just want a clean plan and honest feedback from people who have done it.Thanks in advance.",

        "content": "I graduated 2 years ago, unsure and lost about what I was supposed to do with my life. I finished my senior year a semester late, because of an event that happened which caused me to detach myself from reality and I couldn't lock back into myself, so I ended up with a bunch of D's that year. I lost my ambition and was basically a zombie, and I didn't really know what I was supposed to do with my degree anymore. This past year I've gradually gained back my confidence enough to get back to reality and reach acceptance. As a result my feelings of ambition came back. Since I've graduated I've been doing low intensity code annotation for a company but now I want more, i.e. I want to build and engineer things instead of just evaluating code. I wasn't paying attention to what the industry is like while I was working so I have no idea if this work is valuable to the software engineer market, and I'm afraid it's not as I didn't work in a dedicated frontend/backend structure. My internship experience also seems really obscure. Since I'm 2 years removed from graduation doing a non software engineering role, can someone tell me if I'm out of the game regarding software engineering?

        "content": "hi all,I recently started a new job at a company with a poor reputation. As a May 2025 grad who was becoming increasingly desperate for a foothold, I intended to keep this job for a year or two before leaving for something better, but I am staying with family nearby and commuting (1-1.5hr one-way commute) for the time being.I am still in “training”, but I have been finding myself feeling increasingly isolated. The relatives I am staying with are distant and I miss home and my immediate family, but I don’t think that this is just homesickness (I attended college a similar distance from my hometown). I am spending 8 hours of the day in a windowless office doing training clearly intended for someone with less experience than me. It is becoming more clear to me that the work that I will be doing after training will not be at all engaging and there is very little collaboration between my teammates. I don’t believe that there is much opportunity for growth. Additionally, I am not only the only woman on my team, but I have not met a single other woman in my (admittedly short) time working here.Some of this is certainly just what you get in software, but normally when people talk about feeling lonely at work, it has to do with the WFH environment. I am on-site, and the demands of on-site and the particular location of the company (along with the below-standard pay) have made it hard for me to justify doing anything to shorten my commute as around half of my net pay would go to rent/utilities.I am heavily considering leaving this position and finding temporary employment in my hometown to fill the gap and have some money while I figure out what I want to do. I’m not really sure what I am looking for here. I guess I am just venting and looking for validation and advice. I know that I should be grateful to have a swe job in this market but if this is what swe jobs are I’m not sure that I want them.",

Overall, the distribution of talent didn’t seem any different from my own team, which made me wonder whether an internal transfer might be more realistic than I initially thought.I’ll be starting on an AI-related (but non-research) team in a different product area. The office I’m joining has a fairly strong GDM presence.I did CS with Math in undergrad with a focus on probabilistic ML, and I have one publication in a top AI journal (not first author).For folks who’ve seen or gone through this process:* How rare are internal transfers to GDM? Do you need to be absolutely exceptional?* Beyond strong feedback in my current role, what tends to matter most? * Internal ML work (e.g., 20% project with GDM) * Being active in research communities again * Kaggle or other ML side projects * Internal networking and referralsAny advice & anecdotes would be really appreciated.

The last job took me 400 apps in 2021 so I already know this isn't that many applications considering the current market. I’ve mainly been applying on LinkedIn and have been using Simplify to fill out applications.I realize I’m slowly falling apart because there’s a lot going on in my mind. I honestly feel like I’m not even that great of a developer yet. I spent so much time trying to rush my degree and focused on sending applications that I realized I’ve started to get worse at coding. I’m considering pursuing an OMSCS through Georgia Tech, but I’m not sure if a master’s degree is worth it right now. It would allow me to learn more, possibly specialize in ML/AI, and apply for internships. Admittingly it would also allow me to redirect my mental burden of job apps towards something else. On the other hand I might be spending more time and money for little to no difference.Typing this out I realize I should probably at least spend my time re-learning some of the things I’ve forgotten while building out some more projects. If anyone has any insight or a different job search approach they’d recommend I’d really appreciate it. I’m not too sure which job boards I should rely on outside of LinkedIn and I’m a little hesitant to use AI auto-apply resources.Added my resume below for review: [Resume](https://i.imgur.com/ZGPCMja.png)",

What they offered is OK, 80K doing Software Dev as well as Business Analyst at a 60/40 split according to them. I am anticipating on countering with 90K. The issue is that I am interviewing for a position tomorrow for a job that is paying out the gate 90K and its remote + works with a stack that is more familiar to me. The first job is about 25 miles away, a 35-55 min commute. I'm worried this will add miles on my new car quick, plus the commute during rush hour will be longer.If my interview with the second company goes well, I am considering asking for a time extension for the offer I received from the first company. However I know that even with a 2-3 day extension, say next week Wednesday, I probably wont have an offer with the second company even if I complete all the interviews by that time. I am wondering what my options are here. Can I do any of the following?1. Indicate to the second company that I have a pending job offer from another job, and if there is any flexibility on accelerating the next steps.2. Sign the agreement with the first company, and should the second company offer me a deal, rescind the offer with the first company and sign with the second company.The hiring team for the first company was really nice and supportive and I hope I'm not stabbing them in the back by rescinding my offer.",

For pre-sales you have a solutions engineer which shows customers what’s technically possible in order to help close the deal. And then you have the forward deployed engineer (controversial title) for post sales which works with high ticket customers to ensure integration and prevent churn. Post-sales sounds more interesting to me, but keen to get some real insights from anyone who’s worked in these positions.",

Now, the following might sound extremely stupid/naive, but this is how I imagine this would go, please correct me if I am wrong, and give your suggestions:I was thinking of training a couple of models locally on my PC, gradually increasing parameters and complexity as I observe how emergence appear. From what I read online, even smaller models can be useful as long as you don't expect them to know human language / how to talk. I sort of believe the future is in understanding how emergent behavior occurs and what the thresholds for it are, and I would like to study that more. I would like to explore continual learning.

I've always been very efficient at work, minimizing distractions when thinking about a problem, focusing on one task at a time, and, I know this will be unpopular, but the integrated AI assistants have really sped up my productivity as well. I know there's the whole debate about \\_vibe coding\\_, but I use AI to generate code for parts of the app whose functionality I already know and giving it a prompt just makes the process faster, or if I don't know that part of the app, I ask it to do some research first. It makes mistakes most of the time, but even giving it prompts and then steering it to correct them or correcting them myself is faster than doing it all from scratch.

I'm a pretty risk averse person, so I've just thinking about what would happen in the case that we get in YC, but ultimately find some flaw in our idea or some obstacle down the line which causes us to fail. Coming from a low-income household, the thought of being unemployed because of a reckless risk terrifies me.I'm really trying to grow some balls here and convince myself why it's a good idea to go all-in on the startup (if we get in).

I studied Java and python in school. I use SQL and develop rule code at my job. I also deploy the code to the site and QA it, share results, etc at my job.I feel like the lack of years of professional experience like 2,4,6 for mid level are biting me for development experience.

I'm willing to be at work full time for the role. options I am considering;1. get a masters in devops... feels like this could solve that problem? higher in demand and gets me into the \"masters\" groups to potentially get more interviews.2. pay for an ai resume service to manipulate my resume for me to get better key words to land interviews.3. learn more languages?4. volunteer code to get equivalent experience? is that a thing? cann I claim I have 2 years of java experience if I volunteer on a project for two years?5. any suggestions from y'all to help.thanks for taking the time to read. btw I'm applying internally too and I don't get interviews bc they want people more experienced.I might be totally missing the mark here, appreciate all feedback and advice.",

I have decided for myself that I will stick with my passions for SWE but I'd love to get some advice or hear some other people's opinions.For some background, I'm a junior in a university that is not the best for CS and I have had 0 internships so far. My dreams were to be a SWE ever since I started coding in highschool in 2022.My second semester in college (2024) I started doing research with a CS professor that I liked and have continued it ever since. During my time at university, I also developed and published a Google Chrome extension, mainly to make life easier, and also a VSCode extension, for my professor's research.I also love using Django and have built several full stack web apps (although mainly CRUD). But, I have never deployed something other than on a web service platform like Vercel, Onrender, or Heroku. I'm aware that most of the web apps I build are not scalable and will most likely break if more than 1,000 requests hit an endpoint at once. I also know some things like CI/CD or unit tests are very important for real world projects but I've always thought those things are experiences gained at an internship.I have started applying to internships ever since I was a sophomore and I also attended a career fair last year in the spring. I only started keeping track at the start of my junior year and so far I have more or less applied to 150 intern positions. Only had 2 companies (one small, one medium sized) reach out after for an interview after the OA, but I most likely bombed both because there were no responses after. I know AI is having a big impact on the job market and there are also layoffs happening in tech companies, but I also know several people who still landed internships at Meta and even Google.So, I just wanted to know if anybody could recommend some strategies to stand out more as an applicant or just give some basic advice on my next steps.

I’ve been there 2 years. It’s full time WFH. The benefits are buns and pay could definitely be higher but many of my cs friends are getting laid off frequently and the interview process sucks as I’ve tried to get another job here and there but have been unsuccessful and draining.

Took me 7 months to find FTE after graduation and it was until I successfully got an offer last year with a decent modest six figure entry level wage in the bay area.But as time went on. This organization is messy, while flatter, it means my direct manager has lots and dozens of reports and oversees the infrastructure group comprised of 4-5 teams of 4-5 people that are almost siloed away from each other. The Python software architecture project work that I do doesn't even correlate with any of my coworkers' work because they manage VM/server infrastructure and windows administration/dev ops/click ops.My role got a little more defined when I was handed a Django application and 20 affiliated hardware servers and was told to fix it alone by myself. There is no cloud in this role. All the web servers, databases, and load balancers servers I had to setup, update, and reconfigure by myself. In 4 months, I shipped a working feature end to end using Copilot/Claude for documentation and architectural design reviews; boilerplating the code and then let me apply the specific automated workflow needed to make it work for our use case. I completely revamped the frontend UI with modern look as well and completely overhauled the original design to process requests quicker by creating a more efficient queuing system.Plus, in Q1 this month I am handed a new Django project to develop and test with (finally) 1 or 2 more developers which should be a better experience.Despite the mess and lack of structure, I own the first app now and it's my responsibility and I don't plan on leaving within the short term since I haven't yet met my 1 year mark, I am trying to at least make it to my 2nd or 3rd year to maximize learning and salary.The only other Django developers are on another team under my manager but I specifically have to reach out to them if I ever want help from them. But so far, AI is my savior for a lot of issues.I feel like I am growing a lot using the terminology like design patterns and microservices I learned in school/internships, and applying it to what I develop in my role even if it's essentially a bus factor I am making for the organization.My manager knows I am independent on this too and he knows I am going to be swamped this and next quarter. And he and I are trying our hardest to make sure I get the support I need when I need it.Though the performance review cycle ends really soon and I think I did a hell of a job but we'll see if I get that 5-6% raise.So far, I am enjoying the experience being employed and funding my travel goals this year.",

I completely missed the cloud boat and now the AI race because of the kind of jobs I had and just not paying attention in general. I have a bunch of other knowledge/experience - Tableau/PowerBI, SQL, basic DevOps, etc. - all of which usually comes with setting up .NET solutions. I tried my hand at Product Owner/Product Manager short stints at my company but that doesn't go anywhere with hiring freeze and budget cuts. I am looking to stick to my technical roots and gain some experience in Cloud (AWS since that's what my company uses) and AI implementations by implementing my ideas.I have been looking into AWS designing an app that I am trying to build. For AI, I don't even know where to begin. Do I pay attention to things such as Claude Code and Cursor? Where do I start with them? I prefer learning the details of any technology I want to work with before picking up such tools but they seem to be becoming mainstream and my company has released restricted versions of Claude/Nova chatbots which are amazing when prompted correctly but my knowledge outside of that is zero.Please roast me asl to how much of deep trouble I am in and what I can do to improve my skills.",

        "content": "I built a CGPA planning site for my university that shows your current semester GPA, projected cumulative CGPA, and “what if” simulations. You pick a course and change the expected grade, swap grades between courses, or mark a course as retaken, and it instantly recalculates whether you can reach a target CGPA or honors cutoff and what grades you’d need in the remaining credits. It also highlights which retakes give the biggest CGPA lift and catches common mistakes like wrong credit counts.To avoid manual entry it pulled grades by logging into the student portal and scraping the data, and it grew to about 3000 users. When the portal switched to heavier redirects I used Selenium to keep the login flow working. Later the university added CAPTCHA and warned against automated access, so I stopped the scraping and made the server down. Security wise, I tried to be strict: I didn’t store passwords, I used HTTPS, limited logs, and deleted any temporary transcript files immediately after parsing. I also kept the heavy “what if” calculations client side so the server didn’t keep sensitive data around or hammer the university systems.Should I talk about this in interviews or leave it off? If I mention it, how do I frame it without looking like someone who ignores security boundaries?",

        "content": "hey yall - posting for a bit of career advice. not really sure where to start so I'll give the rundown. I'm a mid-lvl fullstack SWE at a mid-sized, pre-ipo company - 5 yoe total. Went to a bootcamp back in 2019 and switched into SWE from non-technical role at same company, been there 7 years total now.my title and salary progression in that time:* non-technical role - 60k (with options, no bonus)* associate eng - 70k (more options, no bonus)* swe 1 - 105k (rsus, no bonus)* swe2 - 115k -> 128k -> 140k -> 155k (rsus, no bonus)as you can see, I've been stuck at mid-lvl for a few years now, despite my gunning for promotion to senior. over the course of the past 2 years, my day to day has become increasingly more technical (involving a lot more system design this past year or so - microservices, API work, etc.) with significantly more responsibility. I wasn't promoted last year like I thought I'd be, but I got rave reviews and have had very candid conversations with management (direct and director lvl) about my future. I'm currently the lead on a pretty significant, high vis project for my group which seems like was a very intentional choice to \"groom\" me into Senior, so to speak. all that to say, this feels like the year it finally happens for me but I really wouldn't know until the summer.I'm trying to weigh the opportunity cost of potentially sticking it out for the 6 or so months and seeing thru my goal of finally cracking senior vs. taking interviews with hopes of being hired as a senior (and ideally a higher salary as a result). given that I got into this field pretty deep into adulthood, I've always kinda felt like I'm trying to cover a lot of ground as quickly as possible (sometimes to my detriment).I interviewed extensively last year from feb-sep, the majority of which were for senior roles that I was turned down for due to not having good system design fundamentals. I'm thinking if I try again this year, given my recent practical system design experience maybe I'll get lucky and finally earn myself the promotion.how should I play my cards?",

I know that there's going to be layoffs here next week, and so I've been preparing to try to find a new job, which hadn't been going too well so far. I'm 60 applications in with 12 rejections and only 3 OAs, and so I figured I'd need to work on my resume by way of projects. At the same time, I've been having trouble figuring out what projects to make. I had a list of ideas (first two were in progress and were originally on my resume):* interactive Rubik’s Cube in THREE.js (and possibly a solver)* Geometry Dash “git” that allows for pushing/pulling of versions of levels multiple users create with between different devices* Ray Tracer, but experimenting with Linux-inspired scheduling strategies to potentially optimize performance in comparison with traditional implementation technique* GameBoy emulator iOS mobile app (using Swift, SwiftUI, Objective-C)* NYC subway map using MTA API for simulating impact of delays on other trains* AI solver with comparison amongst different optimization techniques for score / efficiency* something related to embedded systems and/or systems programming (not sure what yet)I got feedback that they either weren't complex enough to demonstrate technical skills, original enough to be distinguished from what people have already done, practical enough to solve actual problems that people might have and have an impact, or some combination of those. I genuinely couldn't come up with any ideas that actually accounted for all three of these and I couldn't come up with any problems in my life that could be solved with programming a project, so I tried leaning towards using them as learning opportunities that relate to my interests, and planned on switching them out on my resume to fit it for a bigger range job requirements/skills. At the same time as *that* though, I know that experience is a lot more important than projects to recruiters and I did feel like I was starting to get the hang of things with the help of my team at work. But of course, that might not be the case 6 days from now. If it is the case (hoping it is) I was wondering if I could get any advice from anyone for what to do.",

        "content": "TL;DR:Switched 2 months ago from a C++ role (robotics background, ~60% remote) to a government full-stack web dev job to try something new. I earn slightly more and work 4 longer days, but there’s no remote work and I miss writing efficient, performance-critical C++ code. I can still return to my old job. Not sure if it’s too early to judge or if going back makes more sense long-term.Hi all,I’m looking for some career advice.About 2 months ago, I started working as a software developer for the government. The role is mainly full-stack web development. My background is in robotics, and I previously worked as a C++ developer.I left my previous job because I wanted to see something different and broaden my experience. However, I’m starting to have doubts about that decision.Some context:- Previous job: C++ focused, about 60% remote- Current job: little to no remote work, but the outcome of my work actually makes this world a slightly better place which matters to me. - Compensation: slightly higher now, but beter pension and more days off. - Schedule: 4 days per week, but longer days- Personal preference: I really enjoy writing efficient, performance-critical software, which I don’t get to do much nowAn important detail:I can still return to my old job for now, which makes this decision harder.I’m trying to figure out whether it’s too early to judge after only 2 months, whether staying longer in a full-stack role adds enough long-term value, or whether returning to a C++ role that better matches my interests (and offers remote work) would be the smarter move.Has anyone been in a similar situation?Would you stick it out longer, or go back while the option is still there?Thanks!",

If I do quit it'll *probably* be in a few months at least - if anyone's unironically interested, I can come back to reach out and check/pre-screen you in our tech stack (Java/AWS) if I pull the trigger)This is obviously dependant on a lot of personal factors but I do wonder at what level of income/growth most would find it worth quitting. Would ask in a saas sub but they're mostly just marketing cesspools and somehow they're not desensitized to high CS salaries; mere new grad big tech pay would have everyone slamming the quit button without further thought.We're DINKs and I have 7 YoE. Bonuses are inconsistent so going with base only, $450k combined beteween me and spouse before starting this biz. I downsized to a far lower paying fully remote job that was much more chill (to start with) and now we're at more like $350K, with my slice being $150K. It's much less chill now and I'm being strained.Business has been up for a few months and pulls in 1MM, with \\~500K profit. Growth has been insane and I can only imagine how much faster it would be with me at the helm full time.In a regular economy it'd be a no brainer, $150K for $500K and way more growth potential. But the market is what it is and I'm uncomfortable, and I actually kinda hate working for myself, I've always been a big fan of 9-5, hated the risk of starting my own business, and only went for this because I was 99% sure it would work.BTW I find it hard to fathom this niche having enough demand to take us beyond single digit millions revenue. I could be wrong, I'm not a market analyst. But for this decision, assume that this biz will never pull more than 10MM revenue. At that level, it's probably still sustainable with just myself + agentic coding full time and some cheap support staff.",
