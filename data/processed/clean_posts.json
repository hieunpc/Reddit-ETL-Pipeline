        "content": "I’ve just been promoted to a mid-level data engineer. I work with Python, SQL, Airflow, AWS, and a pretty large data architecture. My SQL skills are the strongest and I handle pipelines well, but my Python feels behind.Context: in previous roles I bounced between backend, data analysis, and SQL-heavy work. Now I’m in a serious data engineering project, and I do have a senior who writes VERY clean, elegant Python. The problem is that I rely on AI a lot. I understand the code I put into production, and I almost always have to refactor AI-generated code, but I wouldn’t be able to write the same solutions from scratch. I get almost no code review, so there’s not much technical feedback either.I don’t want to depend on AI so much. I want to actually level up my Python: structure, problem-solving, design, and being able to write clean solutions myself. I’m open to anything: books, side projects, reading other people’s code, exercises that don’t involve AI, whatever.If you were in my position, what would you do to genuinely improve Python skills as a data engineer? What helped you move from “can understand good code” to “can write good code”?EDIT: Worth to mention that by clean/elegant code I meant that it’s well structured from an engineering perspective. The solution that my senior comes up with, for example, isn’t really what AI usually generates, unless u do some specific prompt/already know some general structure. e.g. He hame up with a very good solution using OOP for data validation in a pipeline, when AI generated spaghetti code for the same thing",

        "content": "I ran a test on Spark with a small dataset (about 700MB) doing some map vs groupBy + flatMap chains. With just map there was no major memory usage but when shuffle happened memory usage spiked across all workers, sometimes several GB per executor, even though input was small. From what I saw in the Spark UI and monitoring: many nodes had large memory allocation, and after shuffle old shuffle buffers or data did not seem to free up fully before next operations.  The job environment was Spark 1.6.2, standalone cluster with 8 workers having 16GB RAM each. Even with modest load, shuffle caused unexpected memory growth well beyond input size. I used default Spark settings except for basic serializer settings. I did not enable off-heap memory or special spill tuning.I think what might cause this is the way Spark handles shuffle files: each map task writes spill files per reducer, leading to many intermediate files and heavy memory/disk pressure. I want to ask the community* Does this kind of shuffle-triggered memory grab (shuffle spill mem and disk use) cause major performance or stability problems in real workloads* What config tweaks or Spark settings help minimize memory bloat during shuffle spill* Are there tools or libraries you use to monitor or figure out when shuffle is eating more memory than it should",

Most experienced DE has less skill in git than others. Our repo is mainly with DDLs, airflow dags and SQL scripts (we want to soon start using dbt so we get rid of DDLs, make the airflow dags logic easier and benefit from other dbts features).We have test & prod environment and we currently do the feature branch strategy -> branch off test, code a feature, PR to merge back to test and then we push to prod from test. (test is our like mainline branch)Pain points:•⁠We dont enjoy PRs and code reviews, especially when merge conflicts appear… •⁠sometimes people push right to test or prod for hotfixes etc.. •⁠we do mainline integration less often than we want… there are a lot of jira tickets and PRs waiting to be merged… but noone wants to get into it and i understand why.. when a merge conflict appears, we rather develop some new feature and leave that conflict for later..I read an article from Mattin Fowler about the Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches and while it was an interesting view on version control, I didnt find a solution to pur issues there.My question is: do you guys have similar issues? How you deal with it? Maybe an advice for us?Nobody from our team has much experience with this from their previous work… for example I was previously in a corporate where everything had a PR that needed to be approved by 2 people and everything was so freaking slow, but here in my current company it is expected to deliver everything faster…",

A small number of tasks take much longer and show most of the spill.The job uses joins and groupBy which trigger wide transformations. It runs on Spark 2.4 on YARN. Executors use the unified memory manager and spill happens when the in memory shuffle buffer and aggregation hash maps grow beyond execution memory. Spark then writes intermediate data to local disk under spark.local.dir and later merges those files.What is not clear is how much of this behavior is expected due to shuffle mechanics versus a sign of inefficient partitioning or skew.

BUT, the iceberg-rust writer ecosystem seems to lack a high-level API. It requires significant boilerplate to manually write Parquet files and commit transactions to Glue.The Question: For those running high-frequency ingestion:Is the maintenance burden of a verbose Rust writer worth the performance gains for 30s batches?Or should we just eat the cost/latency of Python because the library maturity prevents \"death by boilerplate\"?(Note: I asked r/rust specifically about the library state, but here I'm interested in the production trade-offs.)",

But the company is finally investing in data modeling, quality, and governance, and now the team has freedom to choose proper tools for the next stage.In the near future, we want more reliable pipelines, a real data warehouse, better observability/testing, and eventually support for analytics and MLOps. I’ve been looking into Dagster, Prefect, and parts of the Apache ecosystem, but I’m unsure what makes the most sense for a team starting from a very simple stack.Given our current situation (n8n + Lambdas) but our ambition to grow, what would you recommend?

        "content": "Hello.I am in charge of a pipeline where one of the sources of data was a SQL server database which was a part of the legacy system. We were given orders to migrate this database into a Databricks schema and shut down the old database for good. The person who was charged with the migration then did not order the columns in their assigned positions in the migrated tables in Databricks. All the columns are instead ordered alphabetically. They created a separate table that provided information on column ordering.That person has since left and there have been some big restructure, and this product is pretty much my responsibility now (nobody else is working on this anymore but it needs to be maintained).Anyway, I am thinking of re-migrating the migrated schema with the correct column order in place. The reason is that certain analysts sometimes need to look at this legacy data occasionally. They used to query the source database but that is no longer accessible. So now, if I want this source data to be visible to them in the correct order, I have to create a view on top of each table. It's a very annoying workflow and introduces needless duplication. I want to fix this but I don't know if this sort of migration is worth the risk. It would be fairly easy to script in python but I may be missing something.Opinions?",

        "content": "Recently at work I was tasked with optimizing our largest queries (we use spark—mainly SQL). I’m relatively new to Spark’s distributed paradigm, but I saw that most time was being spent with explosions and joins—mainly shuffling data a lot.In this query, almost every column’s value is a key to the actual value which lies in another table. To make matters worse, most of the ingest data are array types. So the idea here was to1. Never explode2. Never use joinsThe result is a combination of transform/filter/flattens to operate on these array elements and map them with several pandas UDFs (one for each join table) to map values from broadcasted dataframes.This ended up shortening our pipeline more than 50x, from 1.5h to just 5 minutes (the actual transformations take ~1 minutes, the rest is one-time cost setup of ~4 minutes).Now, I’m not really in charge of the data modeling, so whether or not that would be the better problem to tackle here isn’t really relevant (though do tell if it would!). I am however curious about how conventional this method is? Is it normal to optimize this way? If not, how else should it be done?",

        "author": "tytds",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello there – I'm fairly new to data engineering and just started learning its concepts this year. I am the only data analyst at my company in the healthcare/pharmaceutical industry.We don't have large data volumes. Our data comes from Salesforce, Xero (accounting), SharePoint, Outlook, Excel, and an industry-regulated platform for data uploads. Before using cloud platforms, all my data fed into Power BI where I did my analysis work. This is no longer feasible due to increasingly slow refresh times.I tried setting up an Azure Synapse warehouse (with help from AI tools) but found it complicated. I was unexpectedly charged $50 CAD during my free trial, so I didn't continue with it.I opted for BigQuery due to its simplicity. I've already learned the basics and find it easy to use so far.I'm using Fivetran to automate data pipelines. Each month, my MAR usage is consistently under 20% of their free 500,000 MAR plan, so I'm effectively paying nothing for automated data engineering. With our low data volumes, my monthly Google bills haven't exceeded $15 CAD, which is very reasonable for our needs. We don't require real-time data—automatic refreshes every 6 hours work fine for our stakeholders.That said, it would make sense to explore Microsoft's cloud data warehousing in the future since most of our applications are in the Microsoft ecosystem. I'm currently trying to find a way to ingest Outlook inbox data into BigQuery, but this would be easier in Azure Synapse or Databricks since it's native. Additionally, our BI tool is Power BI anyway.My question: Would it make sense to migrate to the Microsoft cloud data ecosystem (Microsoft Databricks or Azure Synapse) in the future? Or should I stay with BigQuery? We're not planning to switch BI tools—all our stakeholders frequently use Power BI, and it's the most cost-effective option for us. I'm also paying very little for the automated data engineering and maintenance between BigQuery and Fivetran. Our data growth is very slow, so we may stay within Fivetran's free plan for multiple years. Any advice?",

The type model reflects the needs of modern applications and allows for rich annotations with semantic information that can be evaluated and understood by developers and by large language models (LLMs).JSON Structure’s syntax is similar to that of JSON Schema, but while JSON Schema focuses on document validation, JSON Structure focuses on being a strong data definition language that also supports validation.The JSON Structure project has native validators for instances and schemas in 10 different languages.The Avrotize/Structurize tool can convert JSON Structure definitions into over a dozen database schema dialects and it can generate data transfer objects in various languages.

I started as a junior and recently moved to a medior title.I’ve been feeling a bit unfulfilled and uninspired at the job though. Despite the good pay, the role feels very removed from the business, and I feel like an ETL monkey in my corner. I also feel like my technical skills will also prevent me to move further ahead and I feel stuck in this position.I’ve recently been offered a role at a different large company, but as a senior data analyst.

It will have a focus on data stewardship, visualisation and predictive modeling and forecasting for e-commerce. Salary is quite similar though a bit lower.I would love to hear what people think of this career jump. I see a lot of threads on this forum about how engineering is the better more technical career path, but I have no intention of becoming this technical powerhouse.

The final write must go through a service API because it applies important validations/enrichment/triggers, so I don’t want to write directly to the DB or re-implement that logic.Even when the exports represent the “same” concepts, they’re highly vendor-dependent with lots of variations, so I need adapters per vendor and want a maintainable way to support many formats over time.I want to make the pipeline more robust and traceable by:• archiving raw input files,• storing raw + normalized intermediate datasets in Postgres,• keeping an audit log of uploads (batch id, row hashes, API responses/errors etc).Is dlt (dlthub) a good fit for this “Postgres staging + API sink” pattern? Any recommended patterns for schema/layout (raw vs normalized), adapter design, and idempotency/retries?I looked at some commercial ETL tools, but they’d require a lot of custom work for an API sink and I’d also pay usage costs—so I’m looking for a solid open-source/library-based approach.",

I first process the daily data to identify and upsert a Login node, as all tables track user activity.2. For every subsequent table, the pipeline must: 1. Read all existing Login nodes from Neo4j. 2. Calculate the differential between the new data and the existing graph data. 3. Ingest the new data as nodes. 4. Create the new relationships.3. This multi-step process, which requires repeatedly querying the **Login** node and calculating differentials across multiple tables, is causing significant overhead.**My question is:** How can I efficiently handle this common dependency (the Login node) across multiple parallel table ingestions to Neo4j to avoid redundant differential checks and graph lookups? And what's the best possible way to ingest such logs?",

I tried using Entra passthrough and a SAS token for auth, tried the form of the endpoint using adls://.dfs.core.window.net//, and tried a separate external source using the blob endpoint with OPENROWSET, all of which still hit the same error.I did some research on Synapse/Fabric failures with the same error because I’ve managed to set this up from Synapse in the past with no issues, but only came up with SQL pool-specific issues, or not having the blob reader role (which the MI has).Sorry for the long post, but if anyone can give me a steer of other things to check on, I’d appreciate it!",

Despite that, I still think it offers a lot of value as a fast, easy way to explore data files of various formats - even ones with millions of rows. So I figured I'd share it with this community, as you might find it useful :)Beyond just viewing files, you can also sort, filter, calculate new columns, etc. The documentation is sparse (well, non-existant), but I'm happy to have a chat with anyone who's interested in actually using the app seriously.Even though it's browser-based, there's no sign up or server interaction. It's basically a local app delivered via the web. For those interested in the technical details, it reads data directly from the filesystem using modern web APIs, and stores projects in IndexedDB.I'd be really keen to hear if anyone does find this useful :)**NOTE:** I've been told it doesn't work in Firefox due to it not supporting the filesystem APIs that the app uses. If there's enough of a pull to fix this, I'll look for a workaround.",

        "content": "Hi guys, I have a kind of difficult situation. Basically: * In 2020, I was working as, essentially, a BI Engineer at a company with a fairly old-fashioned tech stack. (SQL Server, SSRS reports, .NET and a *desktop application*, not even a webapp.) My official job title was just Junior Software Engineer. I did a bunch of data engineering-adjacent things (\"make a pipeline to load stuff from this google spreadsheet into new tables in the DB, then make a report about it\" and such)* Then I got sick and had to take medical leave. For several years. For some reason, my job didn't wait for me to come back.* Eventually I got better. I learned Python. I'm really much better at Python now than I ever was at .NET, though I'm better at SQL than at either. * I built a stupid little [test project](https://github.com/manya-t/infinitecraft) doing some data analysis and such. * I started looking for jobs. And continued looking for jobs. And continued looking for jobs.* Oh and btw I don't have a college degree, I'm entirely self-taught.In the long term, I want to break into data engineering, it's... the field that fits how my mind works. In the short term, I need a job, and any job that would take me would rather take a new grad with more legible qualifications and no gap. I'm totally willing to take a pay cut to compensate for someone taking a risk on me! I know I'm a risk! But there's no way to say that without looking like even more of a risk.So... I guess the question I have is, what are some steps I can take to get a job that is at least *vaguely* adjacent to data engineering? Something from which I can at least try to move in that direction.",

        "content": "Hello guys,This is my first time trying to implement data streaming for a home project,And would like to have your thoughts about something, because even after reading multiple blogs, docs online for a very long time, I can't figure out the best path.So my use case is as follows : I have a folder where multiple files are created per second.Each file have a text header then an empty line then other data.The first line in each file is fixed width-position values.The remaining lines of that header are key: values.I need to parse those files in real time in the most effective way and send the parsed header to Kafka topic.I first made a python script using watchdog, it waits for a file to be stable ( finished being written), moves it to another folder, then starts reading it line by line until the empty line , and parse 1st line and remaining lines,After that it pushes an event containing that parsed header into a kafka topic.I used threads to try to speed it up.After reading more about kafka I discovered kafka connector and spooldir , and that made my wonder, why not use it if possible instead of my custom script, and maybe combine it with SMT for parsing and validation? I even thought about using flink for this job, but that's maybe over doing it ? Since it's not that complicated of a task? I also wonder if spooldir wouldn't have to read all the file in memory to parse it ? Because my files size could vary from little as 1mb to hundreds of mb.And also, I would love to have your opinion about combining my custom script + spooldir , in a way where my script generates json header files in a file monitored by a spooldir connector?",

The platform has an API, which gives access to raw data, and require some ETL - pipeline. **The problem:** We need to find a platform, where we can analyze data and visualise it. The problem is, we need to come up a with a platform that can be scalable. By scalable, I mean a platform, where the client can visualise their own data, but also for different partners.This outlines a potentiel challenge, since each partner need access, and we are talking about 60+ partners. The partners come for different organisation, so if we setup a Power BI setup, I guess each partner need a license. **Recommendation**\\- Do you know a data tool, where partneres can access separately their data? \\- Also depending on the tool, what would you recommend to the data transformation in the platform/tool, or in another database or script? \\- Which tools would make sense to lower the costs?",

        "content": "Hi, I am new to data engineering and software dev in general.I've been tasked with creating an AI Assistant for a management service company website using opensource models, like from Ollama. In simple terms, the purpose of this assistant is so that both customer clients and operations staff can use this assistant to query anything about the current page they are on and/or about their data stored in the db. Then, the assistant will answer based on the available data of the page and from the database. Basically how perplexity works but this will be custom and for this particular website only.For example, client asks 'which of my contracts are active and pending payment?' Then the assistant will be able to respond with details of relevant contracts and their payment details.For db related queries, i do not want the existing db to be queried. So i though of creating a separate backend for this AI assistant and possibly create a duplicate db which is always synced with the actual db. This is when i looked into datalakes. I could possibly store some documents and files for RAG (such as company policy docs) and it will also store the synced duplicate db. Then the assistant will be using this datalake instead for answering queries and be completely independent of the website.Is this approach feasible? Can someone please suggest the pros and cons of this approach and if any other better approach is possible? I would love to learn more and understand if this could be used as a standard practice.",

The two sources are independently maintained so the mapping has to naturally go through certain ingestion steps that already transform the data as it goes to the DB. Scripts taking care of these exist in Python. The process has to repeat daily, so a certain level of orchestration is needed. Of course, the files will have to be stored somewhere as well. Read and write should be allowed to a few members of the team.No budget indicates the solution cannot be on Azure (Enterprise cloud) and support by the data teams but you still can make use of MS SSMS, Github and Github Action, Docker, and local/shared network storages, and anything open source like airflow. PS: please dont suggest not to do it given there's no budget - I could take this as a challenge if its possible only to bring some fun to the mundane tasks.",

Did anyone try something like this before and does it sound plausible?# Building a Reference Data Solution## The Core Philosophy**Stop with the enterprise architecture astronaut bullshit.** Reference data isn’t rocket science - it’s just data that doesn’t change often and lots of systems need to read. You need:1. A single source of truth1. Fast reads1. Version control (because people fuck things up)1. Simple distribution mechanism## The Actual Implementation**Start with Git as your backbone.** Yes, seriously. Your reference data should be in flat files (JSON, CSV, whatever) in a Git repository. Why?- Built-in versioning and audit trail- Everyone knows how to use it- Branching for testing changes before production- Pull requests force review of changes- It’s literally designed for this problem**The sync process:**- Git webhook triggers on merge to main- Service pulls latest data- Validates it (JSON schema, referential integrity checks)- Updates cache- Done## Distribution Strategy**Three tiers:**1. **API calls** - For real-time needs, with aggressive caching1. **Event stream** - Publish changes to Kafka/similar when ref data updates1. **Bundled snapshots** - Teams that can tolerate staleness just pull a daily snapshot## The Technology Stack (Opinionated)- **Storage:** Git (GitHub/GitLab) + S3 for large files- **API:** Go or Rust microservice (fast, small footprint)- **Cache:** Redis (simple, reliable)- **Distribution:** Kafka for events, CloudFront/CDN for snapshots- **Validation:** JSON Schema + custom business rule engine",

Now I feel like LLMs are just doing a-lot of this research work for us yet I read so many people griping on how LLMs produce sub par work in this sub. However I feel if you have your house in order then any team should be relatively immune from any sub par work produced. Pre commit with pytest coverage, mypy, formatters, and linters. Proper CI CD. Code reviews. QA department. Proper end to end and unit testing. If you have all of these things you are insulating yourself from a lot of sloppy code and poor architecture.I do agree that LLMs will gaslight your poor architecture design choices, but I disagree that we should not be using LLMs because of this. I think we should use them but within guard rails. Come to it with an already thought out architecture. Have the proper development cycle built out, Then start vibe coding and make sure you are testing.I look back on that common mantra amongst my colleagues and I honestly don’t see a huge difference between just googling and just using LLMs, so get over it.",

Getting to that point where you can confidently pass live coding interviews.This is the point where I strive to get to, and the only way to do this is by actually learning the material. Hopefully some can relate when I say programming is very much enjoyable when you understand every bit of your code, but it gets frustrating if you have gaps in your knowledge and don't understand certain pieces of your code.When you understand every bit of it, you can literally lay on your bed and figure out the error in your head. If you take shortcuts it's much harder to do so, and you'll end up being at the point where you don't know if you can solve the error no matter how much time you have.I made this post to hopefully motivate you guys to actually learn the material, in which many of you are if you're in this sub.TLDR: If you actually learn the material live coding interviews will be a much smoother process(obviously), and coding will be much more enjoyable since you'll actually feel capable of debugging your app. The only way to get rid of imposter syndrome is by actually proving to yourself that you can do the work, don't take shortcuts.Edit: I also came to the realization that it is highly unlikely to \"master\" programming in the way I depicted it out to be. You won't be able to program everything without looking something up but there's nothing wrong with that. As long as you understand every bit of your code, then that's what matters.",

        "content": "I've answered a few questions in the last few days about stuff like \"what language should I learn\" and \"should I learn to code?\"With respect to the askers, those questions are wrong-headed. Code isn't the hard part. On this topic, here is myI reply that we programmers use languages as tools. We use those tools to create programs. We test those programs. We package those programs. We sell those packages, or publish them as open source, or deliver them to an employer, or whatever. We get bug reports from users. We fix (some of) those bugs. We repackage and republish. Code is only part of the trade of programming. Professional programmers understand what our users need. We have clear vision for what a finished software package is and does and looks like. We get our work tested, packaged, and across the finish line. Along the way we write some code. The thing is, if we can do the other things well, the code is (usually) pretty easy, comparatively. At the same time, pure code isn't finished and doesn't have any users. That gets very boring very fast.Wanna see some examples of software packages of a scale that one person -- you -- can make and publish and try to attract live people as users?* These are Javascript utility packages. https://www.npmleaderboard.org/* These are plugins for WordPress: https://wordpress.org/plugins/* ...for Python. https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Topic+%3A%3A+Artistic+Software * Indie games. https://itch.io/There are other lists and repositories of packages out there for the searching. Laying down lines of code is just a part of our trade. The programmers of many of those packages did the whole job: explanation, instructions, code, testing, packaging, publishing, and then bug fixing. Read through some of the package descriptions; they'll give you a feel for what a piece of finished software looks like.Don't be too intimidated by the packages that turn up on the first page of these lists. The best of them have been around for many years, and have been through a lot of changes to perfect them. But those packages started somewhere. Yours can too.Make good software and stay in touch.",

Mostly I am just feeling wrecked on a daily basis because of my lack of skills. The worst part is that there are people much younger than me here that are beasts at this. I am part of 2 projects, 1 is a Saas where I'm mostly doing front-end debugging and even adding elements as I am tasked using laravel.php, js and html in which I find im doing okay in and not using AI a lot. The other is a tool for the company that analyzes pdf pages and which will have a pipeline translation for the text, using python, and this one I am using mostly AI as I never coded in python before and it was handed to me promptly when I started. Now the stress of this 2nd project plus my lack of skill made me use chatgpt A LOT. Adding on top of that I live in a country where people will literally belittle you and throw irony at most things if you prove incompetent, which I am feeling a bit. Of course I try my best to see the logic in what is going on as I had no idea what the process was, now I can explain it at least when people ask and so on, plus seniors have been giving me hints and steps to take to make it better. Now the thing is, if I want to start from scratch a new project I am doomed. And this has just been going into my mind lately and even lost sleep over hiw useless I am. I don't know how you guys handle this stuff and I would love your advice and the whole thing. This job and career path is actually a decent thing to follow through as otherwise I would be forced to take up minimal wage jobs again, which is not ideal.

So far my Python and Javascript classes have been pretty alright but the HTML/CSS and SQL/Bash classes have been literally just freeCodeCamp and that's it. Nothing else.

The only advantage that this college has over others is that it's comparatively cheap.Do I just tough it out and get the degree while teaching myself other languages, toolchains, and build my portfolio or do I run and find an different accredited 4 year that put more effort into their CS/adjacent programs?",

I am a current game development student in university, however for some reason my uni's game development department and CS department aren't super cooperative. I have just completed algorithms & data structures class (generally the 3rd CS class you take here) and so far everything we've done has been in java with a bit of python. Our games department does not have any specific programming classes because the assumption is that most of that will be handled by the CS department, however the main engine we use for the game dev classes is UE5 which runs in C++. There is a games scripting class that I've just completed but that's all using blueprints. I've been told that higher level CS classes don't have a specific language requirement, however there is no dedicated class using c++ or even a primer as far as I'm aware, and would like to be able to transition my knowledge from java to C++ so I can start working effectively in building from there in that to sharpen my skillset later on. Advice I'm seeing tends to be either to read a specific book/forum (which tends to be a \\*very\\* slow method for me, safe to say I'm generally an audiobook person) or to just \"go and start\", which I can grab a compiler and start googling how something formatted in java is formatted in c++, but that doesn't give me as good of an understanding. So I'm not looking for a magic bullet here or anything, but something more than these two types of resources, and something that doesn't assume im an absolute beginner repeating fundamentals of programming would be great if possible?",

I ran into an issue with one of the exercises, where I couldn't add any lines to adjust any parameters because every time the finished graph was closed, everything I entered into the REPL was deleted from the queue and I had to enter the whole program into the REPL again.I went to AI to find this out, and asked about putting this all into a script. Two days later I have a script, an understanding of why I would have multiple files for a script (for separation of concerns), why I would put these files in the project directory and not a \\~/bin directory, and a few other things that I can't recall atm, but that I did not know before, or without, AI.I had to do some thinking to figure out what the script was doing, but not much thinking. I asked the AI a ton of questions along the way. I didn't simply copy-pasta the whole thing, but that only sounds like I'm justifying after-the-fact. Am I doing myself a dis-service?

        "author": "TypingTadpole",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I confess that I have a standard / frequent question around \"how do I create X type of app\", but there are three twists to the question, I promise! The FAQ helped, but before I go off and running, I want to \"test\" my hypothesis.**First, I'm old**. Not too old to learn (approaching 60), just that I have old programming experience. So I typed programs from computer magazines in BASIC into Commodore VIC-20s and PETs back in the 80s and saved them on cassettes; I learned BASIC and STRUCTURED BASIC in high school in the 80s; I took BASIC/FORTRAN/COBOL courses in university in the 90s. I learned enough to write a menu system in BASIC for running in DOS back in the '80s that allowed me to add/subtract items, write batch files that would launch when the menu closed and then reopen the menu when I was done running whatever program was, compile it and run it in DOS. Used it for years. So I have \\*\\*\\*SOME\\*\\*\\* experience. Just nothing recent. Oh, and I also can debug basic HTML / CSS issues on websites but avoid javascript stuff at least for now. I'd rather run WordPress with free plugins than program my own. I'm more of a user than a developer. The second twist is that I have **two very specific needs** in mind, both of which could perhaps be done with a robust GUI and back-end database instead of programming it. But well, I want something a bit more customizable to my specific issues to solve. So, like the videos recommend, I have specific problems to solve that will keep me interested! The first is harder and I have more passion for it; the second is easier and maybe where I should start, even though I'm not as excited about it.And the third twist is that I am **NOT trying to build a revenue stream**. I'm open to having a small revenue stream tied to it enough to buy myself a coffee if someone wants the extra \"bits\", but just looking to use the apps myself, $$ is not my goal. If others in my immediate community find it useful, I'd be open to sharing the apps everywhere for free and with no advertising. Maybe some \"extras\" available in a pro version for $1 or something.The first need would be a mobile app (iOS and Android) that acts like a **field recorder** as if someone was doing a survey or recording a business transaction BUT without local wifi/internet access. So, like you were out in the woods, say, doing biology research and you wanted to record which birds you saw, and the date/time/interesting details. BUT you also want to be able to record the equipment you were using and the place/location with sort of default \"profiles\". Like, \"Profile 1\" says you're using equipment X, Y, Z; Profile 2 says you're using X, A, B; Profile 3 says Y, Z, B, etc. But I want to load the default profiles in as starter info. There are existing database apps that do this, but I have some unique usage links that I'll need to pull from unique style databases too, which the database apps didn't have the power to do. Ultimately, I need the initial recording apps (mostly dumping info into a set of fields in a database) and then once I'm back in civilization, uploading them to a more powerful PC app that would be almost the same software in PC form, with some extra printing, formatting, layout features. I confess I have no idea where that info is saved on the phone, or the PC, or the inbetween bits (common upload to cloud when there's a connection? Like synching photos?). Just that I want the data to eventually be in the PC for more processing. It's not very complicated for operations (input screen, load profiles, enter data, save data, load previous records, etc.), and the graphics needs are not very sophisticated (very functionally focused). If it was the early 90s, I'd be tempted to even use COBOL. The app will do no calculations or advanced graphics; it's almost entirely a text-based database entry and retrieval function with some flex on forms.The second need is similar but even simpler in design. It's like **a quiz game.** Questions, with 4 possible answers, timed. It could be used as a game or as a flashcard-type study aid. I have a specific purpose in mind, but the functionality is basically that of a trivia game -- load small database (say 25 Qs about topic 1), go through the Qs, have options for hints or retries, get score at end, equivalent of a global leader board (so some internet required). But all single player, not live games with others, no live online element. And the extra twist for this one is I would love to be able to do it in iOS, Android, AND a version for my website for those who DO have access. The mobile apps would work differently, and I don't NEED a website version, but I'll keep my options open. The FAQ tells me to use Kotlin or Java (for Android); Objective-C or Swift (for iOS); C#, VB or JS for Windows Phone; or use PhoneGap / Titanium in HTML/CSS/JS. Oh and C# for the Windows PC version (no, I am NOT going to try MAC too). But with my specific two-use functionality...is that the way to go? I'm fine to learn new tricks, just want to make sure I'm learning the right tricks.",

I really want to learn this, so I've watched lectures and followed tutorials, but I feel stuck in a cycle of confusion and I’m hoping for some guidance on how to break out of it.A lot of my high school math is rusty as well, so I’ve been relearning on the fly. When I see the pseudocode or a solution, I can usually understand it at a surface level but when I'm given a problem, I blank on how to even start designing the algorithm. It feels like there's a gap between recognizing a solution and inventing one.I see the final algorithm, but the problem-solving process that led to it feels like a mystery. What mental steps should I be practicing?What I'm struggling with so far:* Foundational Math (Floor/Ceiling, Powers, Logarithms). I understand what a log is, but feeling its impact in binary search is different.* Algorithm Principles & Efficiency (Time/Space Complexity, Big-O). Is Big O notation like a set formula? * Arrays (Operations, Insertion/Deletion)* Searching (Linear, Binary Search)* Basic Algorithms (Array Merging) I'd really appreciate any help. I'm a visual learner so if you can recommend any YouTube channels or websites that are exceptional at teaching the problem-solving process would be great. Something that kinda holds your hand through the why before the how. I'd also like to know how you personally learnt to think algorithmically. Are there specific practices (like a certain way of using pseudocode, drawing diagrams, etc.) that helped you?Please help me find an effective way to practice and learn this.",

BaaS sounds good for authentication and a database, but besides that it seems actually more difficult to configure a backend using a BaaS.I don't know guys. I'm still relatively new to programming. What's your experience with using these BaaS? Is it still easy to setup even when needing the features listed above as well as other configurations?",

        "content": "Hello. I created a Maui app for Android two years ago, which connects to a PHP API. It worked perfectly. But recently, it stopped connecting to the API. It only works in the emulator with API levels 35 and 36, but not with versions 34 and lower. I had a Samsung S8 Active to verify that the app worked on older smartphones, but it no longer allows me to connect to the API. The API link works fine in the S8's browser, but not in the app, and the site has a valid HTTPS certificate. My question is, how does the internet know the phone is old if the app and the API are private?The iOS version connects to the REST API without problems",

I'm a non-CS grad, I did law, and I'm not from the U.S.I am a future FDM software engineering joiner (course starts on 19 Jan 2026), and I am also a former coding bootcamp student. For those that do not know FDM, they do a 3-month training programme that gives you fullstack coverage, then you will go for interviews to get a placement with a client (think the usual DSA questions). In my country, the clients are banks, and the tech stack taught is Java/Spring/React. I was advised to try and start studying the course objectives as much as I can so I struggle less during the course.***Please no comments about how I shouldn't join FDM. I know where I stand in the job market, having spent about 5 months on job applications, and I'm very grateful and thrilled to receive an offer from FDM. Please just be happy for me, and help me with my journey!***I completed CS50's Python and Intro to Programming so I can code in C, Python, JavaScript (poor front end skills though), and also have started programming in Java. I have projects on my portfolio, and I am really passionate about software engineering and I've bought some books to start. The more I read online about what CS majors read, the more overwhelmed I get. Additionally, I feel the added pressure of impressing the interviewers at an interview to get the top banks (think investment banks), but that's in 3-4 months' time.These are the books I have bought so far, and have started reading:* SICP (JS Ed.) by Abelson and Sussman* The Pragmatic Programmer (20th Ann. Ed.) by Thomas and Hunt* Clean Code (4th Ed.)Then there are other books that non-CS grads have been advised to get:* Operating System Concepts (Dinosaur Book)* Compilers Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Dragon Book)* Introduction to the Theory of Computation by SipserAnd then there are books on Java and OOP:* Effective Java by Bloch* Core Java I and II by Horstmann* Head First Design Patterns by Freeman and RobsonThere are just so many books. I am VERY happy to read them because I think these are just fascinating and I enjoy reading the books I have so far... but in what order?I'm a little confused about priorities because I've heard that DSA is taught very early on at university, but doesn't actually help you much on the job. Yet, I need to have a good understanding of it for interviews. I read *Grokking Algorithms* and *Grokking Data Structures*, and those were really fun reads, but those are just general overviews and theories; they don't actually help you with coding. Then I tried Leetcode and Neetcode, and however much I do, I just struggle with understanding because the video explanations aren't that great. So.... do I actually need to read Algorithms by Sedgewick and Wayne? How would that affect my job? But a lot of comments online have told me that this does require some understanding of Mathematics. Other reddit posts have pointed me towards MIT's Mathematics for Programming Course (but that looks pretty long) before reading this.**tldr:*** Which order should I buy / read the books above?* Which books should I buy to get better at Java / in general?* Do I actually need to read Algorithms by Sedgewick and Wayne? Will this affect my job? Prioritise before going for coding interviews?* Alternatives to Leetcode / Neetcode because I barely understand the explanations?",

The background is that latin has a lot of suffixes that occur under a combination of properties that the given word has. The two properties that are currently of interest for me are the Numerus (an Enum) and the Casus (another Enum).My first instinct was to create a two dimensional array for that, but I quickly realised that this will lead to confusion problems if I don't know at any given point in time in which order the suffixes are actually placed into the array, because they aren't linked to the values of the Enum directly.To circumvent this, I quickly figured out that I actually wanted to use the values of the Enum directly and map specific values in a table like fashion to them, basically like:(Singular, Nominative, \"us\")(Singular, Accusative, \"um\")Etc.So I wrote this class here:https://github.com/Hellinfernel/Latin-Learing-Program/blob/main/latin%2FBiEnumMap.java#L19Now the thing is I still don't have any idea if my approach here is even technically doable because I don't know how to get an collection of all the values of an given Enum class.I tried EnumSet and Enum directly, but none of that seemed to really function and I couldn't find a function in the docs that fulfilled my requirements, and I feel like I am either completely and utterly blind or am just not searching in the right place.I am pretty sure my code has other problems as well, but for now I just would like to know the following:How do I get a list of all values of a given Enum class to use them as an index for a map?",

What is the problem?**gmpy2.is\\_integer() is saying that floats that are equivalent to a whole number (i.e. 2.0) are integers, but when using gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) with \"whole number\" floats, it raises a TypeError where only integers or rational arguments are allowed.>**1. What is your code supposed to do?**Currently, I'm just testing simple mathematics operations and learning the gmpy2 library. My code is supposed to check what the type of input is for 2 numbers you select (through gmpy2.is\\_integer() ), and do either gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) for integers, or do gmpy2.div(x, y) for floats.>**2. What is your code doing instead?**See: \"1. What is the problem?\">**3. What inputs, if any, cause the problem?**Floats and gmpy2.mpfr() created floats that are equivalent to whole numbers, like 2.0.>**4. Is there an error message of some kind? If so, include it.**Yes: TypeError: qdiv() requires 1 or 2 integer or rational arguments>**2. What have you tried?**I can easily use the normal python isinstance(x, float), convert \"whole number\" floats to integers, or just use gmpy2.div(x, y) or some other division, but that is not the problem. The problem is with gmpy2.is\\_integer() and/or gmpy2.qdiv(x, y).For the code, I have tried using the first number as a float, the second number for a float, both numbers as floats, and those three combinations as gmpy2.mpfr() floats as well.>**1. What have you already tried to debug your own problem? Where do you suspect the problem is? What uncertainties do you have?**Printing gmpy2.is\\_integer(x) and gmpy2.is\\_integer(y) both return True when both x and y are \"whole number\" floats, and then gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) raises the TypeError, so I'd say the problem would be when I use gmpy2.is\\_integer() or gmpy2.qdiv(x, y).>**2. What precisely are you confused by?**I am confused that gmpy2.is\\_integer() is saying that \"whole number\" floats are integers, but then gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) says I'm not using integers.>**3. Have you tried googling for answers? If so, what search queries have you tried? What pages have you read? What do you find confusing about them?**I have like 20 tabs open that are gmpy2 docs, and various searches with different ways to ask about my problem. For example: \"gmpy2 is\\_integer\", \"gmpy2 qdiv\", \"gmpy2 qdiv with whole number floats\", and \"Why does gmpy2.is\\_integer() returns True for \"whole number\" mpfr floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them?\". For the last search, I got exactly 2 results, both of which are just gmpy2 documentation.On the gmpy2 docs, is\\_integer() → bool. Return True if x is an integer; False otherwise, and gmpy2.qdiv(*x*, *y=1*, */*) → mpz| mpq. Return x/y as mpz if possible, or as mpq if x is not exactly divisible by y.I am aware that gmpy2.is\\_integer() returns True is a float checked is equivalent to a whole number. I am also aware that gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) only works on integer and rational arguments.So what I'm confused about is why gmpy2.is\\_integer() returns True for \"whole number\" floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them.>**DO** be sure to actually ask a question.Why does gmpy2.is\\_integer() returns True for \"whole number\" floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them?>Anyways, here's the actual code import gmpy2 def test(x, y):     rlist = []     z = gmpy2.mul(x, y)     rlist.append(z)     h = gmpy2.add(x, y)     rlist.append(h)     if gmpy2.is_integer(x) and gmpy2.is_integer(y) is True:         print (gmpy2.is_integer(x))         print (gmpy2.is_integer(y))         j = gmpy2.qdiv(x, y)         rlist.append(j)     else:         i = gmpy2.div(x, y)         rlist.append(i)     return rlist print (test(4, 2.0))",

        "content": "Graduated in June and joined Microsoft as a new grad software engineer in Prague. Before that, I spent over two years working at a startup, and honestly those were the best years of my degree. I had close on-site friends, we built creative features, brainstormed ideas, and it genuinely felt fun going into the office every day.Now I’m ~6 months into MSFT and I seriously don’t know if this is normal. On paper everything is great, my winter review says I’m exceeding expectations, my manager and team are super happy with me, and objectively nothing is “wrong.”But emotionally? It’s been rough. Most days I’m anxious, constantly scared I’m not performing enough. Half the week ends with me feeling overwhelmed, and at least once a week I break down crying at night. I look forward to weekends. No matter how much I sleep, exercise, meditate, or whatever, it keeps happening.The work itself isn’t helping. It’s mostly infra, bugs,security standards - barely any coding and zero creativity. My team is nice but almost everyone is remote, and the office is full of people from unrelated teams. Plus people barely talk to each other. I haven’t formed any real friendships here; everything feels formal or “networking-like.” Nothing like the tight on-site friendships I had before.My therapist says there’s probably something else causing this anxiety (also generally I’m someone with big self-imposed expectations of myself). But I can’t shake the feeling that I should be happy - isn’t working at such a company every CS student’s dream?I’m confused and honestly worried. Is this just normal for big tech grads in Europe? Do I need to toughen up or did I just enter the adult life?Would really appreciate advice from anyone who’s been through something similar.",

        "content": "I was a software eng at a somewhat big company for 9 years and 8 months until about 2 hours ago. For the last 2 years, I've honestly been kind of circling the drain and struggling to keep up with the other devs. I managed a senior promotion about 5 years into the job, but was promoted based on my fullstack work, which involved a lot of frontend; almost immediately after getting promoted, I was shunted into mostly backend, which I was able to maintain for about 2 years (although just barely, IMO) since we worked in Node.js.2 years ago, my team switched to Java, which I had very little experience in. I deeply struggled to keep up with the team, which at this point were experienced Java developers. The struggle overtook me, and I made dozens of mistakes, some small, some big. Admittedly, I didn't do anything outside of work; I tried to maintain WLB and stick to working during working-hours only, and didn't do any other prep or studying or projects outside of work hours. After many conversations about performance with my manager, they decided to let me go without a PIP or anything; just fired.Despite working in backend for 4 years now I feel like my backend skills are garbage. But since I had no opportunities during work to do any frontend work, my frontend skills have also decayed significantly to the point that I'm fairly sure I can't pass an interview based on it. On top of all that, the job I had was my first software job out of college, so I don't have experience with other companies to work with. I feel at least a little screwed (this is about as optimistic a take I can give), and extremely directionless; backend clearly isn't a good fit for me, and my frontend skills are junior-level at best. I have no idea how to present myself for interviews, or what to prepare for; I'm considering taking a frontend bootcamp to try and modernize my skills to _hopefully_ be able to get a frontend role, but I'm terrified that I can't maintain a senior skill level. It's frustrating because I know I have at least some experience to draw on; I couldn't have kept this job for so long without at least doing something right at some point. But it all feels so murky.If anyone has been in a similar position or has any advice, I would gladly take it. I don't mind if it's harsh; I'm not in a position to complain. I've been given 2 months severance and have some savings, but I have multiple bills to pay so I cannot just relax and take it slow. Any help or advice would be great.",

Two reasons:1) as I mentioned, I never struggled finding a job.2) when I talk to senior developers and leads in different companies, they always say: no qualified developers or current developers in the company should be fired because they are not doing their jobs well for many reasons.3) in the past 3 years, I've noticed a decline in the quality of the employees in general. They either lack skills, or they are lazy and we can't depend on them.My guesses: the location is a major factor in the availability of jobs. Outsourcing may have affected some jobs.

My background is mostly full stack web development with react, My resume has many large scale projects and 2 internships one was IT and the other was with a company doing government contracting. Here's the main issue:I have zero desire to grind leetcode or interview questions (frankly burnt out from this sort of stuff when it already feels hopeless applying). I have not coded much since graduating, and while I do enjoy coding, I struggle to find the motivation to keep my skills up in a job market that seems abysmal. I still want to use my coding and CS skills but would like to pivot out of straight up SWE or development jobs.I've considered creating my own digital products to sell, starting my own business, maybe going into IT, and more. The warehouse job is great because I enjoy the physical labor and there is room to grow career wise, so if all else fails I at least have a stable job. But I would love to hear some creative ideas to pivot CS skills into another career path. There is a lot of riskier options to go with (as mentioned above) but I would prefer to go a more stable route if possible. I'm open to any and all ideas. Small sidebar: I have no college debt and good savings. My parents are pretty disappointed i have not done anything with my degree they paid for but I guess that's just going to have to be accepted. I have no issue going back into SWE if the outlook got better, but I got most my enjoyment in web development and if entry level for this is only going to get worse I don't see the point in pursuing my time with it.",

I feel like everything I see online is how bad the job market is for SWE's, and the only hopeful posts are ones about how the job itself is changing. I personally would rather not work in the field if the job truly becomes something akin to managing a team of AI agents. If I'm building something I want to actually build the thing. The degree I'm currently pursuing is in Data Science and the curriculum is still basically the same thing as a normal CS degree except a bit more math. I did this with the hope that the data science job market would be a bit better, but even now I'm hearing that the market is becoming over flooded. One might also think that MLE would be the way to go since that's what's taking over jobs right? But similar to DS I hear that those jobs are changing rapidly and are flooded with applicants. There's not as much need to custom train a model from scratch so most just use API's for the big names. It seems like the only jobs holding up are more Sys Admin and general cyber security roles. Personally, that realm isn't my thing and I'd much rather be programming something even if it's just a couple lines of SQL and Python. Is programming really just dead? At least in the way that it once was? I'm only 18 also, so I'm sure my view is just a bit too narrow. I'm sure that a lot of sectors are feeling this as well. I think just with AI being the new big thing and Computer Science jobs being so adjacent to this new advancement that we catch a lot of the heat because of it.For context on who I am, I'm an undergrad student at a T100. My high school offered free CompTIA certs, so I have the A+, Network+, and Security +. I've been programming since high school, and I did a software dev competition where I placed 5th nationally. I also worked essentially a help desk job my senior year of hs as well.If anyone has SWE adjacent jobs please let me know! Either just ones in general or ones that fit my experience. Also, if you think SWE isn't changing and will be fine I'm also curious to hear why.",

At my uni there was a heavy emphasis on theory and more academically oriented programming early on, as opposed to the type and pace of development that devs out in the world. By the time I started building real applications and doing internships, I found every aspect of the job, from planning/design to coding/testing, even the more dev ops/sysadmin parts to be quite draining and I can't imagine myself making a career out of this long term. Most of the advice for developers looking for a career change online is to move into project management, cyber, data analytics or something like that. But all of those are still centered around working with and implementing technical solutions, which is just something that I have no passion for. I'm wondering if anyone else had a similar experience and transitioned to something else? Or if a change like this is even plausible coming from such a technically oriented degree (the irony that I was a computer science major that doesn't like working with computers is not lost on me.)

Then manager made us (me and Person C) work overtime to cover person A's part to meet deadline. I had to “transfered” parts of the task to Person C so he can shared the workload that person A left. Juggling between coding and communication/transferring knowledge and Q&A with another dev really made me unable to focus. Also I was being questioned nonstop and pressured by managers to finish quickly and it worsened my mood and life quality due to pressure and unbalance work hours.User story 2 is assigned to me and person B. Person B didnt really care and did a bad job, and I had to review and corrected his mistake, because I knew in the end if the task isnt done, then I will have to work overtime or being questioned and pressured again. Managers only looked at the surface and whenever theres something not meet deadline, he assigned other members of the team to cover the lackluster member. I don’t know what they do to the particular member in the dark and it is not disclosed.Original:Hi guys, I wonder if theres some coworker that I have to team with and he is either lazy or irresponsible, should I tell the manager or not.I feel like if I always tell the manager, then it would look like I am the problem, who can not work with anyone and always badmouth.Also it may not be wise, since we might have the same paycheck but I am working with all my effort, and someone else is slacking of at work and have more time and energy for his personal life. I'm afraid I will somehow “raise the bar” for expectation and makes all the developers suffer under the already exploitative system.But if I kinda “side with him” and relax, the task will be late or has not very good quality. And it just doesnt feel right.How should I maneuver this? As a neurodivergent sort of person, things like this always confuse me and make me suffer to do the right thing, politics and all that.",

But coming back to the question, how has the university you've gone to helped you in your career (if it HAS at all), and what do you think for me? Of course, I want to get into a T15 cs university, but will that matter significantly?

As an example, one role I saw, showed 85% of applicants had masters degrees, and 73% were senior-level applicants, while the rest of the figures (bachelor's, mid-level, entry-level) were in the teens.Given these metrics, recruiters and hiring managers, how is your process with choosing candidates in this situation? if it is an entry-level position, do you prioritize who is more experienced in years or do you opt to choose best fit based on the posting level? Is there a different guideline you follow?It would be interesting to read some perspectives on the hiring process. TIA!",

In August of this year, I was laid off after the federal government canceled all the contracts I was working on, and there were no other positions available for me. I had been at the company full-time for almost three years before being laid off.I have been applying for jobs for almost five months now, and I have had no success. Most of the time, I do not even get interviews. When I do get interviews, I have reached the final round at Meta but did not get an offer. The same happened with Fanatics. At IBM, I failed the first programming interview after the coding assessment. I was interviewing for a C++ role but had limited experience. I have also interviewed for three local roles and made it to the final round in all of them.The only feedback I have received came from my two most recent interviews. For Company A, they said I did not perform well in the programming project during the interview because I focused on new Java features. However, they also said positive things. They thought I had the right culture fit and technical skill, but I lacked experience in DevOps, which I believe was not part of the job description, and I was relatively slow. For Company B, they said, \"We do not think your skillset is the best fit for the fundamental development tasks that will be our primary focus in the months ahead.\"My experience at my former employer was mainly with legacy systems, which is typical for government contracts. We used AWS for the entire system: ECS, RDS (Oracle SQL), DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambda, and S3. But all the backend code, where I worked full-stack, was in Java 8, later upgraded to Java 21, SpringMVC (no Spring Boot), Apache Tomcat, Apache Maven, SVN, and Git. The frontend consisted of JSPs that loaded XML files with vanilla JS, Bootstrap, and jQuery, along with CSS and HTML.It seems many companies are looking for reactive websites, which I have no experience with, or Spring Boot and more modern tech stacks. I am getting almost no interviews, and the process can take a month or more just to end in rejection. I know the job market is very difficult right now, but this is taking a serious mental toll on me. I already have disabilities and mental health issues, and I feel like my life and career are falling apart. I do not have skills for \"normal\" non-tech roles, and I do not know what to do. I know the obvious advice is to improve my resume and interviewing skills, but at some point, even getting an interview feels completely random, and the same goes for the interviews themselves.EDIT: Resume https://imgur.com/a/j1UZQnQ",

I was also told I’d have had help from said resigned developer in form of emails (spoiler: I couldn’t ask him anything). The code was a mess, half of the stuff wasnt working and there was no documentation so I basically had to learn/guess what stuff did (nobody in the company knew what my apps did)Time skip to today. Stuff is better as I fixed most of things and everything works now. I even implemented some new stuff.Tomorrow I have a big deploy planned, and as every other time I do, I got anxiety. Because of that, I wanted to look of other people had my problem. And they do, and the discussions helped me a lot. But everyone talked about how it is a team’s effort.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello Community,Fortunate enough to have received two Entry Level Software Engineer offers from these companies. Looking for your guidance on which will be better to start my career with.Long Term Goals (at least as of now):Work at a bigger, more respectable Company. Either Big Tech or Fin-Tech (like Bloomberg).Get an MBA from a respectable institution (like Top 20), since my undergrad is a no-name school. Intuition behind getting an MBA is I like software, but I also like the business side of things. MBA obviously also helps with getting a promotion to the business side of things. I will probably pursue the MBA part-time while working full-time.Capital One TDP, McLean, VA (DC Metro Area):Base: 130k, One Time Bonuses (Sign-on + Relocation): 30k, Target Bonus (3600)Pros and Cons will of course be a bit team-dependent, I know a Senior Engineer there who 'might' be able to help with team-matching when the time comes. Team has not been assigned yet; they will match us later.TDP Rotations are 1 year and then 6 months, for a total of 18 months. I do not know about the conversion rate from TDP to full-time.Pros:Bigger Name and a more tech-focused company.TCDC Metro Area(?): Plenty of companies in the DC Metro Area to switch to in case things goes sideways. Amazon, Google, Gov Contracting, Consulting.Hybrid Schedule: 3 days in office, 2 days remoteCons:Stack Ranking and PIP Culture: Around 10% of the staff is laid off every 6 months.Performance Review Method: Performance is evaluated every 6 months, and historical performance does not matter in the next cycle.Worth mentioning: Everyone is judged on a scale of 1-5, and as long as you can stay at 3 or above, you are fine.DC Cost of Living is very high, so not sure how far the higher TC will go.I will have to switch sooner or later (unless there's a miracle and I find a great team environment there).AT&T TDP, Atlanta, GA:Base: 90k, One-Time Bonus (Sign-on): 5k, Target Bonus: 10k.TDP rotations are 1 years each for 2 years. Getting placed full-time in a team after TDP is pretty much guaranteed.This is an intern return offer, so I have pretty good rapport with the managers there. I believe I will have a say in the team matching so I end up with a team whose work seems interesting to me.Pros:Chill work environment, very low chances of PIP/layoff.When I interned there, everyone including the managers were really nice.Good rapport with TDP management means getting placed on a good (or at least interesting) team.Chill work environment means I can coast there while getting a Masters in CS from Georgia Tech (part-time) that might help with employability in the future. Georgia Tech name is pretty strong in tech so that would work in my favor.Atlanta also has a lot of companies there to switch to like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, Blackrock.Cons:5 days in-office (haven't worked remote in my life so I don't really mind this)Lower TC (?): Atlanta's cost of living is much lesser.Legacy Organization (?): This might play a part when trying to switch.Please help me navigate this. Are there any factors I am not considering or giving enough importance to?My primary thoughts were the TC difference is pretty huge to not be considering Capital One, although in a high CoL area. More tech-focused company. But that comes at the cost of being on your toes all the time, in an unstable market.Would you rather be in the DC Metro Area or in Atlanta? I do prefer the hot weather though haha.Edit: Removed some MBA-related stuff, as someone pointed out, is not relevant for now.",

I mean places where the work feels meaningful, you’re treated with basic respect, you can spend time with your family, and you’re not at risk of getting laid off at the snap of a finger.It feels like in the last 15 years, getting a high paying tech job has become part of people’s identities. The tradeoff is that a lot of us have lost touch with what it means to live a full life, where work is part of life instead of the whole thing. Hobbies, friends, family time, just being a human being. All of that gets pushed aside for the grind.I made the mistake of opening TeamBlind today and that place is a mess. Everything is about who has it worse, who has it better, or people endlessly hyping trillion-dollar companies like it’s their entire reason for being.I don’t expect big tech to magically grow a heart. At the end of the day, these are businesses. So in the spirit of keeping it real, I’d love for people to share workplaces where the culture is actually decent. I’m tired of seeing the 200th post about how terrible Amazon’s culture is. If someone wants a better life, they probably won’t find it in the belly of the beast.To be clear, this isn’t about discouraging anyone from aiming for MAANG if that’s what they want. Go for it. I just want to build a thread where people can say, here are the companies where you can have a career without sacrificing your entire life chasing something you never quite catch. Note : I'm aware that not all top tech companies are toxic, and it greatly depends on the team, please share those as well.",

        "content": "I was rejected but I’d love to see if I can get some honest feedback. I know it’s a lot but I need help because I’m not getting offers!Please take a look.It’s a Senior SRE role.# Patreon SRE – Live Debugging Round (Kubernetes)## Context* Goal of the round:Get a simple web app working end-to-end in Kubernetes and then discuss how to detect and prevent similar production issues.* Environment:Pre-created k8s cluster, multiple YAMLs (base / simple-webapp, test-connection client), some helper scripts.Interviewer explicitly said I could use kubectl and Google; she would also give commands when needed.* There were two main components: 1. Simple web app (server) 2. test-connection pod (client that calls the web app)---## Step 1 – Getting Oriented* At first I wasn’t in the correct namespace; the interviewer told me that and then switched me into the right namespace.* I said I wanted to understand the layout:* Look at the YAMLs and scripts to see what’s deployed.* I used kubectl get pods and kubectl describe to see which pods existed and what their statuses were.---## Step 2 – First Failure: ImagePullBackOff on the Web App* One of the simple-webapp pods was in ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull.* I described my reasoning:* This usually means the image name, registry, or tag is wrong or doesn’t exist.* I used kubectl describe pod to see the exact error; the message complained about pulling the image.* We inspected the deployment YAML and I noticed the image had a tag that clearly looked wrong (something like ...:bad-tag).* I said my hypothesis: the tag is invalid or not present in the registry.* The interviewer said for this exercise I could just use the latest tag, and explicitly told me to change it to :latest.* I asked if she was definitively telling me to use latest or just nudging me to research; she confirmed “use latest.”* I edited the YAML to use the latest tag and then, with her reminder, ran something like:* kubectl apply -f base.yaml (or equivalent)* After reapplying, the web app pod came up successfully with no more ImagePullBackOff.---## Step 3 – Second Failure: test-connection Pod Timeouts* Next, we focused on the test-connection pod that was meant to send HTTP requests to the web app.* I ran kubectl get pods and saw it was going into CrashLoopBackOff.* I used kubectl logs :* The logs showed repeated connection failures / HTTP timeouts when trying to reach the simple web app.* I wasn’t sure if the bug was on the client or server side, so I checked both:* Looked at simple-webapp logs: it wasn’t receiving requests.* Looked again at test-connection logs: client couldn’t establish a connection at all (not even 4xx/5xx — just timeouts).---## Step 4 – Finding the Port Mismatch (Service Bug)* The interviewer suggested, “Maybe something is off with the Service,” and told me to check that YAML.* I opened the simple-webapp Service definition in the base YAML.* I noticed the Service port was set to 81.* The interviewer asked, “What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.* I reasoned:* If the app container is listening on 8080 but the Service exposes 81, the test client will send traffic to 81 and never reach the app.* That matches the timeouts we saw in logs.* I changed the Service port 81 → 8080 and re-applied the YAML with kubectl apply.* The interviewer mentioned that status/health might lag a bit, and suggested I re-check the test-connection logs as the quickest validation.* I ran kubectl logs on the test-connection pod again:* This time, I saw valid HTML in the output, meaning the client successfully connected to the web app and got a response.* At that point, both pods were healthy and the end-to-end path (client → Service → web app) was working. Debugging portion complete.---## Step 5 – Postmortem & Observability DiscussionAfter the hands-on debugging, we shifted into more conceptual SRE discussion.1) How to detect this kind of issue without manually digging?I suggested:* Alerts on:* High CrashLoopBackOff / restart counts for pods.* Elevated timeouts / error rate for the client (e.g., synthetic test job).* Latency SLO violations if a probe endpoint starts timing out.* Use a synthetic “test-connection” job (like the one we just fixed) in production and alert if it fails consistently.2) How to prevent such misconfigurations from shipping?I proposed:* CI / linting for Kubernetes YAML:* If someone changes a Service port, require:* A justification in the PR, and/or* Matching updates to client configs, probes, etc.* If related configs not updated, fail CI or block the merge.* Staged / canary rollouts:* Roll new config to a small subset first.* Watch metrics (timeouts, restarts, error rate).* If they degrade, roll back quickly.* Config-level integration tests:* E.g., a test that deploys the Service and then curls it in-cluster, expecting HTTP 200.* If that fails in CI, don’t promote that config.3) General observability practicesI talked about:* Collecting metrics on:* Pod restarts, readiness/liveness probe failures.* HTTP success/error rates and latency from clients.* Shipping these to a monitoring stack (Datadog/Prometheus/Monarch-style).* Defining SLOs and alerting on error budget burn instead of only raw thresholds, to avoid noisy paging.# Patreon SRE System Design## Context* Format: 1:1 system design / infrastructure interview on a shared whiteboard / CodeSignal canvas.* Interviewer focus: “Design a simple web app, mainly from the infrastructure side.” Less about product features, more about backend/infra, scaling, reliability, etc.---## 1) Opening and Problem Framing* The interviewer started with something like: “Let’s design a simple web app. We’ll focus more on the infrastructure side than full product features.”* The prompt felt very underspecified to me. No concrete business case (not “design a rate limiter” or “notification system”) — just “a web app” plus some load numbers later.* I interpreted it as: “Design the infra and backend for a generic CRUD-style web app.”---## 2) My Initial High-Level ArchitectureWhat I said, roughly in order:* I described a basic setup:* A client (browser/mobile) sending HTTP requests.* A backend service layer running in Kubernetes.* An API gateway in front of the services.* Because he emphasized “infra side” and this was an SRE team, I leaned hard into Kubernetes immediately:* Talked about pods as replicas of the application services.* Mentioned nodes and the K8s control plane scheduling pods onto nodes.* Said the scheduler could use resource utilization to decide where to place pods and how many replicas to run.* When he kept asking “what kind of API gateway?”, I said:* Externally we’d expose a REST API gateway (HTTP/JSON).* Internally, we’d route to services over REST/gRPC.* Mentioned Cloudflare as an example of an external load balancer / edge layer.* Also said Kubernetes already gives us routing & LB (Service/Ingress), and we could have a gateway inside the cluster as well.---## 3) Traffic Numbers & Availability vs Consistency* He then gave rough load numbers:* About 3M users, about 1500 requests/min initially.* Later he scaled the hypothetical to 1500 requests/sec.* I said that at that scale I’d still design with availability in mind:* I repeated my general philosophy: I’d rather slightly over-engineer infra than under-engineer and get availability issues.* I stated explicitly that availability sounded more important than strict consistency:* No requirement about transactions, reservations, or financial double-spend.* I said something like: “Since we’re not talking about hard transactions, I’d bias toward availability over strict consistency.”* That was my implicit CAP-theorem call: default to AP unless clearly forced into CP.---## 4) Rate Limiting & Traffic Surges* When he bumped load to 1500 rps, I proposed:* Add a global rate limiter at the API gateway:* Use a sliding window per user + system-wide.* Look back over the last N seconds; if the count exceeds the threshold, we start dropping or deprioritizing those requests.* Optionally, send dropped/overflow events to a Kafka topic for auditing or offline processing.* I described the sliding-window idea in words:* Maintain timestamps of recent requests.* When a new request arrives, prune old timestamps and check if we’re still under the limit.* I framed the limiter as being attached to or just behind the gateway, based on my Google/Monarch mental model: Gateway → Rate Limiter → Services.* The interviewer hinted that rate limiting can happen even further left:* For example, Cloudflare or other edge/WAF/LB can do coarse-grained rate limiting before we even touch our own gateway.* I acknowledged that and said I hadn’t personally configured that pattern but it made sense.* In hindsight:* I was overly locked into “gateway-level” rate limiting.* I didn’t volunteer the “edge rate limiter” pattern until he nudged me.---## 5) Storage Choices & Scaling Writes* He asked where I’d store the app’s data.* I answered in two stages:1. Baseline: start with PostgreSQL (or similar):* Good relational modeling.* Strong indexing & query capabilities.2. Write-heavy scaling:* If writes become too heavy or sharding gets painful, move to a NoSQL store (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB, MongoDB).* I said NoSQL can be easier to horizontally shard and often handles very high write throughput better.* He seemed satisfied with this tradeoff explanation: Postgres first, NoSQL for heavier writes / easier sharding.---## 6) Scaling Reads & Caching* For read scaling, I suggested:* Add a cache in front of the DB, such as Redis or Memcached.* When he asked if this was “a single Redis instance or…?” I said:* Many teams use Redis as a single instance or small cluster.* At larger scale, I’d want a more robust leader / replica cache tier:* A leader handling writes/invalidations.* Replicas serving reads.* Health checks and a failover mechanism if the leader goes down.* I tied this back to availability:* Multiple cache nodes + leader election so the app doesn’t fall over when one node dies.* I also introduced CDC (Change Data Capture) for cache pre-warming:* Listen to the DB’s change stream / binlog.* When hot rows or tables change, proactively refresh those keys in Redis.* This reduces cache misses and makes read performance more stable.* The interviewer hadn’t heard CDC framed that way and said he learned something from it, which felt positive.---## 7) DDoS / Abuse Protection* He asked how I’d handle a DDoS or malicious traffic.* My answer:* Lean on rate limiting and edge protection:* Use Cloudflare/WAF rules to drop/slow bad IPs or UA patterns.* Use the gateway rate limiter as a second line of defense.* The principle: drop bad traffic as far left as possible so it never reaches core services.* This was consistent with the earlier sliding-window limiter description, but I could have been more explicit about multi-layered protection.---## 8) Deployment Safety, CI/CD & Rollouts* He then moved to deployment safety: how to ship 30–40 times per day without breaking things.* I talked about:a) CI + Linters for Config Changes* Have linters / static checks that:* Flag risky changes in infra/config files (ports, service names, critical flags).* If you touch a sensitive config (like a service port), the pipeline forces you to either:* Update all dependent configs, or* Provide an explicit justification in the PR.* If you don’t, CI fails.* The goal is to prevent subtle config mismatches from even reaching staging.b) Canary / Phased Rollouts* Start with a small slice of traffic (e.g., 3%).* If metrics look good, step up: 10% → 20% → 50% → 100%.* At each stage, monitor:* Error rate.* Latency.* Availability.c) Rollback Strategy* Maintain old and new versions side by side (blue/green or canary).* Use dashboards with old-version vs new-version metrics colored differently.* If new-version metrics spike in errors or latency while old-version remains flat, that’s a strong indicator to rollback.* He seemed to like this part; this matches what many SRE orgs do.---## 9) Security (e.g., SQL Injection)* He asked about protecting against SQL injection and bad input.* My answer, in hindsight, was weaker here:* I mentioned:* Use a service / library to validate inputs.* Potentially regex-based sanitization.* I didn’t clearly say:* Prepared statements / parameterized queries everywhere.* Never string-concatenate SQL.* Use least-privilege DB roles.* So while directionally OK, this answer wasn’t as crisp or concrete as it could have been.",

After reaching out the customer support, they were able to fix the issue and they said it was suspended due to suspicious login activity.While troubleshooting, I browsed through LI sub, and I noticed there were several people whose accounts were banned. It could be real time ID verification failures, arguments in comment, etc. I was fortunate to get it resolved in hours, but some cases it took **weeks**. Apparently, making a new account will also result in a ban.If this were to happen during middle of job search, it could seriously feel devastating, losing visibility, recruiter conversations, access to the job application, submitted apps, etc.I realized it doesn't hurt to have a back up.

I guess I'm just looking for opinions or other places to look. Or does Payscale seem accurate to everyone?",

        "content": "Hey, Quick BG—> 3rd year engineering major (focused around software and embedded systems) I work in software primarily (co-ops) 2x Analyst / SDE Co-ops at mid to large size companies in Canada. I feel like traditional coding//problem solving is almost lost. I remember actually liking computers back in school (mid 2010s) and I’m not sitting on a high horse saying I’m better than anyone who prolly went into the field for money or any other reason because that’s not the viewpoint I’m judging this situation from.I’m seeing the market is almost trashed with students who mostly vibe code or really “cracked” students who are building up companies // are also TAs at the same time // also 2x at Amazon. For one end of the spectrum, every other persons got Claude, cursor, Copilot and putting up something in their Bio like “Building (insert words)ly”. You know I felt like in this field there’s a learning part as well where you take the time to get hands on with code , not quickly build something or use AI straight away. AI is great for learning and speed but the way its used to build projects which the “builders” themselves can’t explain most of the code for is pretty shocking. I feel like a lot of GitHub is just trashed with students uploading vibe coded react and next js projects. The other end is filled with really good students who somehow intern in their first year , have 5x internships by 3rd year and go on to be content creators and founders or whatever. Can’t complain about them as such because they probably do good but the question comes here, Where are the people who actually take the time to learn things , maybe not go so fast (I’m aware people have differences in learning speeds but it’s very absurd with the way it’s going). What I mean is the emphasis on theory and understanding stuff little by little , building up on it and then going onto be a very Good software engineer/ programmer / problem solver. As I said people probably can learn quickly but it almost feels like there’s no time on the software side of things to actually learn things properly (Web dev/ App dev the fields I’ve worked in). However on the other side of my degree which has circuits and embedded systems , it’s not so easy to get in and you can’t fake your way into it either. The barrier to entry is very high but at the same time if you’re good at your job you’re not easy to replace either. It still has the essence of the old comp sci when it was a subject to me in middle school. Everyone at the time I feel (mid 2010s) took the time to learn stuff and didn’t go so fast but the good part of the trade was they were genuinely very good at what they did. I don’t think that’s the case anymore today , and I’m only speaking about this from the entry level viewpoint. Would love an opinion from the more experienced and traditional devs about what they think of this.",

        "content": "Hey all, I just graduated from CS from a T50 school. I quit my non technical job in Dec 2024 to focus fully on building my resume and learn web development. I have been applying to roles since January of 25' but it wasn't until August ish that I actually had a decent resume with Full Stack projects, 2 hackathons(including a 3rd place overall), I did a small internship at my school where I used Wordpress. I then also launched a startup solo, I have about 10 non paying users but hopefully it keeps growing. At the same time I have been doing freelance work, from landing pages to SaaS stuff. I have also been networking a lot, been present in almost all cs school events. I got referrals for Microsoft and other local companies(no luck). All while applying to 50 ish jobs per week since April-May.I have only been able to do like 5 phone screenings, a few follow up interviews, 1 technical at a startup and a final non-technical round at a f500 company but for a web marketing role(no leetcode). I have great soft skills and a lot of projects I can talk about so that is really not an issue for me. I have been griding leetcode on and off and I hate it too but what can we do. Now that I graduated this december, I decided that I dont want to keep waiting, so I took a role at the GeekSquad and am studying for my CompTIA Network+. I also won a coding event at my school and got a free voucher for the AZ-500 for next year.I do enjoy development but the market has been terrible for me. I was thinking that maybe It will be a good idea to try to go the IT route and eventually aim for DevOps roles or SRE. I also have a minor in PM so those roles work as well for me.(I have been applying for all sorts of roles)Has anyone done anything similar? Will going into IT now be a good strategy to ride out the job market?Thank you all in advance!! TL:DR Been applying for tech roles without luck for about a year and heavy for about 6 months, no luck. I just graduated and instead of waiting I decided to break into IT, get some certs and apply hard for entry level roles. Was wondering if anyone has done something similar and if this can be a good strategy to ride out the market?",

It’s part of AWS and focuses on backend infrastructure + distributed systems. Large-scale data pipelines, internal platform work, and high-throughput services. High pressure on individual performance.Adobe - Software Engineer I (San Jose, CA):Base: 136KSign-on Bonus: 10K (pre-tax)Relocation: 5KVesting: 24% first yearTeam: Role in org focused on building internal tools, policy enforcement systems, and automated pipelines that detect or mitigate harmful/abusive content/behavior across products.What I want to know is:• How retention stability compares between the two companies• How the engineering experience differs (AWS infra/distributed systems vs. product/platform-oriented work)• Expected work-life balance differences Team: Returning to the org I interned with. It’s part of AWS and focuses on backend infrastructure + distributed systems. Large-scale data pipelines, internal platform work, and high-throughput services. High pressure on individual performance.Adobe - Software Engineer I (San Jose, CA):Base: 136KSign-on Bonus: 10K (pre-tax)Relocation: 5KVesting: 24% first yearTeam: Role in org focused on building internal tools, policy enforcement systems, and automated pipelines that detect or mitigate harmful/abusive content/behavior across products.What I want to know is:• How retention stability compares between the two companies• How the engineering experience differs (AWS infra/distributed systems vs. product/platform-oriented work)• Expected work-life balance differences• General culture differences for new grads• Future mobility into bigger companies (ie. other big tech, etc)• Seattle vs San Jose for early career living (weather, lifestyle, career ecosystem), assuming I plan to move back to NYC in 5 years (also internal transfers to different locations for each company)P.S. More personal thoughts:I interned at AWS, but I didn’t really connect with my team, and my project was pretty separate from what they actually worked on. Because of that, I still don’t have a solid grasp on what the full-time role would feel like day to day. I also didn’t love the overall Amazon culture, which makes me a bit hesitant about returning.Location is another factor. I’m from NYC and very used to walkability and easy access to everything. Seattle seems closer to that lifestyle, while San Jose feels much more suburban. I’m trying to figure out how much that should weigh into my decision since I plan to move back to NYC eventually.I’m also unsure which role sets me up better long-term (prestige/growth). I’m curious how hiring managers view early-career experience at AWS vs Adobe and which one tends to offer more mobility down the line.",

My thinking is:* It addresses the technical gap that's costing me job offers* It gives me academic credentials I currently lack* It positions me for AI/ML product roles where technical depth really matters* It explains the employment gap constructivelyFor those who've been in similar situations or work in AI/ML product - what would you do? Is the technical MSc worth it, or should I take a different approach?",

We support 1 main business function but we literally have dozens of applications that do completely different things and have entirely different frame works. There is a dedicated SME for each main application and we have 1 tech lead. I’m not sure what the point of a tech lead is because there is no way one person could understand ALL of my team’s applications.This is why I don’t think agile works for my team. We all write our own stories. The developers are prey try much entirely in charge of projects. Our scrum master and project managers have no idea what our work is even on a business/non technical level. They have no idea what our stories mean. Their entire job is planing meetings and asking for updates. I feel silly even giving updates because they have no idea what I’m talking about. All of the responsibility is on me.We pretty much have to lead our own agile ceremonies and plan our work. No one on the scrum agile side knows what’s going on, and I don’t blame them because no one on our technical team knows everything about all the apps we support. The agile leadership hates when we roll over and when we don’t have fast “churn” rate for our stories. Did I mention we support a 24/7 operation and have on call rotation? Even in those scenarios they freak out when stories don’t get done because we have to support something urgent…The constant made up deadlines every two weeks is making me miserable. No one knows how to do my job or what I do. Why do we work like this when none of us are working on anything related? It feels more like a micro manage monitoring tool rather than a way to efficiently manage projects. Is this normal?",

Its been about three weeks, and in my first day I was handed this codebase and was asked to go through some parts, some of which I understand, some of which I don't. There's no documentation at all, I have been asking chatgpt to explain what I don't get.But thats about it to be honest. I don't have a clue on how to contribute. I don't even know where to begin to ask a question, and when I do have a question I hear terms that I have barely heard before and try to clear it up with the senior who usually gives a sort of dismissive answer because the senior is busy (which I understand tbh)I don't want to sound like I'm complaining. It's a wonderful opportunity, and I need to take full advantage of it. But between trying to understand the monolithic layers of code and using all my free time in the day to implement my own mini projects and trying to understand how to implement my own knowledge (still have to google alot of it), I don't seem to know a better way to use my time to learn so that I can start atleast writing some methods in their codebase.Any advice, or help? Kinda going nuts. And if it's a messy read, was just dumping my thoughts.Thank you!Tldr: Hard time during internship and need help to learn to contribute to their code and learn effectively.",

The new company uses Python with FastAPI and GCP, both of which I have no prior experience in.I'm not scared to learn new things however I don't know if having so many different languages and tech stacks will make my resume look all over the place, cause i already have bullet points highlighting my work with React, Next.js, React Native, Express, Fastify, .NET, AWS...

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Context:I'm entering my final year of undergrad, and going into my final internship next summer. Throughout university, I've always dreamt of working in NYC full-time, and I was hoping my final internship will lead to a FT RO there. And luckily, I was fortunate enough to get an offer from a mid-size startup (that I believe doesn't have much room for growth) in NYC. By surprise, I also got an offer to intern at a FAANG+ company I believe in, located in SF.Now, I'm really torn as to what to do moving forward.On one hand, I really resonate with the saying \"you're only in your 20s once.\" I've always wanted to experience NYC in my 20s and now I have the opportunity to do so, albeit for a short period of time. People say that summers in NYC have a certain charm to them, and I definitely want to experience this first-hand. Since I'm bearish on the company's future, I would probably still have to recruit full-time for new grad even if I do get an RO, but at least the RO would be in a location I really cherish.On the other hand, the FAANG+ company definitely seems like the safer bet - I get more resume value, more long-term career growth, and their full-time TC is a little higher simply due to publicly traded stock. The people around me say it'll give me more leverage to recruit full-time in NYC, but full-time recruiting is definitely difficult, the market is not looking too hot, and NYC is a very competitive location to break into. I also do have Amazon on my resume, so I don't know if this is diminishing returns.Not really sure if I'm thinking straight. Am I sacrificing the potential of long-term growth for the short-term pleasure of living in the city I want? I'm a firm believer in \"the city shapes you,\" and I definitely think NYC lines much more closer with my beliefs in that sense than SF. However, this is an internship, and maybe choosing what's better for my career is more sensible.What are your thoughts? Any advice? Would appreciate any insight into this Some more context:When I received the offer for the FAANG+ company, I lightly requested to move it to Fall since they have Fall cohorts, but they declined (I also didn't have leverage so I did say I would be happy to work in the summer if it's not possible). However this was before the NYC offer came through. Now, I definitely have more leeway to give an ultimatum since I have another offer, but I'm not sure if potentially burning this bridge is worth the upside.",

I work on product at my current company, but I've naturally evolved into an \"internal consultant\" role. I often help other teams get unblocked, architecting solutions, and guiding projects that touch my specialization. I genuinely love this aspect of my work.The idea of doing this at scale as an FDE, traveling to different companies, solving complex technical problems, applying deep expertise in varied contexts sounds amazing on paper. But here's my concern: **are FDEs expected to hit sales quotas and revenue targets?**Because if it's 50% consulting engineer and 50% hitting numbers/closing deals, that's a hard pass for me. I want to solve technical problems, not chase quarterly targets.* Has anyone made a transition from SWE to FDE? What was your experience?* Do FDEs actually have sales targets, or is it purely technical delivery?* How does comp/WLB compare to traditional SWE roles?",

But I recently graduated with a Masters in Computer Engineering where I took courses in computer architecture, real time operating systems and network security. I started to get more interested in the more software related topics like Linux Kernel programming, parallel processing etc.Since I am an international in the US and have visa restrictions, I had to take whatever job I got and my prior experience helped me lad a job as an embedded systems engineer in a mechatronics based company but I dread it now. I so want to move to the software domain but my work experience (of over five years ) bogs me down and I already feel like it's too late and hard to change my career (i turned 30 recently). What I'd basically like to know is, will staying in this job hurt my chances of moving to the software side? I want interviewers to stop viewing me as an electromechanical software engineer and land interviews in computer engineering field. If I take my time and build personal projects, can I move to the career that I want or is it not as easy at it seems?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello friends,I'm a recent new grad, and landed my first role that's more Data Analysis oriented than actual software development. It's a small, long running company that has recently fallen under a giant corporate conglomerate in a heavily regulated industry. As I've been informed, there was a push after the purchase ~5 years ago to move off the company's old mainframe and DB/2 infrastructure to something more cloud oriented.I'm essentially the only technical person the team today. I report to the Manager and to the IT Manager. The former has little technical knowledge, and the latter is in a unique situation that he's parttime, only available after hours, and not a developer.### Background, skip if you want toMy predecessor (and his predecessor) have built a hodgepodge of systems, scripts, and queries to manage the workflows. There's a mix of automated and manual pieces today. The vast majority is very much undocumented. It's a mix of low/no-code systems for many automated tasks, a mass of manually run SQL queries (largely pulled then altered from our main software package), and various scripts and programs running elsewhere. One such workflow required me to log in to Grandpa Predecessor's computer, launch Docker for a single database, upload newest data from a different source, run queries that need further interpretation, and then shut it all down again.It's all a bit of a mess. After I've put out the fires that were left behind in my wake (and found an enormous amount of missed/missing data...), I have some time and the go-ahead to audit everything that's left to me. I'm already entrusted to handle things as I see fit (everybody panic!), and there's *a lot* of worrying things going on (most queries and programs and such are just tested on prod!).My questions relate to how I'm going to be handling a lot of this. I don't have prior industry experience to rely on. I also don't have any idea if I have any budget or anything. Our corporate overlords are still early in planning stages for actually incorporating us and bringing us onto their systems, so I can't really use their stuff or even really know what they us.### QuestionsWhen it comes to software packages/libraries/etc, at this point I need things that can be self-hosted, and free for commercial use (presumably?).1. Is there some simple ticketing platform I can manage and utilize, even if it's only for me personally without others submitting?2. Is there a good documentation tool available for cataloging scripts, queries, workflows, etc? Is a wiki appropriate for this? Would prefer some way to retrieve PDFs for documentation at times.3. Any recommendations for tracking work? Thinking of things like A and B are in a blocked state for internal response, C needs Testing, X and Y are in production, Q is on fire and needs immediate attention.4. What are some decent ways to create an easy dashboard for my own usage, perhaps related to Question 3? I'm utterly abysmal at front-end web dev, but could probably give it a go on the clock.5. What else should I be keeping in mind? Any general advice?### Next StepsI am severely underpaid, and under mentored, for the work that will be expected of me. Fortunately, my benefits and PTO are actually pretty good, and I'm in a very favorable living situation so the low pay isn't a killer for me just yet.How do I keep track of all of this and present it in a way that leads to a sizeable pay/title bump in a year? I expect I'll also try the market out as well. I understand that my situation is not great for long term growth, but I do want to make the best of what's in front of me and strive to leave things better than where I found them.",
