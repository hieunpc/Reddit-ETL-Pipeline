        "content": "Recently interviewed at DoorDash. Onsite had 4 rounds System Design, Data Modeling, Business Partner and Leadership The recruiter who had reached out regarding the role had transferred my profile to other recruiter at onsite process. This new recruiter , not friendly. In a cold email said that I should book time on her calendar for a prep call. Well there was not a single slot available for next 3 weeks. I kept checking for couple of days and finally found one. On the day of call she rescheduled for different time. On the call read the same pdf that she had shared with me over the email on what to expect. Not a great conversation. I’ve met really good recruiters who are friendly enough. System Design question - question was quite big 6-7 lines. I’ll put it in simple words - Design DataBricks! Yes, you read it right! Interviewer was interested in knowing how will I write exact YAML code for this. I was able to answer all his questions.Data Modeling - Design fitness app. But the interviewer wanted me to draw visualizations. Well never in my past 8 years of work experience I had to do any visualizations but looks like DE in DoorDash work on visualizations as well. It wasn’t a basic graph , some advanced trend graph. Business Partner - DoorDash expanding business how will you go about it etc. basic questions interviewer also seem to be onboarded on the approachesLeadership - Hiring Manager joined 2-3 minutes late. Didn’t bother to apologize. I ignored that and continued to talk with my positive energy. He said he will leave 10 minutes at the end for me to ask any questions. Questions were normal tell me about the time kind. Situation based. I answered all. He had multiple follow up questions. Kept asking something from the list. It was almost 5 minutes to end the meeting and then he stopped and started sharing about the team. Even here he didn’t ask if I have any questions. I had to ask him when we were at time if I can ask couple of questions. I felt like I performed well.Next day morning Recruiter’s cold email came in that team has not decided to move forward. Happy to answer any questions anyone has.",

        "content": "I’ve been in FAANG for about 5 years now, across multiple teams and orgs (new data teams, SDE-heavy teams, BI-heavy teams, large and small setups), and one thing that’s consistently surprised me is how little classic data modeling I’ve actually seen applied in practice.When I joined as a junior/intern, I expected things like proper dimensional modeling, careful handling of changing business meaning, SCD Type 2 being a common pattern, and shared dimensions that teams actually align on — but in reality most teams seem extremely execution-focused, with the job dominated by pipelines, orchestration, data quality, alerts, lineage, governance, security, and infra, while modeling and design feel like maybe 5–10% of the work at most.Even at senior levels, I’ve often found that concepts like “ensuring the business meaning of a column doesn’t silently change” or why SCD2 exists aren’t universally understood or consistently applied. In tech-driven organizations it is more structured, but in business-driven organizations it's less structued (Organization I mean ±100-300 people organization).My logic is because compute and storage got so much cheapier over the years, the effort/benefit ratio is not there in as many situations.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "https://i.redd.it/fsa3dtvkfrgg1.gifHello all!I'm new in this subreddit! I'm a Data Engineer with +3 years of experience in the field.As shown in the attached image, I'm making an ETL simulator in JavaScript, that simulates the data flow in a pipeline.Recently I came across a Linkedin post of a guy showcasing this project : [https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival](https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival)He made a little tower defense game that interactively teaches Cloud Architecture basics.It was interesting to see the engagement of the DevOps community with the project. Many have starred and contributed to the Github repo.I'm thinking about building something silimar for Data Engineers, given that I have some background in Game Dev and UI/UX too. I still need your opinion though, to see whether or not it is going to be that useful, especially that it will take some effort to come up with something polished, and AI can't help much with that (I'm coding all of the logic manually).The idea is that I want to make it easy to learn Apache Spark internals and distributed computing principles. I noticed that many Data Engineers (at least here in France), including seniors/experts, say they know how to use Apache Spark, yet they don't deeply understand what's happening under the hood.Through this game, I'll try to concretize the abstract concepts and show how they impact the execution performance, such as : transformations/actions, wide/narrow transformations, shuffles, repartition/coalesce, partitions skew, spills, node failures, predicate pushdown, ...etcYou'll be able to build pipelines by stacking transformer blocks. The challenge will be to produce a given dataframe using the provided data sources, while avoiding performance killers and node failures. In the animated image above, the sample pipeline is equivalent to the following Spark line : `new_df = source_df.filter($\"shape\" === \"star\").withColumn(\"color\", lit(\"orange\"))`I represented the rows with shapes. The dataframe schema will remain static (shape, color, label) and the rendering of each shape reflects the content of the row it represents. Dataframe here is a set of shapes.I'm still hesitant about this representation. Do you think it is intuitive and easy to understand ? I can always revert to the standard tabular visualisation of rows with dynamic schemas, but I guess it won't look user friendly when there are a lot of rows in action.The next step will be to add logical multi-node clusters in order to simulate the distributed computing. The heaviest task that I estimated would be the implementation of the data shuffling.I'll share the source code within the next few days, the project needs some final cleanups.In the meanwhile, feel free to comment or share anything helpful :)",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’ve been spending time lately looking into how big tech companies use specific phrasing to mask (or highlight) their updates, especially with all the chip investment deals going on. Earlier this week, I was going through the Microsoft earnings call transcript and (based on what seems like shared sentiment in the market), I was curious how Fabric was represented. From my armchair analyst position, its adoption just doesn’t seem to line up with what I assumed would exist by now...On the recent FY26 Q2 call, Satya said:>Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric's annual revenue run rate is now over $2 billion with over 31,000 customers... revenue up 60% year over year.The first thing that made me skeptical is the type of metrics used for Fabric. “Annual revenue run rate” is NOT the same as “we actually generated $2B over the last 12 months.” This is super normal when startups report earnings, since if a product is growing, run rate can look great even when realized trailing revenue is still catching up. Microsoft chose run rate wording here.Then I looked at the previous earnings where Fabric was discussed. In FY25 Q3, they said Fabric had 21k paid customers and “40% using Real-Time Intelligence” five months after GA, but “using” isn’t defined in a way that’s tangible, which usually is telling. In last week’s earnings, Satya immediately discusses specific metrics, customer references, etc. for other products.A huge part of why I’m also not convinced on adoption is because of the forced Power BI capacity migration. I know the world is all about financial engineering, and since Microsoft forced us all to migrate off of P-SKUs, it’s not hard to advertise those numbers as great. The conspiracist in me says the numbers line up a little too neatly with the SKU migration:* $2B in revenue run rate / 31,000 customers ≈ $64.5k per customer per year. * That’s conveniently right around the published price of an F64 reservationObviously an average is oversimplifying it, and I don’t think Microsoft is lying about the metrics whatsoever, but I do think the phrasing doesn’t line up with the marketing and what my account team says…The other thing I saw was how Microsoft talks when they have deeper adoption. They normally use harder metrics like customers >$1M, big deployments, customer references, etc. In the same FY26 Q2 transcript, Fabric gets the run-rate/customer count and then the conversation moves on. And that’s it. After that, I was surprised that Fabric was never mentioned on its own again, nor expanded upon, and outside of that sentence, Fabric was always mentioned with Foundry.Earnings reports aren't everything, and 31,000 customers is a lot, so I went looking for proof in customer stories, and the majority of the stories are just implementation partners and consultancies whose practices depend on selling Fabric (Boutiques/Avanade types), not a flood of end-customer production migrations with scale numbers. (There are are a couple of enterprise stories like LSEG and Microsoft’s internal team, but it doesn’t feel like “no shortage.”)Please check me. Am I off base here? Or is the growth just because of the forced migration from Power BI?",

        "author": "Lastrevio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm reading \"Spark: The Definitive\" guide and there's a part about how user defined functions in Python can be inefficient. This is the quote: \"When you use the function, there are essentially two different things that occur. If the function is written in Scala or Java, you can use it within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that there will be little performance penalty aside from the fact that you can’t take advantage of code generation capabilities that Spark has for builtin functions. There can be performance issues if you create or use a lot of objects; we cover that in the section on optimization in Chapter 19. If the function is written in Python, something quite different happens. Spark starts a Python process on the worker, serializes all of the data to a format that Python can understand (remember, it was in the JVM earlier), executes the function row by row on that data in the Python process, and then finally returns the results of the row operations to the JVM and Spark.Starting this Python process is expensive, but the real cost is in serializing the data to Python. This is costly for two reasons: it is an expensive computation, but also, after the data enters Python, Spark cannot manage the memory of the worker. This means that you could potentially cause a worker to fail if it becomes resource constrained (because both the JVM and Python are competing for memory on the same machine). We recommend that you write your UDFs in Scala or Java—the small amount of time it should take you to write the function in Scala will always yield significant speed ups, and on top of that, you can still use the function from Python!\" I heard from Reddit that this book was written a long time ago and some things may be outdated. Is this still relevant with the latest versions of Spark? Are Python UDFs still significantly slower than Scala/Java UDFs in Spark? If yes, have you ever encountered a situation at work where someone actually wrote a UDF in Scala or Java and avoided using Python for the sake of performance increases?",

        "author": "Ulfrauga",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "As title. **When** ***shouldn't*** **we go through the efforts of building a dimensional model?** To me, it's a bit of a grey area. But how do I pick out the black and white? When I'm giving feedback, questioning and making suggestions about the aspects of the design as developed - and it's not a dim model - I'll tend to default to \"should be a dim model\". I'm concerned that's a rigid and incorrect stance. I'm vaguely aware that a dim model is not always the way to go, but *when is that?*Background: I have 7 years in DE, 3 years before that in SW. I've learned a bunch, but often fall back on what are considered best practices if I lack the depth or breadth of experience. When, and when *not* to use a dim model is one of these areas.Most our use cases are A) Reports in Power BI. Occasionally, B) Returning specific, flat information. For B, it could *still* come from a dim model. This leads me to think that a dim model is a go-to, with doing otherwise is the exception.Problem of the day: There's a repeating theme at work. Models put together by a colleague are never strict dims/facts. It's *relational*, so there is a logical star, but it's not as clear-cut as a few facts and their dimensions. Measures and attributes remain mixed. They'll often say that the data and/or model is small: there is a handful of tables; less than hundreds of millions of rows.I get the balance between *ship now* and *do it properly, methodically, follow a pattern*. But, whether there are 5 tables or 50, I am stuck on the thought that your 5-table data source *still* has some business process to be considered. There are *still* measures and attributes to break out.EDIT: Some rephrasing. I was coming across as \"back up my opinion\". I'm actually looking for the opposite.",

I wanted to share some things I learned getting to column-level at scale.**My main problem**Someone changes a column in a source table. Which downstream dashboards break Table-level lineage says \"everything connected to this table\" (useless, 200 false positives). Column-level says \"these 3 specific dashboard fields\", which is actually helpful.**What didn't work****My first attempt: Regex parsing SQL**Wrote a bunch of regex to pull column names from SELECT statements. Worked for simple queries. Completely fell apart with CTEs, subqueries, and window functions.Example that broke it: WITH customers AS (   SELECT      c.id as customer_key,     c.email as contact_email   FROM raw.customers c ) SELECT customer_key, contact_email FROM customersMy regex couldn't track that customer\\_key came from c.id. I gave up after 2 weeks.**My 2nd attempt: Query INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA only**Thought we could just use Snowflake's metadata tables to see column relationships. **Nope**. INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA tells you schemas exist, not how data flows through queries.I found success by parsing SQL properly with an actual parser, not regex. I used sqlparse for Python but JSQLParser works if you live in Java world.Query Snowflake's QUERY\\_HISTORY view, parse every SELECT/INSERT/CREATE TABLE AS statement, build a graph of column → column relationships.**The architecture** Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY    ↓ Extract SQL (last 7 days of queries)   ↓ SQL Parser (sqlparse)   ↓ Column Mapper (track renames/transforms)   ↓ Graph DB (Neo4j) + Search (Elasticsearch) import sqlparse from snowflake.connector import connect # Pull recent queries queries = snowflake.execute(\"\"\"   SELECT query_text    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY    WHERE query_type IN ('SELECT', 'INSERT', 'CREATE_TABLE_AS_SELECT')   AND start_time > DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) \"\"\") for query_text in queries:     parsed = sqlparse.parse(query_text)[0]          # Extract SELECT columns     select_cols = extract_columns(parsed)          # Extract FROM tables and resolve schemas     source_tables = extract_tables(parsed)          # Handle SELECT * by querying schema     if has_star_select(select_cols):         select_cols = resolve_star_expressions(source_tables)          # Build edges: source_col -> output_col     for output_col in select_cols:         for input_col in output_col.dependencies:             graph.add_edge(                 from_col=f\"{input_col.table}.{input_col.name}\",                 to_col=f\"{output_col.table}.{output_col.name}\",                 transform_type=output_col.transform             )**Some issues I ran into****1. SELECT \\* resolution**When you see SELECT \\* FROM customers JOIN orders, you need to know what columns exist in both tables at query execution time. Can't parse this statically.The solution is to Query INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA.COLUMNS to get table schemas, then expand \\* to the actual column list.**2. Column aliasing chains** SELECT    customer_id as c_id,   c_id as cust_id,  -- references the alias above   cust_id as final_idYou have to track the alias chain through the entire query. The symbol table gets really messy really fast.**3. Subqueries and CTEs**Each level of nesting creates a new namespace. The parser needs to track which customer\\_id is which when you have 3 nested CTEs all selecting customer\\_id.**4. Window functions and aggregates**SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY customer\\_id) means the output column depends on revenue (for the calculation) and customer\\_id (for the partition), but differently.Your lineage graph needs different edge types: \"aggregates,\" \"partitions\\_by,\" \"direct\\_reference.\"**Performance at 50K tables**Parsing 7 days of query history (about 500K queries): 2 hours Storage: Neo4j graph (200M edges), Elasticsearch (column name search) Query time: \"Show me everything downstream of this column\" = sub-2 seconds Query time: \"Where is customer\\_id used?\" = sub-1 secondTo save yourself a future headache, save the 20% of lineage paths that get queried 80% of the time.**What I’m still struggle with**Cross-warehouse lineage. My data flows Snowflake → Databricks → back to Snowflake. This approach only sees the Snowflake side.Real-time updates. I run lineage extraction every 6 hours. If someone on my team changes a column and immediately asks \"what breaks?\", they get stale data.ML pipelines. Notebooks that do df.select(\"customer\\_id\") don't show up in Snowflake query logs. That’s a blind spot.What's your current table count? Curious where others hit the breaking point. Sorry for the wall of text!",

I keep trying to steer it back to the TEAM's performance/delivery/whatever, but here we are. :(One initial idea I had was tracking story points committed vs completed per sprint, but I'm concerned this doesn't map well to reality. Especially because points are team relative, work varies in complexity, and of course there are always interruptions/support work that can get unevenly distributed.I've also suggested tracking cycle time trends per individual (but NOT comparisons...), and defining role specific KPIs, since not every single engineer does the same type of work.Unfortunately leadership wants something more uniform and explicitly individual.So I'm curious to know from DE or even leaders that browse this subreddit:* if your org tracks individual performance KPIs for data engineers and data scientists, what does that actually look like? * what worked well? what backfired?Any real world examples would be appreciated.",

        "author": "seagullbreadloaf",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I'm currently working in a data science role but was thinking about making the switch to data engineering. I have a background in statistics and have been working as a data scientist in biomedical research in academia for 1.5 years. This is my first job since finishing my Masters in statistics. When I first started the job, I was responsible for cleaning datasets from clinical trials (this was 90% of the work), statistical modeling, creating visual aids like graphs and charts, and presenting and explaining my work to biologists. After 6 months, my manager told me I \"wasn't a good fit\" for the role because I \"lack curiosity\". I wouldn't say he was wrong. I didn't mind the work but it also didn't excite me and I didn't find it that fulfilling.I was transferred to a different team within the same company and my main project became writing programming scripts to automate compression of thousands of files from patient databases, and creating lookup tables containing information on all the files (such as patient identifiers, visit dates, etc.) This involved a lot of identifying and sometimes renaming files that were mislabeled, had missing information, or used different naming conventions, and make sure these edge cases were accounted for in the compression process. We also received multiple batches of files from different sources, and I had to modify the scripts to account for all the nuances between different sources. I noticed I enjoyed these projects much more and that I'm very precise and good at paying close attention to small details. I liked how expectations were more well-defined with this project and was more like \"it either works or it doesn't\", rather than the previous data science role which was much more open-ended. I feel like I do better when expectations are more structured and consistent, rather than exploratory. My new manager also noticed the new role was a much better fit for me.That being said, I'm thinking about pivoting into data engineering for my next role because I feel it may be a better fit for me. I've been looking at job postings for data engineering roles, but I don't have many of the skills required for a lot of these roles. My work so far has mainly been in R since that's what my company uses, and I've had some exposure to SQL and Python. I know Python and SQL are important in data engineering and tech is all about transferable skills, but I feel like I don't yet have the toolbox to switch to data engineering, nor do I have strong software engineering skills. I'm also not sure if I will be a strong candidate considering how competitive the job market is nowadays. My plan for now is to learn the important skills so that I'm able to make the switch.Those of you who switched from data science to data engineering, what was your experience like and how did you navigate that shift? What are the most important data engineering skills/tools I should familiarize myself with to become a competitive candidate and be ready for interviews? What are some good resources you would suggest for learning these skills/tools? And do you have any general advice for me?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,I have inherited a pipeline where some of the inputs are reference data that are uploaded by analysts via CSV files.The current ingestion design for these is quite inflexible. The reference data is tied to a year dimension, but the way things have been set up is that the analyst needs to include the year which the data is for in the filename. So, you need one CSV for every year that there is data for.e.g. we have two CSV files, the first is *some\\_data\\_2024.csv* which would have contents:|id|foo||:-|:-||1|423||2|1|the second is *some\\_data\\_2021.csv* which would have contents:|id|foo||:-|:-||1|13||2|10|These would then appear in the final silver table as 4 rows:|year|id|foo||:-|:-|:-||2024|1|423||2024|2|1||2021|1|13||2021|2|10|Which means that to upload many years' worth of data, you have to create and upload many CSV files all named after the year they belong to. I find this approach pretty convoluted. There is also no way to delete a bad record unless you replace it. (It can't be removed entirely).Now the pattern I want to go to is just allow the analysts to upload a singular CSV file with a year column. Whatever is in there will be what is in the final downstream table. In other words, the third table above will be what they upload. If they want to remove a record just reupload that singular CSV without that record. I figure this is much simpler. I will have a staging table that captures the entire upload history and then the final silver table just selecting all records from the latest upload.What do we think? Please let me know if I should add more details.",

        "content": "Hello everyone,I have a dataflow pulling data from a same Unity Catalog on Databricks.The dataflow contains only four tables: three small ones and one large one (a little over 1 million rows). No transformation is being done. Data is all strings, lot of null values but no huge stringsThe connection is made via a service principal, but the dataflow won’t complete a refresh because of the large table. When I check the refresh history, the three small tables are loaded successfully, but the large one gets stuck in a loop and times out after 24 hours.What’s strange is that we have other dataflows pulling much more data from different data sources without any issues. This one, however, just won’t load the 1 million row table. Given our capacity, this should be an easy task.Has anyone encountered a similar scenario?What do you think could be the issue here? Could this be a bug related to Dataflow Gen1 and the Databricks connection, possibly limiting the amount of data that can be loaded?Thanks for reading!",

I should also mention that I have very little experience in the Data Engineering field, and I haven’t worked in an organization that has a standard or mature Data Engineering team. My knowledge mostly comes from what I studied, and for some topics it’s only at a surface level, with little real hands-on experience.I currently work in an organization that does not have sufficient resources to recruit highly skilled Data Engineering personnel, and most of the work is driven by the data analytics team. The current systems were mostly built to solve immediate, short-term problems. Because of this, I have several questions and would like to seek advice from experienced members of this community.My questions are divided into several parts, as follows:* What kind of Data Tech Stack would be most appropriate (Open Source, Cloud Services, or Hybrid)?* For a Data Orchestrator, is a code-based approach (such as Dagster or Airflow) or a GUI-based approach (such as SSIS) better in the long run, especially if the Data Engineering team needs to scale?* What roles should exist within a Data Engineering team (e.g., Lead, Infrastructure, Operational Service), or is it actually unnecessary to divide the team into sub-roles?* How should we choose Data Storage to suit each layer? Is it necessary to use newer technologies (such as Data Warehouse or Data Lakehouse), or should we choose based on the expertise of the organization’s IT department, which is likely more familiar with OLTP databases?* For a Data Dictionary, should it be embedded directly into table names for convenience, documented separately, or handled through a dedicated platform (such as DataHub)?* To comply with PDPA / security audits, should data be masked or encrypted before it reaches the data storage that the Data Engineering team has access to? And which department in the organization is typically responsible for this?* As someone who can be considered a new Data Engineer, could you please recommend skills that I should learn or further develop?Lastly, if there are any parts of my questions where I used incorrect terminology or misunderstood certain concepts, please feel free to point them out and explain. I’m still not fully confident in my understanding of this field.Thank you in advance to everyone who takes the time to share their opinions and advice. PS. English is not my native language.",

        "content": "Hi! I've been to several data warehousing projects lately, built with the \"medallion\" architecture and there are a few things which make me quite disturbed.First - on all of these projects we were pushed by the \"data architect\" to use the Silver layer as a copy of the Bronze, only with SCD 2 logic on each table, leaving the original normalised table structure. No joining of tables, or other preparation of data allowed (the messy data preparation tables go to the Gold next to the star schema).Second - it was decided, that all the tables and their columns are renamed to english (from Polish), which means that now we have three databases (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different names for the same columns and tables. Now when I get a SQL script with business logic from the analyst, I need to transcribe all the table and column names to the english (Silver layer) and then implement the transformation towards Gold. Whenever there is a discussion about the data logic, or I need to go back to the analyst with a question, I need to transpose all the english table&column names back to the Polish (Bronze) again. It's time consuming. Then Gold has still different column names, as the star schema is adjusted to the reporting needs of the users.Are you also experiencing this, is this some kind of a new trend? Would't it be so much easier to leave it with the original Polish names in the Silver, since there is no change to the data anyway and the lineage would be so much cleaner?I understand the architects don't care what it takes to work with this as it's not their pain, but I don't understand that no one cares about the cost of this.. : DAlso I can see that people tend to think about the system as something developed once, not touching it afterwards. That goes completely against my experience. If the system is alive, then changes are required all the time, as the business evolves, which means the costs are heavily projecting to the future..What are your views on this? Thanks for you opinion!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "If I run a query like ``df2 = df.groupBy(\"Country\").count()``, does running ``.repartition(\"Country\")`` before the groupBy make the query faster? AI is giving contradictory answers on this so I decided to ask Reddit.The book written by the creators of Spark (\"Spark: The Definitive Guide\") say that there are not too many ways to optimize an aggregation:>For the most part, there are not too many ways that you can optimize specific aggregationsbeyond filtering data before the aggregation having a sufficiently high numberof partitions. However, if you’re using RDDs, controlling exactly how these aggregationsare performed (e.g., using reduceByKey when possible over groupByKey) can bevery helpful and improve the speed and stability of your code.The way this was worded leads me to believe that a repartition (or bucketBy, or partitionBy on the physical storage) will not speed up a groupBy.This, I don't understand however. If I have a country column in a table that can take one of five values, and each country is in a seperate partition, then Spark will simply count the number of records in each partition without having to do a shuffle. This leads me to believe that repartition (or partitionBy, if you want to do it on the hard disk) will almost always speed up a groupby. So why do the authors say that there aren't many ways to optimize an aggregation? Is there something I'm missing?EDIT: To be clear, I'm of course implying that in an actual production environment you would run the .groupBy after the .repartition more than once. Otherwise, if you run a single .groupBy query, you're just moving the shuffle one step above.",

The SQL syntax, the extensions, the ease of use, the seamless switch between in-memory and local persistence…and DuckLake. Like many before me, I fell for what DuckDB can do. It feels like magic. Postgres I used to roll my eyes every time I read “Just use Postgres.” in the comments section. I had it pegged as a transactional database for software apps. After working with DuckLake, Supabase, and most recently ADBC, I get it now. Postgres can do almost anything, including serious analytics. As Mimoune Djouallah put it recently, “PostgreSQL is not an OLTP database, it’s a freaking data platform.” Python Where would analytics, data science, machine learning, deep learning, data platforms and AI engineering be without Python?

Many of these responsibilities can be handled in dbt through tests and macros, and I’ve already implemented those pieces.What I’d like to enable is a way for every new dbt project to automatically include these generic tests and macros—essentially a shared baseline that should apply to all dbt projects. The approach I’ve found in Snowflake’s documentation involves storing these templates in a GitHub repository and referencing that repo in dbt deps so new projects can pull them in as dependencies.That said, we’ve run into an issue where the GitHub integration appears to require a username to be associated with the repository URL. It’s not yet clear whether we can supply a personal access token instead, which is something we’re currently investigating.Given that limitation, I’m wondering if there’s a better or more standard way to achieve this pattern—centrally managed, reusable dbt tests and macros that can be easily consumed by all new dbt projects.",

        "content": "Hello, I have been searching far and wide for a solution to my predicaments but I can't seem to figure it out, even with extensive help of AI.# TL;DR:I have a skewed dataset representing 9 clients. One client is roughly 10x larger than the others. I’m trying to use `repartition` to shuffle data across nodes and balance the workload, but the execution remains bottlenecked on a single task.# Details:I'm running a simple extraction + load pipeline:`Read from DB -> add columns -> write to data lake.`The data source is a bit peculiar: each client has its own independent database.The large client's data consistently lands on a single node during all phases of the job. While other nodes finish their tasks very quickly, this one \"straggler\" task bottlenecks the entire job.I attempted to redistribute the data to spread the load, but nothing seems to trigger an even shuffle. I’ve tried:* Salting the keys.* Enabling Adaptive Query Execution (AQE).* `repartition(n, \"salt_column\")` , `repartition(n, \"client_id\", \"salt\")`.* `repartition(n)`See picture:https://preview.redd.it/ghlhendf8yhg1.png?width=5030&format=png&auto=webp&s=073ccfbe9dd221427104ae09e132ea995b600505In very short pseudocode, here is what I'm doing: data = [] for db in db_list: # Reading from 9 independent source DBs data.append( spark.read.format(\"jdbc\").option(\"db\", \"table\").load() ) df_unioned = union_all(data) df_unioned = df_unioned.sortWithinPartition(client_id) # This is where I'm stuck: df_unioned = df_unioned.repartition(100, \"salt_column\") df_unioned.write.parquet(\"path/to/lake\")Looking at the Physical Plan, I've noticed there is no `Exchange` (Shuffle) happening before the write. Despite calling `repartition`, Spark is keeping the `numPartitions=1` from the JDBC scans all the way through the `Union`, resulting in a 'one-partition-per-client' bottleneck during the write phase.Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope :(PS:A couple of extra points, maybe they're useful:\\- This data in specific is quite small, just a few gigabytes (i'm testing on a subset of the full data)\\- For the record, the repartition DOES happen: if I do \\`repartition(100)\\`, I will have 100 tiny files in the data lake. What doesn't happen is the shuffle between nodes or even cores.",

I'm learning a lot of the DS tools myself and I have the Statistics knowledge to back me but there's no entry-level DS anymore.

It will take a bit more effort to design, build, and test the ingestion into bronze with schema drift/evolution.Although implementing schema-evolution isn't a big deal, a more controlled approach to new columns still provides a viable trade off.I'm looking at some different options to mitigate it.We'll enforce schema (for the standard included fields) and ignore any new fields. The source database is a production RDBMs, so ingesting RDMBS change tracking rows into bronze (append only) is going to really be valuable to the client. However, the client is aware that they won't be getting new columns automatically.We're approaching new columns like a change request. If they want them in the data platform, we need to include into bronze first, then update the model in silver and then gold.To approach it, we'd get the new field they want; include it into the ETL pipeline. We'd also have to execute a one-off pipeline that would write all records for the table into bronze where there was a non-null value for that new field as a 'change' record first.Then we turn on the ETL pipeline, and life continues on as normal and bronze is up to date with the new column.Thoughts? Would you approach it differently?",

        "author": "Beneficial-Flow-2105",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I built BigAsk, a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language. It’s a fairly thin wrapper over the Gemini CLI meant to address some shortcomings it has in overcoming data querying challenges organizations face.I’m a Software Engineer in infra/DevOps, but I have a few friends who work in roles where much of their time is spent fulfilling requests to fetch data from internal databases. I’ve heard it described as a “necessary evil” of their job which isn’t very fulfilling to perform. Recently, Google has released some quite capable tools with the potential to enable those without technical experience using BigQuery to explore the data themselves, both for questions intended to return exact query results, and higher-level questions about more nebulous insights that can be gleaned from data. While these certainly wouldn’t completely eliminate the need for human experts to write some queries or validate results of important ones, it seems to me like they could significantly empower many to save time and get faster answers.Unfortunately, there are some pretty big limitations to the current offerings from Google that prevent them from actually enabling this empowerment, and this project seeks to fix them.One is that the best tools are available in a limited set of interfaces. Those scattered throughout the already-lacking-in-user-friendliness BigQuery UI require some foundational BigQuery and data analysis skills to use, making their barrier to entry too high for many who could benefit from them. The most advanced features are only available in the Gemini CLI, but as a CLI, using it requires using a command-line, again putting it out-of-reach for many.The second is a lack of safe access control. There's a reason BigQuery access is typically limited to a small group. Directly authorizing access to this data via the BigQuery UI or Gemini CLI to individual users who aren't well-versed in its stewardship carries large risks of data deletion or leaks. As someone with experience working professionally with managing cloud IAM within an organization, I know that attempts to distribute permissions to individual users while maintaining a limited scope on them also requires considerable maintenance overhead and comes with it’s own set of security risks.BigAsk enables anyone within an organization to easily and securely use the most powerful agentic data analysis tools available from Google to self-serve answers to their burning questions. It addresses the problems outlined above with a user-friendly web interface, centralized access management with a recommended permissions set, and simple, lightweight code and deployment instructions that can easily be extended or customized to deploy into the constraints of an existing Google Cloud project architecture.Code here: [https://github.com/stevenwinnick/big-ask](https://github.com/stevenwinnick/big-ask)I’d love any feedback on the project, especially from anyone who works or has worked somewhere where this could be useful. This is also my first time sharing a project to online forums, and I’d value feedback on any ways I could better share my work as well.",

Its really a one way integration between two OLTP systems where webhook from System A writes to apigw which routes to a lambda which writes to dynamo where another lambda on a schedule reads from dynamo and writes unprocessed records to System B. There's also another flow where we have a lamdba check System B to see if users have a token and if if they don't, the lambda writes them to SQS where we have another lambda batch from SQS, grab a token from System A and write them back to users in System B.Its my first real pipeline as a \"Data Engineer\" but it feels like integration engineering not DE. It gets slightly more DE related where we are landing that same webhook data into S3 and materializing it in Redshift for downstream analysis. But im not involved in the code for this part, just the SQL querying for our group's own reporting on the data. Not sure where to go for next job, I am lacking the DBT and airflow skills most DE roles require and I have these cloud skills and some IaC stuff as well to sprinkle on top of my SQL and python skills. I have been a DE title for a year now (was Senior Data Analyst at same company and did some DA/DS for a few years before that) at diff companies) and I want to change roles and make more money for my family. Not sure what jobs to shoot for or how to market myself... Event Driven DE? Not sure. Also, I'm new to reddit so forgive me if there's a better board for this. One more thing is I have been reading books like DDIA so my systems thinking is getting good but my coding skills are rotting because I'm really just trouble shooting the logs and only enriching the code maybe once a month. This post is all over the place but I just need some general guidance.",

        "content": "Junior Engineer here. I have been tasked with designing a scalable and flexible analytics architecture that shows you realtors performance in different US markets. What we need: Show aggregated realtor performance (volume sold based on listing/buying side) on different filters like at the state level, county level, zip level, MLS level) and a user can set a date range. This performance needs to be further aggregated together at office level so we can bring out stuff top agents per office.I currently use 3 datasets (listings, tax/assessor, office data) to create one giant fact table that contains agent performance in the areas I mentioned above aggregated on the year and the month. So I can query the table to find out how a certain agent performed in a certain zip code compared to some other agent, or I can see an agents most sold areas, average listing price etc. The Challenge1) Right now the main issue we are facing is the speed.The table I made is sitting inside snowflake, and the frontend uses a aws lambda to fetch the data from snowflake. This adds some latency (authentication alone takes 3 seconds) and warehouse startup time + query execution time) and the whole package comes to around 8 seconds. We would ideally want to do this under 2 seconds. We had a senior data engineer who designed a sparse GSI schema for dynamodb where the agent metrics were dimensionalized such that i can query a specific GSI to see how an agent ranks on a leader board for a specific zip code/state/county etc. This architecture presents the problem that we can only compare agents based on 1 dimension. (We trade flexibility over speed). However, we want to be able to filter on multiple filters.I have been trying to design a similar leader board schema but to be used on OpenSearch, but there's a 2nd problem that I also want to keep in mind.2) Adding additional datasets in the future Right now we are using 3 datasets, but in the future we will likely need to connect more data (like mortgage) with this. As such, I want to design an opensearch schema that allows me to aggregate performance metrics, as well as leave space to add more datasets and their metrics in the future. What I am looking for:I would like to have tips from experienced Data Engineers here who have worked on similar projects like this. I would love any tips on pitfalls/things to avoid and what to think about when designing this schema. I know i am making a ridiculous ask, but I am feeling a bit stuck here.",

        "content": "So my boss recently told me that try-catch statements are \"garbage\" and that I should avoid using them when developing. This wasn't specific to any particular language - they seemed to mean it as a general programming principle. I'm pretty confused because I thought error handling with try-catch was fundamental to most modern programming languages. I know it can be misused (like catching exceptions and doing nothing, or using exceptions for control flow), but completely avoiding it seems extreme. Is there some programming philosophy or best practice I'm missing here? Are there alternatives to try-catch that are considered better? Or is my boss maybe referring to specific anti-patterns that I should be aware of? Has anyone else encountered this \"no try-catch\" philosophy? What are the actual best practices around exception handling across different languages? Any insight would be really helpful - I want to understand if there's something legitimate here or if I should push back on this guidance. ‐-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When people say vague things like \"That's not good programming,\" I always ask, \"Why?\"Why is it garbage? Why is it bad design? Why isn't it good programming?When I asked that, they said, \"You should at least make a program that doesn't produce errors,\" and then laughed at me.Anyway, thanks for all the responses. I posted this because I was genuinely confused after that conversation and wanted to see if I was missing something obvious.",

I think it can be useful in the right contexts and when used well.But if you learn OOP as a course in college, you'd know that professors seem to think that it's God's perfect gift to programmers. My biggest problem is that colleges overemphasize inheritance as a feature.Inheritance can be useful, but when used improperly, it becomes ridiculously difficult and annoying to work with. In software engineering, there is a concept called \"orthogonality\", and it's the idea that different parts of your code should be independent and decoupled. It's common sense, really. If you change one part of your code, it shouldn't fuck up other parts. It makes testing, debugging, and reasoning about your program easier.Inheritance completely shits on that.When you have an inheritance tower two billion subclasses deep, it's almost guaranteed that there will be some unpredictable behavior in your code. OOP can have some very subtle and easy to overlook rules in how inheritance and polymorphism work, so it's very easy to create subtle bugs that are hard to reason about.So yeah. By all means, learn OOP, but please do it well. Don't learn it the way professors have you learn it, focus on composing classes rather than inheritance.",

It is much faster but I do not wrestle with ideas long enough for them to sink in.It's like having the solution manual for every puzzle before I've even touched the puzzle. Yes, I know the answer, but I didn't learn it.And, I can feel my patience shrinking overtime. If something doesn't click in 30 seconds, my brain goes \"eh, AI will explain it better anyways\". I cannot sit with difficulty anymore. I'm not anti-AI but I miss the struggle. I miss feeling proud of understanding something because I worked for it.

Like somewhere I'd absorbed this idea that real programmers write clean elegant code on the first try, and if I couldn't do that, I wasn't ready to build yet.So I'd go do another tutorial. Where the code was already clean. Where I could follow along and feel competent without risking being bad at something.The thing that broke it was just... accepting I was going to write garbage. Not as a temporary state until I got good. As the permanent reality of programming. Everyone writes garbage first and then improves it.My first real project was mass truly mass mass terrible. Nested if statements everywhere, variables named \"thing2\", logic that made no sense. But it worked. And finishing something that worked, even badly, taught me more than all the tutorials combined.I swear I post even the ugly code on WIP Social now, and seeing other people also posting imperfect work made me realize everyone's first drafts are bad.

You still have to understand the code that's being generated. And in all honesty it's still better to write the code yourself. If you're allowing AI to dictate whether you should learn how to build applications due to the fear of not being able to find a job. Then your passion is probably not there for programming, and better off looking for something else.If you're genuinely curious and want to develop something meaningful. Then I have no doubt you will do well. But you need to trust the process and ignore the noise from people that don't even program themselves and just post AI fear online because their too lazy and lack ambition to do anything so they rather tell others to give up on themselves too. ​​​​Ignore them. The world still needs more developers!",

Well, in a rare bit of good news in dark times, I'm NOT giving up, as the reason I was making no progress was because I was looking at things from the wrong angle ALL ALONG! I was looking at programming from a flowchart perspective- I.E questioning how in the hell people keep track of all these branching paths stretching out into infinity- but a quick convo with chatgpt cleared that up IMMEDIATELY. There is no flowchart with infinite branching paths, and there never was. It was ALWAYS a straight road with occasional detours that lead back to the main path! Before it was like, \"What the fuck is going on?\" and now it's like, \"I can hear colors! See sounds!\" :DYou have no idea how happy I am right now. \\^\\_\\^ Just needed to celebrate that.",

Specifically a lot of questions came up about memory, how computers store and retrieve information, and how that connects to AI systems and such but from a computing perspective.I was already working on something like that but figured I would finish it up early !This one starts with Mad Libs. Not as a gimmick but because the pattern behind that word game, templates with typed blanks filled according to rules, turns out to be structurally how computing works at every level (with a grain of salt). Abstract Syntax Trees are this. Compilers are this. And the way AI systems assemble prompts from system instructions, memory files, and your actual message is this too.Same disclaimers as last time. The computing fundamentals are standard. The framing around AI and where it fits in this history is my own take and I completely understand if people push back on it.

And I'm absolutely obsessed with programming!For the last 2.5 years I've explored many fields of CS and I've absolutely fallen in love with ALL of them:• Frontend design with Flutter.• Game development with the Godot game engine.• Backend development with Django.• low level system design with C and Rust.• programming language and compiler design with Haskell. Every 6 weeks or so I bounce between my interests and create a project in one of them, and honestly it's been great so far. My peers criticize me and tell me to just choose 1 thing and get good at it. But I didn't listen. I was having too much fun and making steady progress in all my interests.But last week when I wanted to create a bigger game I realized something... I'm missing so many fundamentals of game development despite me learning it for the last 2.5 years !I still didn't know any 3D modeling. Didn't understand Shaders. Barley knew anything about 3D dev in general. Didn't know how to create 2D assets.And this was a pretty bad feeling. I wanted to create something big after 2.5 years of learning; But couldn't do much because I didn't have enough experience.And yeah I realized this pretty much applies to all my interests:• The most advanced flutter app I made is a Basic calculator.• Every game I've made is a 2d arcade game with stock assets.• I haven't even learned Authentication with Django yet.• I don't know how to program in any system language. Just watching random videos about C and C++• I've only created 2 new Programming languages and they're both toy languages with limited use cases.• I'm still not experienced enough with Haskell to create anything I can think of.Honestly I'm having a crisis right now. I feel like I should just focus on backend to get hired and game-dev as my main non-work hobby. But I also love the other stuff so much and don't wanna abandon them !I love all of them so much and I wish I can do everything at the same time. But at some point I need to get hired in one of them.",

Do you have previous knowledge of it all and know how stuff works? Do professional coders also just check up stackoverflow and similar sites to get similar codes to what they want? Am i too knew to this that the best way for me to learn currently would be typing other peoples codes and figuring out how stuff works and why it works?Is there a way i can learn all the kinks in coding so that i can write a code from scratch without needing to check forums and other peoples codes, or is that something that comes with years of work and practice?",

The issue is that she has **no prior Computer Science background** at all, yet she’s now doing A-Level.She also never asks questions. I’ve noticed she zones out quite a lot, but when I gently address it, she denies it. I try to engage her with prompts, guided questions, and encouragement, but I don’t get much back.At this point I’m wondering:* Is this a confidence issue, a foundational gap, or just passive learning?* Am I expecting too much too quickly?* Would it help to switch to **Python first**, build problem-solving skills and logic, then come back to C#?* Or should I slow C# down even more and focus purely on micro-tasks and repetition?I genuinely want to help her succeed, but I’m feeling stuck and unsure if my approach is right.

        "content": "*I'd like to preface this entire post by saying that I did enjoy the first few hours of my time on* [*coddy.tech*](http://coddy.tech)*, despite its many... many issues. The base system is promising and could be excellent, if the QA was more thorough.***So, why do I say coddy is utter garbage?** \\- The website is riddled with bugs, from non-loading lessons to timeouts and very... very slow validation.\\- A lot of the lessons have errors: They aren't properly formated, do not explain all the methods and systems needed to actually solve a lesson.\\- The \"daily challenge\" system is a joke. Its some poorly made AI system that gives you a basic ass task like \"Print hello world 10 times\" despite being at chapters like HashMaps etc.\\- There are numerous lessons where they do not actually explain to you what the desired output needs to be (given, you can see that by clicking the \"expected output\" toggle - but you should be able to see exactly what you need to do from the challenge description. \\- This last point goes hand in hand with the issue that the output needs to be exact. They had one extra space at the end of their output, despite not showing that because you're tasked with printing the result of each itteration on a new line anyway? Instantly lose the \"first try\" challenge.\\- Courses aren't even finished. I started the Python and Java course at the same time, hoping to refresh my python knowledge and picking up Java at the same time. Java's whole point is to be an OOP-language. Guess what: Section 3 \"Object oriented Programming\" is \"Coming Soon\":trade_mark:. What the actual fu\\*\\*?\\- The website is clearly built around just monetizing everything as agressively as possible. I got lucky and was able to use a discount code during November to get 30% off monthly subscriptions so it was \"only\" 14.95 a month. Still: I do not feel like that value is really justified. The website has a lot of AI-Slop and wannabe intelligent assistance systems that either fail, timeout (I now know this is a firebase website because the website is printing firebase errors everywhere on every fuc\\*\\*\\* interaction) and lots of lessons are very, very poorly worded.This could've been a 8.5/10 rating but as it stands, I'd say coddy is at best a 4/10 and you should probably look elsewhere.To their credit: They recently updated their Quizz section which made it less buggy and a lot more interactive.",

Even before ai era, I always feel the stupiest in the room. Like everyone else got it but me, yet I managed to survive more than 3 years in this job market.Now im in this new company for three months now, they are the kind of small companies that wanna ship fast no matter what. So you have no time to make architectural decisions or planning. The type of company where requirements are discussed in each daily and can change trillion of times then they question your skills when deadlines are missed. I cant leave though because I need the money and the market is just scary to be jobless. How can I improve in this environment. I started to use ai heavily to the point where I wait for claude code limits to reset so I can keep working. Even though I used to work without ai at all. I will changz companies if I find a better alternative but a better company will ask for a good developer who knows architecture and software design. Not a coder who survives using ai tools. I still ship, and im not against using ai. But when I try to work without it I struggle with the basics even. Any advice is much appreciated",

From what I can tell, pretty much nobody here (who uses Python) is writing modular, testable code, it's mostly just scripts in notebooks.So my question is should I be using OOP for everything I build, even if I'm the only one touching the code? How do I know when something actually needs proper classes and structure vs just being a straightforward script?Like I get the theory behind clean code and all that, but when you're building a niche pipeline for one specific use case, does it really need to be over-engineered? Or am I just making excuses for laziness?Would appreciate any perspective from folks who've navigated this kind of environment.",

But it gave me something to focus on when my thoughts got too loud.Eventually what I was building became tied to what I had lost. I started breaking gambling down into pure numbers and logic. No hype. No rush. Just reality.It did not fix anything. But it helped me survive a period where I felt like I was drowning.I am sharing this because grief does not always look neat. Sometimes it looks like building something just to stay afloat.**TL;DR:** My step mother self-deleted after struggling with gambling addiction.

I don't have much experience in coding. I learnt a little bit of it in college. I know about basic libraries on python like matplotlib and such. I tried VS code while trying to pursue a personal project in order to learn some coding by myself.I got this idea when I made a graph that looked like a room on python. Basically, it had multiple coordinates. I thought what if I code a room like that and then add frames of things that depict how I see her soul. I want to complement them with little notes. She is an artist herself so I would love for the gallery to have her own pieces too. I want it to be a reflection of her and our memories and her soul.But I don't really know coding like that. Please help me. I am here because I don't want to use AI chatbots to write codes for me. I want this project to be extremely intentional. I need your help!My questions for now-1. What application should I use to code this?2. What are your opinions on the feasibility of this project? Do you think I can do it considering my experience with coding? (I think I can but please be honest)3. Can you direct me towards the libraries that I can use to make these possible. I will scoop the internet for codes and information based on the libraries. 4. Do you have any insights or ideas about what I can do more to make this a fun and nice little gesture for her.Thank you!",

My usual approach is to first try to solve the problem on my own and then - even if I succeed - watch a YouTube video with deeper explanation to gain better understanding of the problem. Recently, I worked on [LeetCode 778: Swim in Rising Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/). It was a bit different from the problems I had solved before - I hadn't worked on this kid of problems yet. Although I managed to solve it successfully using a min-heap strucutre and a graph traversal algorithm. But it was something new for me, I had never used them two together. If you're an advanced programmer, when you hear a min-heap and graph traversal, you probably know what it means - but I didn't. Only when I was watching an explanatation of the optimal solution on YouTube, I realized that I had actually implemented a Dijkstra's algorithm - an algorithm invented by one of the greatest figures in computer science history. So even though this algorithm was created many decades ago, I was very excited that my analytical and problem-solving thinking process naturally led me to the same solution as Dijkstra's solution many decades ago. I'm sure that wouldn't happen if I was solving LeetCode blindly, learning only patterns. I wish every programmer feel this kind of moment from time to time to stay motivated on the path of learning!",

If two objects have the same hashCode, can I be 100% sure they are the same?2. If not, why do we even have hash codes? Why not just use `==` for everything?3. How does a HashMap handle it if two different items accidentally get the same code? Does it just overwrite my data?",

Despite my effort and how much I've evolved, these past few weeks I've been incredibly stagnant. Even though I know how to solve a problem on paper, actually applying it in code overwhelms me and nothing seems to work. Although I don't think I abused AI too much, I now wonder if that's even the case anymore.My professor began to be very dissatisfied in me, and keeps pressuring me to do more, but even if I try it doesn't seem to work. I've never been truly able to focus on anything for a long time, and I've never really \"learned\" how to learn. I just picked up everything on the fly, and lately this has been biting me back.

My older sister is a tech lead at X company and I've legit seen her break problems down one by one when presented with an issue, even problems that have nothing to do with tech lol, I still remember the first time I seen her do that and I've been wanting that ever since but I feel like a fraud. How did you guys get better at this? I've been more or less coding everyday since October trying to find a job and whenever I'm presented with a bug or an issue in my code I don't really approach it like actual programmers I just sit in my chair thinking, trying to beat my brain for a solution, sometimes it works, sometimes I end up just asking AI for help. (The other day I spent like two and a half hours trying to debug an \"edit inline\" feature for a finance app i was making and it was the most easiest solution ever that i could've solved on my own if i knew how to google/be resourceful Also, how did you guys get better at reading documentation? What is your process when you're learning new tech? I'm pretty bad at reading documentation I have to re-read certain MDN things like a million times for it to click. I think the overload of information on certain docs is what messes me up, but idk These are all things that I think are holding me back and I want to get better at so I can become a better programmer and not be too dependent on AI since no one knows where this is all going, because tbh AI can easily fill those gaps for me but then I'll never actually feel like a programmer or break problems down like the example I gave of my older sister.

Still struggling with medical but disability runs out next month which came as a surprise to me but lifetime limits are apparently a thing. So I'm scrambling to figure out how to best approach this!Advice?",

The intent of this code is to write one byte into the current location in the buffer and than move the current location forward one byte. I wrote a little bit of code that demonstrates that it does work.But I am confused. I would have guessed that because of the parenthese surroundng `buf++` that the post-increment would happen before the dereference, causing the data to be stored one byte ahead of where it is expected.

Optimization for the hardware. The DS&A side of things.And they kind of seem to clash.But I tried the two and everything I make ends up breaking either being two slow/rigid with lack of control and dynamism if I go full OOP or if I go full DOP then at first it's a breath of fresh air with total freedom and speed of execution and so on but then I fall into madness pretty quickly as things get more complex and hard to keep track of.And I been stuck in that infernal cycle loop of doom for a long time and it's starting to feel like there isn't really a good solution and software may be a lot more limited than it seems to beWell software or my brain. As I found OOP ends up making the hardware fail but DOP ends up making my mind failPerhaps this may just be a skill issue on my part? I mean it definitely is but perhaps the answer lies lower level and I'd just need to \"get good\".But that introduces another issue though. If you program full stack and dive too deep, you end up taking the habit of over engineering everything and then development takes ages...But on the other side if you use only the most automated tools/libraries to make things really fast, you end up with slow and low feature slop that's turning your pc cooling system into a jet engine...I feel so lost... I been giving it my all in game development for soon to be 2 years programming a lot and been studying computer science for 1 year and I been tryharding the shit out of it but it's like I don't even know what to practice practice anymore.

Hence I’ve decided to continue working on my technical skill before matriculating.I’ve still yet to decide whether I should focus on practicing DSA (probably using Python since that’s the language used in the college I’ll be going) or learn new software (was planning to look at Angular and Spring framework). Another option was to look explore other forms of CS such as Machine Learning, Data Science. However, I’m leaning more towards the first 2 options due to it being more aligned with the hiring process…Any advice would be appreciated!Edit: Sorry I can’t post on r/csCareerQuestions since I’ve not enough karma :(",

In my spare time, I’d play around with tech I thought was interesting. If I had some downtime at work, I’d play around with new thingsPerhaps it’s a lot of very demanding, unpleasant working environments… but now I see code and I feel borderline nauseous. In my own personal life, I don’t really get excited about tech or look forward to any of it. Great, new tech released, I’m not even gonna bother checking it out cause it’s either some sort of scam or will enshittify before I can really enjoy it. I’ll just stick with the 4 apps I use on my iPhone 13, and hope that they don’t deprecate my phone anytime soon cause I don’t want a new oneThe people I’ve worked with since about 2020 feel very different than before. It seems like everyone is more interested in business and finance than they are in tech and product. Many people working in tech seem like they don’t care about it. Tech companies have this very “Harvard MBA” feel to them that I can’t describe. Lots of ladder climbing, lots of clamoring for status and visibility. I’ve seen act in really unscrupulous ways to get ahead, despite the fact that it seems very toxicAlso, I’m level 1 autism. As time has gone on, I’ve noticed it’s been less and less tolerated. This doesn’t have to do with any changes in title, either, cause that’s stayed the same for years. Previously it seemed to be viewed as, at worst, a little quirky. Now at work people tell me that being able to read subtle social cues is more important than being able to do \\_any\\_ hard skill. I am still a senior engineerPart of me thinks I’m just getting old (I’m 35) and tired of this industry and maybe I’ve mentally checked out. The thing is, I’ve met at least a small handful of people who have expressed the same feelings to me: tech just isn’t \\_fun\\_ anymore. I also noticed that it even seems like people at these companies don’t even really believe in what they’re selling, really. Like I don’t get the feeling someone like Sam Altman \\_actually\\_ cares about OpenAI, it just feels like a griftLike when I think of growing up, I remember video games like world of Warcraft and newgrounds and MySpace. It felt like the attitude was more along the lines of “how do we get money so we can build what we want to build?” And not “what can we build that will make money?”Yes I know companies have to make money, but I suppose before it didn’t feel like they had to MAXIMIZE how much money they’d make at the expense of everything else they care aboutHas anyone else experienced this or have I just kinda started seeing the way it always was?

For actual development work, it has proved lackluster.He was pushing that coding was dead and AI should be able to do all of it now, so we should all be much faster. He also mentioned software quality in the same discussion, advocating AI should make it easier. He then gave an example of someone he knew in a well known company who was very experienced, IC6 level, and he was bring told that he needs to use AI or go away. Whilst using AI has been useful, I do think the extent of it's usage is being stretched significantly by people who are even developers or were themselves. How does everyone find using AI for their companies so far? When i make a new side project and do simple client side work, it's great and I rarely need to read any code. But for my corporate job, it still hallucinated a lot even with very specific prompting. Am I doing it wrong and has this improved significantly to the level my manager was claiming, or is it still useful for learning and planning to some extent but not execution?

I thought that I had made some sort of mistake or forgot to do something.Last night, HR messaged me and said that my manager has asked that I lower the ratings that I gave to all of my reports.I'm upset by this for many reasons and don't know how to respond.I work in the same office as my manager and feel like we have a decent relationship. Why is he going through HR instead of coming to me?I gave my reports ratings that I sincerely believe they deserve. My boss is completely non technical and has no idea what makes a good software engineering employee. He's not qualified to rate them. If my employees don't deserve the rating that I gave them, then what do they need to do in order to get the higher rating, since they're already doing those things? I don't know how to respond, because every way forward involves something that has the potential to hurt my career, my employment status, or my integrity.I could lie to my employees and make something up as to why they didn't deserve better. That's likely the best thing for my employment status and career, at least at this company. But it makes me absolutely sick.I could tell my employees that I rated them higher but that my boss, who they have daily contact with, didn't think they deserved it. That doesn't feel like a good idea.I could refuse to change the rating. That's also not going to go well for me.My decision as of right now is that I'm going to set up a . meeting with HR and tell them that I'm not going to change their ratings without some convincing justification.I feel like if my boss wants the ratings changed, then my reports should be moved under him, and he needs to own their ratings. I'm unhappy about it in any case, but I'm more comfortable if he owns what he's done and the software engineers know it was him. I left my last company for similar reasons, and I'm now considering switching again.Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed?Update: After reading the advice here, I've messaged HR to set up a meeting with them to try and understand:1. Why they want me to downgrade my ratings2. How do I tell my reports that calibration forced me to rate them lower even though they're doing everything they were supposed to be doing to get their ratings? (I did not rate both employees the same,)3. If my employees ask how to get the higher ratings, what do I tell them, since they were already doing what the HR document lists?",

Does no one what to apply to smaller companies?My question to the community is: how can small businesses who want to hire a reasonable software engineer find you in the first place? Are you using niche boards? Slacks? Discords? Or have you given up on portals entirely in favor of networking? LinkedIn doesn't seem to work, that's for sure.I'm trying to understand where the bridge is broken so we can actually find you.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I made this post to help explain the current state of software development jobs, especially for new and junior developers. I hope this eases some of your worries. It is long, bear with me.Software Engineering, like any other careers is cyclical. Jobs are at the mercy of demand, trends, and capital. We saw an influx during 2010's and especially during and after Covid (early 2020's) when companies started hiring to hoard talent.Lets get to the layoffs. For those who think layoffs are the direct result of AI, you are not completely wrong. But there are more factors at play. The hard reality is the American economy may be in the midst of economic hardship (recession). This takes us to my first point.1. Companies using AI as an excuse to downsize and make the books look good.First reason: Executive Bonuses. Public companies are at the mercy of quarterly reports. One bad quarter could cost some asshole millionaire his/her job. This sadly incentivizes short term gains and hurts the company long term. But who cares as long as they get their bonus right? AI is a goldmine for execs. They buy a Claude or Copilot subscription and start firing devs. They then take the money they were paying those devs back to the board or shareholders and get rewarded with a bonus.Second reason: Optics. Instead of telling shareholders they need to cut costs (signs of weakness), companies can now conveniently say \"AI Efficiency\". “We don’t need as many people” sounds better than “we can’t afford them”. To top that off, the market rewards any mention of AI with a stock bump. Again the millionaire assholes gets their bonus.2. Management is not immune to industry trends. Leadership is not perfect, they will make mistakes. Unfortunately we are often the victims of those mistakes. Executives talk to peers, copy what other companies are doing, then push it internally. Often times, this comes in the form of asking devs to vibe code/prompts/use agents.3. Take a close look at motivations. The same people dooming and glooming software development are often the ones collecting million dollar bonuses for selling the hype and tools.Below is how things will play out:After management finishes downsizing and the quality of the product goes to shit (either from the vibe coding or short staffing), we will see the following:* Companies admiting AI didn’t deliver the expected benefits* Anyone tied to the AI initiative gets fired (after they get their million dollar bonuses of course)* Start hiring engineers again* AI repositioned as “assistive\" rather than substitutiveTime and time again we have seen this with offshoring, outsourcing and any form of automation.My recommendation, if you enjoy coding, keep doing it. After the hype and fad dies down, this job will continue to be in demand.“In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death, taxes, and executive bonuses”",

I am 26F and currently have 5 YoE and an engineering degree from an Ivy. In December, a recruiter from Capital One reached out to me. I guess at one point I had applied in the past and was rejected but my name was in their system and they wanted to consider me for a Senior Software Engineer (Principal Associate) role. I kinda thought eh, what the hell why not, but after a little brushing up on Leetcode I managed to pass the online assessment and the Power Day and am now at the team match phase. The recruiter called me yesterday to let me know that while I still passed, they ultimately are going to offer me a Software Engineer (Senior Associate) role, which is the level below what I interviewed for. I'm honestly shocked I even passed so this is still good news, and according to Levels.fyi I would be making \\~160k base in NYC which is significantly more than what I make now.Now that I've passed and I'm waiting to hear back about team match, I was looking on Blind and Reddit about working at Capital One and I worry that the culture is really cutthroat. Apparently every 6 months they PIP 15% of employees per team and it's common for new hires to get cut. This is really concerning to me. My entire career I've been more used to a startup environment where there is obviously a chance of layoffs (and have been through one) but they weren't cutting teams every 6 months. Going from having mostly startups on my resume to having somewhere with more name recognition like Capital One might be more beneficial for my career in the long run, plus the compensation is significantly more than what I make currently. However, I worry that I'll be out of a job in 6 months and with this current job market I don't think most people are in a place to take risks. I'm weighing the pros and cons and I'm not sure how to proceed once I hear back about team match and get an offer. Should I stay at my current job, or take the leap?",

With a few hours of focused studying, I can usually grasp everything and do well on exams. The issue has not been that the material is too hard. It is more about motivation and how I feel about the path I am on.After freshman year, where I honestly did not do much career wise, reality hit me in my second year. I felt like I had to catch up. I took on multiple research projects to make up for my lack of industry experience, built personal projects, constantly took 20 units a quarter along with some community college classes, and spent a lot of time grinding LeetCode. I really pushed myself because I thought that if I did everything right, the results would come.But even after all that effort, I did not see the outcomes I expected in terms of internships or job offers. That gap between effort and results has been mentally exhausting. Over time, the constant grind with no clear payoff has worn me down, and I have lost the excitement I used to have for CS.I have realized that I do not hate problem solving. I still like thinking through ideas and solutions. I especially enjoy working with numbers and seeing patterns, which is why my Statistics and Management minor has felt more interesting recently. What I do not enjoy is the actual process of coding. Sitting and building things line by line feels draining, even though thinking about the solution at a higher level feels engaging.Right now I am not excited about more studying, more interview prep, or more side projects. I want to work and get real experience instead of staying in this cycle of preparation. Applying for a Master's was partly strategic because I have not landed a job yet, not purely because I am excited to keep studying.At this point, I am trying to figure out if this loss of passion is just temporary burnout from overworking myself, or if my interests are actually shifting toward something more analytical or business focused rather than pure software engineering.I know I am just ranting and will probably just get flamed in the comments (please be nice)",

Just being adequate forever with no external validation that I'm progressing?I talked to a friend who's been working for five years and she laughed and said \"yeah that's the job.\" But then she said something that stuck with me. She said the people who need constant external feedback either burn out or become managers, and the people who figure out internal motivation are the ones who last.Still chewing on that. How do you build internal motivation when you've been externally validated your whole life?",

They don’t actually reflect skill levels, and hiring managers tend not to actually care about them once the interview process begins.* View B: They’re a measure of general competency and a candidate’s willingness to put in effort to learn. They’re a tiebreaker when other qualifications are roughly equivalent.For people who have experience hiring or interviewing software engineers:* Do AWS/Azure/GCP certifications actually factor into your hiring decisions at all?* What level of career progression do you think certifications become irrelevant to hiring or consideration, or do they remain relevant no matter what?* Have you seen any correlation between certification holders’ performance on the job?* If you had two candidates that were comparable in terms of experience, would a cert ever be the deciding factor?I’m not asking if certs are a good tool for learning. I’m specifically asking if it actually affects hiring decisions in a meaningful way, particularly when compared to actual project or production experience.Would love to get some real-world perspectives rather than theory.

It means that you need either a git worktree or having multiple directories for the same repo, each with code for a different feature. Needless to say, that's very hard to manage! I tried it with two directories and I got lost, forgot which directory had what, push it all on the same branch and had to fix is later. It only made me slower and tired. Yet leadership expectations is that each engineers runs TEN! agents at once.At the stand up today I was expected to work and finish three tasks at the same time and I just can't do it. My brain doesn't work like that. I forget about the first agent when I start interacting with the second one.It's sad really, that they're taking an amazing thing that has so much potential and it should be fun to learn, and ruining by this greedy, ruthless mindset. And it's a \"do it or leave\" kind of situation.In the meantime everybody else is pushing branch after branch with four parallels agents like it's nothing.

I hope this is useful for someone# CS Student 4-Year Plan## Freshman Year* Join 1-2 clubs related to your major. My recommendation is to pick a general engineering one and a more niche technical one (e.g. SHPE + Robotics or NSBE + Cybersecurity)> **Note**: If you attend school online or your school does not have active clubs, you still need to network with people in person. Look for local tech meetups for your chosen programming language, tech stack, or the local makerspace. Pick 2 and show up often and be active* Pick 1 programming language and follow an in-depth tutorial or book such as Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, or a Learn GO with Tests* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Make a resume and a LinkedIn profile## Freshman -> Sophomore Summer* Get a part-time job, anything will do* Practice more for your chosen programming language## Sophomore Year* Be more active in the same 1 - 2 club(s). Join event committees, help setup at events and show up frequently to events. Aim for a leadership position when elections are next held* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile. By the end of sophomore year you should have on your resume: a part-time job, some relevant coursework, 1-3 programming languages and some technologies, and active participation in a student organization* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely (slacks, a dress shirt and dress shoes can be had at Walmart). Take 5 - 10 printed copies of your resume with you and make it your goal to hand out all of them to recruiters. The point is to get accustomed to talking to professionals## Sophomore -> Junior Summer* If you got an internship, congratulations you are ahead of the curve. If not get a part-time job, anything will do* Fill in gaps as necessary (Git, SQL, basic cloud stuff, HTML & CSS, Unix CLI, basic networking)* By now you should have taken a Data Structures and Algorithms class. Time to start LeetCode. You don't have to go too crazy if you are consistent. Pick 2 days a week for ~1 hr: * **Day 1**: Watch an instructional video, attempt a problem, watch the solution video, then write the code for the solution * **Day 2**: Attempt a problem (30 mins for Easy, 45 mins for Medium, 1 hr for Hard). If you can't solve it in time, watch the solution video, then write the code for the solution. If you have more time, attempt another problem * **Repeat**: Continue with Day 2 until you run out of problems on a topic. Then start again on the next topic from Day 1 Check out NeetCode 250 for a list of problems organized by type, ordered from least to most difficult, with solutions## Junior Year* Be active in the same 1 - 2 club(s), hopefully this time in a leadership position. Try to get a leadership position during officer elections* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects. Take resumes and be dressed decently (clean shirt and pants with no holes). Recruiters sometimes do interviews* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile. Make sure to have a professional headshot. Obtain 500 connections by the end of the year. Add folks in you classes, in your student orgs, and at hackathons* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely. Take 10 - 30 printed copies of your resume with you and make it your goal to hand out all of them to recruiters. You NEED an internship this upcoming summer* If you have the money, go to a national conference so you can try to get an internship (e.g. SHPE, NSBE, Grace Hopper, WICSE, IEEE, etc). Dress nicely, take resumes, add people on LinkedIn* Start looking for internships in August. The goal is to get out 2+ applications out EVERY day. Don't just apply in your city, apply nationally## Junior -> Senior Summer* Do your internship and do it well. Dress nicely, ask questions, do your best work, add folks on LinkedIn. You are trying to get a return offer## Senior Year * Be active in the same 1 - 2 club(s). If you already had 1+ leadership positions feel free to take a break this year if you like. If you have not gotten a leadership position and you have not had 1+ internships you NEED to have a leadership position senior year* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects. Take resumes and be dressed decently (clean shirt and pants with no holes). Recruiters sometimes do interviews* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile* Keep up the LeetCode* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely. Take 10 - 30 printed copies of your resume with you and make it your goal to hand out all of them to recruiters. You NEED a full-time offer If you have the money, go to a national conference so you can try to get an full-time job offer (e.g. SHPE, NSBE, Grace Hopper, WICSE, IEEE, etc). Dress nicely, take resumes, add people on LinkedIn* Start looking for full-time roles in August. The goal is to get out 5+ applications out EVERY day if you do not have a return offer. Don't just apply in your city, apply nationally. Feel free to apply less or be more selective if you got a return offer that you wouldn't mind taking",

They hired me as a solo developer to manage 4 different projects. There is no other technical person in the company. One of the projects specifically is a mess. The way it was built wasn't very robust. The previous developer used a bunch of technologies that they were not familiar with, and it's very messy. I was not aware of the state of this project when they hired me. It took me about a month to get set up because there was no one to onboard me; I basically had to figure everything out on my own, and there were some really niche things about the system that weren't documented properly. Actually, their entire documentation is a mess and not very helpful. It also took like 3 weeks for them to give me access to everything I needed.I've been stuck on a few issues for months, and it's driving me insane. These issues are direct symptoms of how the system was built. Initially, the system worked fine, but the way it was built is now causing a bunch of long-term problems to arise. I'm trying my best, but as soon as I fix one thing, another issue pops up. My boss and our clients don't really understand this, and they basically blame me for everything. I feel so overwhelmed right now. I've been trying my best, but I feel like it's not good enough. I've been working through nights and on weekends to try to resolve these issues, but it's like an endless cycle because more issues keep popping up. They also want me to do a full QA assessment every time I test, and that takes time.I've tried to explain to my boss that I'm just one person and that there is only so much I can do, but he doesn't care. They basically want me to do the job of an entire team while paying me below average for what a developer makes. I also mentioned to my boss that we should hire another developer or a consultant to help with the workload, and he told me that in order to do that, they would have to cut my salary by at least 45%. By their logic, they hired me to do a job, and if I need extra help to do that job, then it's going to have to come out of my pay. I'm trying my very best, but they make me feel like I'm incompetent and that I'm not even trying at all. They told me that I should be able to do this and more.

        "content": "Right after graduating college in 2020, I wasn't really confident in my coding abilities. Luckily, I got an offer from a company that was willing to teach me a low-code platform to be a developer in (Pega). Things were pretty ok but I eventually changed roles to do manual QA and I'd been doing that for about 3 or 4 years. Due to government lockdowns and budget cuts, I got laid off and now I'm not really sure what I can do. Since I went into manual QA, my pega dev skills aren't really up to snuff, and my regular Java/C++ skills are definitely extremely rusty. I've applied to both Pega dev jobs as well as manual QA jobs, but I'm trying to figure out what else I can do in the meantime.I'm considering going into pharmacy technician jobs since I have connections there, but on the coding side I'm not really sure what I should do to bounce back. Should I try and relearn my pega skills even though there are less jobs up for that? Relearn java/c++ thru bootcamp or otherwise? Try and learn javascript or python for automated testing roles? New language entirely like Cobol or Rust? I'm just feeling very lost and not sure where the best use of my time would be. Edit: just to mention what my current plan is, right now I'm studying for a pharm tech certification so I can get a job to supplement/replace my unemployment checks. Once the cert is sorted, I was gonna continue applying for manual QA roles and maybe even entry level/junior dev roles while also looking into other, less coding-centric tech roles to pivot into so I can have a more financially stable long-term full-time job.",

        "content": "Huge gap between ego driven job posting requirement / interview process and the actual job.C level execs started to force only senior level hires, because AI supposedly magically does junior / mid level job by itself without anyone \"driving\" it. (it doesn't)I have had open positions, and often the job is not that difficult, but I'm forced to hire giga seniors only, with ego driven super tough interview processes. HR and people involved feel good drafting a super demanding job posting requirement and process. I internally cringe when I compare it to what actually is the job.The truth is no one wants to challenge it, my theory is it’s because in terms of optics. When leaders and execs say they hire senior only, it gives the impression that they are raising the bar, that they work on super hard problems, that the org super mature, etc... No one wants to say the truth that sometimes \"well actually what we work on here is not too hard, let's get a coachable hire we can invest in\". Last we tried we got shut down hard.What happens then, we eventually find someone senior enough that can pass the process, then they are underutilized, get frustrated and leave. Or they stay but invent problems and over engineer (and some important basic work does not get done).In the recent job posting I worked on, we had to remove a line about how \"you will get to coach juniors\" because we literally don't have any now. The simple tasks haven't disappeared, it’s just that seniors are wasting time on them instead of juniors.Frustrated with this, can anyone relate?[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qwmnv8)",

Wanted to hear anyones thoughts on if I should do anything or just leave it.Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions - sent a nice note to the recruiter, figured I don't have much to lose, really only gain if he can sympathize but likely won't change anything.

        "content": "To not make it extremely long yet also consice enough...I'm a recent CS major graduate, and I managed to land a role very shortly after graduation (aka. zero actual work experience) as a \"game dev intern\" at a software company (they're not a game studio, they're mainly vehicle-oriented), basically making them a simulation for cars.The internship is 6 months, and during these months, I'd been working on my own in this project, with the only additional help is just insight from my supervisor, but other than that, I built everything myself from the ground up.Now I'm mainly a game developer, just regular Unity/Unreal stuff, with some knowledge with graphics APIs like OpenGL and DirectX, but that's pretty much it. On the job however, the actual \"game dev\" part is like 40%, maybe 35% of the project. The rest is system configurations on platforms, bash scripting, networking and front-end, and recently robotics too. All of that was not only way outside my main working field, but also no one else in the team is able to help me with the project.About two months ago, deadlines started approaching, and with them, much more pressure and extremely long days, especially since I, as an intern, was responsible for this project that should be presented at some big \"conferences\". And of course, wouldn't you expect it (even though I'd have loved achieving it and being proud of it), I failed every single deadline. Too many moving parts of it and with the typical managers' requests, made me even more burnt out. The \"internship\" is 5 days/40 hours a week, full on site, with no options for days off. And more than once, I had to (not by my choice, but it did sort of help once) go on weekends to catch up.Eventually, about a month ago, I reached a state of burnout where I'm simply not even doing the bare minimum of a job to not get fired anymore, I couldn't be bothered. Even though the job pays so well at this level, the pressure made me terrified of staying any longer at the company.Am I right to feel that way or do I need to \"toughen up\"?Edit: I forgot to mention, we have paid access to AI agents so they handle all the heavy duty I barely write code myself anymore. But still, even with them, it's become quite exhausting working like a senior yet being an intern.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, just wanted to get a feel for the current job market for cleared SWE roles.A little background: I have a BSCS from a state school and a MSCS from Georgia Tech (OMSCS program). I’ve got about \\~3 years of experience, and I’ve been working as a full stack developer on a DoD project, so I do have an active security clearance (secret level).I started as a campus hire making $65k for this big defense consulting company, and after a few raises I’m at $79k now. No bonus though (my company doesn’t pay bonuses at my current level, which is some BS...). Also no promotion so far as they keep saying the market is bad, even though the company used to promote campus hires within 2 years just a few years before. I’ve been basically fully remote the whole time, which has been the best part about this job honestly.But yeah… things are getting worse. They’ve been slowly cutting people, and now they just eliminated our entire team (the project is going to end some time in February), so we’re basically being told we need to find other projects internally. I’m definitely not quitting without something lined up, and I’ve already started sending my internal resume to other teams inside the company. But at the same time, I feel like I should start looking outside too since i feel i can get paid more if i switch jobs...So I’m curious, how’s the cleared job market right now? I’m currently living in a MCOL city, and I’m willing to relocate if the company offers relocation assistance. I know the job market overall is pretty rough right now. Any advice would be appreciated.",

I'm hesitant bc it would involve relocating to Los Angeles and the extra hours would be the norm rather than the exception. I do think they're the future but do you think it is worth the extra grind and higher COL? Looking for guidance",

        "content": "For context, I finally got an offer from a company that’s a bit smaller, but the compensation is decent and the work is solid for learning a lot at the beginning of my career. That said though, I have to give an answer to them within the next day two days. I’m also in the running for another company that’s relatively larger, would teach me a lot, and most importantly would start me at about 15-20k more base than the first company. The issue is I’ve done 3 interviews with them but would still need to do another in-person and I’m almost certain they won’t give me offer before the deadline for the other offer. With how the economy is right now, declining the first offer and hoping the other one comes through is simply off the table, I have to take the guaranteed offer right now no matter what. That said though, if the other company does come through say a week down the line, I would hate to have to decline the materially better offer due to some unfortunate timing. My question is, would it be acceptable to accept my first offer and then potentially rescind my acceptance a week or two later if I do get a better offer from the second company? I would ideally like to not burn any bridges, but the company is smaller so I’m sure it would impact them a little more. Of course, that would also mean it wouldn’t be the end of the world if I can’t work with them anymore since it’s not a big company with a lot of potential job openings anyways. I’m just not familiar with this area, and I’m not sure if this is like unheard of or potentially career-threatening later down the line. I do understand this is all assuming I get the job for the other company which may not happen anyways, but I wanted to be prepared just in case. This is all unfamiliar territory for me, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

We have had a number of bad deployments lately where shit was not tested as well as it could have been.

I've done a few system design interviews before, but those were whiteboarding sessions. I haven't had to actually code up a full system under time pressure and validate it against a suite of test cases.Are there any sites where you build a system in code and run it against a test suite? Essentially, Leetcode but for system design? Or problem sets/files that I can work through and then locally run the tests myself? I've already found some LeetCode problems like \"Design an In-Memory File System\" and \"Web Crawler,\" but I'm curious what else is out there.Any resource recommendations on OOP design principles and patterns, too? I'm currently going through System Design Interview by Alex Xu, but that's about it.Lastly, I'd love any advice for those who have taken this OA. Definitely a bit nervous!Thanks!",

Are there beginner-friendly learning paths that hiring managers actually respect?

        "content": "TL;DR: I have \\~3 years of SWE experience (including 2 years at Amazon), but I’ve been out of the industry for almost 2 years due to health issues. In today’s market, is it realistic to get back into an SDE role, and how should I approach it?Hi all. I’m looking for honest perspective from people who’ve been in the industry for a while, especially anyone who has hired or returned after a gap.I have a CS degree and about three years of professional experience as a backend engineer. I spent roughly a year at a banking-as-a-service/fintech company, then two years at Amazon working on backend services. After Amazon, I took time off because I had savings and I needed a reset. What I expected to be a shorter break became much longer because I ran into health issues that took time to resolve. I’m doing better now, and I’m ready to re-enter the workforce, but the gap has me worried; not just because it’s almost two years, but because I’m re-entering during a slower market.I’m currently getting back into interview prep (LeetCode, system design, and behavioral). I haven’t applied broadly yet because I wanted to rebuild momentum first. The part that’s making me anxious is whether recruiters and hiring managers will view the gap as a hard stop, even with the Amazon experience. I learned a lot in that role and I feel like the work itself made me a stronger engineer, but I also know the market can be unforgiving about “recent experience,” and I don’t have that right now.I’m not asking for reassurance so much as a realistic read on how this plays out. Is a two-year gap something that can be overcome with strong prep and a straightforward explanation, or does it usually require a different strategy (contracting first, down-leveling, focusing on smaller companies, heavy networking/referrals, etc.)? If you’ve seen people come back successfully after a gap, what actually made the difference?I’m genuinely committed to staying in software and I want to work in the field I trained for, but I’m also trying to be pragmatic about what the next step should look like. Any advice on how to approach applications, how to talk about the gap without oversharing, and what expectations to set would really help.",

        "content": "Just had a screening with a company for a frontend engineer position. This was my first meeting with them and it was over Zoom. She said they are looking for someone very strong in React and who will be up to par with the staff engineers on the team by the first two months. I've used React but all of my professional experience has been with Angular, which she knows from my resume. It was going okay until she started asking me some technical questions which I didn't expect since it was supposed to be a phone screen type meeting. I stumbled on some of the questions and gave responses that I didn't feel good about, and one question I straight up had to say \"I'm sorry I'm struggling to remember right now.\"I'm feeling really bad about it. I'm going to send a follow up thank you email, and I'm wondering if it's a good idea to acknowledge the questions I stumbled on? Something like \"I realized afterward there were a couple technical topics I could’ve explained more clearly. I appreciate the space to think through them during the conversation. I’m excited about the opportunity to go deeper in future discussions.\" Or should I not even acknowledge it at all?",

Until I looked the company’s name up on this subreddit (and on other forums). I’ve read many complaints, but the main one I am worried about is not learning transferable skills. I acknowledge that it may not be the best in terms of developing my software engineering skills, but I am honestly not even set on pursuing a career in strictly that. I am just worried that after I stay at this company at least a few years, if I happen to want to leave, what will I do? For other people who have worked here: did you have to start your career over? Were you able to leverage your experience here at all? Thanks!",

These days I've been applying but it is absolutely a blood bath I've gotten no calls back or even OA invites and it feels like my job has been slowly declining further and further. I also feel like the work is growing stale and I'm falling behind as a dev. Biggest bright side is my WLB is great and I like the people I work with but the pay isn't great for my level 114k VHCOLWhat's the best course of action in my position, I've got a bunch of desktop development experience in C++ and some server side development in Java (osgi not spring boot though). I also do have active clearance but IDK if it's worth keeping or not at this point. I've been debating either just leetcoding like crazy and memorizing system design stuff but I've also been thinking of trying to go back for an online Masters in CS. I'd like to be fully remote for my next role but I'm sorta losing hope that would be possible in this market so I'm sorta lowering my expectations to just being hybrid if possible",
