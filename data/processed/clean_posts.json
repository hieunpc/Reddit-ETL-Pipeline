        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’ve just been promoted to a mid-level data engineer. I work with Python, SQL, Airflow, AWS, and a pretty large data architecture. My SQL skills are the strongest and I handle pipelines well, but my Python feels behind.Context: in previous roles I bounced between backend, data analysis, and SQL-heavy work. Now I’m in a serious data engineering project, and I do have a senior who writes VERY clean, elegant Python. The problem is that I rely on AI a lot. I understand the code I put into production, and I almost always have to refactor AI-generated code, but I wouldn’t be able to write the same solutions from scratch. I get almost no code review, so there’s not much technical feedback either.I don’t want to depend on AI so much. I want to actually level up my Python: structure, problem-solving, design, and being able to write clean solutions myself. I’m open to anything: books, side projects, reading other people’s code, exercises that don’t involve AI, whatever.If you were in my position, what would you do to genuinely improve Python skills as a data engineer? What helped you move from “can understand good code” to “can write good code”?EDIT: Worth to mention that by clean/elegant code I meant that it’s well structured from an engineering perspective. The solution that my senior comes up with, for example, isn’t really what AI usually generates, unless u do some specific prompt/already know some general structure. e.g. He hame up with a very good solution using OOP for data validation in a pipeline, when AI generated spaghetti code for the same thing",

To add context, I live in Germany and have about 2.5 full time YO and 2 years of internships in data engineerings. - Offer 1: Big Airline company - main tech stack: Databricks, Scala, Spark - Note: I will be the only data engineer in the team working with an analysts, intern and team lead. - High responsibility role and a lot of engagement needed- Offer 2: Mid size 25 YO ecommerce company - main tech stack: Azure Fabrics, dbt, python - Note: I will be the only data engineer in the team working with 3 analysts and team lead. - The want someone to migrate their old on-prem tech stack to azure Fabrics and use dbt to enable analysts - High responsibility role and a lot of engagement needed- Offer 3: Tech start up (Owned by big German auto maker) - main tech stack: AWS, python, protobufs - Note: data platform role. I will be working with 4 data engineers (2 senior) and a team lead - Medium responsibility role as there are other data engineers in the team My main back ground is close to offer 2 and 3, but I have no experience in databricks (The company ofc knows about this). I am mostly interested in offer 1 as the company is the safest in this market, but have some doubts about whether the tech stack is the best for future job changes and if it is popular in DE world.

Most experienced DE has less skill in git than others. Our repo is mainly with DDLs, airflow dags and SQL scripts (we want to soon start using dbt so we get rid of DDLs, make the airflow dags logic easier and benefit from other dbts features).We have test & prod environment and we currently do the feature branch strategy -> branch off test, code a feature, PR to merge back to test and then we push to prod from test. (test is our like mainline branch)Pain points:•⁠We dont enjoy PRs and code reviews, especially when merge conflicts appear… •⁠sometimes people push right to test or prod for hotfixes etc.. •⁠we do mainline integration less often than we want… there are a lot of jira tickets and PRs waiting to be merged… but noone wants to get into it and i understand why.. when a merge conflict appears, we rather develop some new feature and leave that conflict for later..I read an article from Mattin Fowler about the Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches and while it was an interesting view on version control, I didnt find a solution to pur issues there.My question is: do you guys have similar issues? How you deal with it? Maybe an advice for us?Nobody from our team has much experience with this from their previous work… for example I was previously in a corporate where everything had a PR that needed to be approved by 2 people and everything was so freaking slow, but here in my current company it is expected to deliver everything faster…",

Engineers are arguing that they are already on AWS and Redshift natively integrates with VPC, IAM roles, etc. And with reserved instances, cost of ownership looks cheaper than showflake.Analysts are not cool with it however. They complain about distribution keys and the trouble with parsing of json logs. They are struggling with Redshift's SUPER data type. They claim it’s \"weak for aggregations\" and requires awkward casting hacks. They want snowflake because it works no frills (especially VARIANT and dot notation) and they can query semi structured data.The big argument is that savings on Redshift RIs will be eaten up by the salary cost of engineers having to constantly tune WLM queues and fix skew.What needs to be picked here? What will make both teams happy?",

A small number of tasks take much longer and show most of the spill.The job uses joins and groupBy which trigger wide transformations. It runs on Spark 2.4 on YARN. Executors use the unified memory manager and spill happens when the in memory shuffle buffer and aggregation hash maps grow beyond execution memory. Spark then writes intermediate data to local disk under spark.local.dir and later merges those files.What is not clear is how much of this behavior is expected due to shuffle mechanics versus a sign of inefficient partitioning or skew. I want to understand how shuffle write relates to spill memory and spill disk in practice?",

However, the heavy imports (Pandas, PyArrow, PyIceberg) mean cold starts are noticeable (>500ms-1s), and we need larger memory allocation.Rust: The dream for Lambda (sub-50ms start, 128MB RAM). BUT, the iceberg-rust writer ecosystem seems to lack a high-level API. It requires significant boilerplate to manually write Parquet files and commit transactions to Glue.The Question: For those running high-frequency ingestion:Is the maintenance burden of a verbose Rust writer worth the performance gains for 30s batches?Or should we just eat the cost/latency of Python because the library maturity prevents \"death by boilerplate\"?(Note: I asked r/rust specifically about the library state, but here I'm interested in the production trade-offs.)",

The proposal is to migrate our dbt models from PostgreSQL to BigQuery in order to take advantage of BigQuery’s OLAP capabilities for analytical workloads. However, since I am quite fond of PostgreSQL, and value having a stable, open-source database as our data warehouse, I am wondering whether there are extensions or architectural approaches that could extend PostgreSQL’s behavior from a primarily OLTP system to one better suited for OLAP workloads.So far, I have the impression that this might be achievable using DuckDB. One option would be to add the DuckDB extension to PostgreSQL; another would be to use DuckDB as an analytical engine interfacing with PostgreSQL, keeping PostgreSQL as the primary database while layering DuckDB on top for OLAP queries. However, I am unsure whether this solution is mature and stable enough for production use, and whether such an approach is truly recommended or widely adopted in practice.",

We were given orders to migrate this database into a Databricks schema and shut down the old database for good. The person who was charged with the migration then did not order the columns in their assigned positions in the migrated tables in Databricks. All the columns are instead ordered alphabetically. They created a separate table that provided information on column ordering.That person has since left and there have been some big restructure, and this product is pretty much my responsibility now (nobody else is working on this anymore but it needs to be maintained).Anyway, I am thinking of re-migrating the migrated schema with the correct column order in place. The reason is that certain analysts sometimes need to look at this legacy data occasionally. They used to query the source database but that is no longer accessible. So now, if I want this source data to be visible to them in the correct order, I have to create a view on top of each table. It's a very annoying workflow and introduces needless duplication. I want to fix this but I don't know if this sort of migration is worth the risk. It would be fairly easy to script in python but I may be missing something.Opinions?",

I have to run a basic SELECT (row-based processing, no group-by) on it, inside a Kubernetes pod with __512MB memory__.I have verified that the Linux gunzip command successfully unzips the file from inside the pod. DuckDB, however, crashes into OOM when directly given the gzip file. I'm using Java with DuckDB JDBC connector.As a workaround, I manually unzip the file and then give it to DuckDB as unzipped. It still failed with OOM. I also followed the advice in docs to set memory_limit, preserve_insertion_order, and threads. This gave me a DuckDB exception instead of the whole process getting killed, but still didn't fix the OOM :DI finally started opening the file in Java code, chunking it into 3000-line or so \"sub-files\", and then processing _those_ with DuckDB, after some try and fail. But then I was wondering, is that the best DuckDB can perform?All the DuckDB benchmarks I can remember were about processing speed, not memory usage. So am I irrationally expecting DuckDB to be able to process a huge file row by row without crashing into OOM? Is there a better way to do it? Thanks",

        "content": "Recently at work I was tasked with optimizing our largest queries (we use spark—mainly SQL). I’m relatively new to Spark’s distributed paradigm, but I saw that most time was being spent with explosions and joins—mainly shuffling data a lot.In this query, almost every column’s value is a key to the actual value which lies in another table. To make matters worse, most of the ingest data are array types. So the idea here was to1. Never explode2. Never use joinsThe result is a combination of transform/filter/flattens to operate on these array elements and map them with several pandas UDFs (one for each join table) to map values from broadcasted dataframes.This ended up shortening our pipeline more than 50x, from 1.5h to just 5 minutes (the actual transformations take ~1 minutes, the rest is one-time cost setup of ~4 minutes).Now, I’m not really in charge of the data modeling, so whether or not that would be the better problem to tackle here isn’t really relevant (though do tell if it would!). I am however curious about how conventional this method is? Is it normal to optimize this way? If not, how else should it be done?",

        "content": "Hello there – I'm fairly new to data engineering and just started learning its concepts this year. I am the only data analyst at my company in the healthcare/pharmaceutical industry.We don't have large data volumes. Our data comes from Salesforce, Xero (accounting), SharePoint, Outlook, Excel, and an industry-regulated platform for data uploads. Before using cloud platforms, all my data fed into Power BI where I did my analysis work. This is no longer feasible due to increasingly slow refresh times.I tried setting up an Azure Synapse warehouse (with help from AI tools) but found it complicated. I was unexpectedly charged $50 CAD during my free trial, so I didn't continue with it.I opted for BigQuery due to its simplicity. I've already learned the basics and find it easy to use so far.I'm using Fivetran to automate data pipelines. Each month, my MAR usage is consistently under 20% of their free 500,000 MAR plan, so I'm effectively paying nothing for automated data engineering. With our low data volumes, my monthly Google bills haven't exceeded $15 CAD, which is very reasonable for our needs. We don't require real-time data—automatic refreshes every 6 hours work fine for our stakeholders.That said, it would make sense to explore Microsoft's cloud data warehousing in the future since most of our applications are in the Microsoft ecosystem. I'm currently trying to find a way to ingest Outlook inbox data into BigQuery, but this would be easier in Azure Synapse or Databricks since it's native. Additionally, our BI tool is Power BI anyway.My question: Would it make sense to migrate to the Microsoft cloud data ecosystem (Microsoft Databricks or Azure Synapse) in the future? Or should I stay with BigQuery? We're not planning to switch BI tools—all our stakeholders frequently use Power BI, and it's the most cost-effective option for us. I'm also paying very little for the automated data engineering and maintenance between BigQuery and Fivetran. Our data growth is very slow, so we may stay within Fivetran's free plan for multiple years. Any advice?",

The type model reflects the needs of modern applications and allows for rich annotations with semantic information that can be evaluated and understood by developers and by large language models (LLMs).JSON Structure’s syntax is similar to that of JSON Schema, but while JSON Schema focuses on document validation, JSON Structure focuses on being a strong data definition language that also supports validation.The JSON Structure project has native validators for instances and schemas in 10 different languages.The Avrotize/Structurize tool can convert JSON Structure definitions into over a dozen database schema dialects and it can generate data transfer objects in various languages. Gallery at https://clemensv.github.io/avrotize/gallery/#structurizeI'm interested in everyone's feedback on specs, SDKs and code gen tools.",

This is my first job after college and quite a technical role: focussed on aws infrastructure, etl development with python and spark, monitoring and some analytics. I started as a junior and recently moved to a medior title.I’ve been feeling a bit unfulfilled and uninspired at the job though. Despite the good pay, the role feels very removed from the business, and I feel like an ETL monkey in my corner. I also feel like my technical skills will also prevent me to move further ahead and I feel stuck in this position.I’ve recently been offered a role at a different large company, but as a senior data analyst. This is still quite a technical role that requires SQL, Python, cloud data lakes and dashboarding. It will have a focus on data stewardship, visualisation and predictive modeling and forecasting for e-commerce. Salary is quite similar though a bit lower.I would love to hear what people think of this career jump. I see a lot of threads on this forum about how engineering is the better more technical career path, but I have no intention of becoming this technical powerhouse. I see myself move into management and/or strategy roles where I can more efficiently bridge the gap between business and data. I am nonetheless worried that it might seem like a step back? What do you think?Cheers xx",

        "content": "Hey folks - looking for some architecture feedback from people doing this in production.We sit between structured data sources and AI agents, and we’re trying to be very deliberate about how agents touch internal data. Our data mainly lives in product DBs (Postgres), BigQuery, and our CRM (SFDC). We want agents for lightweight automation and reporting. Current approach: Instead of giving agents any kind of direct warehouse access, we’re planning to run them against an isolated sandboxed environment with pre-joined, pre-sanitized views pulled from our DW and other sources. Agents never see the warehouse directly.On top of those sandboxed views (not direct DW tables), we’d build and expose custom MCP tools. Each of these MCP tools will have a broader sql query- with required parameters and a real-time policy layer between views and these tools- enforcing row/column limits, query rules, and guardrails (rate limits, max scan size, etc.).The goal is to minimize blast radius if/when an LLM does something dumb: no lateral access, no schema exploration, no accidental PII leakage, and predictable cost.Does this approach feel sane? Are there obvious attack vectors or failure modes we’re underestimating with LLMs querying structured data? Curious how others are thinking about isolation vs. flexibility when agents touch real customer data.Would love feedback - especially from teams already running agents against internal databases.",

Whereas with S3 tables, you use a native AWS catalog, and maintenance is automatically handled. When would someone choose one over the other? Is there anything fundamentally wrong with the self-managed route? My plan was to ingest data using SQS+ Glue Catalog + PyIceberg + PyArrow in ECS tasks, and handle maintenance through scheduled Athena-based compaction jobs.",

It's basically a local app delivered via the web. For those interested in the technical details, it reads data directly from the filesystem using modern web APIs, and stores projects in IndexedDB.I'd be really keen to hear if anyone does find this useful :)**NOTE:** I've been told it doesn't work in Firefox due to it not supporting the filesystem APIs that the app uses.

        "content": "Hello everyone!I’m very very new to Spark Structured Streaming, and not a data engineer :grinning_face_with_sweat:I would appreciate guidance on how to efficiently process streaming data and emit only changed aggregate results over multiple time windows.Input Stream:Source: Amazon KinesisMicrobatch granularity : Every 60 secondsSchema:(profile\\_id, gti, event\\_timestamp, event\\_type)Where:event\\_type ∈ { select, highlight, view }Time Windows:We need to maintain counts for rolling aggregates of the following windows:1 hour12 hours24 hoursOutput Requirement:For each (profile\\_id, gti) combination, I want to emit only the current counts that changed during the current micro-batch.The output record should look like this:{\"profile\\_id\": \"profileid\",\"gti\": \"amz1.gfgfl\",\"select\\_count\\_1d\": 5,\"select\\_count\\_12h\": 2,\"select\\_count\\_1h\": 1,\"highlight\\_count\\_1d\": 20,\"highlight\\_count\\_12h\": 10,\"highlight\\_count\\_1h\": 3,\"view\\_count\\_1d\": 40,\"view\\_count\\_12h\": 30,\"view\\_count\\_1h\": 3}Key Requirements:Per key output: (profile\\_id, gti)Emit only changed rows in the current micro-batchThis data is written to a feature store, so we want to avoid rewriting unchanged aggregatesEach emitted record should represent the latest counts for that keyWhat We Tried:We implemented sliding window aggregations using groupBy(window()) for each time window. For example:groupBy(profile\\_id,gti,window(event\\_timestamp, windowDuration, \"1 minute\"))Spark didn’t allow joining those three streams for outer join limitation error between streams.We tried to work around it by writing each stream to the memory and take a snapshot every 60 seconds but it does not only output the changed rows..How would you go about this problem? Should we maintain three rolling time windows like we tried and find a way to join them or is there any other way you could think of?Very lost here, any help would be very appreciated!!",

        "content": "Hi everyone,## Our current situationI am working at a small software company, and we have successfully switched to Clickhouse in order to store all of our customers' telemetry, which is at the heart of our activity.We are super satisfied with it and want to move on.So far everything was stored in PostgreSQL.Currently, we're relying on a legacy format to define our aggregations (which calculations we need to perform for which customer).These definitions are stored as JSON objects in the db, they are written by hand and are quite messy and very unclear.They define which calculations (avg, min, max, sum, etc, but also more complex ones wih CTES...) should be made on which input column, and which filters and pre/post treatments should be made on it.They define both what aggregations should be made daily, and what should be calculated on top of it when a user asks for a wider range. For instance we calculate durations daily and we sum these daily durations to get the weekly resultThe goal is ultimately to feed custom-made user dashboards and reports.A very spaghettish code of mine translates these aggregation definitions into templated Clickhouse SQL queries that we store in PGSQL.At night an Airflow DAG runs these queries and stores the results in the db.It is very painful to understand and to maintain.## What we want to achieveWe would like to simplify all this and to enable our project managers (non technical), and maybe even later our customers, to create/update them, ideally based on a GUI.I have tried doing some mockups with Redash, Metabase or Superset but none of them really fit, mostly because some of our aggregations use intricate CTEs, have post-treatments, or use data stored in Maps etc..I felt they were more suited for already-clean business data and not big telemetry tables with hundreds of columns, and also for simple BI cases.## Why am I humbly asking for your generous and wise advicesWhat would your approach be on this?I was thinking about maybe a simpler/sleeker yaml format that could be easily generated by our PHP backend for the definition.Then for the conversion into Clickhouse queries,I was wondering if you guys think that a tool like DBT could be of any use in order to template our functions and generate the SQL queries, and even maybe to trigger them.I am rather new in Data Engineering so I am really curious about the recommended approaches, or if there might even be some standard or frameworks for this.We're not the first ones to face this problematic for sure!I just want to precise we'll go fully opensource and are open to developing stuff ourselvesThank you very much for your feedbacks!",

        "content": "Folks, I’m working on a data VCS similar to Git but for databases and data lakes. At the moment, I have a headless API server and the code to handle PostgreSQL and S3 or MinIO data lakes with plans to support the other major databases and data lakes, but before I continue, I wanted community feedback on whether you’d find this useful.The project goal was to make a version of Git that could be used for data so that we data engineers wouldn’t have to learn a completely new terminology. It uses the same CLI for the most part, with init, add, commit, push, etc. The versioning control is operations-based instead of record- or table-based, so it simplifies a lot of the branch operations. I’ve included a dedicated ingestion branch so it can work with a live database where data is constantly ingested via some external process. I realize there are some products available that do something moderately similar, but they all either require learning a completely new syntax or are extremely limited in capability and speed. This allows you to directly branch on server from an existing database with approximately 10% overhead. The local client is written in Rust with PyO3 bindings to interact with the headless FastAPI server backend when deployed for an organization. Eventually, I want to distribute this to engineers and orgs, but this post is primarily to gauge interest and feasibility from my fellow engineers. Ask whatever questions come to mind, bash it as much as you want, tell me whatever comes to mind. I have benefited a ton from my fellow data and software engineers throughout my career, so this is one of the ways I want to give back.",

The two sources are independently maintained so the mapping has to naturally go through certain ingestion steps that already transform the data as it goes to the DB. Scripts taking care of these exist in Python. The process has to repeat daily, so a certain level of orchestration is needed. Of course, the files will have to be stored somewhere as well. Read and write should be allowed to a few members of the team.No budget indicates the solution cannot be on Azure (Enterprise cloud) and support by the data teams but you still can make use of MS SSMS, Github and Github Action, Docker, and local/shared network storages, and anything open source like airflow. PS: please dont suggest not to do it given there's no budget - I could take this as a challenge if its possible only to bring some fun to the mundane tasks.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Context:We have an old MSSQL Server on prem + Alteryx for orchestration/transformations + Tableau server for visualizations. Our data \"team\" is basically just me, plus my manager and coworker - both of whom are mostly comfortable just with data visualization in Tableau. Our data comes in from various vendors (20+) in the form of flat files in SFTPs or API endpoints. Nothing overly crazy, no streaming, no more than 1-2 GB over the course of a day.While Alteryx has been \"good enough\" the last 10 years, their rapidly rising costs has led us to research various options at how we can modernize our data stack and keep costs low. My manager has given me free reign to research various options and come up with a plan that we can execute over 2026, just with the understanding that our company has a footprint in Azure, so I shouldn't branch out to AWS or GCP for example.Proposal:+ Azure Blob Storage to ingest and store all our vendors' files and data on a daily/hourly basis+ Dagster+ (hybrid) for orchestration+ Deltalake tables created/updated in blob storage for staging, warehouse, and marts layers using delta-rs and polars for transformations+ For serving to BI tools, use external tables in a Databricks SQL warehouse pointed to delta tables+ Keep Tableau as is, reduce our need for Alteryx over time to just last mile transformations/adhoc analysis for my other team membersOther considerations:+ DBT: I did some of their courses and tried to recreate an existing pipeline using dbt-core orchestrated by Dagster and it seemed overkill for my purposes. Everything I liked in it was already covered by Dagster, such as data lineage, testing, and the features that might be nice require cloud. I'm also more comfortable writing transformations in Python rather than SQL.+ Table maintenance: I'm aware that external tables are not managed by DBX and it's on me to manage the tables manually (optimize/vacuum). I figure I can set up a script that runs once a month or something to automatically do it.+ Why delta-rs? Again, we don't have overly complex data needs or sizes that require Spark computing costs. Our machines are perfectly capable of handling the compute requirements that we need. If we get to ML models down the road, then I'd probably run those in DBX notebooks and rely on their computing power.Has anyone else ran a similar design before? Any pitfalls or limitations to be aware of?",

Code isn't the hard part. On this topic, here is myI reply that we programmers use languages as tools. We use those tools to create programs. We test those programs. We package those programs. We sell those packages, or publish them as open source, or deliver them to an employer, or whatever. We get bug reports from users. We fix (some of) those bugs. We repackage and republish. Code is only part of the trade of programming. Professional programmers understand what our users need. We have clear vision for what a finished software package is and does and looks like. We get our work tested, packaged, and across the finish line. Along the way we write some code. The thing is, if we can do the other things well, the code is (usually) pretty easy, comparatively. At the same time, pure code isn't finished and doesn't have any users. That gets very boring very fast.Wanna see some examples of software packages of a scale that one person -- you -- can make and publish and try to attract live people as users?* These are Javascript utility packages. https://www.npmleaderboard.org/* These are plugins for WordPress: https://wordpress.org/plugins/* ...for Python. https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Topic+%3A%3A+Artistic+Software * Indie games. https://itch.io/There are other lists and repositories of packages out there for the searching. Laying down lines of code is just a part of our trade. The programmers of many of those packages did the whole job: explanation, instructions, code, testing, packaging, publishing, and then bug fixing. Read through some of the package descriptions; they'll give you a feel for what a piece of finished software looks like.Don't be too intimidated by the packages that turn up on the first page of these lists. The best of them have been around for many years, and have been through a lot of changes to perfect them. But those packages started somewhere. Yours can too.Make good software and stay in touch.",

Getting to that point where you can confidently pass live coding interviews.This is the point where I strive to get to, and the only way to do this is by actually learning the material. Hopefully some can relate when I say programming is very much enjoyable when you understand every bit of your code, but it gets frustrating if you have gaps in your knowledge and don't understand certain pieces of your code.When you understand every bit of it, you can literally lay on your bed and figure out the error in your head. If you take shortcuts it's much harder to do so, and you'll end up being at the point where you don't know if you can solve the error no matter how much time you have.I made this post to hopefully motivate you guys to actually learn the material, in which many of you are if you're in this sub.TLDR: If you actually learn the material live coding interviews will be a much smoother process(obviously), and coding will be much more enjoyable since you'll actually feel capable of debugging your app. The only way to get rid of imposter syndrome is by actually proving to yourself that you can do the work, don't take shortcuts.Edit: I also came to the realization that it is highly unlikely to \"master\" programming in the way I depicted it out to be. You won't be able to program everything without looking something up but there's nothing wrong with that. As long as you understand every bit of your code, then that's what matters.",

Again, no notes, no documentation, no references. Is that how it is on the job market? Am I expected to show up, learn stuff real fast, and be treated like a dummy if I consult documentation? I chose this career path partly because I like it, but also because I thought I could consult documentation until it becomes second nature down the line.",

I feel like this makes your methods harder to read once they get more complicated than this example. I have the same problem with ternary if/else is JS. I understand you have to type less charaters but its really easy to make your code less readable IMO.What are the general thoughts around these early returns vs writing out the full if-else?Edit: i understand this is a question about style and readability, thats why im asking.",

Our games department does not have any specific programming classes because the assumption is that most of that will be handled by the CS department, however the main engine we use for the game dev classes is UE5 which runs in C++. There is a games scripting class that I've just completed but that's all using blueprints. I've been told that higher level CS classes don't have a specific language requirement, however there is no dedicated class using c++ or even a primer as far as I'm aware, and would like to be able to transition my knowledge from java to C++ so I can start working effectively in building from there in that to sharpen my skillset later on. Advice I'm seeing tends to be either to read a specific book/forum (which tends to be a \\*very\\* slow method for me, safe to say I'm generally an audiobook person) or to just \"go and start\", which I can grab a compiler and start googling how something formatted in java is formatted in c++, but that doesn't give me as good of an understanding. So I'm not looking for a magic bullet here or anything, but something more than these two types of resources, and something that doesn't assume im an absolute beginner repeating fundamentals of programming would be great if possible?",

I ran into an issue with one of the exercises, where I couldn't add any lines to adjust any parameters because every time the finished graph was closed, everything I entered into the REPL was deleted from the queue and I had to enter the whole program into the REPL again.I went to AI to find this out, and asked about putting this all into a script. Two days later I have a script, an understanding of why I would have multiple files for a script (for separation of concerns), why I would put these files in the project directory and not a \\~/bin directory, and a few other things that I can't recall atm, but that I did not know before, or without, AI.I had to do some thinking to figure out what the script was doing, but not much thinking. I asked the AI a ton of questions along the way. I didn't simply copy-pasta the whole thing, but that only sounds like I'm justifying after-the-fact. Am I doing myself a dis-service?

Should I redo the projects, start the course over, or watch YouTube tutorials? I feel pretty lost right now.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I confess that I have a standard / frequent question around \"how do I create X type of app\", but there are three twists to the question, I promise! The FAQ helped, but before I go off and running, I want to \"test\" my hypothesis.**First, I'm old**. Not too old to learn (approaching 60), just that I have old programming experience. So I typed programs from computer magazines in BASIC into Commodore VIC-20s and PETs back in the 80s and saved them on cassettes; I learned BASIC and STRUCTURED BASIC in high school in the 80s; I took BASIC/FORTRAN/COBOL courses in university in the 90s. I learned enough to write a menu system in BASIC for running in DOS back in the '80s that allowed me to add/subtract items, write batch files that would launch when the menu closed and then reopen the menu when I was done running whatever program was, compile it and run it in DOS. Used it for years. So I have \\*\\*\\*SOME\\*\\*\\* experience. Just nothing recent. Oh, and I also can debug basic HTML / CSS issues on websites but avoid javascript stuff at least for now. I'd rather run WordPress with free plugins than program my own. I'm more of a user than a developer. The second twist is that I have **two very specific needs** in mind, both of which could perhaps be done with a robust GUI and back-end database instead of programming it. But well, I want something a bit more customizable to my specific issues to solve. So, like the videos recommend, I have specific problems to solve that will keep me interested! The first is harder and I have more passion for it; the second is easier and maybe where I should start, even though I'm not as excited about it.And the third twist is that I am **NOT trying to build a revenue stream**. I'm open to having a small revenue stream tied to it enough to buy myself a coffee if someone wants the extra \"bits\", but just looking to use the apps myself, $$ is not my goal. If others in my immediate community find it useful, I'd be open to sharing the apps everywhere for free and with no advertising. Maybe some \"extras\" available in a pro version for $1 or something.The first need would be a mobile app (iOS and Android) that acts like a **field recorder** as if someone was doing a survey or recording a business transaction BUT without local wifi/internet access. So, like you were out in the woods, say, doing biology research and you wanted to record which birds you saw, and the date/time/interesting details. BUT you also want to be able to record the equipment you were using and the place/location with sort of default \"profiles\". Like, \"Profile 1\" says you're using equipment X, Y, Z; Profile 2 says you're using X, A, B; Profile 3 says Y, Z, B, etc. But I want to load the default profiles in as starter info. There are existing database apps that do this, but I have some unique usage links that I'll need to pull from unique style databases too, which the database apps didn't have the power to do. Ultimately, I need the initial recording apps (mostly dumping info into a set of fields in a database) and then once I'm back in civilization, uploading them to a more powerful PC app that would be almost the same software in PC form, with some extra printing, formatting, layout features. I confess I have no idea where that info is saved on the phone, or the PC, or the inbetween bits (common upload to cloud when there's a connection? Like synching photos?). Just that I want the data to eventually be in the PC for more processing. It's not very complicated for operations (input screen, load profiles, enter data, save data, load previous records, etc.), and the graphics needs are not very sophisticated (very functionally focused). If it was the early 90s, I'd be tempted to even use COBOL. The app will do no calculations or advanced graphics; it's almost entirely a text-based database entry and retrieval function with some flex on forms.The second need is similar but even simpler in design. It's like **a quiz game.** Questions, with 4 possible answers, timed. It could be used as a game or as a flashcard-type study aid. I have a specific purpose in mind, but the functionality is basically that of a trivia game -- load small database (say 25 Qs about topic 1), go through the Qs, have options for hints or retries, get score at end, equivalent of a global leader board (so some internet required). But all single player, not live games with others, no live online element. And the extra twist for this one is I would love to be able to do it in iOS, Android, AND a version for my website for those who DO have access. The mobile apps would work differently, and I don't NEED a website version, but I'll keep my options open. The FAQ tells me to use Kotlin or Java (for Android); Objective-C or Swift (for iOS); C#, VB or JS for Windows Phone; or use PhoneGap / Titanium in HTML/CSS/JS. Oh and C# for the Windows PC version (no, I am NOT going to try MAC too). But with my specific two-use functionality...is that the way to go? I'm fine to learn new tricks, just want to make sure I'm learning the right tricks.",

I really want to learn this, so I've watched lectures and followed tutorials, but I feel stuck in a cycle of confusion and I’m hoping for some guidance on how to break out of it.A lot of my high school math is rusty as well, so I’ve been relearning on the fly. When I see the pseudocode or a solution, I can usually understand it at a surface level but when I'm given a problem, I blank on how to even start designing the algorithm. It feels like there's a gap between recognizing a solution and inventing one.I see the final algorithm, but the problem-solving process that led to it feels like a mystery. What mental steps should I be practicing?What I'm struggling with so far:* Foundational Math (Floor/Ceiling, Powers, Logarithms). I understand what a log is, but feeling its impact in binary search is different.* Algorithm Principles & Efficiency (Time/Space Complexity, Big-O). Is Big O notation like a set formula? * Arrays (Operations, Insertion/Deletion)* Searching (Linear, Binary Search)* Basic Algorithms (Array Merging) I'd really appreciate any help. I'm a visual learner so if you can recommend any YouTube channels or websites that are exceptional at teaching the problem-solving process would be great. Something that kinda holds your hand through the why before the how. I'd also like to know how you personally learnt to think algorithmically. Are there specific practices (like a certain way of using pseudocode, drawing diagrams, etc.) that helped you?Please help me find an effective way to practice and learn this.",

BaaS sounds good for authentication and a database, but besides that it seems actually more difficult to configure a backend using a BaaS.I don't know guys. I'm still relatively new to programming. What's your experience with using these BaaS? Is it still easy to setup even when needing the features listed above as well as other configurations?",

Ive bee growing up as an athlete and have recently shifted my journey to become an engineer.I want to do cool side projects that other studetns are doing, be good enough to create my own startup, and build my portfolio and knowledge in general. Obviously job hunting is important, but that just comes with my knowledge skill and expertise.Recently watched this guy named Gabriel Petersson talking about the importance of diving into things and trying making it over watching lectures over and over. I want to be independent from school and learn some things myself.Where should i start? With what goal?Everyone seems to be ahead of me since all i know is a bit of math, SUPER basic java, and how to be a wide receiver and run fast.",

Every time I try to look for answers to these questions, I get even more confused, more lost, and more overwhelmed. And I always end up in arguments about which programming language to start with, whether basics matter or not, and half the people giving advice are just trying to sell their own courses.Honestly, I’m tired and frustrated with this field before I even start. The community feels toxic, nobody talks about the actual job market, the long working hours (10–12 hours), the lack of entry-level jobs, or the fact that most companies want 2–3 years of experience just to let you in.Right now, I don’t know anything for sure.

I have plans to create automation software like an automatic maze generator and solver and etc. I've started 3Blue1Brown algebra lessons and problem solving as well.Although, I am using Claude AI to coach me additionally. I don't ask AI to write for me the code I want, but I do use AI to explain to me principles, to show me certain commands, how you call stuff, I ask about the logic. I never implement a code that I do not understand and sometimes spend hours reading on a topic an asking questions. Still, I feel a bit guilty for using AI for additional coaching, but I'm just a little slow when it comes to learning and need my own time and speed and I need a lot of freedom to ask questions - something, which is not freely available in academies and with real teachers.I am really interested in learning a lot of stuff, because I am very curious. I am curious about software development, ML, game dev, robotics, low-level languages as well and is all things I want to explore in the future step by step. I am just afraid of wasting my time learning the wrong way and then not knowing basic concepts or ways of work, as this field is pretty broad and it is quite difficult sometimes to follow and know where to learn from.",

I'm a non-CS grad, I did law, and I'm not from the U.S.I am a future FDM software engineering joiner (course starts on 19 Jan 2026), and I am also a former coding bootcamp student. For those that do not know FDM, they do a 3-month training programme that gives you fullstack coverage, then you will go for interviews to get a placement with a client (think the usual DSA questions). In my country, the clients are banks, and the tech stack taught is Java/Spring/React. I was advised to try and start studying the course objectives as much as I can so I struggle less during the course.***Please no comments about how I shouldn't join FDM. I know where I stand in the job market, having spent about 5 months on job applications, and I'm very grateful and thrilled to receive an offer from FDM. Please just be happy for me, and help me with my journey!***I completed CS50's Python and Intro to Programming so I can code in C, Python, JavaScript (poor front end skills though), and also have started programming in Java. I have projects on my portfolio, and I am really passionate about software engineering and I've bought some books to start. The more I read online about what CS majors read, the more overwhelmed I get. Additionally, I feel the added pressure of impressing the interviewers at an interview to get the top banks (think investment banks), but that's in 3-4 months' time.These are the books I have bought so far, and have started reading:* SICP (JS Ed.) by Abelson and Sussman* The Pragmatic Programmer (20th Ann. Ed.) by Thomas and Hunt* Clean Code (4th Ed.)Then there are other books that non-CS grads have been advised to get:* Operating System Concepts (Dinosaur Book)* Compilers Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Dragon Book)* Introduction to the Theory of Computation by SipserAnd then there are books on Java and OOP:* Effective Java by Bloch* Core Java I and II by Horstmann* Head First Design Patterns by Freeman and RobsonThere are just so many books. I am VERY happy to read them because I think these are just fascinating and I enjoy reading the books I have so far... but in what order?I'm a little confused about priorities because I've heard that DSA is taught very early on at university, but doesn't actually help you much on the job. Yet, I need to have a good understanding of it for interviews. I read *Grokking Algorithms* and *Grokking Data Structures*, and those were really fun reads, but those are just general overviews and theories; they don't actually help you with coding. Then I tried Leetcode and Neetcode, and however much I do, I just struggle with understanding because the video explanations aren't that great. So.... do I actually need to read Algorithms by Sedgewick and Wayne? How would that affect my job? But a lot of comments online have told me that this does require some understanding of Mathematics. Other reddit posts have pointed me towards MIT's Mathematics for Programming Course (but that looks pretty long) before reading this.**tldr:*** Which order should I buy / read the books above?* Which books should I buy to get better at Java / in general?* Do I actually need to read Algorithms by Sedgewick and Wayne? Will this affect my job? Prioritise before going for coding interviews?* Alternatives to Leetcode / Neetcode because I barely understand the explanations?",

The background is that latin has a lot of suffixes that occur under a combination of properties that the given word has. The two properties that are currently of interest for me are the Numerus (an Enum) and the Casus (another Enum).My first instinct was to create a two dimensional array for that, but I quickly realised that this will lead to confusion problems if I don't know at any given point in time in which order the suffixes are actually placed into the array, because they aren't linked to the values of the Enum directly.To circumvent this, I quickly figured out that I actually wanted to use the values of the Enum directly and map specific values in a table like fashion to them, basically like:(Singular, Nominative, \"us\")(Singular, Accusative, \"um\")Etc.So I wrote this class here:https://github.com/Hellinfernel/Latin-Learing-Program/blob/main/latin%2FBiEnumMap.java#L19Now the thing is I still don't have any idea if my approach here is even technically doable because I don't know how to get an collection of all the values of an given Enum class.I tried EnumSet and Enum directly, but none of that seemed to really function and I couldn't find a function in the docs that fulfilled my requirements, and I feel like I am either completely and utterly blind or am just not searching in the right place.I am pretty sure my code has other problems as well, but for now I just would like to know the following:How do I get a list of all values of a given Enum class to use them as an index for a map?",

        "title": "[Python] TypeError with floats using gmpy2 library",
        "author": "cton999",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello, I am new to and testing out the gmpy2 library to eventually use in other python code, but I have ran into some type of TypeError problem.>**1. What is the problem?**gmpy2.is\\_integer() is saying that floats that are equivalent to a whole number (i.e. 2.0) are integers, but when using gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) with \"whole number\" floats, it raises a TypeError where only integers or rational arguments are allowed.>**1. What is your code supposed to do?**Currently, I'm just testing simple mathematics operations and learning the gmpy2 library. My code is supposed to check what the type of input is for 2 numbers you select (through gmpy2.is\\_integer() ), and do either gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) for integers, or do gmpy2.div(x, y) for floats.>**2. What is your code doing instead?**See: \"1. What is the problem?\">**3. What inputs, if any, cause the problem?**Floats and gmpy2.mpfr() created floats that are equivalent to whole numbers, like 2.0.>**4. Is there an error message of some kind? If so, include it.**Yes: TypeError: qdiv() requires 1 or 2 integer or rational arguments>**2. What have you tried?**I can easily use the normal python isinstance(x, float), convert \"whole number\" floats to integers, or just use gmpy2.div(x, y) or some other division, but that is not the problem. The problem is with gmpy2.is\\_integer() and/or gmpy2.qdiv(x, y).For the code, I have tried using the first number as a float, the second number for a float, both numbers as floats, and those three combinations as gmpy2.mpfr() floats as well.>**1. What have you already tried to debug your own problem? Where do you suspect the problem is? What uncertainties do you have?**Printing gmpy2.is\\_integer(x) and gmpy2.is\\_integer(y) both return True when both x and y are \"whole number\" floats, and then gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) raises the TypeError, so I'd say the problem would be when I use gmpy2.is\\_integer() or gmpy2.qdiv(x, y).>**2. What precisely are you confused by?**I am confused that gmpy2.is\\_integer() is saying that \"whole number\" floats are integers, but then gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) says I'm not using integers.>**3. Have you tried googling for answers? If so, what search queries have you tried? What pages have you read? What do you find confusing about them?**I have like 20 tabs open that are gmpy2 docs, and various searches with different ways to ask about my problem. For example: \"gmpy2 is\\_integer\", \"gmpy2 qdiv\", \"gmpy2 qdiv with whole number floats\", and \"Why does gmpy2.is\\_integer() returns True for \"whole number\" mpfr floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them?\". For the last search, I got exactly 2 results, both of which are just gmpy2 documentation.On the gmpy2 docs, is\\_integer() → bool. Return True if x is an integer; False otherwise, and gmpy2.qdiv(*x*, *y=1*, */*) → mpz| mpq. Return x/y as mpz if possible, or as mpq if x is not exactly divisible by y.I am aware that gmpy2.is\\_integer() returns True is a float checked is equivalent to a whole number. I am also aware that gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) only works on integer and rational arguments.So what I'm confused about is why gmpy2.is\\_integer() returns True for \"whole number\" floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them.>**DO** be sure to actually ask a question.Why does gmpy2.is\\_integer() returns True for \"whole number\" floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them?>Anyways, here's the actual code import gmpy2 def test(x, y):     rlist = []     z = gmpy2.mul(x, y)     rlist.append(z)     h = gmpy2.add(x, y)     rlist.append(h)     if gmpy2.is_integer(x) and gmpy2.is_integer(y) is True:         print (gmpy2.is_integer(x))         print (gmpy2.is_integer(y))         j = gmpy2.qdiv(x, y)         rlist.append(j)     else:         i = gmpy2.div(x, y)         rlist.append(i)     return rlist print (test(4, 2.0))",

Two reasons:1) as I mentioned, I never struggled finding a job.2) when I talk to senior developers and leads in different companies, they always say: no qualified developers or current developers in the company should be fired because they are not doing their jobs well for many reasons.3) in the past 3 years, I've noticed a decline in the quality of the employees in general. They either lack skills, or they are lazy and we can't depend on them.My guesses: the location is a major factor in the availability of jobs. Outsourcing may have affected some jobs. Jobs are available but salaries are not enough.I may be wrong or maybe my circle is not big enough to judge, so correct me if I'm wrong and tell me your stories and facts I may have missed.",

We also have an issue where I feel like we overpoint tickets because no one wants to be that guy I guess. I thought I would be overwhelmed and have no idea what I’m doing but it’s gotten kind of tedious after doing it a couple of times.I know there’s a lot of stuff I don’t know. But it doesn’t feel like that knowledge gap is insurmountable or even hard to cross. Because in the end a lot of web dev does seem like it’s just crud stuff. Our backend is also in go so learning proper design patterns and stuff doesn’t really take that much time. What would you say is the hardest part of web development?",

Here's the main issue:I have zero desire to grind leetcode or interview questions (frankly burnt out from this sort of stuff when it already feels hopeless applying). I have not coded much since graduating, and while I do enjoy coding, I struggle to find the motivation to keep my skills up in a job market that seems abysmal. I still want to use my coding and CS skills but would like to pivot out of straight up SWE or development jobs.I've considered creating my own digital products to sell, starting my own business, maybe going into IT, and more. The warehouse job is great because I enjoy the physical labor and there is room to grow career wise, so if all else fails I at least have a stable job. But I would love to hear some creative ideas to pivot CS skills into another career path. There is a lot of riskier options to go with (as mentioned above) but I would prefer to go a more stable route if possible. I'm open to any and all ideas. Small sidebar: I have no college debt and good savings. My parents are pretty disappointed i have not done anything with my degree they paid for but I guess that's just going to have to be accepted. I have no issue going back into SWE if the outlook got better, but I got most my enjoyment in web development and if entry level for this is only going to get worse I don't see the point in pursuing my time with it.",

I feel like everything I see online is how bad the job market is for SWE's, and the only hopeful posts are ones about how the job itself is changing. I personally would rather not work in the field if the job truly becomes something akin to managing a team of AI agents. If I'm building something I want to actually build the thing. The degree I'm currently pursuing is in Data Science and the curriculum is still basically the same thing as a normal CS degree except a bit more math. I did this with the hope that the data science job market would be a bit better, but even now I'm hearing that the market is becoming over flooded. One might also think that MLE would be the way to go since that's what's taking over jobs right? But similar to DS I hear that those jobs are changing rapidly and are flooded with applicants. There's not as much need to custom train a model from scratch so most just use API's for the big names. It seems like the only jobs holding up are more Sys Admin and general cyber security roles. Personally, that realm isn't my thing and I'd much rather be programming something even if it's just a couple lines of SQL and Python. Is programming really just dead? At least in the way that it once was? I'm only 18 also, so I'm sure my view is just a bit too narrow. I'm sure that a lot of sectors are feeling this as well. I think just with AI being the new big thing and Computer Science jobs being so adjacent to this new advancement that we catch a lot of the heat because of it.For context on who I am, I'm an undergrad student at a T100. My high school offered free CompTIA certs, so I have the A+, Network+, and Security +. I've been programming since high school, and I did a software dev competition where I placed 5th nationally. I also worked essentially a help desk job my senior year of hs as well.If anyone has SWE adjacent jobs please let me know! Either just ones in general or ones that fit my experience. Also, if you think SWE isn't changing and will be fine I'm also curious to hear why.",

At my uni there was a heavy emphasis on theory and more academically oriented programming early on, as opposed to the type and pace of development that devs out in the world. By the time I started building real applications and doing internships, I found every aspect of the job, from planning/design to coding/testing, even the more dev ops/sysadmin parts to be quite draining and I can't imagine myself making a career out of this long term. Most of the advice for developers looking for a career change online is to move into project management, cyber, data analytics or something like that. But all of those are still centered around working with and implementing technical solutions, which is just something that I have no passion for. I'm wondering if anyone else had a similar experience and transitioned to something else? Or if a change like this is even plausible coming from such a technically oriented degree (the irony that I was a computer science major that doesn't like working with computers is not lost on me.)

In August of this year, I was laid off after the federal government canceled all the contracts I was working on, and there were no other positions available for me. I had been at the company full-time for almost three years before being laid off.I have been applying for jobs for almost five months now, and I have had no success. Most of the time, I do not even get interviews. When I do get interviews, I have reached the final round at Meta but did not get an offer. The same happened with Fanatics. At IBM, I failed the first programming interview after the coding assessment. I was interviewing for a C++ role but had limited experience. I have also interviewed for three local roles and made it to the final round in all of them.The only feedback I have received came from my two most recent interviews. For Company A, they said I did not perform well in the programming project during the interview because I focused on new Java features. However, they also said positive things. They thought I had the right culture fit and technical skill, but I lacked experience in DevOps, which I believe was not part of the job description, and I was relatively slow. For Company B, they said, \"We do not think your skillset is the best fit for the fundamental development tasks that will be our primary focus in the months ahead.\"My experience at my former employer was mainly with legacy systems, which is typical for government contracts. We used AWS for the entire system: ECS, RDS (Oracle SQL), DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambda, and S3. But all the backend code, where I worked full-stack, was in Java 8, later upgraded to Java 21, SpringMVC (no Spring Boot), Apache Tomcat, Apache Maven, SVN, and Git. The frontend consisted of JSPs that loaded XML files with vanilla JS, Bootstrap, and jQuery, along with CSS and HTML.It seems many companies are looking for reactive websites, which I have no experience with, or Spring Boot and more modern tech stacks. I am getting almost no interviews, and the process can take a month or more just to end in rejection. I know the job market is very difficult right now, but this is taking a serious mental toll on me. I already have disabilities and mental health issues, and I feel like my life and career are falling apart. I do not have skills for \"normal\" non-tech roles, and I do not know what to do. I know the obvious advice is to improve my resume and interviewing skills, but at some point, even getting an interview feels completely random, and the same goes for the interviews themselves.EDIT: Resume https://imgur.com/a/j1UZQnQ",

        "author": "vandeveloper",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Edit: Yes, my coworkers’ lazy and irresponsible attitude is affecting me. For example:User story 1 is assigned to me and person A. Person A did not finish his part and did not tell manager. And then he went on a trip and didnot answer his phone. Then manager made us (me and Person C) work overtime to cover person A's part to meet deadline. I had to “transfered” parts of the task to Person C so he can shared the workload that person A left. Juggling between coding and communication/transferring knowledge and Q&A with another dev really made me unable to focus. Also I was being questioned nonstop and pressured by managers to finish quickly and it worsened my mood and life quality due to pressure and unbalance work hours.User story 2 is assigned to me and person B. Person B didnt really care and did a bad job, and I had to review and corrected his mistake, because I knew in the end if the task isnt done, then I will have to work overtime or being questioned and pressured again. Managers only looked at the surface and whenever theres something not meet deadline, he assigned other members of the team to cover the lackluster member. I don’t know what they do to the particular member in the dark and it is not disclosed.Original:Hi guys, I wonder if theres some coworker that I have to team with and he is either lazy or irresponsible, should I tell the manager or not.I feel like if I always tell the manager, then it would look like I am the problem, who can not work with anyone and always badmouth.Also it may not be wise, since we might have the same paycheck but I am working with all my effort, and someone else is slacking of at work and have more time and energy for his personal life. I'm afraid I will somehow “raise the bar” for expectation and makes all the developers suffer under the already exploitative system.But if I kinda “side with him” and relax, the task will be late or has not very good quality. And it just doesnt feel right.How should I maneuver this? As a neurodivergent sort of person, things like this always confuse me and make me suffer to do the right thing, politics and all that.",

But coming back to the question, how has the university you've gone to helped you in your career (if it HAS at all), and what do you think for me? Of course, I want to get into a T15 cs university, but will that matter significantly? Also, I really apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to ask this question, just wanted answers from people in CS or looking for jobs.Cheers everyone!",

As an example, one role I saw, showed 85% of applicants had masters degrees, and 73% were senior-level applicants, while the rest of the figures (bachelor's, mid-level, entry-level) were in the teens.Given these metrics, recruiters and hiring managers, how is your process with choosing candidates in this situation? if it is an entry-level position, do you prioritize who is more experienced in years or do you opt to choose best fit based on the posting level? Is there a different guideline you follow?It would be interesting to read some perspectives on the hiring process. TIA!",

My job is to develop and maintain some minor web apps.I was fresh out of school (and pandemic) so it would’ve been my first job. I was also told I’d have had help from said resigned developer in form of emails (spoiler: I couldn’t ask him anything). The code was a mess, half of the stuff wasnt working and there was no documentation so I basically had to learn/guess what stuff did (nobody in the company knew what my apps did)Time skip to today. Stuff is better as I fixed most of things and everything works now. I even implemented some new stuff.Tomorrow I have a big deploy planned, and as every other time I do, I got anxiety. Because of that, I wanted to look of other people had my problem. And they do, and the discussions helped me a lot. But everyone talked about how it is a team’s effort. And I was there like “Wait, what team?”I’m all alone following my stuff. I do all the coding, testing and maintainance. And I’ve always believed it was the norm, as most of my collagues (Who follow other stuff) are like 2 people at most following the same projects.Am I the only one in this situation?

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello Community,Fortunate enough to have received two Entry Level Software Engineer offers from these companies. Looking for your guidance on which will be better to start my career with.Long Term Goals (at least as of now):Work at a bigger, more respectable Company. Either Big Tech or Fin-Tech (like Bloomberg).Get an MBA from a respectable institution (like Top 20), since my undergrad is a no-name school. Intuition behind getting an MBA is I like software, but I also like the business side of things. MBA obviously also helps with getting a promotion to the business side of things. I will probably pursue the MBA part-time while working full-time.Capital One TDP, McLean, VA (DC Metro Area):Base: 130k, One Time Bonuses (Sign-on + Relocation): 30k, Target Bonus (3600)Pros and Cons will of course be a bit team-dependent, I know a Senior Engineer there who 'might' be able to help with team-matching when the time comes. Team has not been assigned yet; they will match us later.TDP Rotations are 1 year and then 6 months, for a total of 18 months. I do not know about the conversion rate from TDP to full-time.Pros:Bigger Name and a more tech-focused company.TCDC Metro Area(?): Plenty of companies in the DC Metro Area to switch to in case things goes sideways. Amazon, Google, Gov Contracting, Consulting.Hybrid Schedule: 3 days in office, 2 days remoteCons:Stack Ranking and PIP Culture: Around 10% of the staff is laid off every 6 months.Performance Review Method: Performance is evaluated every 6 months, and historical performance does not matter in the next cycle.Worth mentioning: Everyone is judged on a scale of 1-5, and as long as you can stay at 3 or above, you are fine.DC Cost of Living is very high, so not sure how far the higher TC will go.I will have to switch sooner or later (unless there's a miracle and I find a great team environment there).AT&T TDP, Atlanta, GA:Base: 90k, One-Time Bonus (Sign-on): 5k, Target Bonus: 10k.TDP rotations are 1 years each for 2 years. Getting placed full-time in a team after TDP is pretty much guaranteed.This is an intern return offer, so I have pretty good rapport with the managers there. I believe I will have a say in the team matching so I end up with a team whose work seems interesting to me.Pros:Chill work environment, very low chances of PIP/layoff.When I interned there, everyone including the managers were really nice.Good rapport with TDP management means getting placed on a good (or at least interesting) team.Chill work environment means I can coast there while getting a Masters in CS from Georgia Tech (part-time) that might help with employability in the future. Georgia Tech name is pretty strong in tech so that would work in my favor.Atlanta also has a lot of companies there to switch to like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, Blackrock.Cons:5 days in-office (haven't worked remote in my life so I don't really mind this)Lower TC (?): Atlanta's cost of living is much lesser.Legacy Organization (?): This might play a part when trying to switch.Please help me navigate this. Are there any factors I am not considering or giving enough importance to?My primary thoughts were the TC difference is pretty huge to not be considering Capital One, although in a high CoL area. More tech-focused company. But that comes at the cost of being on your toes all the time, in an unstable market.Would you rather be in the DC Metro Area or in Atlanta? I do prefer the hot weather though haha.Edit: Removed some MBA-related stuff, as someone pointed out, is not relevant for now.",

        "content": "With all the doom and gloom in the tech industry right now, I wanted to hear from this community. What companies do you think are actually good places to work? I’m not talking about top-tier compensation or perks like free food or rides. I mean places where the work feels meaningful, you’re treated with basic respect, you can spend time with your family, and you’re not at risk of getting laid off at the snap of a finger.It feels like in the last 15 years, getting a high paying tech job has become part of people’s identities. The tradeoff is that a lot of us have lost touch with what it means to live a full life, where work is part of life instead of the whole thing. Hobbies, friends, family time, just being a human being. All of that gets pushed aside for the grind.I made the mistake of opening TeamBlind today and that place is a mess. Everything is about who has it worse, who has it better, or people endlessly hyping trillion-dollar companies like it’s their entire reason for being.I don’t expect big tech to magically grow a heart. At the end of the day, these are businesses. So in the spirit of keeping it real, I’d love for people to share workplaces where the culture is actually decent. I’m tired of seeing the 200th post about how terrible Amazon’s culture is. If someone wants a better life, they probably won’t find it in the belly of the beast.To be clear, this isn’t about discouraging anyone from aiming for MAANG if that’s what they want. Go for it. I just want to build a thread where people can say, here are the companies where you can have a career without sacrificing your entire life chasing something you never quite catch. Note : I'm aware that not all top tech companies are toxic, and it greatly depends on the team, please share those as well.",

        "author": "Icy-Dog-4079",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I was rejected but I’d love to see if I can get some honest feedback. I know it’s a lot but I need help because I’m not getting offers!Please take a look.It’s a Senior SRE role.# Patreon SRE – Live Debugging Round (Kubernetes)## Context* Goal of the round:Get a simple web app working end-to-end in Kubernetes and then discuss how to detect and prevent similar production issues.* Environment:Pre-created k8s cluster, multiple YAMLs (base / simple-webapp, test-connection client), some helper scripts.Interviewer explicitly said I could use kubectl and Google; she would also give commands when needed.* There were two main components: 1. Simple web app (server) 2. test-connection pod (client that calls the web app)---## Step 1 – Getting Oriented* At first I wasn’t in the correct namespace; the interviewer told me that and then switched me into the right namespace.* I said I wanted to understand the layout:* Look at the YAMLs and scripts to see what’s deployed.* I used kubectl get pods and kubectl describe to see which pods existed and what their statuses were.---## Step 2 – First Failure: ImagePullBackOff on the Web App* One of the simple-webapp pods was in ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull.* I described my reasoning:* This usually means the image name, registry, or tag is wrong or doesn’t exist.* I used kubectl describe pod to see the exact error; the message complained about pulling the image.* We inspected the deployment YAML and I noticed the image had a tag that clearly looked wrong (something like ...:bad-tag).* I said my hypothesis: the tag is invalid or not present in the registry.* The interviewer said for this exercise I could just use the latest tag, and explicitly told me to change it to :latest.* I asked if she was definitively telling me to use latest or just nudging me to research; she confirmed “use latest.”* I edited the YAML to use the latest tag and then, with her reminder, ran something like:* kubectl apply -f base.yaml (or equivalent)* After reapplying, the web app pod came up successfully with no more ImagePullBackOff.---## Step 3 – Second Failure: test-connection Pod Timeouts* Next, we focused on the test-connection pod that was meant to send HTTP requests to the web app.* I ran kubectl get pods and saw it was going into CrashLoopBackOff.* I used kubectl logs :* The logs showed repeated connection failures / HTTP timeouts when trying to reach the simple web app.* I wasn’t sure if the bug was on the client or server side, so I checked both:* Looked at simple-webapp logs: it wasn’t receiving requests.* Looked again at test-connection logs: client couldn’t establish a connection at all (not even 4xx/5xx — just timeouts).---## Step 4 – Finding the Port Mismatch (Service Bug)* The interviewer suggested, “Maybe something is off with the Service,” and told me to check that YAML.* I opened the simple-webapp Service definition in the base YAML.* I noticed the Service port was set to 81.* The interviewer asked, “What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.* I reasoned:* If the app container is listening on 8080 but the Service exposes 81, the test client will send traffic to 81 and never reach the app.* That matches the timeouts we saw in logs.* I changed the Service port 81 → 8080 and re-applied the YAML with kubectl apply.* The interviewer mentioned that status/health might lag a bit, and suggested I re-check the test-connection logs as the quickest validation.* I ran kubectl logs on the test-connection pod again:* This time, I saw valid HTML in the output, meaning the client successfully connected to the web app and got a response.* At that point, both pods were healthy and the end-to-end path (client → Service → web app) was working. Debugging portion complete.---## Step 5 – Postmortem & Observability DiscussionAfter the hands-on debugging, we shifted into more conceptual SRE discussion.1) How to detect this kind of issue without manually digging?I suggested:* Alerts on:* High CrashLoopBackOff / restart counts for pods.* Elevated timeouts / error rate for the client (e.g., synthetic test job).* Latency SLO violations if a probe endpoint starts timing out.* Use a synthetic “test-connection” job (like the one we just fixed) in production and alert if it fails consistently.2) How to prevent such misconfigurations from shipping?I proposed:* CI / linting for Kubernetes YAML:* If someone changes a Service port, require:* A justification in the PR, and/or* Matching updates to client configs, probes, etc.* If related configs not updated, fail CI or block the merge.* Staged / canary rollouts:* Roll new config to a small subset first.* Watch metrics (timeouts, restarts, error rate).* If they degrade, roll back quickly.* Config-level integration tests:* E.g., a test that deploys the Service and then curls it in-cluster, expecting HTTP 200.* If that fails in CI, don’t promote that config.3) General observability practicesI talked about:* Collecting metrics on:* Pod restarts, readiness/liveness probe failures.* HTTP success/error rates and latency from clients.* Shipping these to a monitoring stack (Datadog/Prometheus/Monarch-style).* Defining SLOs and alerting on error budget burn instead of only raw thresholds, to avoid noisy paging.# Patreon SRE System Design## Context* Format: 1:1 system design / infrastructure interview on a shared whiteboard / CodeSignal canvas.* Interviewer focus: “Design a simple web app, mainly from the infrastructure side.” Less about product features, more about backend/infra, scaling, reliability, etc.---## 1) Opening and Problem Framing* The interviewer started with something like: “Let’s design a simple web app. We’ll focus more on the infrastructure side than full product features.”* The prompt felt very underspecified to me. No concrete business case (not “design a rate limiter” or “notification system”) — just “a web app” plus some load numbers later.* I interpreted it as: “Design the infra and backend for a generic CRUD-style web app.”---## 2) My Initial High-Level ArchitectureWhat I said, roughly in order:* I described a basic setup:* A client (browser/mobile) sending HTTP requests.* A backend service layer running in Kubernetes.* An API gateway in front of the services.* Because he emphasized “infra side” and this was an SRE team, I leaned hard into Kubernetes immediately:* Talked about pods as replicas of the application services.* Mentioned nodes and the K8s control plane scheduling pods onto nodes.* Said the scheduler could use resource utilization to decide where to place pods and how many replicas to run.* When he kept asking “what kind of API gateway?”, I said:* Externally we’d expose a REST API gateway (HTTP/JSON).* Internally, we’d route to services over REST/gRPC.* Mentioned Cloudflare as an example of an external load balancer / edge layer.* Also said Kubernetes already gives us routing & LB (Service/Ingress), and we could have a gateway inside the cluster as well.---## 3) Traffic Numbers & Availability vs Consistency* He then gave rough load numbers:* About 3M users, about 1500 requests/min initially.* Later he scaled the hypothetical to 1500 requests/sec.* I said that at that scale I’d still design with availability in mind:* I repeated my general philosophy: I’d rather slightly over-engineer infra than under-engineer and get availability issues.* I stated explicitly that availability sounded more important than strict consistency:* No requirement about transactions, reservations, or financial double-spend.* I said something like: “Since we’re not talking about hard transactions, I’d bias toward availability over strict consistency.”* That was my implicit CAP-theorem call: default to AP unless clearly forced into CP.---## 4) Rate Limiting & Traffic Surges* When he bumped load to 1500 rps, I proposed:* Add a global rate limiter at the API gateway:* Use a sliding window per user + system-wide.* Look back over the last N seconds; if the count exceeds the threshold, we start dropping or deprioritizing those requests.* Optionally, send dropped/overflow events to a Kafka topic for auditing or offline processing.* I described the sliding-window idea in words:* Maintain timestamps of recent requests.* When a new request arrives, prune old timestamps and check if we’re still under the limit.* I framed the limiter as being attached to or just behind the gateway, based on my Google/Monarch mental model: Gateway → Rate Limiter → Services.* The interviewer hinted that rate limiting can happen even further left:* For example, Cloudflare or other edge/WAF/LB can do coarse-grained rate limiting before we even touch our own gateway.* I acknowledged that and said I hadn’t personally configured that pattern but it made sense.* In hindsight:* I was overly locked into “gateway-level” rate limiting.* I didn’t volunteer the “edge rate limiter” pattern until he nudged me.---## 5) Storage Choices & Scaling Writes* He asked where I’d store the app’s data.* I answered in two stages:1. Baseline: start with PostgreSQL (or similar):* Good relational modeling.* Strong indexing & query capabilities.2. Write-heavy scaling:* If writes become too heavy or sharding gets painful, move to a NoSQL store (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB, MongoDB).* I said NoSQL can be easier to horizontally shard and often handles very high write throughput better.* He seemed satisfied with this tradeoff explanation: Postgres first, NoSQL for heavier writes / easier sharding.---## 6) Scaling Reads & Caching* For read scaling, I suggested:* Add a cache in front of the DB, such as Redis or Memcached.* When he asked if this was “a single Redis instance or…?” I said:* Many teams use Redis as a single instance or small cluster.* At larger scale, I’d want a more robust leader / replica cache tier:* A leader handling writes/invalidations.* Replicas serving reads.* Health checks and a failover mechanism if the leader goes down.* I tied this back to availability:* Multiple cache nodes + leader election so the app doesn’t fall over when one node dies.* I also introduced CDC (Change Data Capture) for cache pre-warming:* Listen to the DB’s change stream / binlog.* When hot rows or tables change, proactively refresh those keys in Redis.* This reduces cache misses and makes read performance more stable.* The interviewer hadn’t heard CDC framed that way and said he learned something from it, which felt positive.---## 7) DDoS / Abuse Protection* He asked how I’d handle a DDoS or malicious traffic.* My answer:* Lean on rate limiting and edge protection:* Use Cloudflare/WAF rules to drop/slow bad IPs or UA patterns.* Use the gateway rate limiter as a second line of defense.* The principle: drop bad traffic as far left as possible so it never reaches core services.* This was consistent with the earlier sliding-window limiter description, but I could have been more explicit about multi-layered protection.---## 8) Deployment Safety, CI/CD & Rollouts* He then moved to deployment safety: how to ship 30–40 times per day without breaking things.* I talked about:a) CI + Linters for Config Changes* Have linters / static checks that:* Flag risky changes in infra/config files (ports, service names, critical flags).* If you touch a sensitive config (like a service port), the pipeline forces you to either:* Update all dependent configs, or* Provide an explicit justification in the PR.* If you don’t, CI fails.* The goal is to prevent subtle config mismatches from even reaching staging.b) Canary / Phased Rollouts* Start with a small slice of traffic (e.g., 3%).* If metrics look good, step up: 10% → 20% → 50% → 100%.* At each stage, monitor:* Error rate.* Latency.* Availability.c) Rollback Strategy* Maintain old and new versions side by side (blue/green or canary).* Use dashboards with old-version vs new-version metrics colored differently.* If new-version metrics spike in errors or latency while old-version remains flat, that’s a strong indicator to rollback.* He seemed to like this part; this matches what many SRE orgs do.---## 9) Security (e.g., SQL Injection)* He asked about protecting against SQL injection and bad input.* My answer, in hindsight, was weaker here:* I mentioned:* Use a service / library to validate inputs.* Potentially regex-based sanitization.* I didn’t clearly say:* Prepared statements / parameterized queries everywhere.* Never string-concatenate SQL.* Use least-privilege DB roles.* So while directionally OK, this answer wasn’t as crisp or concrete as it could have been.",

        "content": "TLDR: Any LinkedIn alternatives for making yourself visible?I have been working as SWE for over 5 years, and LinkedIn has been **extremely** helpful in my career. I am fortunate to have a high paying job, which I got from a LinkedIn reach out. In fact, most of my job offers came through LinkedIn and offer rate was much higher when recruiters reached to me first.Anyways, today I got a permanent restrictions on my account, which freaked me out and my profile basically disappeared online. After reaching out the customer support, they were able to fix the issue and they said it was suspended due to suspicious login activity.While troubleshooting, I browsed through LI sub, and I noticed there were several people whose accounts were banned. It could be real time ID verification failures, arguments in comment, etc. I was fortunate to get it resolved in hours, but some cases it took **weeks**. Apparently, making a new account will also result in a ban.If this were to happen during middle of job search, it could seriously feel devastating, losing visibility, recruiter conversations, access to the job application, submitted apps, etc.I realized it doesn't hurt to have a back up. Which platform is everyone using as a backup, so that people can reach out to you and build connections? In any meet ups I go, LI has been the de facto platform to connect.",

        "author": "EstablishmentProof54",

        "content": "Hey, Quick BG—> 3rd year engineering major (focused around software and embedded systems) I work in software primarily (co-ops) 2x Analyst / SDE Co-ops at mid to large size companies in Canada. I feel like traditional coding//problem solving is almost lost. I remember actually liking computers back in school (mid 2010s) and I’m not sitting on a high horse saying I’m better than anyone who prolly went into the field for money or any other reason because that’s not the viewpoint I’m judging this situation from.I’m seeing the market is almost trashed with students who mostly vibe code or really “cracked” students who are building up companies // are also TAs at the same time // also 2x at Amazon. For one end of the spectrum, every other persons got Claude, cursor, Copilot and putting up something in their Bio like “Building (insert words)ly”. You know I felt like in this field there’s a learning part as well where you take the time to get hands on with code , not quickly build something or use AI straight away. AI is great for learning and speed but the way its used to build projects which the “builders” themselves can’t explain most of the code for is pretty shocking. I feel like a lot of GitHub is just trashed with students uploading vibe coded react and next js projects. The other end is filled with really good students who somehow intern in their first year , have 5x internships by 3rd year and go on to be content creators and founders or whatever. Can’t complain about them as such because they probably do good but the question comes here, Where are the people who actually take the time to learn things , maybe not go so fast (I’m aware people have differences in learning speeds but it’s very absurd with the way it’s going). What I mean is the emphasis on theory and understanding stuff little by little , building up on it and then going onto be a very Good software engineer/ programmer / problem solver. As I said people probably can learn quickly but it almost feels like there’s no time on the software side of things to actually learn things properly (Web dev/ App dev the fields I’ve worked in). However on the other side of my degree which has circuits and embedded systems , it’s not so easy to get in and you can’t fake your way into it either. The barrier to entry is very high but at the same time if you’re good at your job you’re not easy to replace either. It still has the essence of the old comp sci when it was a subject to me in middle school. Everyone at the time I feel (mid 2010s) took the time to learn stuff and didn’t go so fast but the good part of the trade was they were genuinely very good at what they did. I don’t think that’s the case anymore today , and I’m only speaking about this from the entry level viewpoint. Would love an opinion from the more experienced and traditional devs about what they think of this.",

I have been applying to roles since January of 25' but it wasn't until August ish that I actually had a decent resume with Full Stack projects, 2 hackathons(including a 3rd place overall), I did a small internship at my school where I used Wordpress. I then also launched a startup solo, I have about 10 non paying users but hopefully it keeps growing. At the same time I have been doing freelance work, from landing pages to SaaS stuff. I have also been networking a lot, been present in almost all cs school events. I got referrals for Microsoft and other local companies(no luck). All while applying to 50 ish jobs per week since April-May.I have only been able to do like 5 phone screenings, a few follow up interviews, 1 technical at a startup and a final non-technical round at a f500 company but for a web marketing role(no leetcode). I have great soft skills and a lot of projects I can talk about so that is really not an issue for me. I have been griding leetcode on and off and I hate it too but what can we do. Now that I graduated this december, I decided that I dont want to keep waiting, so I took a role at the GeekSquad and am studying for my CompTIA Network+. I also won a coding event at my school and got a free voucher for the AZ-500 for next year.I do enjoy development but the market has been terrible for me. I was thinking that maybe It will be a good idea to try to go the IT route and eventually aim for DevOps roles or SRE. I also have a minor in PM so those roles work as well for me.(I have been applying for all sorts of roles)Has anyone done anything similar? Will going into IT now be a good strategy to ride out the job market?Thank you all in advance!! TL:DR Been applying for tech roles without luck for about a year and heavy for about 6 months, no luck. I just graduated and instead of waiting I decided to break into IT, get some certs and apply hard for entry level roles. Was wondering if anyone has done something similar and if this can be a good strategy to ride out the market?",

Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.Then I even heard that your cover letter doesn't get read, but the fact that you have one is acknowledged. Or I read recently in a post, that someone uploads a video as attachment for the application, quite unorthodox.

More personal thoughts:I interned at AWS, but I didn’t really connect with my team, and my project was pretty separate from what they actually worked on. Because of that, I still don’t have a solid grasp on what the full-time role would feel like day to day. I also didn’t love the overall Amazon culture, which makes me a bit hesitant about returning.Location is another factor. I’m from NYC and very used to walkability and easy access to everything. Seattle seems closer to that lifestyle, while San Jose feels much more suburban. I’m trying to figure out how much that should weigh into my decision since I plan to move back to NYC eventually.I’m also unsure which role sets me up better long-term (prestige/growth). I’m curious how hiring managers view early-career experience at AWS vs Adobe and which one tends to offer more mobility down the line.",

        "content": "January to May 2025 was a bit bittersweet. Was a college junior at the time, and I had just molded my resume into something semi-satisfactory after sticking a bunch of school projects onto it. I had pretty much locked in with applying to tech-adjacent roles like data analysis at this point, and was prioritizing local companies. I kept applying through the spring, long after many might've given up or accepted offers. And while most of the internships I'd applied to were duds, a few did reach out to me. None of them were really technical, and yet I managed to fail many of those. For some I feel like I came painfully close to an acceptance, only for the door to be slammed in my face never to be opened again.Come May, I was at wits end, and dreading the possibility of having to work at my church friend's father's store and get paid in cash for the second summer in a row. But eventually, I found a company which onboarded me at the last second for the summer. Their office wasn't far from where I lived, so things did go smoothly. Unfortunately, though, they didn't give me a return offer even though they were satisfied with my performance.For this fall I've landed a tech job through my school's research department that pays like 16 an hour. And while I've received glowing reviews for this, it's just through the school. In the meantime I've applied to a few tech jobs, and have even secured a few interviews. My resume looks a lot better now than it might've 1 year ago, people have reviewed it and told me that I'm well qualified for new grad. And yet, I'm like the world's worst interviewer. One guy ended the interview 10 minutes in because he didn't like my responses. Another gave up on me despite me being a referral. I've failed an OA they were asking for a \"winter help desk intern\" even though it's literally help desk.The last month of class I didn't even apply to anything at all, it was just depressing. I just feel like an idiot. I haven't leetcoded in ages, and if you throw LC at me right now I'll probably fail at it miserably. You can do everything with AI nowadays so that's literally what I've been doing for some of my work, like come on even many companies are doing it. I don't even want to leetcode. I don't even want to work. Some days I literally just want to sleep forever, to tell the truth. Once I literally ranted to some of the people on campus so badly after bombing one of these interviews that they had the cops called on me and forced me to go to the hospital to make sure I wasn't planning on unaliving myself.Hopefully I can lock in well enough to land something by the time I graduate may 2026. But something tells me I'm probably not. And if I don't the battle will just grow more and more uphill. You literally cannot afford to live life unless you're at the top of the world. The sooner I leave my shitty parents the better, but the world is conspiring to hate me so badly that they're probably going to force me to live with them for the rest of my life and probably even die with them. It's like the curse of unbinding from minecraft.I absolutely hate all of this, and I'm going to absolutely hate next semester of college because it'll be my last, and I'll have to do and go through with all the routines and actions knowing it'll soon be over which'll just ruin the fun. To paraphrase Calvin and Hobbes, it's like trying to enjoy one's final meal before the execution. I'll have spent what's supposed to be the best time of my life to get a boy/girlfriend and exit it without one. Who the fuck is going to date me if I'm flipping burgers since it's the only job I'll be able to find even with a degree in CS, or if I'm stuck living with my parents in an unwalkable typical American suburb because it's the only home I can afford?Honestly, if the world is going to hate me, I might as well hate the world.",

We support 1 main business function but we literally have dozens of applications that do completely different things and have entirely different frame works. There is a dedicated SME for each main application and we have 1 tech lead. I’m not sure what the point of a tech lead is because there is no way one person could understand ALL of my team’s applications.This is why I don’t think agile works for my team. We all write our own stories. The developers are prey try much entirely in charge of projects. Our scrum master and project managers have no idea what our work is even on a business/non technical level. They have no idea what our stories mean. Their entire job is planing meetings and asking for updates. I feel silly even giving updates because they have no idea what I’m talking about. All of the responsibility is on me.We pretty much have to lead our own agile ceremonies and plan our work. No one on the scrum agile side knows what’s going on, and I don’t blame them because no one on our technical team knows everything about all the apps we support. The agile leadership hates when we roll over and when we don’t have fast “churn” rate for our stories. Did I mention we support a 24/7 operation and have on call rotation? Even in those scenarios they freak out when stories don’t get done because we have to support something urgent…The constant made up deadlines every two weeks is making me miserable. No one knows how to do my job or what I do. Why do we work like this when none of us are working on anything related? It feels more like a micro manage monitoring tool rather than a way to efficiently manage projects. Is this normal?",

Its been about three weeks, and in my first day I was handed this codebase and was asked to go through some parts, some of which I understand, some of which I don't. There's no documentation at all, I have been asking chatgpt to explain what I don't get.But thats about it to be honest. I don't have a clue on how to contribute. I don't even know where to begin to ask a question, and when I do have a question I hear terms that I have barely heard before and try to clear it up with the senior who usually gives a sort of dismissive answer because the senior is busy (which I understand tbh)I don't want to sound like I'm complaining. It's a wonderful opportunity, and I need to take full advantage of it. But between trying to understand the monolithic layers of code and using all my free time in the day to implement my own mini projects and trying to understand how to implement my own knowledge (still have to google alot of it), I don't seem to know a better way to use my time to learn so that I can start atleast writing some methods in their codebase.Any advice, or help? Kinda going nuts. And if it's a messy read, was just dumping my thoughts.Thank you!Tldr: Hard time during internship and need help to learn to contribute to their code and learn effectively.",

        "content": "I’m glad I’ve had the opportunity to interview at a bunch of FAANG+ companies and trading firms, but I can’t seem to get all the way through. It feels like every time I start to see the finish line, something just doesn’t connect fully.Obviously no one here has seen me interview so there’s only so much applicable advice I can get, but I’m curious: for people who did end up getting offers, did you also have to go through a ton of interview processes before it finally worked out?Context: ~2–3 YOE. Worked/work at fairly established companies but not FAANG+ (think top 3 investment bank + top 2 ERP). I’m not “cracked,” but I can hold my own technically, and I try to be pleasant / communicative. I didn’t get recruiter feedback for most of these, so the “reason” is my best guess. All were full-time roles ranging from new grad to intermediate.Where I’ve interviewed + why I think it didn’t convert1.DRW (internship): Onsite went well, but the recruiter joined at the end (which I took as a great sign). I think I fumbled by making it sound like I’d need sponsorship even though I didn’t. Interview otherwise felt strong, so maybe it was just competition. Rejected.2.Coinbase: First technical was excellent. Second was scrappy - I misunderstood at first but eventually solved it. Third round (manager) I completely blew. It was my first time having multiple interviews in one day; I skipped lunch and was totally drained, and I gave the worst, least thought-out answers in the round where communication probably matters most. Rejected.3.Tower Research Capital: First technical went well. Second was okay; there were some brain teasers and I was mixed. The technical part ended up being shorter than expected, and I got a strange question like “tell me everything you know in Python.” In hindsight, I know how I should have answered.4.Squarepoint: Interviewed a couple times and didn’t meet the technical bar (felt fair). I interviewed there pre-LeetCode era and now I get auto-rejected.5.Amazon (AWS): Nothing to say here; I was sick and just didn’t do well. Except the third round both my technicals were just about average. Did well on leadership principle questions though.6.Google: Googlyness round was good. First technical was connected components - no issues, plus a follow-up. Second technical was prefix sum; solved the optimized version with a hint. Third technical was brutal (some greedy variation I still can’t solve). I completely choked. This sucked because it was a new grad role and I know others who got 2-sum equivalents. I was pretty demoralized and took a break since I had just started a new role.7.Apple: Recruiter reached out recently. First round with manager went great. I spaced out the technical rounds too much, so I suspect they may have found someone else by the time I completed them. The technical rounds felt almost too easy and I did well. Interviewers seemed happy and didn’t press time complexity much. Only possible miss I can think of is in the second interview where I didn’t say some “keywords,” but honestly if I replayed it, I think it would go similarly. It felt like there wasn’t much I could do differently.I feel like I’ve had a few real chances to land a big role at one of these places, and I’m trying to figure out what I’m missing. I’ve tried to learn something from each attempt, but repeated rejections from places like these start to stack mentally.If I had to name my biggest improvement areas: reliably making it to later rounds with more confidence, and narrating my approach more cleanly (especially when I’m tired / under pressure).Any constructive feedback or criticism is welcome. Also would love to hear:•Is it normal to go through this many processes without an offer?•For those who eventually got offers, what changed (prep, mindset, interview strategy, pacing, etc.)?",

I did have ChatGPT do a few templates, but finding out the terms, figuring out which goes to which, it's been the hardest part.",

A lot of what exists out there is rather old/outdated and our team has been sort of tasked with figuring out the \"new way\" as we move into uncharted territory.Now normally companies have like a manager, IE: QA manager/Devops Manager/etc..., however there was some restructuring and a lot of people have been confused at who makes decisions.Anyways, I've been one of the people experimenting with newer Devops tooling and newer CI/CD pipeline/processes. I've sort of taken it upon myself to get a lot of the \"unknowns\" figured out, since eventually legacy applications will move to this.I have the support from devops, as well as my manager/project manager. I've made sure to clarify that I am not coming in to make decisions, but more-so show what has worked for our team (Which I was sort of the guinea pig with a lot of the Terraform/AWS stuff) but really just wanted to get a list of what \"needs to be done\" and what \"needs answers/conventions\". Mainly just sort of \"organizing\" everything and tracking it.I've made sure to say as much as possible I am not trying to take over anyone job, and everyone seems supportive.

Will that really affect me much in a job hunt (for junior to mid-level SWE roles in a new field), if I can get solid at coding/system design problems?I’m a mid-level SWE (4 YOE) at a popular company that was bought by a FAANG before I started. I don’t do much and have basically been coasting, doing just enough to meet expectations in perf reviews. This is in part due to a lack of opportunity to lead projects or do high-impact work (when it is available, it is usually given to seniors). But, being honest, I don’t seek those opportunities out either. In fact, I actively avoid them. I don’t really want to work here and got trapped by the golden handcuffs. So I’ve been saving most of my mental capacity for personal studying, as I dream to transition out of web dev to a different field (still early SWE). My New Year’s resolution is to get really good at coding/system design problems and start applying. But I’m worried because I don’t have much to speak to as far as impact/metrics from my current job. I’m wondering if that matters much as long as I have solid whiteboarding performance?",

        "content": "I recently applied to a job on LinkedIn that I'm beginning to think is not legitimate somehow. The role is for a remote junior SWE position, and the listing seemed like any other one I've come across on the site. I hadn't heard of the company before, but I quickly scanned their website to check for legitimacy before applying. I heard back from the company about a week later asking if I was interested in completing a quick assessment via interview questions. I was so excited to finally hear back about a potential role so I emailed them back within an hour. Let's call the guy that I'm emailing with Ron.Ron's email wanted me to reply YES if I was interested in the assessment. I haven't seen this before, but I brushed it off as just a little odd. I responded with a YES, and a few hours later, I got another email from Ron with the interview questions attached in an .rtf file. He gave a little blurb about how there are no right answers and the test is to gauge if my skills and approach to the role are a good fit. He let me know that I could reach out with any questions if I had them and wished me luck on the assessment. This was on Friday.I browsed the \\~20 questions of the assessment so I could be prepared and started brushing up on some of the topics. They seemed like very normal questions for a junior SWE role. Explain the difference between these two technologies, some DSA, some behavioral, etc. Nothing strange other than an address by their logo at the top that I looked up. It's for a big office building in a major US city that had no record of them having a space in.I completed the assessment over the course of the weekend and emailed Ron back first thing Monday morning. To my surprise, he got back to me within half an hour of my response. He told me that he received my message and that their team will review my answers, then forward them to the hiring board for their decision. He said I'd hear back from him when a decision is made and asked me to acknowledge I received his email. I sent him a message back thanking him for his acknowledgement, and said I looked forward to hearing back. This is where things go downhill.I went to the company's site again to find some more information. Unlike the first time I looked around, this time I was closely reading the information on the site and clicking around. The first thing that raised an alarm was how unprofessional their about us section is. It has a really long run-on sentence that doesn't make a lot of sense and ends with three exclamation marks. This prompted me to do a real deep dive on them.After more time on their site, things really started to unravel. Social media buttons that link to nothing. Those buttons you see on the bottom of most web pages about privacy policy, ad choices, etc? All lead to blank pages. Inconsistencies with spacing and grammar. An address that looks to be a residential home in Canada. A portfolio page that has a nice flashy intro, but nothing else. Nothing on the site is selectable text. All very strange for a company that supposedly provides tech solutions.Then I did some research on Google. They have only a few people affiliated with them on LinkedIn, only 2 of which are people have any sort of information about themselves. One is a guy who seems to be a real software developer, complete with a personal website and a lively GitHub. Another is a woman who allegedly started working there years ago as a PM, but only just a few weeks ago posted an update sharing that she started there. She lists herself as still working there, but also has another current job listed. The other people affiliated with the company have no profile picture or anything, but I did find out one of them is Ron because he has a very distinct tagline that came up when I looked up his name as well.Multiple websites that report company information list them as having fewer than 10 employees, most of which are located in Canada or Africa. The company is credited as the designer and developer on a few dozen sites that I can find, but most of them seem to be associated with one specific church in one way or another. They do have a few social media accounts with not much on them. Also, the page for the LinkedIn posting I applied to is gone. Not marked as filled, but entirely gone.I'm just so confused about this whole thing. It seems so sketchy. But why send over a technical assessment if it's a scam? Why put up so many fake sites? It seems like a lot of effort just to get some data. Unless they're going even further and will try to offer people employment to get their bank data and/or social security number. Is this really how far scammers are going now? I'm already exhausted enough looking for an entry-level SWE role in 2025, I don't need scams that look this believable at surface level to waste my time.What do you all think? Has anyone seen anything like this before?TL;DR- I applied to a company for a junior SWE role and they sent over a technical assessment. After doing more research on them, I'm not sure if they are legit due to some sketchiness and inconsistencies.EDIT: Yeah it turned out to be a fake check scam as everyone was saying. There is at least 1 other person I’ve seen post about it with the same story. Now I’m not worried to say the name of the company, it’s Velte Technology Solutions. Beware!",

Note that this would be my first ever job change.Now *IF* I do get the offer, I'm kinda unsure whether to take it or not, for 2 reasons:1- My backend stack is mostly Node.js/.NET, with AWS for cloud. The new company uses Python with FastAPI and GCP, both of which I have no prior experience in.I'm not scared to learn new things however I don't know if having so many different languages and tech stacks will make my resume look all over the place, cause i already have bullet points highlighting my work with React, Next.js, React Native, Express, Fastify, .NET, AWS... So I feel like adding completely new things like Python, FastAPI, GCP... Will make me seem all over the place.2- I would be switching from a startup to another startup, and this time it's not a tech based startup. I think the engineering team consists of like 2 or 3 people only.However it would be a pretty good jump in payment, what do you guys think ?For context, I'm 20 and have been at my current job for around 1.5 years.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Context:I'm entering my final year of undergrad, and going into my final internship next summer. Throughout university, I've always dreamt of working in NYC full-time, and I was hoping my final internship will lead to a FT RO there. And luckily, I was fortunate enough to get an offer from a mid-size startup (that I believe doesn't have much room for growth) in NYC. By surprise, I also got an offer to intern at a FAANG+ company I believe in, located in SF.Now, I'm really torn as to what to do moving forward.On one hand, I really resonate with the saying \"you're only in your 20s once.\" I've always wanted to experience NYC in my 20s and now I have the opportunity to do so, albeit for a short period of time. People say that summers in NYC have a certain charm to them, and I definitely want to experience this first-hand. Since I'm bearish on the company's future, I would probably still have to recruit full-time for new grad even if I do get an RO, but at least the RO would be in a location I really cherish.On the other hand, the FAANG+ company definitely seems like the safer bet - I get more resume value, more long-term career growth, and their full-time TC is a little higher simply due to publicly traded stock. The people around me say it'll give me more leverage to recruit full-time in NYC, but full-time recruiting is definitely difficult, the market is not looking too hot, and NYC is a very competitive location to break into. I also do have Amazon on my resume, so I don't know if this is diminishing returns.Not really sure if I'm thinking straight. Am I sacrificing the potential of long-term growth for the short-term pleasure of living in the city I want? I'm a firm believer in \"the city shapes you,\" and I definitely think NYC lines much more closer with my beliefs in that sense than SF. However, this is an internship, and maybe choosing what's better for my career is more sensible.What are your thoughts? Any advice? Would appreciate any insight into this Some more context:When I received the offer for the FAANG+ company, I lightly requested to move it to Fall since they have Fall cohorts, but they declined (I also didn't have leverage so I did say I would be happy to work in the summer if it's not possible). However this was before the NYC offer came through. Now, I definitely have more leeway to give an ultimatum since I have another offer, but I'm not sure if potentially burning this bridge is worth the upside.",

        "content": "Hi Everyone,I really need some advice here and clarity here as I feel anxious at this moment.Most of my work experience is working on mechatronic systems where I have done bare metal programming, some electrical engineering and working with mechanical systems. But I recently graduated with a Masters in Computer Engineering where I took courses in computer architecture, real time operating systems and network security. I started to get more interested in the more software related topics like Linux Kernel programming, parallel processing etc.Since I am an international in the US and have visa restrictions, I had to take whatever job I got and my prior experience helped me lad a job as an embedded systems engineer in a mechatronics based company but I dread it now. I so want to move to the software domain but my work experience (of over five years ) bogs me down and I already feel like it's too late and hard to change my career (i turned 30 recently). What I'd basically like to know is, will staying in this job hurt my chances of moving to the software side? I want interviewers to stop viewing me as an electromechanical software engineer and land interviews in computer engineering field. If I take my time and build personal projects, can I move to the career that I want or is it not as easy at it seems?",

The way the dates work my 2 week notice would be dec 26th but it's a stat, work one more week in Jan and be done.I feel like dec26 is too late, giving notice right before Christmas doesn't seem like a huge diff either.Should I just give notice before going on 3 week vacation? Seems like a lot",

A lot of people my age talk about having imposter syndrome by being surrounded by people smarter than them, but for me, it feels like the opposite is true. I am the only person on my team who is willing to push for proper documentation, rigorous automatic testing, organized design meetings, and research. I worry that I won’t learn from anyone here but at the same time, judging by my school days, it can be demoralizing to be surrounded by people better than you. Is imposter syndrome a necessary evil to grow in your career, or can it be avoided while still allowing you to flourish 10 years from now?",
