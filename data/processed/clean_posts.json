        "author": "Dense_Car_591",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,I made a post a while back agonizing whether or not to take a 175k DE II offer at an allegedly toxic company. Wanted to say thank you to everyone in this community for all the helpful advice, comments, and DMs. I ended up rejecting the 175k offer and opted to complete the final round with the second company mentioned in the previous post. Well, I just got the verbal offer! Culture and WLB is reportedly very strong but the biggest factor was that everyone I talked to from peers to potential manager all seemed like people I could enjoy working with 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. Offer Breakdown: fully remote, 145k base, 10% bonus, 14k stock over 4 years First year TC: 165.1k due to stock vesting structure To try to pay forward all the help from this sub, I wanted to share all the things that worked for me during this job hunt. 1. Targeting DE roles that had near 100% tech stack alignment. So for me: Python, SQL, AWS, Airflow, Databricks, Terraform. Nowadays, both recruiters and HMs seem to really try to find candidates with experience in most, if not all tools they use, especially when comparing to my previous job hunts. Drawback is smaller application shotgun blast radius into the void, esp if you are cold applying like I did. 2. Leetcode, unfortunately. I practiced medium-hard questions for SQL and did light prep for DSA (using Python). List, string, dict, stack and queue, 2-pointer easy-medium was enough to get by for the companies I interviewed at but ymmv. Setting a timer and verbalizing my thought process helped for the real thing. 3. Rereading Kimball’s Data Warehouse Toolkit. I read thru the first 4 chapters then cherry picked a few later chapters for scenario based data modeling topics. Once I finished reading and taking notes, I went to ChatGPT and asked it to simulate acting as an interviewer for a data modeling round. This helped me bounce ideas back and forth, especially for domains I had zero familiarity in. 4. Behavioral Prep. Each quarter at my job, I keep a note of all the projects of value I either led or completed and with details like design, stakeholders involved, stats whether it is cost saved or dataset % adoption within org etc, and business results. This helped me organize 5-6 stories that I would use to answer any behavioral question that came my way without too much hesitation or stuttering. For interviewers who dug deeply into the engineering aspect, reviewing topology diagrams and the codebase helped a lot for that aspect. 5. Last but not least, showing excitement over the role and company. I am not too keen on sucking up to strangers or act like a certain product got me geeking but I think it helps when you can show reasons why the role/company/product has some kind of professional or personal connection to you. That’s all I could think of. Shoutout again to all the nice people on this sub for the helpful comments and DMs from earlier!",

        "content": "Just a Friday rant…I’ve worked on a bunch of data platforms over the years, and lately it’s getting harder to stay motivated and just do the job. When Fabric first showed up at my company, I was pumped. It looked cool and felt like it might clean up a lot of the junk I was dealing with. Now it just feels like it’s being shoved into everything, even when it shouldn’t fit, or can’t fit.All the public articles and blogs I see talk about it like it’s already this solid, all-in-one thing, but using it feels nothing like that. I get random errors out of nowhere, and stuff breaks for reasons nobody can explain. It makes me waste hours to debug just to see if I ran into a new bug, an old bug, or “that’s just how it is.” It’s exhausting me, and leadership thinks my team is just incompetent because we can’t get it working reliably (Side note: if your team is hiring, I'm looking to jump).But what’s been getting to me is how the conversation online has shifted. More Fabric folks and partner types jump into threads on Reddit acting like none of these problems are a big deal. Everything seems to be brushed off as “coming soon” or “it’s still new,” even though it’s been around for two years and half the features have GA labels slapped on them. It often feels like we get lectured for expecting basic things to work.I don’t mind a platform having some rough edges. Butt I *do* mind being pushed into something that still doesn’t feel ready, especially by sales teams talking like it’s already perfect, especially when we all know that the product keeps missing simple stuff you need to run something in production. I get that there’s a quota, but I promise I/my company would spend more if there was practical and realistic guidance and not just feel cornered into whatever product uplift they get on broken feature.And since Ignite, the whole AI angle just makes it messier. I keep asking how we’re supposed to do GenAI inside Fabric, there are lots of, “go look at Azure AI Foundry” or “go look at Azure AI Studio.” Or now this IQ stuff that’s like 3 different products, all called IQ. It feels like both everything and nothing at all are in Fabric? It just feels like a weird split between Data and AI at Microsoft, like they’re shipping whatever their org chart looks like instead of a real platform.Honestly, I get why people like Joe Reis lose it online about this stuff. At some point I just want a straight conversation about what actually works and what doesn’t, and how I can do my job well, instead of just getting into petty arguments",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I need some advice on a big career shift that just landed on me.I’ve been working at the same company for almost 20 years. Started here at 20, small town, small company, great culture. I’m a traditional data-warehousing person — SQL, ETL, Informatica, DataStage, ODI, PL/SQL, that whole world. My role is Senior Data Engineer, but I talk directly to the CIO because it’s that kind of company. They trust me, I know everyone, and the work-life balance has always been great (never more than 8 hours a day).Recently we acquired another company whose entire data stack is modern cloud: Snowflake, AWS, Git, CI/CD, onboarding systems to the cloud, etc.While I was having lunch, the CIO came to me and basically said:“You’re leading the new cloud data engineering area. Snowflake, AWS, CI/CD. We trust you. You’ll do great. Here’s a 100% salary increase.”No negotiation. Just: This is yours now.He promised the workload won’t be crazy — maybe a few 9–10 hour days in the first six months, then stable again. And he genuinely believes I’m the best person to take this forward.I’m excited but also aware that the tech jump is huge. I want to prepare properly, and the CIO can’t really help with technical questions right now because it’s all new to him too.My plan so far:Learn Snowflake deeply (warehousing concepts + Snowflake specifics)Then study for AWS certifications — maybe Developer Associate or Solutions Architect Associate, so I have a structure to learn. Not necessarily do the certs.Learn modern practices: Git, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, etc.)My question:Is this the right approach?If you were in my shoes, how would you prepare for leading a modern cloud data engineering function?Any advice from people who moved from traditional ETL into cloud data engineering would be appreciated.",

One person on our team basically did kafka ops full time which is insane.The \"exactly-once semantics\"? That was a lie. Found duplicates constantly, maybe we configured wrong but after 3 weeks of trying we gave up. Said screw it and rebuilt everything simpler.Ditched kafka entirely, we went with nats for messaging, services pull at own pace so no backpressure disasters. Custom go services instead of spark because spark was 90% overhead for what we needed and cut airflow for most things, use scheduled messages. Some results after 4 months: latency 3-4 hours to 45 minutes, zero lost messages, infrastructure costs down 40%.I know kafka has its place. For us it was like using cargo ship to cross a river, way overkill and operational complexity made everything worse not better. Sometimes simple solution is the right solution and nobody wants to admit it.",

I’m burnt out on the \"people\" side of the job - the constant stakeholder management, team management, the meetings, and the subjective decision-making... so on. I realized (and over the years ignored) that the only time I’m truly happy at work is when I’m digging into data or doing something technical. I miss doing quiet work where there is a clear right or wrong answer (more or less).I'm thinking about pivoting to an individual contributor role and one of the roles I'm considering is data engineering/analytics.My study plan is to double down on advanced SQL, pick up Python and learn PowerBI for the \"product\" side. I already know basic to intermediate SQL (used it for my own work), I know basic programming.I’d love a reality check on two things: First, is data engineering actually a \"safer\" environment for someone who wants to code but is anxious about the \"people\" side?Second, given my age and background, does it make sense to move in this direction in this economy?Thanks for the help",

On the other hand, this direction is slightly easier and little more interesting to me and maybe business communication skills will be more valuable in the future than technical skills.The Data Engineer path, however, is more technically demanding, but the long-term benefits seem much greater - better pay, more opportunities, lower risk of being replaced by AI and more technical skill development.Please don’t reply with “just do what you like,” because I’ve spent several years in a dead-end job and at the end of the day, work is work.I’m just a junior with only a few days of experience who already has to make an important decision, so I'm sorry if these questions are stupid.",

Is it safe*** **?\"**. Lineage alone often isn't enough to quickly assess the risk especially in large projects. That's why I've extended my tool to be more **\"impact analysis\"** oriented. It uses the column lineage to generate a high-level, actionable view that clearly defines how and where the selected column is utilized in downstream assets, **without the need for navigating in the whole lineage graph** (which can be painful / error prone), it shows :* **Derived Transformations:** Columns that are transformed based on the selected column. These usually require a more extended review compared to a direct reference, and this is where the tool helps you quickly spot them (with the code of the transfo).* **Simple Projections:** Columns that are a direct, untransformed reference of the selected column.**Github Repo:** `Fszta/dbt-column-lineage` **Demo version:** I deployed a live test version -> You can find the link in the repository.I've currently only tested this with Snowflake, DuckDB, and MSSQL.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "The official channels (account teams) are not often trustworthy. And even if they were, I rarely hear the explanation for changes in Microsoft \"strategic\" direction. So that is why I rely on reddit for technical questions like this. I think enough time has elapsed since it happened, so I'm hoping the reason has become common knowledge by now. (.. although the explanation is not known to me yet). Why did Microsoft kill their Spark on Kubernetes (HDInsight on AKS)? I had once tested the preview and it seemed like a very exciting innovation. Now it is a year later and I'm waiting five mins for a sluggish \"custom Spark pool\" to be initialized on Fabric, and I can't help but think that Microsoft BI folks have really lost their way! I totally understand that Microsoft can get higher margins by pushing their \"Fabric\" SaaS at the expense of their PaaS services like HDI. However I think that building HDI on AKS was a great opportunity to innovate with containerized Spark. Once finished, it may have been an even more compelling and cost-effective than Spark on Databricks! And eventually they could have shared the technology with their downstream SaaS products like Fabric, for the sake of their lower-code users as well!Does anyone understand this? Was it just a cost-cutting measure because they didn't see a path to profitability?",

Without explocit repartitioning, Spark would still do shuffle exchange to bring the date on executor, the same operation which a repartition would have triggered, so moving it up the chain shouldn't make much difference to speed?2. Though, I can see the value where after repartitioning we cache the data and use it in more joins ( in seperate action), as Spark native engine wouldn't cache or persist repartitioning, is this right assumption?So, I am trying to understand in which scenarios doing repartitioning would beat Sparks catalyst native repartitioning?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Been doing data engineering for a while now and wanted to share some thoughts on a pattern I've been seeing more of.**TL;DR:** Instead of trying to consolidate all your data into one platform (which never actually works), there's a growing movement to federate metadata instead. The \"metadata lake\" concept. After being skeptical, I'm starting to think this is the right approach for most orgs.## The pattern that keeps repeatingEvery company I've worked at has gone through the same cycle:1. Start with one data platform (Hadoop, Snowflake, Databricks, whatever)2. A different team needs something the main platform doesn't do well3. They spin up their own thing (separate warehouse, different catalog, etc.)4. Now you have two data platforms5. Leadership says \"we need to consolidate\"6. Migration project starts, takes forever, never finishes7. Meanwhile a third platform gets added for ML or streaming8. RepeatSound familiar? I've seen this at three different companies now. The consolidation never actually happens because:- Migrations are expensive and risky- Different tools really are better for different workloads- Teams have opinions and organizational capital to protect their choices- By the time you finish migrating, something new has come along## The alternative: federate the metadataI've been reading about and experimenting with the \"metadata lake\" approach. The idea is:- Accept that you'll have multiple data platforms- Don't try to move the data- Instead, create a unified layer that federates the metadata- Apply governance and discovery at that layerThe key insight is that data is expensive to move but metadata is cheap. You can't easily migrate petabytes of data from Snowflake to Databricks, but you can absolutely sync the schema information, ownership, lineage, and access policies.## Tools in this spaceThe main open source option I've found is Apache Gravitino (https://github.com/apache/gravitino). It's an Apache TLP that does catalog federation. You point it at your existing catalogs (Hive, Iceberg, Kafka schema registry, JDBC sources) and it presents them through unified APIs.What I like about it:- Doesn't require migration, works with what you have- Supports both tabular and non-tabular data (filesets, message topics)- Governance policies apply across all federated catalogs- Vendor neutral, Apache licensed- The team behind it has serious credentials (Apache Spark, Hadoop committers)GitHub: https://github.com/apache/gravitino (2.3k stars)There's also a good article explaining the philosophy: https://medium.com/datastrato/if-youre-not-all-in-on-databricks-why-metadata-freedom-matters-35cc5b15b24e## My POC experienceRan a quick POC federating our Hive metastore, an Iceberg catalog, and Kafka schema registry. Took about 3 hours to set up. The unified view is genuinely useful. I can see tables, topics, and schemas all in one place with consistent APIs.The cross-catalog queries work but I'd still recommend keeping hot path queries within single systems. The value is more in discovery, governance, and breaking down silos than in making cross-system joins performant.## When this makes sense- You have data spread across multiple platforms (most enterprises)- Consolidation has failed or isn't realistic- You need unified governance but can't force everyone onto one tool- You're multi-cloud and want to avoid vendor lock-in- You have both batch and streaming data that need to be discoverable## When it might not- You're a startup that can actually standardize on one platform- Your data volumes are small enough that migration is feasible- You don't have governance or discovery problems yet## Questions for the community1. Has anyone else moved toward this federated metadata approach? What's your experience?2. Are there other tools in this space I should be looking at? I know DataHub and Atlan exist but they feel more like discovery tools than unified metadata layers.3. For those who successfully consolidated onto one platform, how did you actually do it? Genuinely curious if there's a playbook I'm missing.",

        "content": "**Built an ADBC driver for Exasol in Rust with Apache Arrow support**I've been learning Rust for a while now, and after building a few CLI tools, I wanted to tackle something meatier. So I built `exarrow-rs` \\- an ADBC-compatible database driver for Exasol that uses Apache Arrow's columnar format.**What is it?**It's essentially a bridge between Exasol databases and the Arrow ecosystem. Instead of row-by-row data transfer (which is slow for analytical queries), it uses Arrow's columnar format to move data efficiently. The driver implements the ADBC (Arrow Database Connectivity) standard, which is like ODBC/JDBC but designed around Arrow from the ground up.**The interesting bits:*** Built entirely async on Tokio - the driver communicates with Exasol over WebSockets (using their native WebSocket API)* Type-safe parameter binding using Rust's type system* Comprehensive type mapping between Exasol's SQL types and Arrow types (including fun edge cases like `DECIMAL(p)` → `Decimal256`)* C FFI layer so it works with the ADBC driver manager, meaning you can load it dynamically from other languages**Caveat:**It uses the latest WebSockets API of Exasol since Exasol does not support Arrow natively, yet. So currently, it is converting Json responses into Arrow batches. See [exasol/websocket-api](https://github.com/exasol/websocket-api) for more details on Exasol WebSockets.**The learning experience:**The hardest part was honestly getting the async WebSocket communication right while maintaining ADBC's synchronous-looking API. Also, Arrow's type system is... extensive. Mapping SQL types to Arrow types taught me a lot about both ecosystems.**What is Exasol?**Exasol Analytics Engine is a high-performance, in-memory engine designed for near real-time analytics, data warehousing, and AI/ML workloads.Exasol is obviously an enterprise product, BUT it has a free Docker version which is pretty fast. And they offer a free personal edition for deployment in the Cloud in case you hit the limits of your laptop.**The project**It's MIT licensed and community-maintained. It is not officially maintained by Exasol! Would love feedback, especially from folks who've worked with Arrow or built database drivers before.What gotchas should I watch out for? Any ADBC quirks I should know about?Also happy to answer questions about Rust async patterns, Arrow integration, or Exasol in general!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi,I'm 26 and I just graduated in Data Science. Two months ago I started working in a small but growing company as a mix Data Engineer/Data Scientist. Basically, now I'm making order in their data, writing different pipelines to do stuff (I know it's super generic, but it's not the point of the post). To schedule the pipelines, I decided to use Airflow. I'm not a pro, but I'm trying to read stuff and watch as many videos as I can about best practices and so on to do things well. The thing is that my company outsourced the management of the IT infrastructure to another and even smaller company, which made sense in the past because my company was small and they didn't need the control, nor did they have IT figures in the company. Now things are changing, and they have started to build a small IT department to do different stuff. To install Airflow on our servers, I had to pass through this company, which I mean, I understand and it was ok. The IT company knew nothing about Airflow, it was the first time for them and they needed a looooot of time to read everything they could and install it \"safely\". The problem is that now they don't let me do the most basic stuff without passing through them, like make a little change in the config file (lfor example, adding the SMTP server for the emails) or install python packages, not even restart Airflow. Every time I need to open a ticket and wait, wait, wait. It happened in the past that airflow had some problems and I had to tell them how to fix them, because they didn't let me do it. I asked many times the permission to do these basic operations, and they told me that they don't want to allow me to do it because they have the responsibility of the correct functioning of the software, and if I touch it they cant guarantee it. I told them that I know what i'm doing, and there is no risk at all. Furthermore, most of the things that I do are BI stuff, so it's just querying operational databases and make some transformations on the data, the worst thing that can happen is that one day I don't deliver a dataset or a dashboard because airflow blocks, but nothing worse can happen. This situation is very frustrating for me because I feel stuck many times, and it annoys me a lot to wait for the most basic and stupid operations. A colleague of mine told me that I have a lot to do, and in the meantime I can work on other tasks. It made me even angrier because, ok I have a lot of stuff to do, but why I have to wait for nothing?? It's super inefficent. My question is, how does it work in normal/structured companies? who has the responsibility of the configuration/packages/restart of airflow? the data engineers or the \"infrastructure\" team?

        "title": "Desperate for Guidance, DA Market Is Saturated, Should I Pivot to AE?",
        "author": "Pipeline_Dreams",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Experience DE and Hiring Manager here I need your guidance with this dilemma. My long-term goal over the next 2–4 years is to become a Data Engineer. The question is: should I follow the Data/Product Analyst → Analytics Engineer → Data Engineer path, or skip straight to Analytics Engineer → Data Engineer?**Context:**I’m a CS dropout with 9–10 years of SaaS consulting experience, where roughly half my work involved analysis (SQL, Excel, product analysis). I’ve always gravitated toward data, and that curiosity pushed me into big data engineering. I completed a 6-month live course on PySpark along with several others. I’m also completing my degree online to close the non-degree gap.My Tech Stack:1. SQL2. Python3. PySpark4. AWS5. Data WarehousingI can solve about 6/10 LeetCode problems on my own and improving steadily. I’ve built multiple projects involving API data ingestion, database creation, and EDA. I’m comfortable with GitHub.I don’t rely on ChatGPT for coding, I’m old-school about writing my own solutions. I mainly use LLMs to understand bugs faster than digging through StackOverflow.Earlier Guidance from others has made me realize I can’t jump directly into a DE role because I lack production-level experience, so the “right” path should be Data Analyst first, then transition.**The problem:**The DA market is extremely saturated. Every posting gets 10–15K applications, and realistically, I’m not competitive right now on paper. I’ve done the whole drill - no movement. I’ve been jobless for over a year, and I’m desperate at this point.**My concern/dilemma:**Given that my end goal is DE, should I really stick to the DA/PA → AE → DE route, or should I bypass DA entirely and aim for AE → DE? If I do land a DA job, I’ll have to go through another full transition again, whereas AE → DE is almost a direct pipeline.A lot of this dilemma comes from the fact that I’m not even getting any calls for DA roles because the market is congested and full of scams/fake hiring. If I were getting traction, I would’ve followed the original plan.But since I’m getting nowhere, should I aim directly for AE instead? I genuinely like the AE toolset- dbt, Snowflake, data modeling, that’s the direction I want to go.I’m just unsure whether hiring managers would consider me for an AE role purely based on my projects and skills, given that I don’t yet have production experience. What if I face same issue in AE and be back to square one after spending 3-4 month learning and applying. Should I just stick to DA/PA and keep applying. Please help!",

I looked in Kaggle, but unlike the sample that Baraa used in his course, it is tailored and most of them are cleaned.Hoping you could give me or atleast drop some few recommendations of where can I get a raw datasets to practice.

Others have a working RAG setup, but it's not giving them the results they want. Each iteration is painful. The feedback loop is slow. Time to failure is high. The pattern I keep seeing: you can build twenty different RAGs and still run into the same problems. If your processing pipeline isn't good, your RAG won't be good. What trips you up most? Is it:- Figuring out what steps are even required- Picking the right tools for your specific data- Trying to effectively work with those tools amidst the complexity - Debugging why retrieval quality sucks- Something else entirely Curious what others are experiencing.",

We also have DDL and random docs (PDFs/Confluence) defining business metrics.**The Proposed Flow:**1. **Ingest & Clean:** An LLM agent parses the messy dumps into structured JSON (cleaning syntax + extracting logic).2. **Human Verification:** I’m planning to build a \"Staging UI\" where a senior analyst reviews the agent’s work. **Only verified JSON** gets embedded into the vector store.3. **Retrieval:** Standard RAG to fetch schema + verified SQL patterns.**Where I’m Stuck (The Questions):**1. **Business Logic Storage:** Where do you actually put the \"rules\"? * *Option A:* Append this rule to the metadata of every relevant Table in the Vector Store? (Seems redundant). * *Option B:* Keep a separate \"Glossary\" index that gets retrieved independently?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi!So I am finally getting around to reading the Data Warehouse Toolkit by Ralph Kimball and I'm confused. I have reached Chapter 4: Inventory, which includes the following ERD for an example on periodic snapshot facts. https://preview.redd.it/tfxpmlj27o4g1.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=115f322cd498649895da55f8b01f69e3212b80c1In this section, he describes all facts in this table except for 'Quantity on Hand' as fully additive:>Notice that quantity on hand is semi-additive, but the other measures in the enhanced periodic snapshot are all fully additive. The quantity sold amount has been rolled up to the snapshot’s daily granularity. The valuation columns are extended, additive amounts. In some periodic snapshot inventory schemas, it is useful to store the beginning balance, the inventory change or delta, along with the ending balance. In this scenario, the balances are again semi-additive, whereas the deltas are fully additive across all the dimensionsHowever, this seems incorrect? 'Inventory Dollar Value at Cost' and 'Inventory Value at Latest Selling Price' sound like balances to me, which are not additive across time and therefore they would be semi-additive facts. For further context here is Kimball's exact wording on the differences: >The numeric measures in a fact table fall into three categories. The most flexible and useful facts are *fully additive*; additive measures can be summed across any of the dimensions associated with the fact table. *Semi-additive* measures can be summed across some dimensions, but not all; balance amounts are common semi-additive facts because they are additive across all dimensions **except time**. The only way this seems to make sense is that these are supposed to be deltas, where the first record in the table has a 'starting value' that reflects the initial balance and then each day the snapshot would capture the change in each of those balances, but that seems like an odd design choice to me, and if so the naming of the columns doesn't do a good job of describing that. Am I missing something or is Kimball contradicting himself here?",

        "content": "Our data is sessionized. Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity, so far so good. However:* About 2% of sessions cross midnight;* ‘Stable’ attributes like device… change anyway (trust issues, anyone?);* There is no expiration time, so sessions could, in theory, go on forever (of course we find those somewhere, sometime…).We process hundreds of millions of events daily using dbt with incremental tables and insert-overwrites. Sessions spanning multiple days now start to conspire and ruin our pipelines.A single session can look different depending on the day we process it. Example:* On Day X, a session might touch marketing channels A and B;* After crossing midnight, on Day X+1 it hits channel C;* On day X+1 we won’t know the full list of channels touched previously, unless we reach back to day X’s data first.Same with devices: Day X sees A + B; Day X+1 sees C. Each batch only sees its own slice, so no run has the full picture. Looking back an extra day just shifts the problem, since sessions can always start the day before.Looking back at prior days feels like a backfill nightmare come true, yet every discussion keeps circling back to the same question: how do you handle sessions that span multiple days?I feel like I’m missing a clean, practical approach. Any insights or best practices for modeling sessionized data more accurately would be hugely appreciated.",

        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering! A few weeks ago I shared Rigatoni, my CDC framework in Rust. I just published comprehensive benchmarks and the results are interesting! TL;DR Performance: \\- \\~780ns per event for core processing (linear scaling up to 10K events) \\- \\~1.2μs per event for JSON serialization \\- 7.65ms to write 1,000 events to S3 with ZSTD compression \\- Production throughput: 10K-100K events/sec \\- \\~2ns per event for operation filtering (essentially free) Most Interesting Findings: 1. ZSTD wins across the board: 14% faster than GZIP and 33% faster than uncompressed JSON for S3 writes 2. Batch size is forgiving: Minimal latency differences between 100-2000 event batches (<10% variance) 3. Concurrency sweet spot: 2 concurrent S3 writes = 99% efficiency, 4 = 61%, 8+ = diminishing returns 4. Filtering is free: Operation type filtering costs \\~2ns per event - use it liberally! 5. Deduplication overhead: Only +30% overhead for exactly-once semantics, consistent across batch sizes Benchmark Setup: \\- Built with [Criterion.rs](http://Criterion.rs) for statistical analysis \\- LocalStack for S3 testing (eliminates network variance) \\- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions \\- Detailed HTML reports with regression detection The benchmarks helped me identify optimal production configurations: Pipeline::builder().batch\\_size(500) // Sweet spot.batch\\_timeout(50) // ms.max\\_concurrent\\_writes(3) // Optimal S3 concurrency.build() Architecture: Rigatoni is built on Tokio with async/await, supports MongoDB change streams → S3 (JSON/Parquet/Avro), Redis state store for distributed deployments, and Prometheus metrics. What I Tested: \\- Batch processing across different sizes (10-10K events) \\- Serialization formats (JSON, Parquet, Avro) \\- Compression methods (ZSTD, GZIP, none) \\- Concurrent S3 writes and throughput scaling \\- State management and memory patterns \\- Advanced patterns (filtering, deduplication, grouping) :bar_chart: Full benchmark report: [https://valeriouberti.github.io/rigatoni/performance](https://valeriouberti.github.io/rigatoni/performance) :crab: Source code: [https://github.com/valeriouberti/rigatoni](https://github.com/valeriouberti/rigatoni)Happy to discuss the methodology, trade-offs, or answer questions about CDC architectures in Rust!For those who missed the original post: Rigatoni is a framework for streaming MongoDB change events to S3 with configurable batching, multiple serialization formats, and compression.

The solution was a script that would switch to my main branch, compile the manifest, and switch back, compile my working manifest, and run:dbt build -s state:modified --state $main_stateThen I needed the same logic for generating nice sql commands to add to my PR description to help reviewers see the tables that I had made (including myself, because there are so many config options in our project that I often didn't remember which schema or database the models would even materialize in). So I decided to scrap the bash scripts and ask Claude to code me something nice, and here it is.

Is it just Software Eng mindset vs. Data Eng mindset?In the industry, do you typically wrap the modular code inside the infra tools, or do you stick to the simpler script-based approach for pipelines? For a junior, is it better to show I can write robust OOP code, or that I can orchestrate containers?Any insights from those working in the field would be amazing! Thanks! :rocket:",

Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com* The 3rd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/* I do plan on updating the Udemy course, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.* **You're not too old to learn to code.

Do people pick, say, web development on Linux because it is easier, more secure, or faster? I cannot get my head around why Linux would be a choice to program something in it rather than doing it on WIndows. As I am a COMPLETE beginner, real answers would be appreciated. Kindly thank you!",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I graduated with a CS degree in 2021, but due to some life circumstances and a tough job market, I haven't held a developer position since then. I've decided to stop worrying about the gap and finally get back into the saddle to break my impostor syndrome.My goal is to build a portfolio of 2–3 solid projects to prove (to myself and employers) that I can still write code. I’m looking for some feedback and/or suggestions on a learning path.As it stands, I have familiarity with the following programming languages and will list my strength/capability with said languages:Python: 8/10 - I can confidently write most things in Python and I think the only thing that I would need to re-visit are some OOP concepts and other small nuances given that most OOP I did during my undergraduate years were done in Java. I've tinkered with (but could never really finish or grasp) Pythonic frameworks like Flask and Django, and that's as far as I've ever went project-wise with the language. Can say without a doubt it's my strongest language. I have some books like *Fluent Python 2nd Edition, Django 4 By Example 4th Edition,* that I bought a year or so ago; was wondering if they're still relevant or have become outdated. What other books or resources would you recommend?Java: 5/10 - It's been a *whileeeeeee* since I wrote anything in Java, but a lot of job descriptions I've seen for listings in my area have things like Java Spring and Spring Boot which have roots in the language, therefore piquing my interest to re-visiting Java. The problem? I can hardly remember the syntax let alone know if it's worth re-learning. Is it worth re-visiting Java just for the job market, or should I double down on Python to get \"job ready\" faster? If I do go the Java route, what is the best \"refresher\" resource for someone who already understands the theory but forgot the syntax?C++: 5/10 - Roughly the same description as above, but will say it was my favorite to play around with and was a bit simpler to understand vs. Java. Was told there was still demand with the language, particularly in Finance and Embedded Systems. ... and other languages that I can say I have \"familiarity\" with, but have hardly done things in: C#, Bash, and JavaScript.Thus, what would you guys recommend I start with topic-wise, anything-wise? Also, I like physical media such as books so I can take notes and physically get involved with the learning. Any recommendations would be much appreciated! Thanks for taking the time to read this post.",

        "content": "Hey, I’ve been building my REST API and recently stumbled upon a design problem. I’m working on an app for managing a car repair shop. I currently have a few routes, such as:* `/api/clients`* `/api/cars`* `/api/car`* `/api/jobs-histories` (where we store each car’s repair history)Recently, my frontend developer asked me to create an endpoint that would allow him to **send a client and a car in a single request**, and also to **fetch a client and their car in a single request**. Now I’m wondering how to handle this in a RESTful way.I’ve considered several options, but none of them seem ideal:1. Allow passing a car object to the `/clients` route so that both objects are created together. But this feels wrong because the operation is supposed to create only a client, not a client and a car.2. Introduce a new route like `/api/registration`. But the name feels misleading, and creating a new representation for every such scenario seems odd.3. Add some kind of action endpoint like `/api/client/with-car`, but this looks like an anti-pattern since verbs should not appear in REST endpoints.4. Create a generic actions/transactions endpoint like `/api/actions` or `/api/transactions` and put things like `/api/actions/client-with-car` under it. But this also feels like an anti-pattern.Do you have any tips on which approach I should take? What is the correct way to solve this in a RESTful manner? UPDATE:Hey guys, I think I’ve found a way to address this. Thanks for all the answers.The frontend needed this additional query mostly for convenience and to reduce latency in the app plus to make operation easier for frontend. After thinking about it, I realized that the first solution isn’t as bad as I initially thought. It’s actually quite reasonable: the **Client** is an aggregate root and it owns the **Car**, so creating both in a single request is acceptable(car as optional param)I can also later support an `include` query parameter that allows the caller to decide whether they want the client returned with the car or not. This makes the route much more flexible and makes the entire API more expressive, because we’re not creating artificial endpoints for every possible data representation.I think that API should describe **business entities**, not implementation details (like different representations of the same thing). So I’ll go with the first solution.Thanks for all the answers!",

I wanted to study a career that I both enjoyed and could get good money from, so I decided to go for Systems Engineering (in a University that focuses on Software Development and ICT).At first it was really fun, I learned pseudocode and at the end of the semester I made an over 2000 line program that contained 10 minigames, each one more complex than the other. Everything was fine, until I got to the second semester and started learning basic programming. I found out they focused only on teaching java, and in the future we'll learn other languages like C++ and CSS, and while I stayed on track for most of the time, everything collapsed when we got to OPP and GUIs. Our teacher only taught us the basics, and said we had to learn the rest by ourselves. I couldn't find the time to do it because of homework from other subjects, and even when I did, I forgot everything faster than usual. Then he taught us UML diagrams, and same story, even when I watched a lot of tutorials, I could never understand how to do it properly.My grades dropped a lot at this point, we had to construct small business applications that stored data on arraylists. I always got stuck at points where I tried to compile but got errors everywhere, and from that moment on, even if I wanted to learn so hard I just couldn't get myself to do it. Programming now feels overwhelming and boring, even if I get excited when thinking of project ideas, everything starts to feel too big for me at some point, and I drop it.I'm really nervous because my final exam will be tomorrow and I have no idea how things will turn out for me, and after that I'll be on vacation. I want to improve my coding during that time, but I don't know if I'll have the motivation to do it. Does anyone have any tips for me? How can I recover my motivation again, how can I get myself to learn and actually understand?",

I have decided to get a second undergrad (online through LSUa, will only take me about a full year) in computer science because I am really interested in computational neuroscience, data science and the sorts.I just finished my first course, python 101. I am not sure why the hell I am not getting it. I think it’s a mind set thing, like I have never trained myself to think proactively. Biology/neuroscience was really just a lot of memorizing. I feel very ashamed to admit that I have been using AI to write basically all of my final project code (creating a battleship game, with a 4 x 4 grid, without using any lists). I just have no clue. What’s worse is that I know there are 8 year olds out there that could probably do it in the blink of an eye.Any tips for somebody just starting out? Is it a “either you got or you don’t” type thing? How do I get myself to actually apply what I learned? How do I *think* like a programmer ?",

It’s disheartening when I look at threads on this reddit or hear programmers speak about things I literally don’t now a tad about. Because I wanna get to that level and have the drive to do so but not the direction or the patience.I have a ton of motivation and everyday I wake up and try to understand the concepts in OOP (also my next assessment for another topic is due soon which is data structures and algorithms and I’m quite behind because I’ve been focused on this).This just feels like a lost cause I feel like throwing the towel in, I get it’s hard and it’s only going to get harder that’s the point. Sometimes it’s either a syntax issue I’m having, or struggling with ArrayLists and using classes as types it’s all been piled on me quite fast it’s hard to juggle all of these.But even with the basics of using a PC just interacting with files on a PC sometimes deciding where to save something or what to name it makes me overthink to an unhealthy degree.I don’t want to give up and I likely won’t but I’m barely hanging on, I have aspirations to be in this field especially game development one day and to see me struggle at stuff that is presumably so basic is like a punch to the gut.",

I know this sounds weird but my situation is complicated, if I were to explain it this post would be way too long. I'm getting treatment for it and maybe I'll be able to resume college next academic year. I really wish I could just continue instead of wasting my time bc my coach is underestimating me but I need a decent alternative that doesn't cost me a fortune and maybe helps me get through college faster later on if possible. I just want that degree ASAP really.I'm mainly interested in learning programming so I can have a career related to it later and can maybe develop an indie game or two in my off time, before I started with college I had basically zero programming experience, now I have a little but it's not enough really. I thought \"I'll just go through college and when I have my degree I'll be all set\"I learned from boot.dev from a few sponsorships and bought a subscription once but I barely felt like using it bc the opinions on it were mixed and I refunded it. Now there's a pretty good deal for it from Black Friday. I often have trouble with motivating myself to study and getting enjoyment out of it so maybe this helps. Seems like a good fit for an introvert like me I guess? It says you can get hired after 12 or so months of using it but is that actually legit or is it just false advertising? I've also heard mixed opinions about whether the certificates you can get from it, or from anywhere really, are actually useful, or whether employers actually care for them. I know getting a degree is important and I want to get one at some point, this is just an alternative to pass the time until next academic year while I'm getting treatment. I'm not sure if this will actually shorten the time I have to wait before I can get that degree tho.Has anyone here actually taken courses from boot.dev and what are your opinions on it? Were the certificates actually useful? How long will it take me to go through it if I try to use it as a substitue for college and spend like say 40 hrs a week on it? So is this actually useful enough to me or should I go argue with my study coach?EDIT: Just wanted to point out that while I do want to make indie games, I know I most likely won't be able to do it for a living so I do want to get a career that's adjacent to something like that and put programming experience and other CS-related things to use. I'm also consdering university instead of college but idk if that'll actually work better for me. So I guess boot.dev isn't a great way to self study?",

I like building stuff that actually exists in the world, things that people can use, see, feel, you know?I’m just scared it might be that random spark that dies out later lol. My brain works kinda wild, if something doesn’t hook me or challenge me enough, I get bored and jump to something new. But with code it feels different, like I want to dive deeper, but the fear still hits sometimes.Have any of you ever felt that? The “is this real or just hype?” moment? How did you deal with it? Did that feeling go away with time or experiences? I’d appreciate any stories or advice, fr.I’m learning everything from zero by myself, building projects, watching talks, reading docs, trying to absorb the real engineering mindset. And I really want to know if this path can match both freedom and a meaningful career for me.Thanks in advance legends! :folded_hands::rocket::laptop:",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I posted here before saying that I’m a Software Engineering graduate who feels completely lost, and many people told me to either try getting an internship or start building small projects to figure out if I even enjoy programming. The problem is that during university I mostly studied just to pass exams, not to really learn, so even though I worked with front-end, Java, C++, and a few other things, I honestly forgot most of it because I never practiced. I also feel like there are a lot of basic concepts I should already know but don’t.Another thing that’s been holding me back is applying to companies. Most places ask for a CV, and I honestly don’t feel confident putting mine out there. It’s not that the things I list are “wrong”—I really did study them—but I don’t master them and barely remember anything. That makes me hesitate to apply for internships or entry-level positions because I feel like I don’t truly deserve the skills I say I have.At the same time, I always felt like things like HTML or even C++ are “easy” and that anyone can learn them, so I’m not sure if I should learn completely different languages like Java or Python, or if I should just stick to one clear track and build from there.Right now I want to restart properly from zero, but I don’t know where to begin. I see a lot of people recommending The Odin Project—would that be a good starting point? I can study around 4–6 hours a day, but I don’t want to waste time on something too basic or something that won’t help me get anywhere. I’m also not sure whether to focus on front-end, back-end, or try both at the same time. And I’m confused about how people even start building small projects—do you follow certain websites for ideas, or specific courses?What’s also discouraging me is AI. It feels like AI can now build a full website in minutes while a beginner needs days. Is this actually true, or am I overthinking it? Should I look into mobile development instead, or try something that fits the market better?Any advice or a clear roadmap for restarting would really mean a lot. Thanks :folded_hands: .",

        "content": "For context, I am currently trying to learn Latin by inserting the rules of the language into a Java library.Latin has a very interesting way of generating words: You have an word stem, which usually doesnt change, and then an very big number of possible suffixes that change based on the context in which the word appears.For example, lets take the word \"Servus\", which means (a male) slave. (Dont be scared, its a unfortunately very common word in the roman time period, in which most of the training texts are settled). In the nominative case, its just \"Servus\", while the genitive case has \"servi\", the dative has \"servo\" and the accusative case has \"servum\" (Cases determine the function of a Noun in the context of a sentence and therefore are extremly important for translations).But then there are also the plural forms, which are \"Servi\", \"servorum\",\"servis\" and \"servos\" respectively.And nouns are a comparatively easy example here. Putting aside the fact that the suffixes also change based on the declension of a word (mostly affected by grammatical gender), Verbs have even more different attributes to them, especially when it comes to the tempus.This requires me to somehow construct something that can handle a lot of those cases, the question is just, how.My first instinct was creating a Noun-Class (Java) and then create a constructor that takes the word stem and the grammatical gender and then write methods that return the fitting suffix based on the context that is called. This looks then like this: public String getNominativeSingular() { StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder(); stringBuilder.append(stem); String suffix = \"\"; switch (gender){ case NEUTRUM -> { suffix = \"um\"; break; } case MASCULINUM -> { suffix = \"us\"; break; } case FEMININUM -> { suffix = \"a\"; break; } } stringBuilder.append(suffix); return stringBuilder.toString(); }In a vacuum this approach is fine, but it feels like this might cause more work than actually necessary in the long run. Imagine this as a big table with multiple dimensions. What i could imagine would be creating a big Array with multiple dimensions that have a size based on the amount of states that the given properties can have. Does this sound like it makes sense or are there some patterns i potentially could utilise?",

I’ve been thinking about expanding my career opportunities, so I decided to learn .NET development.I completed a basic Udemy course and I’m currently working through a second one. So far, the material seems manageable and I feel like I’m understanding the concepts. However, when I open up a real project to look at as an example, it’s completely overwhelming - there are so many files, and I can’t make sense of how everything fits together. This makes me anxious and I start doubting myself, thinking maybe I’m not cut out for this, that it’s too difficult, or that it’s meant for people smarter than me.On top of that, I rely heavily on AI assistance right now, and honestly, I feel like I wouldn’t be able to write much code without it.I wanted to reach out and ask: are there any QA professionals here who successfully transitioned to development? If so, could you share some words of encouragement or advice? I’d really appreciate hearing about your experience.Thanks in advance!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Edit: I forgot to mention - my company will actually provide me with a .NET project within the next month or so, and they’re giving me the opportunity to contribute to development work while still being in my QA role. So I’ll be able to gradually transition over time.",

The visual diagrams leave a lot to be desired. And, as would be expected, the AI bots are unhelpful and repetitive. As I worked my way through their distributed systems course, I found myself checking blog posts, Reddit, and using Claude to explain the concepts more clearly and succinctly. After a few days of this, I essentially stopped using the course altogether, and just used the outline as a primer for learning & quizzing myself inside of Claude. I had purchased an annual plan at $179/yr because the monthly cost was $99/mo (classic marketing tactic that I fell for; my fault, I should've tried the product more and shouldn't have reached for the annual plan).After two weeks I emailed their customer support asking for a partial refund of my annual plan, which was denied \"based on their return policy\".

I took some time off from work and would like to dedicate it to solidifying knowledge in some technologies as well as learning others. I had an idea on how to go about it, but while talking with one colleague his words discouraged me from this initial idea.So, one of us thinks that I should pick up a project, design it in broad terms, do some research on what technologies make sense for it, then learn them as I work on the project. The other thinks that I should make a list of topics (design patterns etc) and technologies I would like to learn, find some solid resources, follow them. As I follow the concepts I also do exercises or make up examples to apply the knowledge / tinker with the different info. As knowledge accumulates, I revisit these exercises and see if there are better ways to do those things and why. By the time I have covered a significant amount of the material, I think of a project that would be fitting for the topics and technologies I am studying and work on it. In case the answer to my question is \"whatever works for you\", I don't know what works for me. I have a couple of years of experience, but I always learn things as I go in a very half baked way. That has made me professionally insecure, because my knowledge does not match my hard work or years of experience.My goals are, 3 months of studying. I should learn design patterns and architecture, solidify my python, airflow, spark and postgresql knowledge. Learn kafka and some kubernetes and aws services. In the end, definitely create at least one project (although I would prefer several smaller projects) that intertwine the different things I learned. Other studying (as well as living ..)

Considering how structured the Java standard library is, I expected someone to have built a viewer that maps it all out graphically.But what I keep finding are tools that generate UML from **your** code (IntelliJ UML, Visual Paradigm, etc.), not something that visualizes the hierarchy of `java.*`, `javax.*`, etc. out of the box.So I’m wondering:* Is there a technical reason why no one has made this?* Is it just too large/complex to visualize?* Is it considered not useful enough in practice?* Or does it exist and I’m just missing it?If anyone knows of a project or website that gives a graphical view of the standard Java type hierarchy, I’d love to see it.",

But someone told me that using a government exam syllabus as a learning roadmap isn’t a great idea, and that infrastructure can be a tough field in terms of pay and quality of life early on (lots of on-call, lower salaries in some places, etc.).They suggested a more “traditional base” first, like:* strong Linux fundamentals (LPIC-1/2)* Windows basics* virtualization (VMware)* storage fundamentals* DB administration* containers (Docker → Kubernetes later)* IaC (Terraform)* configuration management (Ansible)* maybe CompTIA certs (A+, Network+, etc.)They also said DevOps/DevSecOps usually come later in a career, after you’ve had solid experience in infra + dev (and security for DevSecOps).On top of that, I’m planning long-term to work abroad. I have Italian citizenship and I’ve lived in Spain before, so Europe is a realistic option for me. My English is decent (not perfect yet, but improving). I’m also saving money monthly so I can move if needed. That said, if I found a good remote job paying in EUR/USD, I might even stay in Brazil.So my questions are:1. For someone still in college, does it make sense to start with infrastructure as a base and move into cloud later? Or is it better to go straight into cloud studies early on?2. Between infrastructure/cloud and security, which one is smarter to focus on first if I genuinely like both? I’m thinking: build a strong infra foundation first, then if I end up enjoying security more, transition over time since they overlap a lot.3. For people who’ve worked in Europe (or hired there): is it true that with 2–3 years of solid experience you can become competitive there pretty fast? What skills/certs/projects actually matter most for entry-level roles?4. Since I’m still in university, would it be worth trying to transfer to a European university (Erasmus / full transfer / master later), or is it better to finish here and move with experience?I’d really appreciate any advice, especially from people in infra/cloud/security or who’ve made a similar move abroad. Thanks!",

The only way the face became clear enough was by setting the zoom level to less than 50%, which unfortunately made the surrounding conversational text extremely difficult to read. I tried to get around that by trying to make the art text smaller while keeping the conversational text large enough but a quick google search revealed that having such varying font sizes is not possible within a terminal.Any ideas as to how to solve that issue?",

        "content": "Senior software engineer with 9YOE.I got an offer for a fully remote role earlier this week. I negotiated with them with a higher base and told them that I'm in process with Meta (L5). With some back and forth, today they reached out and told me that they're willing to meet my asking base salary, which is higher than their cap for the role. I can tell that they want me and I also told them that I'm willing to stop my process with Meta if they can meet my requirements. They did, and now I'm wondering if I should cancel my final rounds with Meta next week. Regardless I will choose the fully remote role since even if I pass Meta, the 2-3 days hybrid in office requires me to uproot my family and relocate probably, and I do have a 18-month old toddler so work/life balance matters a lot to me now.So for now, I'm thinking what's the point of doing the interviews if I'm not going to take the offer. Plus I've been preparing for this round for months, doing leetcode, system design everyday. I'm tired of all of this. If doing interviews, I think it's just for the sake of gaining experience. I don't want to waste everybody's time. The thing is I failed the final rounds with Meta in 2024, so if I fail this time it would be the 2nd fail attempt. But pulling before the final rounds might be better since I technically only failed once I guess. What do you think?",

He does have the most business context and the original product was poorly written, but this has been worked on for two years and has a lot of custom config that will likely be overlooked in the rewrite and will cause tons of issues for existing customers.My CEO was bragging about how our CTO stays up all night vibe coding and I later found out that they are not even reviewing their frontend code. He expects my team to maintain his code - literally said, “I don’t want to maintain that.” He said it appears to work because his endpoints work (who cares about user interaction). I feel like his failure to manage his team has led to him deciding that it is easier to do it himself than do his job. This is insane right? Do I jump ship? How do I express how ruinous this is as a business decision when both the CEO and CTO are on board?",

But it's time I face the music and start learning Tech once more unless I plan to stay unemployed.I've also been debating to myself if I even want to stay in CS and maybe switch to a more IT help desk role since the whole reason why I started using ChatGPT was because I lacked the smarts to solve coding problems and I don't find joy in solving them as other people have described in various articles about being competent in CS. I don't know if I'm just too emotionally weak to find joy in it or it's something else entirely.How do I start over and start learning Tech once more? How do I even know if CS is for me and consider a job in IT or some other forms of texh? What resources, learning habits should I start doing to develop routine and is passion really important when working in a tech field? And is there a way to use AI well in the field or should I avoid it entirely?Thanks to those who are willing to leave some answers. I appreciate it since I'm very lost right now.",

        "author": "Comet7777",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I was coming from a tech leadership role for a handful of years before sort of burning out and deciding to jump at a startup. Same industry that I know, cool new hook and angle, a \"Head of Product\" title and good investors. This company demanded 10-12 hours daily and would rush projects out and I'm just completely allergic to this way of \"working\". Because they're in pacific time and I'm in central, I was working past dinner time and not eating or spending time with my family. So, after 4 months of being here, something I've never done, I decided to look for something better already.I've always been \"good\" at getting new offers if I wanted them, via by networking or other means. I was sort of slapped to reality and humbled when I saw how awful this market actually is. The pain at work, coupled with two early phone screen rejections made me realize I had to change how I was doing this. The tech job market from 2017-2022 was long gone.Here are the tips that ultimately worked for me:1. Reached out to my network and let them know my situation. I received 4 referrals and a handful of informational interviews with folks. I did this via group chats, messaging connections on LinkedIn, college alumni groups I'm a part of.2. I used LinkedIn Premium. Why use this overpriced service? As soon as I have it and I mark myself as actively looking (oh and hide the damn Premium icon from your profile or your employer will find it odd that you have it) - I start getting tons of recruiters hitting me up. 2 of these led to an initial screen.3. Adjusted my title appropriately. I de-leveled my title for certain Senior Product Manager roles. One question I kept getting was why go from leadership/management to a role like this. The real reason was because my current environment is toxic, my title is inflated there, and the money isn't great, and these \"lower title\" roles were paying on par or sometimes higher for significantly less responsibility. A buddy of mine who was a VP had to practice a similar thing in de-leveling his title when he was laid off. You can play around with your title a bit, but I DO NOT recommend leveling up your title when that isn't factual. It'll come out.4. Apply daily to the latest openings, I'll show you how to best do this below.5. Had a single thread with ChatGPT where it knew my resume, my work history, my specific projects, my answers to previous interview and job application questions. This made answering bespoke custom questions on ATSs very quick.6. A benefit/luxury/advantage - I do have a variety of experience as a software engineer, product manager, tech leadership etc. I'm aware that this greatly expedited this whole process and if I was more junior I likely would have struggled significantly more.**Best Places to Apply.** I would open up my computer and had a browser with the following tabs open:1. LinkedIn job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)2. Indeed job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)3. [Hiring.Cafe](http://hiring.cafe/) search (an AI aggregator that links you directly to company careers postings)4. [Wellfound.com](http://wellfound.com/) search (specifically for start-up hiring)5. Google search with the following:site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com (\"Group Product Manager\" OR \"Principal Product Manager\" OR \"Senior Product Manager\" OR \"Director of Product\" OR \"VP of Product\" OR \"Head of Product\") AND \"remote\"This will list ALL job postings that match the description of those job titles I was looking for (and remote!) directly against the ATS without having to rely on crappy job aggregators. Now open up a tab and do the same thing but replace site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com with the following ATSs I could find: \\- site:jobs.lever.co \\- site:boards.greenhouse.io \\- site:ashbyhq.comThen on the google results, go to Tools and select last 24 hours.This means I would have 10'ish tabs open each day and do the search at 9am and later around 2-3pm and then apply right away. This search almost always takes you to a new posting, rather than those annoying ghost openings or jobs that get reposted for months. This also takes you directly to the employer's site.**High-level stats:** \\- Total Applications - 350+ \\- Referrals made on my behalf - 4 (only one led to a phone screen lol) \\- Duration - \\~2 months \\- Companies scheduling phone screen - 9 (2 ghosted, 2 wanted very niche experience) \\- Companies moving to hiring manager round - 5 \\- Companies moving to second/third+ round - 5 \\- Offer - 1, I cancelled the remaining 4 live opportunities upon accepting offerThe offer came from the place I least expected (Wellfound). An application for a hybrid role in NYC (I'm not in NYC, or close to it) led to the CEO directly reaching out to me. I took his call not thinking much of the opportunity since the description didn't have much to go off of. We both had a ton of fun talking and getting a feel for each other. The rest of the interviewing process with that team felt like talking to friends, it was an easy offer to accept.I could go way more in detail about how I prep for interviews, not sure how helpful that would be for people. I just wanted to share my process of applying, hoping it's of any use to anyone!",

It makes me wonder how much neurodivergence plays into the tech world. These founders go from isolated kids to running giant companies, and even after becoming billionaires, they don’t “relax” like other wealthy people. A lot stay obsessively focused on huge, almost sci-fi goals (Mars missions, reinventing society, etc.), while others try to reinvent themselves as cool, stylish, yacht-owning public figures ( bezos, zuckerberg ).

At my latest company, I moved from FAANG to a smaller company in the hope that I'll stay here forever, even though it's a bit lower pay, but with a more chill workload.Though, just like clockwork, now my company has been bought by a bigger company, and they just laid off some people on my team. It's expected that every year, they'll lay off 10% of our department. I already started grinding LeetCode, but I feel like I'm at an age where I just want to stay at one place for a long time. It seems like everywhere I go, as soon as I settle in, layoffs start happening for some reason.Does this happen to anyone? Do you have any recommendation for a rock-solid stable career?

I see a lot of questions from juniors and graduates about growing their skills, but I would like to know if anyone has screwed up by spending too much time in a job which didn’t grow your skills that much. I worked for almost 8 years at a company where a lot of the work involved knowledge of the internal systems and maintaining them, not really building new stuff. I ended up touching so many parts - old monolith application, data pipelines for etl workloads, cloud application, and heaps of languages: C++, C#, Perl, node, python, golang and more… yet I don’t feel like I’m good enough in any of them. Between the stress of immigration and family problems, I haven’t been putting enough effort to grow my skills and knowledge in the past. This resulted in me being promoted to a senior and performing like one in that company using my knowledge of their software - but having no particular in-demand skills to land another job. In the past few years I have been realising that I do not want this to be my reality. I started learning more about AWS, working on small personal projects, reading books like DDIA and, yes, grinding leetcode to prepare for the interviews. However, my CV remains unimpressive. It was always my dream to get into a FAANG company. I wanted to work with smart people on cool stuff and feel like I’m actually using my brain instead of changing simple queries on a dashboard. Is this something that is still possible for someone who wasted so much time? Has anyone done this? What could I do to strive towards this goal?",

Whenever a tool automates a skill, the neural circuitry behind that skill weakens over time. We’ve seen this with GPS and navigation ability, calculators and mental arithmetic, spell check and spelling. AI is now scaling that effect across almost every domain.The next generation of workers will grow up in a radically different cognitive environment. A huge part of what we call \"skill\" is repeated cognitive strain, and AI removes that strain.Critical thinking follows the same rule as physical training: stop working the muscle and it atrophies. If you skip the gym for 6 months, your body changes; skip mental effort for 6 months, your mind changes.Problem solving won’t decline because people are getting “dumber,” but because the incentives to think deeply are disappearing. When an answer is always one prompt away, the cognitive machinery for generating answers naturally weakens.It creates a double bind:1. Use AI heavily and you outsource your thinking. 2. Avoid AI and you risk falling behind everyone who does.We’ve never faced a technological shift that directly competes with our core cognitive processes. As experienced workers with decades of intuition retire, we may end up with a workforce whose baseline thinking is increasingly shaped and limited by the tools they rely on.If this trajectory continues, we’re heading toward a society where AI performs most of the critical thinking, and humans gradually lose the habit and even the ability to do it themselves.",

Now I'm at this new company. This is a purely product based company. Absolutely massive codebase. I'm supposed to be a senior. I feel like their expectations are too high. In terms of how quickly I get onboarded and start contributing. Maybe not to the code directly but leading the junior devs there as a small team. (But the juniors know wayyy more than me).I can't even understand what the heck is happening in the code. Dozens if not hundreds of projects (.NET). Various front ends, licensing, devops etc. it's extremely overwhelmingly This is worse than imposter syndrome ...How do i tackle this?

But if you check well established fintech companies like Revolut, Wise, N26, Adyen, etc., they all use Java heavily in their backend systems. In fact, most of them built their core services on Java from day one and continue to scale with it.From what I've seen, only a smaller set of newer or niche fintechs actually use Go as their main language for example, Monzo is the standout case here with a Go-based microservices architecture.Go does have strengths: simplicity, concurrency model, and speed for distributed systems. But Java still dominates in fintech due to ecosystem maturity, hiring pool, JVM performance, reliability, and the fact that so many financial institutions already have huge Java ecosystems.So I'm curious:Is Go really the \"future fintech language,\" or is Java still the backbone of the industry and will remain so?If you work in fintech, what language does your company use and why?",

        "content": "Hey yall, as end of year reviews come out and as my company hits raise and bonus time of year, I am curious if I am really underpaid, or if I am paid fairly and have unrealistic expectations. I work for a non tech, semi small (around 100 employees) company, that has some pretty big clients. **I currently make 39k a year,** I am going on almost 2 years here and I have not received a raise yet. We work mostly in C# and .net, but have been making some pushes into some python development (more on this). personally I work on a wide range of applications, both client facing and internal. I am remote but company is located in Southern U.S. Since we are a smaller dev team, I have alot of responsibilities that I feel like *most* jr. devs don't have, but I could be wrong. Some of the things I do outside of programming are1. Meeting directly with Clients to scaffold out and discuss task, creating them in Jira, developing the solution, presenting and then directly receiving feedback on the solution (along with the PM and sr. dev) 2. Having a heavy involvement in AWS migration, being the one creating proof of concepts for utilizing alot of different AWS micro services (e.g. currently working on lambda function that work with our applications) 3. Creating internal and client facing documentation and sop's for applications, work flows, and pipelinesI had a rocky start during my first 6 months, but improved alot and got an -A in my end of year review, as compared to a -B one my first.But there are some caveats that I think are important1. I am \"Full-time\" w/ benefits but contracted at 32 hours a week. This because I am also a full time student at a university. They work around my class schedule, but I try my best to make my classes compliment the work day. I would be willing to move to 40 hours a week2. I am also part time Military, I know that they can't hold this against me, but during my first 6 months at this company, I spent probably about 4 of Military service, which could have slowed my progression either way. They also let me work reduced hours while I am fulfilling military commitments and pay me as usual (I can't really afford not to)3. I am sometimes a mediocre developer, however, past work experience makes my true strength my soft skills. I am applauded for how I carry myself in meetings and presentations with clients. So, after all that, I am as underpaid as I think I am? I went into software development for financial stability for my family (I do have children), but I am kind of at a loss. I don't really want to start looking for other jobs, because I am unsure if they would work with my school schedule and be as flexible as this place. I also love the team and the work life balance is pretty good. Is thinking I should at least be around 70-80k unrealistic? I have brought up getting a raise before, but there really hasn't been an actual conversation about it. How do I engage in negotiation? What do yall think is acceptable pay? I think that's everything, thanks guys! **TLDR;** Junior Software dev making production level code being paid 39k, often works directly with clients and new technologies, such as AWS during a huge migration. Am I super underpaid? If I am, what should I ask for and how should I broach that subject",

A few promotions along the way\\- Founded a startup in the AI space, did fundraising, hiring, sales calls, etc.\\- Been an IC, TL, manager, founder, etc.What I think I can help with:\\- General mentorship: I currently (and have in the past) mentor early-career folks, topics range from \"how do I talk to my manager about this issue\" to \"How do I know what to work on?\"\\- Technical mentorship: General technical brainstorming/AI model review/code review, etc., in the past I did this with folks who didn't have a senior technical leader to learn from (e.g. they were the founding engineer in a small startup).\\- Mock interviews: Prepping for interviews at a tech company?

I studied a lot and broke into an ML job in big tech but now I really feel like I have no idea how to actually code. I can solve a leetcode problem and explain on a high level what different parts(front end, backend, etc.) of software does but have no idea how to actually build anything. (ask me to build a working scalable MVP of anything I doubt I could do it) I feel like I can’t keep up without using AI but then I have an over dependence on AI. So in conclusion: without AI I can’t actually build anything and thus I feel like I am faking it in big tech. I want to learn how to be a better programmer and be able to do all these things so, where to start? Thanks!",

QA tested it, but the system is super complex and I was touching around five different endpoints, so I missed a bad issue directly caused by me.This is the second mistake from the same ticket that made it to production, and it’s the more serious one. I just can’t seem to relax or get past it. Was your junior career smooth sailing? I feel like I’m getting worse even though I’m trying really hard.No one is blaming me yet but feel like I am just being.judged for it, even when I am trying my best in a complex multi API system.How do you guys handle mistakes and things like this caused by you?

I don't think I performed as well as I could have, due to a different environment (all my prior internships were at large tech companies) and soft skills that I'm still working on. Near the end of the internship, I asked my manager and recruiter for feedback, but the responses I got were pretty vague.When I asked my manager whether my performance met expectations, he said something along the lines of “I think you can do a few more internships,” but in the official evaluation he marked me as “met expectations” (third-highest rating, with “exceeded expectations” being the highest). When I later asked my recruiter about return offers and the evaluation process, she mentioned that my manager already discussed my evaluation with me, and that feedback is shared across teams (I was potentially interested in switching teams if I returned). I know it's my fault for not clarifying, but I didn't want to probe further, as it felt like I was only getting vague answers. It's been a few months since I finished the internship and I reached out to my recruiter again to follow-up on head count and potential to interview for new grad roles, but haven't heard back since I reached out about a month ago. I’m still actively applying elsewhere, but I'm concerned if a mediocre internship performance blacklists me from working at the company again?

        "content": "So I worked three excessively shitty jobs in a rowFirst was (Forest in Brazil). I found my manager nearly impossible to communicate with, we just did things so differently. My mentor was excessively aggressive, I legit thought he had some sort of personality disorder. I remember in my first week, I asked maybe 3 questions, common ones like where to find certain resources. Each time my mentor would simply send me a link, and on the third one, he made a remark about how I’m asking too many questions. So, I took the hint and didn’t ask questions unless it was absolutely necessary. Then they started complaining I wasn’t asking _enough_ questions. I was so lost. Then I was assigned a job with another new hire and she faced the same problem, told she asks too much questions then when she stopped. They said that she “just went off and did her own thing”. I kinda felt like I was missing something — isn’t the obvious reaction to “you’re asking too many questions” to… ask fewer questions? Obviously it was more than just this, but it’s an example of how communication was very hostile. I just kept a low profile as much as possible. I ended up quitting, but I definitely think something lingered hereNext job was a weirdly incompetent AI company. Management expected ~30 tickets to be completed per week, and those tickets were usually big ones. For context, they expected something similar to ChatGPT to be built in 2 weeks by 2 engineers with 0 bugs. I was let go from here. I asked why, and they seemed to say I should be available 24/7 and I wasn’t (I explicitly said I can’t be contacted 6-8pm because I help at a Muay Thai gym and you can’t have a computer/phone on you while holding pads obviously)Next job started great. I was cautiously optimistic. Around 6 months in, I started to relax and take a deep breath. Then… they hired a new manager. I could not understand for the life of me what this manager was talking about. I thought I was losing my mind a little, honestly. She would constantly say these bromides like “act more like a senior engineer”. If I asked where I was falling short of being a “senior engineer” or what goals I should have, she said it’s not her job to tell me that, nor is it her job to give me work to do. I’d have to fight for hours to figure out what I should be working on. She was just an odd person. I remember she had an exercise where she _insisted_ that everyone eats peanut butter sandwiches. I don’t and never have. I thought this was some sort of weird test, because she was so insistent that everyone does this. I could tell I was being intentionally sabotaged by her, as she would block PRs with frankly obviously stupid and unproductive commentsNow I’m starting a new job and I feel extremely intense anxiety about… everything. Although I’m a frontend engineer, this job has asked me to get up to date on ruby. I’ve never written ruby before. It’s not that I can’t learn it, but it causes me such deep anxiety to feel like I’m asking “stupid” questions. I asked one stupid question and I lost a whole night of sleep over the anxiety of thinking that I’m gonna get fired and start this cycle againIs there anything I can do? I’ve hired a therapist and everything but she mostly says “you should take it easy and be in the present” but that’s easier said than done. I have some fear that the “new manager” thing happening again. Yeah, the job is good _now_, but what if I get a new manager who just decides to fire me?",

I’m currently expected to graduate with my bachelors in CS in May 2026 but would be able to complete this masters within one semester so I would be able to graduate December 2026. I do have a full-time role in SWE lined up to start in the summer at a small tech company (TC 115k) from my previous summer internship. If I do pursue a Masters, I would likely need to ask the company to convert my full-time offer into an internship for this summer and then delay or risk my full-time offer. I am also considered doing light recruiting for internships regardless if I do do the Master’s. Given all that, would pursuing the extra master’s be worth it? I’d love to hear thoughts from anyone who has been in a similar situation or has insight into the trade-offs.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This post may be long, but I want to be completely honest so I can get real guidance.I completed my BCA in 2021 and started my career at Cognizant as a Programmer Trainee. I worked there for about 1.1 years, but I left because the project felt dull and I thought I could do better. Looking back now, resigning without a backup was probably one of the biggest mistakes I made.After that, I joined Amazon as an SPS Associate. The work was mostly repetitive support tasks - more like a BPO setup. There was no real growth, and I thought I should get back into a proper IT role while I was still young. So I left Amazon too.To rebuild myself, I joined a 9-month Data Analyst bootcamp. I genuinely put effort into it - completed all modules, built projects, created a portfolio website, made proper LinkedIn project presentation, customized my resume as per each JD, and applied mainly through official career sites. My ATS score was almost always above 95%.Despite all that, I wasn’t able to secure even a single interview. Not one. I applied to more than 2000 jobs. Each rejection hit me harder, and eventually I completely burned out. I stopped studying, started escaping into video games and alcohol, and mentally I was in a very dark place. Every day felt heavier than the last.It’s been around 5-6 months since I stopped my job search. Now I’m sitting with:an almost 1.8-year career gap, no savings, no sense of direction and a lot of self-doubt.My parents are supportive and even willing to invest in further studies if needed. But at this point, I don’t have the courage to spend more money on courses that may or may not lead to anything. The job market feels extremely dry, and I’m scared of making another wrong move.The only safe option I can think of is going back to the BPO world - but then I wonder why I even left a good WFH Amazon job if I have to end up in the same place again. It makes me feel like I’ve messed everything up.Right now, I’m not even fixated on IT. I just want a career with real growth, not something where even after 10-15 years the salary barely crosses 50k. I’m willing to put in 3-5 months of focused effort to learn something valuable but I don’t want to end up in another dead-end situation.If anyone has been in a similar situation, or has genuine advice on what direction I should take next, I would be truly grateful. I’m not looking for motivation, I just need clarity and a practical path forward.",

A lot of the tools we write are based on other internal tools from other teams that we have to add automation and scalability, basically making it so developers (our customers) don't have to think about how and where this tool is running and testing their code. Recently we started working with a new team who was supposed to be providing this whole suite if new tools for us to take and \"wrap\". Except their product is absolute shit. They gave us a pip package that makes the most insane assumptions. It assumes that the package is being a run on a machine with a mount to the company wide NFS. This NFS is the most dogshit piece of bullshit to ever exist. It works. It works great. And what that means is that you have thousands of devs just throwing files and scripts in places, and assuming that other scripts exist. And the dependencies chain down, so every thing is tied to everything else. And their pip package needs to be run there. Even worse, one of their scripts that they call from inside their package starts with \" #!/usr/bin/python3.7\" (we are using python 3.13) and assumes that there are certain packages installed in that environment. Now we have been trying to unplug from all this bullshit, but the amount of crappy design and dev culture is just driving me insane. We tried to dockerize and run our stuff cleanly in a cluster, but the amount of leaky dependencies that we are finding is just soul crushing.Thankfully at least my managers are very understanding and basically want to go to war with these nonces for providing such ass backwards tooling.

I'm struggling with such extreme burnout right now and honestly procrastinating at the moment (which tbf this is like the 6th weekend in a row I've had to work) but I feel like I just need some perspective from people who have been through this alreadyI got reassigned to another team's dumpster fire of a project (extremely behind, extremely critical, immovable deadline), being run by an engineer that has been the greatest challenge of my life.. extremely egotistical (will never admit fault, to the point of lying to me in code review, pushing code changes under sneakily named commits and trying to gaslight me about what I was reviewing), and the spec and tickets are all inconsistent AI generated slop. it took me time to even wrap my head around the project and then I realized we were so much more behind than we even realized because he hadn't even written tickets to capture all the work.his PRs are recklessly sloppy, and then he won't approve my PRs for misc. nits. meanwhile he pushes stuff straight into prod that breaks things.I continually have tried to signal that we're headed for a trainwreck to my EM who just says 'every team is a trainwreck' (untrue)I worked 28 days in a row at one point - many of them 12+ hrs (because i have to stay up and deal with Chinese contractors).I'm really trying to maintain perspective - there are many people desperate to be in my position. gainfully employed at a pretty stable company with (as far as I can tell) good compensation. I'm not laboring in the UAE or some other contemporary slavery situation. but I'm just so angry at how much this project has impacted my personal life.. had to forsake many personal goals for the end of the year, my wife has basically been running the house alone. the stress caused me to lose sleep, which caused me to get sick, which caused me to stop exercising for the last few weeks. I'm trying to be grateful but I'm so bitter right now.I want to leave this company but i have a feeling everywhere is like this now - trying to squeeze every drop out of its employees (leadership: \"AI will improve efficiency!\")if there's any silver lining (trying to talk myself up into positivity). the last time I posted in this sub was [2+ years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18ksydi/struggling_with_transition_to_senior/), and I don't struggle with those issues now.is anyone actually happy at their jobs right now?does anyone have a paid interview prep service that's actually decent? i feel like i have to pay for something to force me to do it at this pointhas anyone felt this way and left the industry for something else they like? I'm not sure what else I'd do.sorry for this stream of consciousness nonsense I'm just trying to figure out how I'm going to do this for 30 more years.",

        "content": "Hey, I have been laid off around 5 times in my whole software development career (also tried consulting) because I have a bit of a slower performance than others and made more mistakes (bugs or small design issues like margin mismatch when doing frontend dev). Chatgpt mentioned that I might have ADD (so ADHD-I) because I sometimes struggled in private areas too. But it's more like I forget things or I don't force myself to do my work hard enough. I feel like my brain is often more \"lazy\" because thinking hard (like solving a complex issue) is uncomfortable. I mean it's not that I'm lazy at work, but having the complex issue in ones mind and try to solve it efficiently is not that easy. On some days I have a overall good performance and I'm clearheaded but unfortunately on other days I'm not. Chatgpt mentioned that I might have some mental issue where stimulants could help me to have a better performance. Actually I'm not sure if ADHD-I would be the right diagnosis because I don't have distraction issues like these people often have. It's not that my focus or thoughts are changing all the time and that's the core reason of all... No rather it's stuff like working memory, processing speed, mild \"brain fog\", etc. where I feel this impacts my performance at work. The thing is that I'm not sure anymore. Even psychologists do have an overall different opinion... some say it could be ADHD-I, others say rather not. I don't know. Currently I don't know what kind of work I can do instead if the only issue is that I'm not capable to work in this field. I'm currently studying so I focus on that at the moment.",

I'm not familiar with Java but I've used most of the tools here except the observability stack, and I think it'd take a couple of days because of debugging/orchestrating stuff + not being super familiar with writing CI/CD or Docker scripts.

Both companies seem strong, but the work and long term trajectories look very different.On the SRE side, the work is focused on cloud engineering, observability, automation, CI CD, Kubernetes, and reliability. It feels very hands on and technical. A lot of people say SRE experience opens doors at big tech later because it shows you can handle scale and complex systems.On the Security Engineering side, the work is more about hardening, IAM, vulnerability management, detection logic, cloud security, and defense. It feels more structured and predictable. It also seems like a path that can lead to architect level security roles or broader cloud security positions.For people who have been in either role, I’d really appreciate your insight on a few things:• Which role grows your skills faster• Which path tends to pay more over time• Which one provides better job security• Which is more stressful day to day• Which one is easier to move from into big tech• If you switched between these fields, what made you changeAny honest advice from people who have done SRE or security engineering would help a lot.

Now I'm 3 years into a computer science degree and have completely lost all passion for the subject. I'm barely skimming by, barley passing, and altogether demoralized. I truly don't have drive for it anymore but I believe I'm too far in to back out now.It's incredibly daunting when everyone around me has been landing these incredible internships and working on super cool development projects and I just... haven't. I don't have the drive or motivation to do any of it.I'm very worried about what the next steps for me are. I've considered just graduating and finding work in related fields that aren't software, but then I'd be crazy behind. And I'm not sure I even have the skills to land a job in computer science at this point.Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as the worry has been eating me up. I just don't want to dissapoint everyone who has supported me so intensely and has absolutely no idea about any of my struggles.",

        "content": "Hi, I’m looking for advice on my career path.I’ve been working as an Ops intern (data, strategy) at a Big Tech company and I’m about to graduate. The plan was moving internally to a technical team (engineering, data, product), but that didn’t work out.Right now, I’m debating between two options before making a decision. What path should I choose?Full-time Ops at current company. Would give me stability after graduating, compensation is nice but puts me further away from technical roles down the road.Software Engineering intern at a tech startup. Conversion to full-time after 3 months. Risky if they don’t end up hiring me, but I reckon it’s a better decision in the long term (deep down I’m not even sure about that given the AI hype).Appreciate your guidance.",

        "author": "ExcitingCommission5",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi all, I was recently accepted to UPenn's online part-time MSE-DS program. I graduated from college this past May from a top 5 CS school with a degree in data science. To be honest, I originally applied to this program because I was having a tremendous amount of trouble landing a job in the data science industry (makes sense, since data scientist isn't an entry level role). However, I lucked out and eventually received an offer for a junior data scientist position after 1000+ applications.I like my current job, but the location isn't ideal. I'm a lot farther away from my family, and I'm only seeing them once or twice a year, and that has been very hard for me to deal with on top of adjusting to a much colder northeastern city. I was hoping a master's will help me job hop back to california in a year or two, and that's also a reason why I have decided to not take a break from school. With the deadline to deposit coming, I am having a really hard time deciding whether this program is for me. I have listed some pros and cons below:Pros:1. employer reimbursement - I will only have to pay around 20k for the entire program2. UPenn name and prestige3. asynchronous lectures, which is actually a plus for me because I tend to zone out during synchronous lecturesCons:1. After talking to some people who attended my undergrad school and this program, it seems like there's a lot of overlap in terms of course content. So, i'd be learning a lot of the same things all over again2. I want to become a data scientist, so maybe a CS program would improve my coding skills more. I've heard GT omscs is good, but I also heard it's hard, and I don't know if I'll be able to handle work with omscs.3. Penn name doesn't matter as much since I have already broken into the DS industryAny advice would be greatly appreciated!!",

I've heard of some people getting placed permanently even though it's not always guaranteed.I have a BS in ME and not in CS so not sure how big it affects me. I currently worn work for IBM consulting but consulting is very inconsistent and my designated sucks. I've tried asking and I'm applying to jobs within IBM and also nothing (probably cause it's consulting). Do I'm looking for something more stable. Anyone knew of staffing companies with good reputations in the area? Pros and con info would also be helpful.",
