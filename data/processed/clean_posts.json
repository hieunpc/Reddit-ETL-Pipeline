Spent roughly 5 years at my current job, all with excellent reviews each year, survived the last round of layoffs, had my performance review which basically said don't make any thing and start putting process in place while the ceo just looked at me in disgust. So I'm thinking I'm pretty much on the way out as the company is planning to buy software that makes what I'm doing irrelevant (Has its own data warehouse, it's own way of loading data, etc).Our company is currently all on prem for work, so a big shared drive is our datalake, sql server is our database, and the best I've been able to do to improve/modernize things was to introduce Prefect for our orchestration, make my own libraries in python to make loading data easier, show the usages of PowerBI and Tableau and create a data warehouse that did what the company wanted to do, but now has decided was a waste of time.I've started go through the AWS Data Engineering Exam and Snowflake exams, and I have projects on Github that show the use of Amazon S3, Athena, and Glue, so I can at least point to those and say I have cloud experience that I've set up myself. I've been applying to jobs, but I usually get stopped where they are looking for cloud experience. I've been working with data for almost 20 years now, so I'm hoping my experience can help in terms of getting a job. Does anyone have any advice out there for how to get an in on cloud experience or what places look for with cloud experience? Would the certifications be enough?Any help is greatly appreciated.",

I also developed some internal streamit applications for teams to input information directly into the database using a user friendly UI.Why am I potentially cooked?Data stack consists of Snowflake, Tableau and and Snaplogic (a low code drag and drop etl tool). I realised early that this low code tool would hinder me in the future so I worked on using it as a place to experiment with metadata based ingestion and create fast solutions. Now that I’ve been placed on work for a year that is 80% non DE related aka SQL copying/report bug fixing Whilst initially I’d go above and beyond to build additional pipelines and solutions I feel as though I’ve burnt out.I asked to alter this work flow to something more aligned with my role this time last year. I was told I’d finally be moving onto data product development this year April (in effect I’ve been begging to just do what I should have been doing) and I’ve realised even if I begin this work in April I’m still at almost three years experience with the same salary I was offered when I went full time and no mention or promise of an increase.I know the smart answer is to keep collecting the pay check until I can land something else but all motivation is gone. The work they have me doing is relatively easy it just doesn’t interest me whatsoever. At this rate my performance will continue to drop for lack of any incentive to continue besides collecting this current pay check.I’ve had some interviews which are offering 20-25% more than my current role, interpersonally I succeed and am able to progress but in the technical sections I struggle without resources. I’d say I’m a good problem solver but poor at syntax memorisation and coding from scratch. I tend to use examples from online along with documentation to create my solutions but a lot of interviews want off the dome anwers…Has anyone been in a similar position and what did you do to move on from it?Tldr:Almost at 3 years experience, level of experience technically lagging behind timeframe due to exposure at work being limited and lack of personal growth.

Airbyte was interesting because of the open source angle and we liked having control, but self hosting added a whole new category of things to maintain which defeated part of the purpose for a small team. Matillion felt more oriented toward transformation than data ingestion which wasn't quite our primary use case.Precog had more reasonable pricing and less operational overhead, though their documentation could use work and the UI takes some getting used to if you're coming from fivetran's polish. Each has tradeoffs depending on your scale, team size, and needs. Happy to answer questions about specifics.",

Redirect is only available to Fabric engines and likely is some internal library for translating OneLake paths to ADLS paths. Proxy is for everything else (including 3rd party engines) and is probably just as it sounds some additional compute layer to hide direct access to ADLS.I also think that there may be some caching on Fabric side which is only working for Fabric engines...My scenario - run a query from Snowflake or Spark k8s against an Iceberg table on ADLS and on OneLake. The performance is not the same! OneLake is always worse especially for tables with lots of files...So here is my fear - OneLake is not ADLS. It is NOT operating as open storage. It is operating as a premium storage for Fabric and a sub optimal storage for everything else...Just use ADLS then.. Yes, we do. But every time I chat with our Microsoft reps they are pushing and pushing me to use OneLake. I am concerned that one day they will just deprecate ADLS in favour of OneLake.Look Fabric might be decent if you love Power BI, but our business runs on 2 clouds. We have transactional workloads on both, and no way are we going to egress all that data to one cloud or another for analytics. Hence we primarily run an open stack and some multi cloud software like Snowflake.What is wrong with ADLS? Why. do they keep pushing to OneLake? Is this is the next lock-in?",

        "content": "Hey all,I'm a fairly new software engineer who's graduated school recently. I have about \\~2.5YOE including internships and a year at my current job. I've been working on an ETL project at work that involves moving data from one platform via an API to a SQL database using Python. I work on this project with a senior dev with 10+YOE.A lot of my work on this project feels like I'm reinventing the wheel. My senior dev strives for minimizing dependencies to not be tied to any package which makes sense to some extent, but we are only really using a standard API library and pyodbc. I don't really deal with any business logic and have been basically recreating an ORM from the ground up. And at times I feel like I'm writing C code, like checking for return codes and validating errors at the start of every single method and not utilizing exceptions. I don't mean to knock this senior dev in any way, he has a ton of experience and I have learned a lot about writing clean code, but there are some things that throw me off from what I read online about Python best practices. From what I read, it seems like SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Prefect are popular frameworks for creating ETL solutions in Python. From experienced Python developers: is this approach — sticking to vanilla Python, minimizing dependencies, and using very defensive coding patterns — considered reasonable for ETL work? Or would adopting some standard frameworks be more typical in professional projects?",

I'm about 5 months into my job and I feel horrible and terrified; I really like the people that I work with and the energy that they give off but I think that I need to find a new job because I don't think this work is for me because I find it repetitive, frustrating, and anxiety inducing.I really tried understanding the work that I do by working all throughout December and New Years just to get a footing on some of the applications we are supporting but I get so frustrated because learning and understanding the technologies of the application and how we investigate them is so limited that I am forced to ask and or set a meeting with a senior instead of finding it on my own using some guide or written documentation. I also find it frustrating that sometimes when I ask a question to different people (whom have been with the team for more than a year) only for them to give off different answers.Our documentation is so scattered its stored on individual or group OneNote, confluence, excel, azure dev ops, some obscure SharePoint, and sometimes pdfs that were just being shared or sometimes not even shared (for reasons beyond my understanding). On the bright side, they are pushing towards a more unified and reliable way of storing documentation. I get anxious answering to users / operations manager because honestly, I'm scared that what I'm saying is absolutely wrong or something I assumed, so every time I have to ask someone to verify what I'm saying.I also feel misled with my title of being a data engineer and doing specifically only investigation and escalation to other teams and it feels more like a support rather than a DE (and this is for the whole team, there will be no touching of pipelines / code or actual data).On some positive note, I got my AZ-900 and AI-102 (planning for more) and I constantly try to better myself by taking advantage of the free learning sites of the company and now starting some side projects. Given of what I am experiencing, is this my cue to find another job ?",

Similarly, although I have handled schema changes and inconsistent raw files multiple times, I had never heard the term “schema drift.”I felt quite discouraged afterward.

I am atill applying to them, keeping in mind that there's a 90% chance of being rejected during screening itself. It's not like there aren't any Azure openings, but majority of the product based company DE openings are for AWS, as I saw.Just wanted to understand what's the general take is on this? Is it difficult to switch between cloud providers? Should I create a separate cv for aws and use it to apply for aws jobs, even when I know nothing about them and figure out the questions gradually?",

Now once doing the gold layer, I have been noticing some corrupt data.There is a total of 1.5 million records, from the same vendor (Curb Mobility, LLC) which has a negative total amount which can only be described as falsely recorded data by the vendor. I'm trying to make this more of a production ready project, so what I have done is for each record, I have added a flag \"is total amount negative\" into the silver layer. The idea is for data analyst that work on this layer to later question the vendor ect. In regard to the gold layer, I have made another table called gold\\_data\\_quality where I put these anomalies with the number of bad records and a comment about why. Is that a good way to handle this or is there a different way people in the industry handles this type of corrupted data ?",

I know there are journalist networks doing the same, typically (Panama papers etc).I’m thinking working in a organised and open way about examining the files. Dumping all the files in a database, keeping them raw, transforming the data in whatever best possible. The files being “open” enables the power of the collective to be added to the project.I have never organised or initiated anything like this. I have a project management, product management and analytics background but no open source. I know graphanalytics was used across the massive Panama papers dataset, but never used that technology myself.I’d be happy to contribute in whatever way possible.If you think it could help and I any way and have any resources (time, money, knowledge) and want to contribute - ship in! What would we need to get going? Could we get inspiration from the way “open source” projects are formed? Maybe the first step would just make the files a little easier for everyone to work with - downloaded and transformed, classified by llms etc? Code that does that needs to be open so that the raw data is traceable to the justice.gov file. Thoughts?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,I am seeing A LOT of discussion on AI and I feel nervous b/c I haven't quite integrated AI too much in my workflow yet. To be quite frank, I don't know how just yet - I am supposed to be wrapping up a task and moving onto a brand new project. My current task that I've worked on for some time now has been really all over the place - basically, I'm an analytics engineer and I create the datasets that go into dashboards for stakeholders. I work in a slightly niche scientific domain where the parameters of what I need weren't well described and the only way I know I'm looking at the right thing is eyeballing and seeing which parameter is the one that makes the most sense per the stakeholders ask. The issue I am currently dealing with is our data warehouse went through an upgrade and not all the data I need is there - so I have to sometimes use data from the raw data files. And in those files, I have to go through 2 or 3 and find the parameter by eyeballing b/c I don't know the exact name of the field, but can tell what is the right one by looking at it. Also, how we actually want to use and transform those parameters is constantly changing per stakeholders request. There's just a lot of vagueness in this process that is difficult to be clear with a prompt. Writing code isn't really the hard part for me (with this work in particular) and so far, I use genAI (my work gives access to GPT-5) to help me debug if something is wrong or give me a better solution to what I'm doing, which it gives me a good answer I'd say 6/10 times. I'm seeing people discuss Claude to an extent they are no longer doing anything technical at all really, just prompting. Is this really is for people's work these days? I feel behind because I use AI very sparingly and haven't touched Claude yet. I'm planning to try it out but idk what is hype or real anymore, on LinkedIn people are teaching vibe coding courses and it's like being made to feel anybody can be an engineer now, no technical skills needed. Or the narrative if you're not using AI, you are going to become irrelevant. It's honestly making me nervous about how to move forward in my career or what to do anymore really.",

Majority (\\~95%) of the data pipelines are for a lakehouse environment, so lakehouse is a key decision point. We did a poc with Fabric, but it did not really meet our need, on the following points:\\- GovCloud. Majority of the services of Fabric are still not in GCC, so commercial was the choice of poc for us. But the transition of couple of lakehouses from Synapse to the Fabric was really painful. Also, the pricing model is very ambiguous. For example, if we need powerbi premium licenses, how Fabric handles that? \\- Lakehouse Explorer does not supportfor OneLake security RW permissions. RBAC also not mature for row level security.\\- Capacity based model lead to vety unpredictable costing, and Microsoft reps were unable to provide good answers,So we are looking to Databricks, and Snowflake. I am very curious to know thought and experiences for you'll for these platforms. To my limited toe-dipping Databricks environments, it is very well suited for lakehouse. Snowflake, not so.

        "title": "Metaxy: sample-level versioning for multimodal data pipelines",
        "author": "danielgafni",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "My name is Daniel, and I'm an ML Ops engineer at [Anam](https://anam.ai).At [Anam](https://anam.ai), we are making a platform for building real-time interactive avatars. One of the key components powering our product is our own video generation model.We train it on custom training datasets that require all sorts of pre-processing of video and audio data. We extract embeddings with ML models, use external APIs for annotation and data synthesis, and so on. We encountered significant challenges with implementing efficient and versatile sample-level versioning (or caching) for these pipelines, which led us to develop and open-source [Metaxy](https://metaxy.io): the framework that solves metadata management and **sample-level versioning** for multimodal data pipelines.[Metaxy](https://metaxy.io) sits in between high level orchestrators (such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io)) that usually operate at table level and low-level processing engines (such as [Ray](https://ray.io)), passing the exact set of samples that have to be (re) computed to the processing layer and *not a sample more*.## BackgroundWhen a traditional (tabular) data pipeline gets re-executed, it typically doesn't cost much. Multimodal pipelines are a whole different beast. They require a few orders of magnitude more compute, data movement and AI tokens spent. Accidentally re-executed your Whisper voice transcription step on the whole dataset? Congratulations: $10k just wasted!That's why with multimodal pipelines, implementing incremental approaches is a requirement rather than an option. And it turns out, it's damn complicated.## Introducing Metaxy[Metaxy](https://metaxy.io) is the missing piece connecting traditional orchestrators (such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) or [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)) that usually operate at a high level (e.g., updating tables) with the sample-level world of multimodal pipelines.Metaxy has two features that make it unique:1. It is able to track partial data updates.2. It is agnostic to infrastructure and can be plugged into any data pipeline written in Python.Metaxy's versioning engine:- operates in batches, easily scaling to millions of rows at a time.- runs in a powerful remote database or locally with Polars or DuckDB.- is agnostic to dataframe engines or DBs.- is aware of *data fields*: Metaxy tracks a dictionary of versions for each sample.We have been dogfooding Metaxy at Anam since December 2025. We are running millions of samples through Metaxy. All the current Metaxy functionality has been built for our data pipeline and is used there.### AI DisclaimerMetaxy has been developed with the help of AI tooling (mostly Claude Code). However, it should not be considered a vibe-coded project: the core design ideas are human, AI code has been ruthlessly reviewed, we run a very comprehensive test suite with 85% coverage, all the docs have been hand-written (seriously, I hate AI docs), and /u/danielgafni has been working with multimodal pipelines for three years before making Metaxy. A great deal of effort and passion went into Metaxy, especially into user-facing parts and the docs.## More on MetaxyRead our [blog post](https://anam.ai/blog/metaxy), [Dagster + Metaxy blog post](https://dagster.io/blog/building-real-time-interactive-avatars-with-metaxy), Metaxy [docs](https://docs.metaxy.io/), and `uv pip install metaxy`!We are thrilled to help more users solve their metadata management problems with Metaxy. Please do not hesitate to reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/anam-org/metaxy)!",

        "content": "Hi all, we’ve just open sourced Floecat: https://github.com/eng-floe/floecatFloecat is a catalog-of-catalogs that federates Iceberg and Delta catalogs and augments them with planner-grade metadata and statistics (histograms, MCVs, PK/FK relationships, etc.) to support cost-based SQL query planning.It exposes an Iceberg REST Catalog API, so engines like Trino and DuckDB can use it as a single canonical catalog in front of multiple upstream Iceberg catalogs.We built Floecat because existing lakehouse catalogs focus on metadata mutation, not metadata consumption. For our own SQL engine (Floe), we needed stable, reusable statistics and relational metadata to support predictable planning over Iceberg and Delta. Floe will be available later this year, but Floecat is designed to be engine-agnostic.If this sounds interesting, I wrote more about the motivation and design here: https://floedb.ai/blog/introducing-floecat-a-catalog-of-catalogs-for-the-modern-lakehouseFeedback is very welcome, especially from folks who’ve struggled with planning, stats, or metadata across multiple lakehouse catalogs.Full disclosure, I'm the CTO at Floe.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’ve been digging into the recent news about Fundamental AI coming out of stealth with their Nexus model (a \"Large Tabular Model\" or LTM), and I have some doubts, I wanted to run by this sub.context: we have LLMs for text, but tabular data has always by tree-based models (XGBoost/LightGBM). Nexus claims to be the \"first foundation model for tabular data,\" trained on \"billions of public tables\" to act as an \"operating system for business decisions\" (e.g forecasting, fraud detection, churn).I have doubt regarding the data standardisation, unlike text, which has a general structure, business data schemas are the messy. \"Revenue\" in Company A might b \"Total\\_Sales\\_Q3\" in Company B. Basically relationships are implicit and messy.If businesses don't follow open standards for storing data (which they don't), how can a pre-trained model like Nexus actually work \"zero-shot\" without a massive, manual ETL work?I've been trying to map where Nexus sits compared to what we already use:1. Nexus vs. Claude in Excel: Claude in Excel (Anthropic) is basically a super-analyst. It’s a productivity tool. Nexus claims to be a predictive engine. It integrates into the data stack (AWS) to find non-linear patterns across rows/columns automatically. It’s trying to replace the manual modeling pipeline.2. Nexus vs. Deep Learning Architectures (TabNet / iLTM): TabNet (Google) is an architecture you train \"yourself\" on your specific data. It uses sequential attention for interpretability (feature selection). iLTM (Integrated Large Tabular Model - Stanford/Berkeley) seems to be the academic answer to this. It uses a hypernetwork pre-trained on 1,800+ datasets to generate weights for a specific task. It tries to bridge the gap between GBDTs and Neural Nets. LaTable: This is for generating synthetic data (diffusion).Questions for the community:1. Has anyone actually tested a \"Foundation Model\" for tabular data (like Nexus or the open-source iLTM) on messy, real-world dirty data?2. Can an LTM really learn the \"schema\" of a random SQL dump well enough to predict fraud without manual feature engineering?3. Is this actually a replacement for ETL/Feature Engineering, or just another black box that will fail when Column\\_X changes format?",

In Power BI, we govern access via workspaces, dataset permissions, and report sharing.We have a case where a dataset is being created in Databricks purely to support a narrow HR workflow for one person. Because of how our RLS is structured, anyone in certain corporate groups would technically be allowed to query the dataset if they had access to it even though only one HR user will be given the Power BI workspace/report.Questions for the group:* Do you treat the BI tool (Power BI) as the primary gate for “who should see this dataset,” with the data platform enforcing only baseline security?* How do you govern purpose-built or limited-audience datasets so they don’t become broadly discoverable over time?* Any patterns you’ve found helpful (naming conventions, workspace isolation, dataset classification, certification rules, etc.)?Would love to hear how others draw the line between data platform governance vs BI-layer governance.",

Now, these tables are hosted on premises and are being used in production. Meaning, data pull into blob is done only at night so as to not use up the capacity and bring production down (bad idea, i know but that's the situation here). I've been wondering, the capacity would break only if i do a pull during the day. What if i create an application that would incrementally keep loading the data into blob as and when it appends in the raw tables? And also, if there is any way that i can tap into the capacity metrics of the database to ensure that the pull happens only when the utilization is below 40 percent, then that would be brilliant too. Any SAP experts here, please help me out. This would change a lot of things for me.As far as I've checked Debezium cannot be used. Now i can keep polling on the transaction tables, but that doesn't seem to help me in anyway. It could be counterproductive. Is there anything else i can use?Thanks in advance",

I am thinking of creating a Python service within Azure Container Apps for the integration part and splitting it from the Analytics data. I am familiar with Python and my boss inherited the mess as well, so he is open to a different setup. Do you think this is a good approach or should I look elsewhere?",

That’s fine until you actually need low-latency analytics, live dashboards, or fast iteration on streaming data - then you’re suddenly standing up Flink, renting beefy cloud instances, or duct-taping together tools that were never designed for the job. Even worse - you go to push it into Databricks that you are paying 20k a month for and it doesn’t really stream. Mate.I kept running into this, so I’ve been building [Minarrow](https://github.com/pbower/minarrow) \\- a fast, minimal columnar data library that’s wire-compatible with Apache Arrow but purpose-built to run efficiently on a single machine.**What it does:*** Core data building block paired with “*SIMD-Kernels*” crate -> delivers sub-second aggregations on laptop-class hardware - no cluster, no JVM/Java OOM, no orchestrator* Drives live dashboards directly from streaming data without an intermediate warehouse or materialised view layer (you and/or your mate Claude still need to wire it up yourself)* Converts to Arrow, Polars, or PyArrow at the boundary via zero-copy, so it slots into existing ecosystems without serialisation overhead *(.to\\\\\\_polars() in Rust)** Pairs with a companion crate (*Lightstream*) if you want to push results straight to the browser over WebSocket**Where it fits** *(and where it doesn’t):*This sits at pipeline as code, or the engine-internals level. It’s a building block for engineers who are comfortable constructing pipelines and systems, not a plug-and-play BI tool. If your workload is distributed and you genuinely need horizontal scale, keep using Spark/Flink - Minarrow won’t replace that.But if you’re in the zone - and prefer compiling for performance, and working with the blocks you need, this is the layer I wanted to exist and couldn’t find.Happy to answer questions, take criticism, or hear what you feel you’ve actually been missing in your stack.Also, if you’ve focused more on the Python side happy to help point you into Rust land.Thanks for checking it out.",

I don’t see a bright future there any longer but the role is well paid and fully remote.One of my options will likely be a team lead role. The job is for a regionally recognized software company that works in the finance space. It’s likely similar to a data engineering and architect role with some management of some junior developers. The role will be more corporate and pays roughly the same after the year-end bonus but will require being in-office twice a week.The other option is a senior data engineering role at another smaller startup that just raised some capital. It’s better paid but will require being in-office three times a week. Overall, the leadership team is strong and everyone on the team seems very down-to-earth.What would you guys lean towards?

        "author": "Prudent-Newt-7603",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "We’re currently running our data warehouse on SQL Server on an Azure VM and only have a single production environment. We want to move to a proper DEV/STAGING and PROD setup so we can test changes safely before promoting them to production.At the same time, we’re also introducing Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) as a central landing zone for raw data. Instead of ingesting directly into SQL Server like we do today, data will first land in ADLS in partitioned Parquet format (for example `/bronze///year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/`). From there, it would be loaded into SQL Server. This should give us better control, allow replay/backfills if needed, and make it easier to keep DEV and PROD consistent.Historically, most of our transformations were implemented using stored procedures directly in SQL Server. As things have grown more complex, this has become difficult to maintain and version properly, so we want to move transformation logic into dbt to get proper version control, modularity, and lineage.The main challenge we’re facing is around ingestion and schema management. dbt assumes that the source tables already exist in the warehouse, but in our case those bronze tables need to be created and updated first, including handling schema changes like new tables or columns.Since PROD will be locked down (engineers shouldn’t be able to write to it directly), we need a controlled way to manage and promote schema changes from DEV/STAGING to PROD. We also need a reliable way to ingest data from ADLS into both environments, either incrementally or as full reloads, without maintaining everything manually.Right now, we see two main options:**Option 1:** Use a migration tool like Flyway? to manage bronze table schemas via version-controlled migrations. ADF would then load data from ADLS into those bronze tables in both DEV and PROD, ideally using a metadata-driven approach.**Option 2:** Use external tables (there is apparently a dbt-external-source tables package that could handle that directly within the dbt repository) over ADLS and let dbt read directly from the data lake and materialize bronze or staging tables itself using incremental models. This would reduce the amount of ingestion logic in ADF, but we’re not sure how well this works with SQL Server on an Azure VM, especially around incremental loads, schema changes, and operational stability. Also given that the data is organized as `/bronze///year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/` would that even work as a pointer? Any help would be great!!",

        "content": "Hello! I'm currently in a Business Analyst trainee position at an insurance company, six months into a 12-month program. The problem is that I don't feel fulfilled in terms of growth and challenge; I work exclusively with PROC SQL and SAS, simply joining tables and creating basic rules for them.I recently received an offer to work as an Intern Data Engineer at Natixis. For the first two months, I would attend an internal academy to learn their tech stack (which involves a significant salary hit during this period). This would be followed by three months of on-the-job training (where the pay is similar to my current salary) and, finally, a six-month \"solo\" professional internship where the pay exceeds my current salary by a good margin.I am inclined to accept the offer, but it has its downsides: the initial salary hit, a fully on-site schedule for the first two months (though it eventually moves to three days remote, compared to my current two), and one extra working hour per day (moving from a 35-hour week to a 40-hour week). Both jobs require about a one-hour commute each way.I'm wondering if I should take this opportunity (being that currently I have zero monetary responsibilities), or if I am simply being over-optimistic about the growth potential of a Data Engineering career path, a field that genuinely interests me.",

When a user activity is not captured, an outlook email is sent to devs. Since I've been put on the dev list (as a non dev) I receive these emails too. These emails have all the required information we need.My idea is to make a pipeline of sorts that takes the outlook data, transforms it, and adds it to the existing data used to build operations reports. That way, reporting is accurate. I'd also like it to refresh every week or so, to accurately reflect the information in the database.The issue is, I have only access to VBA, MS Access, Excel, and Outlook. So no real modern tech advice has helped me so far. I know some things I have considered (what if the Pipeline fails, how to isolate pipeline failures ect) but I know so little about Data Engineering conceptually...(As for my Access VBA skills, I already have build user forms and basic form logic that involves communicating with other Microsoft Applications.)My question is, what should I consider when building a data pipeline, regardless of the tech I have access to?

Sei o básico (funções, variáveis etc.), mas sinto que ainda não entendo bem os conceitos e a estratégia por trás das coisas.O que mais me confunde é que muitos cursos ensinam um fluxo tipo: pegar um CSV, salvar em algum lugar, limpar, subir de novo, carregar no Python, automatizar com o Windows Task… e, sendo bem sincera, isso parece pouco prático no dia a dia real de uma empresa.Aqui onde trabalho temos vários dashboards, alguns bem pesados para editar, que puxam direto do banco do TI. Usamos Oracle e MySQL. Aí fico pensando: o Python não poderia se conectar direto no banco e alimentar o BI? Porque, se for para pegar dados de um banco que eu nem tenho permissão de edição, jogar no Python e depois subir para outro banco ou planilha… isso realmente compensa?Também fico perdida porque vejo opiniões muito diferentes: tem gente que fala que Power BI é maravilhoso, outros dizem que o certo é fazer todos os gráficos no Python e que BI é ruim… e eu sinceramente não sei por onde começar nem no que focar para evoluir.Outro ponto: temos um banco em que o pessoal do TI cadastra nomes de empresas e outras informações de formas diferentes. A gente trata isso nos dashboards, mas sempre aparece uma nova variação e temos que corrigir tudo de novo. Se levássemos esse tratamento para Python, não seria o mesmo problema? Como garantir que os dados fiquem padronizados e corretos ao longo do tempo?E ainda surgem outras dúvidas: onde guardar os códigos? como organizar os projetos? como lidar com erros? questões de segurança?O Python é tão abrangente que acabo não sabendo em que focar primeiro.Se alguém puder compartilhar como funciona esse fluxo na prática (Python + banco + BI) e o que realmente vale a pena estudar no início, eu agradeceria muito!",

The first thing I noticed is that most softwares we see are built on top of open source tools that have been made by thousands of developers world wide example: Linux, Database Management Systems, Frameworks so most devs work on business logic on top of this software.What is important for any programmer are fundamentals when you understand some commonly used fundamentals like: data types, variables, conditions statements, loops, collections, functions, data structure and OOP are enough for expressing logic. Before writing and following syntax I basically think a good programmer understands something in a very high level way instructions, also how the full flow works without touching the syntax. Then, the last part is translating high level written instructions into syntax based on a certain language.This is based on my opinion and how I have been coding also being language agonistic by ensuring that logic comes first before anything else. May be, some experienced devs may correct or share thoughts on this but this is basically based on what I have experienced throughout my programming journey.",

Despite that, when it came time to apply for jobs, I felt like I didn’t know enough. I kept telling myself I needed to learn more before I was “ready,” so I hesitated.Meanwhile, one of my friends from the same program someone who had some of the worst grades started applying everywhere. He admitted later that he exaggerated and even lied on his applications because he was tired of being unemployed.**And it worked. He got hired.**During the interview, he told them he had stretched the truth because he just wanted a chance. They took a chance on him, trained him on the job, and now he’s working in the field. I’m still jobless and ironically, he sometimes tries to “teach” me the things he learned there, even though I already studied most of it.I’m not angry at him. If anything, I’m frustrated with myself. It feels like I let fear and self-doubt hold me back while someone else just went for it and figured things out along the way.I guess this is a reminder that sometimes the biggest barrier isn’t skill it’s confidence. Or maybe just timing and luck.",

        "author": "DuztyLipz",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Alright, let me preface this by saying that I'm not a software engineer by profession, but I have been coding for \\~6-7 years. I came to an epiphany/connected the dots. This post may not fit everybody, but hopefully, this can get *someone* out of a rut. Apologies for non-technical refinement/terms in advance.So, when I used to watch fundamentals tutorials or lurk Reddit, people would always say something to the effect of \"just build stuff\"... I always wondered why that was or why they would say that without the reason why. I had a tough time grasping object-oriented programming (non-sequitur: we gotta stop using the Animal -> Dog -> Labrador example for OOP... I think it confuses people), but I kept building with OOP--and with the help of others' code in The Odin Project and seeing how it was **actually applied**\\--I had the \"aha\" moment needed to understand OOPs purpose. Here's the kicker though: **there are actually terms for this and why building is so crucial**. Now, it's an adjacent field, but these terms also apply to how programmers think... The terms are: [mathematical maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity), ***mathematical insight***, and [mathematical intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_intuition). It's crucial to tell you--or whom it may concern--exactly what they are.***Mathematical Maturity*** is basically someone's experience with math, *especially mathematical understanding that is not directly taught*. Mathematicians seriously have to grind math problems because being instructed by teachers only goes so far. You gain more maturity via repeated exposure. Grinding enough problems over and over again makes you reach ***mathematical insight***.***Mathematical Insight*** is where you have that \"Aha!\" moment, that \"oooooh, that's what that does\". This happens when you \"build stuff\" or solve problems. This happened with me stuck in \"OOP hell\"... After finally applying it in an appropriate way (instead of Animal -> Dog -> Labrador) and applied it to different things, I gained a deeper understanding of it that I could **never** get from a tutorial. Mathematical insight can't be directly taught. You grind problems/build stuff to get that \"Aha!\" moment.***Mathematical Intuition*** is where you've grinded the concept so much, it's apart of your repertoire. You don't even need to think of \"how\" it works because you upped your mathematical maturity and insight through applying what you've learned, *instead of watching tutorials;* therein deepening your understanding. This also helps with you understanding the range of projects you can do. It's just a matter of \"how to logically structure \\[insert program\\]\".That's basically it. \"Building stuff\" actually makes these programming concepts stick in your mind. The reason I posted this is two-fold: 1.) It would, hopefully, get someone out of a rut and 2.) Give those who say \"build stuff\" a few terms that can exactly describe how crucial it is... For anyone in the industry/do this professionally... What are your thoughts on this? All criticism is welcome",

However in JS, arrays are composite data structures which hold *heterogeneous* values and are ordered with an index. Would an array in JS be closer to a record as far as data structures go or am I putting the cart before the horse in the importance of the allowance of more than one data structure? Is it more important that arrays are index-based by their definition more than it is important that they are homogeneous? Any and all help would be great, thanks!!",

Naturally I took another “small” ticket as 2nd for next sprint. The story explicitly stated it would exclude the core parts of the codebase, so I was confident I could wrap it up quickly.However, it turned out to be the \"tip of the iceberg.\" There was no way to complete the task without touching the entire application and refactoring core logic. The 2week sprint is ending soon and I still have error in integration testing and need to debug.I think my “people” manager and teammate still in the “black box” and might questioning why taking me so long for a “small” ticket. I’ve been quiet about it in standups because I wasn't sure if the task was genuinely big or if I was just bad. But I have just reached out to my direct tech lead recently and confirmed this is “a lot” and I’m on the right track.I’m a front end leaning full stack but hired as a backend engineer. I’ve already stayed up until 3am several nights trying to bridge the gap. Any advice to bridge the gap faster and handling people manger expectation?Add on:Thanks everyone for the advice. I’ve learned a lot.Just to provide some additional background: I reached out to the Senior Tech Lead very early in the sprint to confirm the scope, but I didn’t ask to formally edit the story. I expected the team had acknowledged the issue, but the Senior Tech Lead wasn’t in stand-up last week, and it seems the people manager wasn’t aligned either.I didn’t expect it to take this long. I can handle the business logic, but errors keep coming up during unit testing and integration testing because the changes touch a large portion of the codebase, if that makes sense.I originally applied for a full-stack role but was placed as a Senior Backend engineer, so I’ve been a bit concerned about expectations — specifically, whether I’m expected to handle something like this entirely on my own.",

I recently switched jobs from a less technical company that just needed some basic React, to a FAANG adjacent company which is highly tech based in all products (my team does React and React Native). I feel like I have talent and understand code, but my seniors are so technical and have such an in depth understanding of everything that sometimes I still feel like a junior. I have been programming as a hobby since middle school (25 now) but did not attend college and am self taught. Sometimes I feel like I conned my way into these positions lol. Any advice for those of us past junior level but struggling to find the knowledge to become a senior?I hear often that senior roles require a greater understanding of company goals and cross team functionality - I understand the importance of that - but I am purely just asking about the technical level and how to gain that in depth knowledge of systems and tools.Thank you so much!",

The problem is I can’t find clear advice on how to *actually* learn properly or what the roadmap should look like — especially for someone who wants to become a game developer and build their own game someday.Should I:* Stop watching tutorials completely?* Keep building small projects?* Start learning a game engine already?* Focus more deeply on C++ fundamentals first?If anyone here escaped tutorial hell or is on the game dev path, I’d really appreciate some guidance.Thanks!",

I know I can do it when I sit down and do it for hours, but for some reason it just doesn’t click for me like most things do and it frustrates me. How do I get better at programming? I’m at the point where I learned C and C++ and python and MATLAB where I find MATLAB easy, C difficult and C++ harder, but python is okay. I don’t think like a programmer does. I tend to think instead like a mathematician does and I’m thinking maybe doing some discrete math will help me. But honestly, it’s just frustrating me to no end and I don’t understand why I struggle so much with this. Please give me some advice any would be appreciated or places I can do to learn programming.

If tasks truly run at the same time on multiple cores, is that still considered concurrency? I'm asking this because classic concurrenct issues such as race conditions and deadlocks can also occur in truly parallel execution. So does concurrency include parallelism as a broader concept, with parallelism being one way to achieve it?",

        "title": "Why use Message Brokers?",
        "author": "normantas",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Preface. I have 4YOE as backend engineer. I use Azure with some tiny experience with React + TypeScript when I worked in teams that had some React components or a webpage. I have used RabbitMQ and Mass Transit with PostgreSQL.I still can't wrap my head around why use Message Brokers (MB). Sometimes I find their use. You have an API and a pods for long jobs. The ones that take at least few seconds. So let's say API takes in a massive file and does a request for a long calculation operation which queues a task to the Pods.Where my issue falls is when the operation is short so giving it to a message broker does not seem to make sense. It feels a lot of times it is not worth to create the logic for message brokers.I was reading about making a URL shortener. One person said if you want metrics you will want to use a MB to log statistics and usage. Why not just push the request locally on same instance of a service just different process/thread. I do not thing logging statistics take that much resources? Would it not slow down giving the request and add costs for running 2 services instead of one? A lot of programs nowadays run on 1 thread and just use the async/await pattern as creating a new process is costly.The primary values I find in message brokers:1. Separation of intents and simplifying services. So basically microservices. Though a lot of people are moving to \"modular monolith\" structure where you create a new service when it is needed.2. Orchestrating long running tasks.3. If you have few seperate services on same machine, some MB can read the RAM data and reuse it which lowers the memory usageand speeds up the process by not sending the data but just re-reading the same data from RAM.4. There is probably a case of improved Horizontal scaling.Both can be done with an API (without the use case of RAM), though API adds some bloat but so do message brokers and not sure if managing something more complex is worth the investment. I guess also small benefit of some MB is sequentiality of tasks or in case the process fails, it stores the tasks. Though not all MB do that.It just creates me lot of confusion (as my writing is probably all over the places so the confusion is shown). To me it has tradeoffs though I see a lot of people putting MB where they can instead of evaluating if it is worth it.Can someone give me good project ideas, examples to master the value of MB? Message broker usage is so far and wide and sometimes I do not understand why not just have an API that is closed to external traffic?I'll give an example of a project I think could use MB: A web Crawler. There is a crawler that collects web pages. Fills the queue with URLs and the Workers consume the URLs and extract data. That is how I would do a basic crawlers for data collection. Data collection like metadata, Urls can take multiple DB queries and such so it can take up to 100ms on a massive page. Though I have to take into account if the Web Crawler can't do the same. If the added time for sending the request take a while. Why use workers? I just add more time to work by sending the request and waiting for it to be consumed.",

The camera will be external, not mounted on the robot, and will be overlooking the arena from above to see the entire field.And here's my question: Is it possible to determine in real time where the opponent robot's front and back sides are? Also, can a \"friend-or-foe\" system be implemented so that my robot can recognize itself?I should add that I have NEVER worked with CV before and am just studying the material for now.

Isn't giving a callback like \"ExecuteJump\" to inputManager and making the inputManager call it way more efficient? Why would unity dev team who are clearly more experienced than me do this?2. Why is there polling in the first place? Tbh it feels like it will always be more efficient to give callback instead? Is there a case where polling is actually better in terms of performance or when they can do something callbacks cannot do?3.

Please recommend good YouTube tutorials (German or English).\\---Hey everyone,I don’t want to end up posting in r/ifuckedup in a couple of months, so I figured I’d ask for help now.My team leader asked if anyone would be willing (and able) to adapt a spreadsheet from another division to fit our department’s needs. It’s basically an automated form where you enter your name, the station, select a specific part from a dropdown, and add a short description of the issue (after it’s fixed) so the next shift has proper documentation and certain parts can be monitored.I work with Excel on a surface level and thought this would be something like:“Delete a few unnecessary dropdowns, add some new ones, rename a few labels — done.”Since nobody else was interested, I said I’d give it a try. I made it clear that this would be somewhat experimental on my end. My boss was totally fine with that and said I could take as much time as I need. We currently use our own list, but it’s all free text, which makes filtering difficult. For example, one station is officially called “03st02,” but colleagues enter things like “3st2” or “3-2”… you get the idea.Anyway — I received the file and the password for the VBA project.And wow. I completely underestimated it.The file basically contains a full program running in the background, constantly cross-checking every input. I can’t just remove, add, or rename anything without breaking everything else. And honestly, for our department’s needs, it feels way overengineered. The deeper I dive into the code, the more confusing (and unnecessary) it seems.I’ve told my boss that I don’t think adapting this file makes sense and that I’d rather build something new from scratch. He’s fine with that — no pressure.But if I’m going to do this, I want to do it properly. So I need to actually learn VBA.Can you recommend some good beginner-level YouTube tutorials to get started? German or English is fine. I also wouldn’t mind paid courses if they’re really worth it.Thanks in advance!AI-Usage for grammar etc",

        "author": "NerdyBooy",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello all,As the title suggests, I wish to know what books are good resource to learn about low-level programming (specifically - embedded programming).I'm an embedded sw dev in my (new) job and would like to know which books would be good for deepening my understanding/improving my expertise? I am currently reading \"Operating Systems - Three Easy Pieces\" (OSTEP), ( [Source](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) ). But that's not entirely related to what I'm interested in.I was wondering if there are books which offer relatively deep explanations of RTOS systems, communication protocols (TCP,UDP,CAN,SPI,I2C,Uart, etc) - and maybe even introduction to circuit boards (as I have to read those schemas quite often at work). I had found this: [CircuitSymbols](https://electronicsclub.info/circuitsymbols.htm) \\- but I'd like to know if there was a book I could read on the topic as well.As for my background - I have a degree in software engineering. But when it comes to practical sw development, my college had primarily taught us web technologies. I happened to get a job as an embedded sw dev and realized I like it a lot more - so I'd like to improve.Basically - I have a background in high-level software development but would like to read books to become a better low-level developer.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I’m planning a small, local delivery platform inspired by Wolt/UberEats, but starting very lean. The idea is to have three roles: customers who can browse products, add them to a cart and place orders, stores/restaurants that only see and manage their own orders and products, and in-house couriers who get assigned deliveries and update their status through a mobile-first interface (likely a PWA).I want to avoid reinventing basic e-commerce logic, but I also don’t want to be locked into a heavy platform that fights against delivery-style workflows. I’ve looked at Bagisto and similar full platforms, but they feel very e-commerce-centric. Lately I’ve been considering Laravel with LunarPHP (core + Filament admin) and building the store, courier and dispatch logic on top of that.Does LunarPHP sound like a reasonable foundation for this kind of project, or would you recommend a different stack or approach? I’m mostly interested in starting with a clean architecture that can scale later.Thanks!",

While searching, I came across a few options like the Full Stack Developer course by Angela Yu and some other free courses on YouTube. When I checked Angela Yu’s course, I found that its duration is 62 hours. However, some of my friends suggested that it might be too short and that I should look for courses that are more in-depth.Right now, I am really confused. Can you please suggest which course I should follow? Should I go with Angela Yu’s course, or are there any better alternatives that you would recommend? Your guidance would be a great help.Thank you.",

I eventually gave up on this approach.* **Webcam + AprilTags (Python):** I managed to get some basic detection working, but it started feeling overly complicated, especially when I thought about where and how I’d even place the tags on the sword in a practical way.* **Other ideas (not tried yet):** * Color masking / color tracking * Something ML-based like YOLOAt this point, my goal has degraded to: Read rough orientation (is the sword pointing up / down / left / right) and detect swings.

Then I decided I'd try using TDD for this - something that I know in theory but have never really practiced...Several months later, \\*just\\* the bootstrapping of the project is taking up all my spare time - admittedly, that's not a huge amount of spare time as there is a lot going on in my life at the moment.

The team knew there are things that I don't know, because they have never been properly communicated, so I was helped with that. There are changes in the team or deployment process? communicated. Some new framework? communicated. Some update in our best practices? communicated too.But in the new team, the approach turned out to be very much 'sink or swim'. You are told some things initially but then rest of the things, even processes, even whom to reach out and even what to do when there is a conflict with someone else, everything was left on you. Your ticket/task was handled to you and it was said to be your ownership The moment you are assigned your task, you treat it like a sword hanging near your neck and you do everything possible to deliver it on time. Something unexpected causing delays? Some other component which you rely on, not working properly? Nobody cares. You need to deliver on the deadline anyhow.I don't really like this kind of a culture, really. I loved the old, collaborative culture where it felt like we are working on a mission together with our team. Where our team is not our enemy, but they are comrades.

        "author": "sharjeelsidd",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm genuinely curious. Years ago, whenever a company announced it was offshoring engineering work, people would roll their eyes and say, \"Oh, when will they learn?\" Guess what. They've learned and come back with better execution. The assumption has been it would backfire, Time zone gaps, miscommunication, quality issues, and lack of ownership would eventually make companies regret the move. Back then, that argument had weight. High-level technical work depends on speed, tight feedback loops, and shared context. It wasn't easy to coordinate complex engineering across continents. But over the last two decades, US companies have consistently invested in talent pipelines in places like India, the Philippines, and Brazil. What started as cost-cutting experiments turned into long-term infrastructure. The quality gap has narrowed. With Zoom, Slack, Jira, GitHub, and real-time dashboards, accountability is no longer the barrier it once was. Work is visible and there are tons of tools in place for checks and balances before code gets deployed. Add AI to that stack, code review tools, copilots, automated testing, and suddenly the difference in execution shrinks even more. Offshore teams are no longer turning out to be unreliable. They're writing code with AI and increasing velocity. Product strategy and client-facing roles are still staying in the US, but a large portion of engineering execution, the high-paying core, is increasingly moving out. If a company can get comparable output at a fraction of the cost, the incentive is obvious. How are US developers supposed to compete in that environment?",

Their excuse was that the firm was on a hiring freeze due to AI, but I know for a fact all of that is BS, they are under tight regulations that won't let some random AI handle sensitive financial information or personal identifiable information from customers since it's almost impossible to secure with the current iteration of AI models as for a clever prompt can make them spill their guts creating a huge liability.Then I started to talk to people on other branches and I was told they're in fact hiring aggressively outside of the US, specially in India and when they need someone in the same time zone they hire in Canada.The reasoning is that in the US corporate tax is 21% and by moving their operations offshore they only have to pay 10.5% halving their costs on taxes alone.The icing on the cake is the H1B visa which has become the new way of slave driving employees, [Tesla is getting sued for not hiring in the US](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/lawsuit-says-musks-tesla-hires-visa-holders-instead-americans-so-it-can-pay-less-2025-09-12/) at all and Salesforce fired 3000 employees due to \"AI\" in 2023 and [has brought over 1000 visa holders yearly](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-hire-1-000-people-194931457.html) ever since.So no AI is not taking jobs, at least not yet, when I was working at the firm, Their AI agent couldn't even rename a function across a few files but companies are just firing as many people as they can to put more money into their own pockets and please investors. tldr; AI is not the enemy, company greed isEdit 1: I know they are also saving on wages and that corporate taxes is not the only reason, I just thought it was common knowledge wages were the main reason companies outsource and didn't want to repeat it again.Edit 2: Also about me being a contractor, I see a lot of people arguing semantics because I technically never was hired full time, I was under a special early career program which is sponsored by the NY State which gives them huge tax breaks in exchange for hiring you at the end if you're a fit.Financial institutions as the scumbags that they are keep using the AI excuse to reject candidates and still get the tax breaks, i don't know how that is not a breach of contract but if working for them.",

My team seems cool and the work sounds like it'll be pretty interesting. Unfortunately the office is 1.5 hours away from my place (I've been couch surfing at a friend's place during the workweek to mitigate this) and the pay itself is also pretty low. There's also mandatory 5-day RTO (with rumored hourly minimums).The offer for the new job starts in June, 2 day hybrid office requirement, and is 15 minutes from home. The question is, how do I actually make this transition? Do I do as much work as possible to offset my team having to essentially interview, hire and onboard someone new? When should I let my manager know? The priority is minimizing the impact my early departure could potentially have.Thank you.",

I felt like a dissapointment to my parents, especially seeing my friends progress with their lives while i was back at home bedrotting everyday. I told myself that i NEEDED to lock in and get an internship for this summer, orelse I had to apply for some retail job like starbucks to keep me afloat.Welp… this morning after 624 job applications, I finally got my offer letter today. It’s not a big prestigious company like amazon but im literally so happy and cannot complain.Im like one of the dumbest people I know so if I can do it, SO CAN YOU. DONT GIVE UP!! if you are still struggling to find an internship, here are some tips that helped me:* use linkedin to network but not for applying to jobs. they repost jobs and it’s just a waste of time because everyone is applying to those postings* surround yourself with ambitious friends. im so thankful that my friends are so smart and supportive because they helped me fix my resume, and seeing their success just motivates me to do better* in the job interview, you need to show some personality. lots of candidates focus too much on GETTING the interview but remember you also need to pass it, show that you are someone enjoyable to be around* try to find internships the moment they get posted, literally the day of. constantly refresh github repos, intern insider, discord, etc. or stalk company sites directly* stay consistent and protect your mental health. I kept applying even when nothing was working, but I also made sure I had hobbies and friends outside of job hunting so rejections did not completely wreck meAt the end of the day, i think it’s just a game of luck. Keep putting shots up and eventually one will fall in.. or something like that. Happy to answer any questions about my job search and help give more advice if youre struggling!",

You can filter by funding stage, remote, equity, and see who you’re actually talking to.

The documentation in the code is spotty at best, documentation for the language is spotty at best, and online resources are nonexistent.

Also, our entire accounting system is run by this application. I know nothing of accounting.I don't have too many years left in my career but this is not how I want to spend them. And at my age and having been at the same place for nearly a quarter of a century I have no idea who would hire me. I was given the opportunity a while back to buy into the company as a partner, but I declined since it seemed like mostly just more aggravation plus I'm actually fairly nervous about the financial health of the company.

Some of them are clearly trying to solicit personal information out of you and try to figure out your real identity.

I'll give you much better advice than the people commenting on your post. They don't know anything :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:\" No you won't. You won't say anything different from the other 100+ comments. Fuck off.I had to enable the hide all posts feature on my profile because of this sub.

Most of us on Reddit use this platform anonymously. We're not trying to show our real identity. The other issue I have with this is that some of you are currently in uni. Why don't you guys try to interact with CS people in your lectures, tutorials, labs, or the tech club at your uni? For all you know, you could be talking to some guy on this sub who's living on another continent who you will never meet in real life. At least interact with your community at uni/college.I should've made this post a long time ago but better late than never. The main thing to be careful is to watch out for the people trying expose your identity through something like \"send me your resume\". But even putting that aside, I don't get the whole dming thing on this sub when I never experience it on any other sub.",

        "content": "I got laid off 2 weeks and 2 days ago from Amazon (after getting my only 6 months of experience), and there's always been an underlying sense of insecurity about it. My old job as an SWE was genuinely like the only redeeming quality I have. I'm not cool, charismatic, skilled, or attractive like other people. I'm trying to change that, but no matter what I do, I just lack in comparison to other people online and IRL. Most of the people I live have tech jobs still – hell, I see a few still wearing their badges from my old company. I'm kind of tempted to try a career pivot and get a master's because of the whole AI thing, but I don't know if I can get into that great of a school (and in turn, I don't know how accomplished I could get to feel).I don't have a job like other people I know now. Outside of my team, almost all of the people I know at my old company still have their jobs. I also feel even more envious than usual of people that were able to get into really prestigious companies that I've gotten rejected from multiple times (namely Google and Apple). Every time I meet someone new, there's that inevitable circle of everyone saying what they do for a living. It honestly feels like I'm lying if I were to say I'm still a software engineer, so I usually end up caving and saying that I got laid off and am searching. I was debating whether to try to hang out with my friends, but I can't help but feel somewhat avoidant since I'd be the oddball.I know it's technically not my fault (it was a mass layoff of thousands of people, then half my old team including my manager), but as is, I still don't have a job anymore. Beyond getting another position (which I'm of course, working on), I don't really think there's a way to feel better. I wish I could rewind – maybe I could've made it to another company out of college that didn't do mass layoffs..",

        "content": "I honestly think what’s happening in the job market is pretty obvious. It’s not just AI taking everyone’s jobs (maybe some of them, sure), but a lot of work is simply being outsourced to cheaper labor markets : Eastern Europe, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc.I’m pretty active on a bunch of subreddits, and the difference is obvious. You’ve got people in the US and Western Europe saying they’ve applied to 100+ jobs and can’t even land an interview. Meanwhile, people in places like India or the Philippines talk pretty casually about getting IT jobs, call center work, remote contracts and earning high income ( relative to their country’s norm) .If someone like Trump argues that protectionist policies are necessary to protect Western industries, workers and western dominance , and points to China building its economy off the back of offshored manufacturing , then why isn’t this treated the same way? Offshoring these tech jobs might not look as dramatic as factories moving overseas, but it’s shifting income, skills, and long-term capacity to other countries. It should be treated as a threat to western dominance And the bigger picture is this: when you offshore work, you’re not just saving money in the short term. You’re helping build those countries skilled workforce. Over time, those countries will develop expertise, infrastructure, and competitive companies of their own. That could eventually mean they outperform Western firms and that further weakens Western dominance in the long run.It just feels like we’re watching the same pattern repeat, only this time with tech and services instead of manufacturing. Maybe it’s a bit wild to say but I don’t think companies that offshore lots of their jobs like this should be allowed to operate in the country or at the very least they should face much higher taxation that makes offshoring unattractive",

The job is way chiller than I ever could have expected. I'm fully remote, on a team of five (with some very experienced people), On Call weekend once every ten weeks or so but it's generally very uneventful. Leadership is thoughtful, people get along, WLB is amazing (working hours are working hours, 4 weeks PTO, etc). It's really a genuinely great situation. The bad is that the work isn't really challenging or interesting. We maintain probably 20-30 different legacy Java applications, frequently that just looks like small little feature or workflow changes, database work, or some kind of server script that needs to be done. We're in the process of modernizing them - but the vast majority (which truly are very simple boring CRUD workflows) are getting moved into a proprietary \"pro-code\" platform (a convuluted, absolute mess of a thing that uses java objects in a bizarre way) with the remaining 5-6 of them being rewritten as cloud native react apps. Right now, we're inbetween that. Theres a few developers that are staying pretty busy doing deep dives into a high impact java app that was originally written around 2006, but the rewrites haven't started yet and I find myself doing super low impact work and trying to \"look\" busy because theres just not much to do. For a while I was enjoying that - doing projects around the house or the yard but now I'm over that. I want to do something interesting and I have NO interest in taking part in the low code nonsense. I'm being underutilized. I also only get paid around 65k (LCOL area so whatever, but even the \"leads\" are barely pushing 100). It seems obvious to look for something else but I work with awesome people, have a ton of free time, fully remote, AND good management? I'd hate to leave and go somewhere else thats miserable. Background: 31, Career changer, went to an average state school after high school for accounting, proceeded to go work at a car dealership because I liked cars and hated taxes. Did pretty well, moved through the ranks, wanted to do something more intellectually challenging, went back to school (WGU don't flame me) to get a CS degree (honestly I was always a nerd who understood computers well and tinkered with stuff so I was more looking for the HR checkbox, I know it's not great though). Decent soft skills, better than a lot of my coworkers for sure, could probably do well at leetcode mediums if I gave it some effort, but no strong interest in relocating. Would consider myself competent and a strong employee but I'm probably never going to be the guy coding on the weekends because he just loves it that much. Have considered signing up for OMSCS to lose some of that wgu stigma and open up possibilities but with AI here it kind of feels like: why?",

        "content": "This is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately.Software engineering used to feel like the golden path. High pay, tons of demand, solid job security. Then bootcamps blew up, CS enrollments exploded, and now it feels pretty saturated at the entry level. On top of that, AI tools are starting to automate parts of coding, which makes the future feel a bit uncertain.Now I’m wondering if machine learning is heading in the same direction.ML pays a lot of money right now. The salaries are honestly a big part of why people are drawn to it. But I’m seeing more and more people pivot into ML, more courses, more degrees, more certifications, and some universities are even starting dedicated AI degrees now. It feels like everyone wants in. People from all kinds of backgrounds are moving into ML and AI too, math majors, engineering majors, stats, physics, and even people outside traditional tech paths, similar to how CS became the default choice for so many different majors a few years ago. At the same time, tools are getting better. With foundation models and high-level frameworks, you don’t always need to build things from scratch anymore.As a counterpoint though, ML is definitely harder than traditional CS in a lot of ways. The math, the theory, reading research papers, running experiments. The learning curve feels steeper. It’s not something you can just pick up in a few months and be truly good at. So maybe that barrier keeps it from becoming as saturated as general software engineering?I’m personally interested in going into AI and robotics, specifically machine learning or computer vision at robotics companies. That’s the long term goal. I just don’t know if this is still a smart path or if it’s going to become overcrowded and unstable in the next 5 to 10 years.Would love to hear from people already in ML or robotics. Is it still worth it? Or are we heading toward the same oversaturation issues that SWE is facing?",

I’ve learned a lot and have had a lot of ownership. We are trying to do everything according to best practices, if we can.The downside is that I’m significantly underpaid for the scope of work, and the company has become increasingly chaotic. A few months ago I realized I should probably move on.Recruiter outreach has been decent (a few LinkedIn messages per week), and I’ve started applying and studying to fill in gaps. Still, I’ve been feeling oddly demotivated and worried that starting at a messy startup might hurt my long-term prospects.Still, I feel pretty demotivated and I’m not sure why. I’m hoping that my experience and time are on my side, and that sooner or later I’ll end up at a better company. I know, some people can't even get experience, so I'm glad for that at least. One thing I’m sure about is that at this startup I gained experience that I would have had no chance of getting at a large company, so I’m happy about that.**So the main question of this post:** are there people here who started at a “shitty” or low-quality company and later made it to FAANG or just built a solid career overall?Would appreciate hearing some success stories or perspective from people who’ve been in a similar spot.",

Obviously, job hunting is a numbers game, and there's a random element to it. But I genuinely haven't had a **single** organic interview during this entire period. Even some years ago, when I was unemployed for an extended period like this, I was still able to land an interview every month or so.For context, I have over 6 years of professional experience and a background in React, JavaScript + TypeScript, Python, and more. These are, no doubt, heavily crowded tech stacks in the market right now. Additionally, I used the phrase \"organic interview\" earlier, since I did have a few interviews early in my job search, but only after reaching out to some old connections about openings at their companies. None of those interviews led to anything.These past 8 months (with some breaks in between days/weeks), I've applied to over 600 openings and tried what feels like everything. I've rewritten my resume about 6 times, and at one point even hired a professional resume-writing service to tailor my resume to my background and target roles. But still nothing.I'm just so lost at this point in terms of what to do now. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd greatly appreciate it. So far I've tried:* Rewriting my resume multiple times, improving keyword targeting, human & ATS readability, and quantifiable career achievements.* Revamping my LinkedIn profile multiple times.* Optimizing my portfolio multiple times.* Applying to jobs on niche job boards and common job boards like Indeed, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor.* Applying to jobs at different times of the day and week.* Reaching out to CTOs, CEOs, or Hiring Managers of the companies I'm applying to.* Applying for jobs with salaries well below market value.* Using various filtering options to target jobs posted within minutes, hours, days, or at most weeks.",

Formally, I am now a SWE 2 with 3 YOE as SWE, but in terms of code complexity I've never really been tasked with complex implementations, only very simple stuff (simple customer bugs/CICD stuff), and it's been affecting my performance reviews, as my development skills have clearly atrophied. I've never gotten a formal onboarding into my SWE role and it's been rough trying to understand the codebase (product is older than me). I have been exploring an out (low pay here so I want to leave), but my resume is not getting hits and I am assuming it's because my bullet points aren't exactly \"wow, we should hire this guy,\" due to the nature of my career development here. I've changed the title of the first job to SDET instead of QA since that was the nature of my job.The tech stack is pure Java (no Spring or anything), but it's rare to even have tasks where I'm actively implementing Java code; due to my nature of swapping from QA to SWE, I end up doing things like working on Jenkins stuff or writing Python to improve pipelines/QA tasks, etc.I've tried reaching out for more development-related tasks but it doesn't result in any learning opportunities (\"it'd be better to assign this to (other SWEs on team) and it'll be done faster\" or I'll genuinely have no idea how to even approach a task) and I'm usually shuffled off to do more automation/non-development work. On the offchance I do get a development related task and I have questions, I try to ask to further grow my understanding but what usually ends up happening is that they just end up implementing it for me, or the task gets broken apart and suddenly it's a 3 line PR from me, while the actual higher complexities of the original task is assigned elsewhere.I am working on the leetcode grind, I tend to solve most easies and can handle mediums generally (just rusty with some DSA). I do have a CS degree from a mid tier UC. I am just wondering if my career is fucked (I am <30 lol so this is probably an overexaggeration but with the current state of hiring I feel like I'm falling behind hard) or it's a skill issue by me (imposter syndrome? not smart enough to learn the codebase? others formally hired as SWE with similar YOE seem to be doing amazing) or any words of advice. It really feels like I should've left a couple of years ago, since now I feel stuck in a way where I just have multiple chunks of entry-level SWE experience, and I'm not sure how to proceed.",

The product would be a web-app; there will be an AI agent and quite a few dynamic dashboards with user data. The AI Agent will provide insights and suggestions from the data among other things.The issue is, they just revealed their plan for the frontend: WordPress + Elementor. They think because they are building the \"site\" in WordPress, they are handling the frontend.The product requires:* Complex Data Ingestion: Parsing fragile PDFs and CSVs from automated emails* OAuth Integration: Securely connecting to Gmail/Outlook APIs.* AI EngineWordPress can't handle a dynamic SaaS dashboard. I’m effectively having to build a \"Custom Backend\" that does 95% of the heavy lifting, including the API bridges to make their WordPress site even function.**Their proposed workload for me is insane...

Am I overreacting, or is 20% equity for a solo dev building a complex AI data pipeline and a custom backend way too low? Especially when the \"frontend assistance\" is just a marketing site?TL;DR: Only dev on the team. Founders doing marketing/WordPress. I'm building a custom AI engine + data parsers for 20% equity. Does this sound like a fair split, or am I being used as cheap labor for their \"idea\"?I feel like I'm being taken advantage of and don't know how to navigate this discussion",

He answered that the platform was complete, and I answered that the pieces we needed would not be complete until next year.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I’m asking mostly out of curiosity and to get a sense of how things look from inside the industry today.I used to be a software developer in Seattle about ten years ago. I worked in the field for roughly two years before deciding to switch careers and move on to something else. I’ve been out of tech for a long time now, but I still loosely follow what’s going on. Watching the wave of layoffs since 2022, one thing I’ve been wondering about is whether they disproportionately affected people who entered tech through coding bootcamps during the 2015 to 2021 boom. Back when I was around, bootcamps were just starting to become a thing, and later they seemed to turn into a very common path into junior roles. From the outside, it feels like when hiring tightened, companies cut a lot of junior or surface level roles first. That made me wonder whether former bootcamp hires, especially career switchers with fewer years of deep experience, were more exposed compared to traditional CS grads or more senior engineers.I’m not trying to bash bootcamps or the people who went through them. I’m genuinely curious whether people inside companies noticed any real pattern during layoffs, or whether this is mostly selection bias and anecdotal noise.For those who stayed in tech through the last few years, did layoffs feel credential blind, or were certain backgrounds more vulnerable? Did former bootcamp grads fare worse, better, or about the same as everyone else once the market contracted? Would really appreciate perspectives from engineers, hiring managers, or anyone who went through layoffs themselves.TL;DR:Former software dev from Seattle, out of the industry for about 10 years. Curious whether the post-2022 layoffs hit former bootcamp hires harder than others, or if that’s just anecdotal.",

        "content": "Hello,I am here because I am in desperate need for some help. It seems like my mind has stopped functioning and I can't find a solution on my own so I really need help from wise strangers on the internet.So here goes my story: I am a 34 years old man (birthday in about a week from now). I was born and raised in a third world country. I completed my BS in CS in 2013 and I have worked as a software dev until 2019 when I started my own business (not related to tech) so I kinda gave up on my career.My business was doing good and everything was fine until in 2025, I moved to the US. My family is here and I was alone back in my country so it made sense to move here. I thought I could keep my business running remotely but unfortunately, due to some issues I couldn't and it all came crashing down.Now, I dont have anything. I no longer have a career to get a job in IT here nor do I have a business to support me. I am also in $19K of debt. I have started working an odd job to survive here which pays $19/hour but I am even unable to meet my basic need as I need to pay the rent here. I am unable to find a job with better pay. My resume is a disaster.I desperately need to revive my career but I don't know how. I was a .NET (C#) dev back then and I use to work on MVC & Web forms projects. I also use to make REST & SOAP APIs. I did dabble in a little bit of [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) core too. I used to work on MS SQL too.I asked ChatGPT and it recommened to start with Azure cloud as I can leverage my background in .NET & C#. Although I have no experience in cloud, do you think it is a wise suggestion? I have started prepping for AZ900 (which I know, doesnt help in securing a job as its just fundamentals but its a necessary step to cloud). Its been so long since I coded that I have forgotten almost everything about it.Or should I look into AI and Data Science stuff? Feels complicated but since there is all the hype about it and how AI is the future, I am not sure. I was never good at maths so I am not sure if I will be able to grasp it.So can anyone of you please help me in guiding towards a path (in detail please if possible) where I can potentially have a financially stable life? I have always been a hard worker and have been praised for my work ethics, even in the odd job here. So I know with a little bit of help, I can rise again.Right now, I feel broken. I have nothing to show for 34 years of my life. All my friends/ex-colleagues have good careers and are married, have their own house, cars, kids and living a stable (or close to it) life. I can't go back to my country as there is absolutely nothing there for me and I am finding it extremely hard to survive here. After bills, I dont have enough money for basic groceries here. I had a comfortable life back home and was earning well and never had a physical/laborious job in my life. Here I am working 12 hours shift as a warehouse worker. I dont mind it but it feels like I am wasting away my life.I am sorry if my post looks like I am looking for pity. I am not. Its just that I do not have anyone to talk to about this and I am not in a good state of mind right now.Thank you for taking the time to read this and I would really appreciate your help.TLDR: .NET dev who abandoned his career in 2019, is now looking to go back to his career in tech and asking for the correct path.",

        "content": "TL;DR: Am I overthinking or just fine? Do small companies do leetcode or just \"can you code without breaking prod\"? Is 2.5k USD okay for \"Senior C# SQL Developer Remote Latam\"?Context: 10 years coding as hobbyist (not for companies). Got a couple projects in production making some extra cash monthly. Moved from Venezuela, trying to enter IT industry now. (I know, sounds crazy)I'm clearly not a junior, but not really a senior either. I tried CS in 2011, quit due Venezuela chaos, went self-taught while working to survive.Applied as Full Stack .NET Software Engineer (9 years .NET doing: CLI apps, Worker Services, Web APIs, Blazor Server/WASM, even a bit of IoT with ESP32). My main project has been online for 8 years straight, niche market, but no scaling budget (that's why I'm looking for job).Is it a mistake applying as Full Stack SE .NET? Should I stick to backend and mention Blazor as skill instead? My projects uses Blazor for FE but I see almost 0 offers for Blazor out there.I tried 30 applications last week, got 1 interview tomorrow for a small US company that needs a \"Senior C# SQL Developer\", remote, 2.5k/month (I'd happily take it as first professional job).They want: Sr C#/SQL, Azure is a plus, good English required.EFSET says I'm C1/C2 but honestly I'm not sure, never took any courses in my life, yet I've spoken with some friends via discord and they understood me just fine so I guess I'm going to be fine here.I know the Azure basics (Key Vault, VMs, Azure SQL with Entra ID). No certs yet.But I fear I'll fail the technical interview because it's been years since I solved any DSA/leetcode, never worked with real distributed systems in my life. I've built my apps with layered architecture, used EF Core, handled race conditions with semaphores, but never touched Kafka/RabbitMQ/CQRS in production and my projects never hit 1k users. Handled JWT for auth most times and my own auth system as I never hit so many users.So... my question: Does a small company paying 2.5k remote really expect leetcode mastery? Or maybe just \"can you build features and not break things and pass the following basic DSA excercises\"?Also: Should I switch to Backend only and keep Blazor as skill? Feel like I wasted 3 years learning Blazor instead of React/Angular since jobs are rare to find with Blazor. Maybe I get better or more offers with C# only and not look like a jack of all trades, master of none.I want to enter the industry and once inside, keep building my skills and finally try to apply for better positions after some years. I can live with 2.5k USD a month for some years.What should I expect in technical interview? What to refresh today?Thank you for readng! I tried to summarize it all with AI, btw I'm trying to use AI to help me when I get stuck and it has been useful to be honest. I have no idea if mentioning the use of it is a problem when applying.",

I understand the market is tough right now but regardless, getting hired as fast as possible is what I'm aiming here, while still focusing on something that interests me.Despite mentioning system development, I know that stuff is way too advanced to have as a first job/internship, so in reality I'm struggling between the 2 other options.I've seen opportunities for internships in cybersec in my country, but most people say that the path in this career is way longer and the ideal is to start as a helpdesk and get experience and whatnot, so I'm kind of at a loss on what to do.For the purposes of getting employed, should I just focus on backend tech stacks or trying the cybersec route would be worthy it, too? And if I do pick up back end, could I transition to sec in the future? Would that be viable?Just as an added info: I'm not trying to \"get rich quick\" here. As fast as possible depends on how much time I have available to study and how much effort I put and it could be a long time, I get it. The questions I'm asking are just to have a better grasp of the career paths in the bigger picture. Thanks for the help.",

        "content": "I’ve had a bit of job instability over the last few years and I'm looking for perspective on switching from remote back to in-person.- 2020-2024: Worked at a large company. After the pandemic... it fluctuated between 100% remote and hybrid. Every time I went fully remote, I eventually hated it. I felt purposeless, like I had a \"fake job,\" and struggled with the lack of structure (I’ve discussed this extensively in therapy).- Last Year: Worked a 1-year stint for a government contractor (hybrid). This worked fairly well for me mentally. I actually did a lot of work on remote days, but from a closer office just to focus. But the contract folded over the summer due to budget cuts (DOGE), forcing me to find a new job quickly. Some other parts of the job didn't quite work...it was a far commute in particular.- Current Role (6 months): I joined a smaller \"boutique\" government contracting firm. It’s 100% remote, and the same bad feelings have returned. On top of the isolation, the environment is toxic, disorganized, and the codebase is chaotic. But after the shakeup last summer with contracting work, I felt desperate. I’m looking again and have landed 5 interviews, mostly focusing on in-person or hybrid roles. Mostly SCIF work in the government contracting world...but the front-runner is a role 20 minutes from my house with core hours of 10am–2pm. They seem really modern, use Svelte and more prototyping stuff, but just the nature of it can't be remote. Where I'm at rn, I mean...it's really not working out, and I have the experience to know and see these are some bad managers and work environment...even outside of it being remote. I feel at odds. My mental health and history tell me I need to be in the office (or at least hybrid) to feel purposeful and get out of the house. But now that it's becoming real, I’m worried I’m going to miss the freedom of remote work once it's gone.Also planning to push for more money. I currently make around $170k TC. I'm gonna push more for $200k-$220k. Security clearance work and being only on-site, I think could justify it. They don't really know my situation that I don't like remote and could use it to my advantage I feel.I don't have an offer in-hand but...I can read the signs one of these 5 will come through at least.Has anyone else here realized they just can't do remote work? Did you regret going back to the office, or did the structure help you?",

I was accepted into OMSCS last year but I withdrew because I thought if I just applied like crazy I'd be able to get a job. Well here I am with no CS job still after a year. The main thing that bothers me about OMSCS is the time commitment with how bad the job market is. I've seen several people who still can't get a job even after doing OMSCS which really makes me question if it's worth it.I recently made another post where I said I was considering going back to university to try and get a bachelors from a more respected university. I've heard several people say they completely blacklist WGU grads so that's why I'm concerned with just having it on my resume. Idk what I'm going to do honestly, I'm an older adult and it feels like I've done a lot of work for nothing but at the same time I don't want to go into another field.

I ask \\*how\\*I've grown a lot in this career, I know how to push back and assert myself. I've come to expect companies to ramp up pressure (even without deadlines, just constantly hammering with wanting something ASAP). I've come to expect tech debt to keep climbing unless I sneak it in here and there on other tickets.But I guess I am tired of it?I'm trying to \"not care\" but I just won't? I want to do a good job and write good code. So abandoning that and putting out lackluster results both scares me and feels like a betrayal to my core needs as a person. Plus it feels so reckless when I know that pressure will just end up with my colleagues instead of me. Or I worry that I'll come off badly to the customer (despite assurances from my manager that I'm very good at what I do and that I'm valued). And I KNOW that companies play ball this way, with manipulating emotions for benefit. I KNOW it's fascist bs...I just don't know what to do anymore about it.I dunno... I've also never quit without prospects lined up. I'm interviewing, people contact me without me needing to reach out and that's cool... But to be brutally honest, I am not sure if I should stick in this career if I can't figure out how to \"not care\" enough to resolve this pressure problem.Esp with all this AI bullshit... I feel it has gotten esp worse with that. I've done my part to communicate the problems and have been grateful my colleagues express similar concerns... It feels good to reclaim some power and remind them (and me) that you don't have to accept this BS and that if you can push back on it then you absolutely can and should.But it's hard despite that not to unsee the writing on the wall and not feel like I'm wanted... Because if places were willing to ship slop and horrific tech debt into prod before, now they can just do it for free. And now one of our customers wants a discount if the engineers don't use AI in their daily workflow. Like... that's a sinking ship for sure, and I worry it's not the only place working that way.Anyone have some advice on this?Or am I in denial, and maybe dropping out is the best choice atm?Trying to identify maybe where I am seeing this in black and white, because there are plenty of people doing fine in this industry too, and I don't want to doompost because it may not be helpful. Most of the assignments I have had have been with larger private companies, which has me wondering if a smaller private company or government job would have less pressure and be a better fit?I am in Europe, and I have savings...so not really worried financially. But my mental health is far far far more urgent and suspect I've hit burnout (or will soon).",

I have an associate's degree from a community college, and some 4 year university for a mechanical engineering before I ran out of money. I got an insanely lucky break at a small startup anyway for roughly 6 years, then a year at an enterprise position. Both of them remote which is insanely lucky because I live in south PA, hours away from most tech centers. I should have saved up and moved but I was making pretty below average pay so it never really added up. Plus family things kept me rooted where I am. I should have jumped ship from my job sooner but I thought all the experience would look better rather then job hopping. I also had a weird sense of loyalty since they took me on without a bachelors in the first place. The stupid part is I was trying to save up to return to college at that enterprise job but then I was laid off. That was a year ago. I got an entry level helpdesk position at an old job for about half the pay I was making and I've been trapped here ever since. I got maybe 8 interviews total last year and half of them the companies disappeared overnight. The other half went with what unicorns I assume the market is oversaturated with now. At least that's what it felt like.At this point I am at a loss of what to do. I've been up and down the existential nightmare of the AI hype and have safely arrived at the \"it's a tool nothing more\" stance but it feels like it's going to be another couple years before CEOs recognize this. I know most of this thread is in the same boat dealing with that aftermath. But what do I do in the meantime? I get small one off \"maintenance\" with my old company's software I play up a bit on my resume and I'm \"technically\" still registered with them but I feel like it's hurting more then helping. I only play it up because I was under the impression it's much harder to get hired in software if you haven't been doing it recently. If I say I've been doing 99% tech support for the past year that makes it sound like I'm not even an engineer anymore. I had a recruiter straight up ask me \"why'd you leave to do tech support instead\" like I did this on purpose. It's demeaning. It's not that I mind IT but I don't have the certs to move up in it, and I always wanted to build software for a living. It's part of the reason I started having trouble with my bachelor's degree originally, because I wanted to change trajectory and it ended up being too expensive to.I have a handful of active personal projects, including a rust library, a game engine, and a joint one with a dev friend I've been working on that's more of a SaaS. I feel like entrepreneurship might be my only hope at this point but I don't consider myself business brained, nor do I necessarily consider myself a designer. Even my system design is probably just mediocre at best. I feel gross using AI to churn out slop. I am trying to figure out a way to use it productively like i know peers of mine manage without feeling like I'm building on top of popsicle sticks. I think I'm better then AI but by how much i couldn't tell you.Anyway I know this is a bit of a sad sap ramble but really it comes down to income. I love software development, I've been doing it since I was a kid, but I also need money. I have mouths to feed and a mortgage and entry level jobs aren't cutting it. My credit card is almost maxed out and the interest is enough I can never pay it off. I'm hoping the answer isn't just to take up a trade like my dad and father in law did. I always felt like software is what I'm meant to do and it kills me that I can't make it happen anymore. If I could even just get some gigs like the good ol days I could hunker down until the economy corrects, but the gig market is basically dead from what I've found. And I haven't had a single bite on Fiver/Upwork. What would you do in my situation?",

        "content": "I’m in a bit of a weird spot and could use some perspective.I’ve been with my current department for a while—I interned here for three separate stints (about 20 months total) and have been full-time as a Junior SWE for exactly one year. Because of my history with the company (basically rotating between teams in my department), I’ve had the chance to touch basically everything: Frontend, Backend, Databases, Devops pipelines, K8s/containers, Cloud infrastructure, AuthN/AuthZ, API gateways/reverse proxies, and Messaging (Pub/sub). I’ve become the \"jack of all trades\" in our department.Management is now aggressively pushing me toward a Tech Lead/Lead developer role. They want me focused on unblocking other developers, guiding engineers, and handling the \"big picture\" stuff. This would drastically reduce my time \"in the trenches\" where I'm basically delegating the day to day stuff.The issue is that I’m already losing my time to code. My typical day now includes: mentoring other junior developers/interns, discussing integration points with other systems, stakeholder meetings with my EM, sprint planning, and removing blockers for other engineers - for example, getting our authN/authZ infra setup or API routes design done so that implementation can begin on a new module.I’ve only been coding seriously for 5–6 years (including personal projects and my college degree) and only have \\~2 years of \"professional\" industry experience. I feel like it is **way too early** to stop being an Individual Contributor (IC). I want to experience being a \"Senior dev\" and build true deep technical expertise. Basically I foresee my career moving towards the \"IC\" path rather than the \"EM\" one.Even worse, I’m starting to feel anxious (like I'm not ready for this step up) and feel like a fraud. Because I’ve been a generalist, I look at our dedicated Backend engineers and realize they are better at their jobs than I am. They have depth I don't have in terms of programming and db design.Has anyone else been fast-tracked like this and am I right to think that \\~2 years of experience is too shallow for a Tech Lead role?",

        "content": "I am panicking about my future because opportunities seem so tight these days, and I think it is unfair. Here is my story. I am a 23-year-old software developer from a third world country. I graduated from a top university with a good GPA (3.9/4) in 2024. I interned at two machine learning software companies before I graduated. I also took an interest in LeetCode problems and solved over 1000 of them. Now I work for a mid-tier trading firm as an Odoo developer with a not-so-great salary. I was brought up in a family where math was considered very essential for a good career. As a result, I am good at math. My high school science fair projects were often applications of machine learning I discovered independently. I wrote a bunch of manuscripts on math topics throughout high school and college. This is all to say I am passionate about math, and being good at it is really a core part of my identity. I feel like I have an advantage here. Not many people identify as a \"math person,\" whereas I prefer jobs where I can do more math. My educational background is good enough, and I have an okay history of work experience. The reality is I am earning less than $1/hr, and better-paying entry-level jobs are impossible to find these days. The worst part is I am not doing something as meaningful as I want. I despise this phase of mediocrity, but I don't know what to do about it. I feel like a failure because people (including me) expected I would be in a good position in life by now, but I am nowhere near there. The point of the post is that I am lost. Maybe I was wrong about my expectations, and I invested too much in a skill that is no longer as relevant. So I am curious what people suggest I should explore with my skill set. PS: Academia is not an obvious choice for me because it doesn't pay remotely well where I live, and I am applying for opportunities abroad, though that also seems a long shot. There are not many open positions for software developers other than web developers here so I am open (prefer) remote roles.",

Plus, you can’t really afford to in this economy.I’m a self-taught developer. I have a bachelor’s degree but it’s not technical. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. I obtained a marketing degree because, to be honest, I didn’t know what I wanted to do at the time.I realize that technology moves fast, and going back to school will likely slow me down. Most of the stuff taught at school is theoretical. And, as far as the practical stuff goes, that will essentially be useless by the time one graduates.Still, I feel like there’s a big gap of knowledge that I’m missing. Especially foundational stuff like how operating systems work, how compilers work, and computer architecture. I also feel like I’m missing a lot of math as well.Ultimately, I’d like to become a ai systems architect. One who knows not only how to strategically implement ai models, but also how to create the models and teach them.If i were to go back to school, I’s likely wouldn’t be able to just jump into a masters program. I’d need to end up taking a bridge program. I’d likely apply to a post bacc cs program, like OSU. And then, a few years down the road, if things go well, enroll in Georgia Tech and earn a masters program emphasized in machine learning.Ultimately, im wondering if this is a good idea or just a waste of time and money. Considering how much material is out there, it might be better off just teaching myself these things. Yes, it’ll take longer and it’ll be unstructured, but, I’d be saving money, I’d be able to upgrade myself with hands-on on practical skills, I’d get more hands-on experience while making money, and let’s be honest, I’d be able to have more of a social life (which i could use right about now).But, what fears me is the slight chance that not having any technical degree will prevent me from leveling up as an engineer. Obviously I know there are certain fields which almost certainly require an advanced technical degree like robotics or self-automation engineering and ml research. But I’m not too interested in those fields. What i am interested is backend development, cloud infrastructure, systems architecture, applied machine learning (maybe), and maybe dabble in cybersecurity.Sorry for the long post, but it’s just something that’s been lingering in my mind these past couple weeks. And, yes, i do know how fortunate i am to still have a job. Thank you. Wish u guys all the best",

They also highlight my language proficiency (ok?) and that they need someone to join interviews in place of their developers. I honestly don't get this scam... Why would they have a developer working on the technical part and have someone else join the meetings for them? How am I supposed to answer questions and update my statuses on daily meetings if I'm not the one doing the job? They say the job is:\"• You act as the official contractor and client-facing representative• My team handles all technical execution and delivery • Together, we unlock higher-paying roles, repeat engagements, and sustainable long-term outcomes\"All very generic but anyway, I love how they stress in the email how this is \"not illegal and not a workaround of any kind\", but it definitely feels very illegal to me.What are they after? Do they actually \"hire\" people? Sounds like impersonation to me, and like you could get really in trouble for that if you were to actually \"work\" like that.",

For background, I work in a remote marketing company in the US that pays 18 dollars an hour that has been a bizarre experience (in a very bad way). They fired their employee that trained me right before they offered a paid position too. Probably not a coincidence.My work expectations went from conducting audits for social media accounts with Excel and Python (in the first week) to doing a ton of stuff that does not involve coding. I am now expected to manage all 52 of their social media accounts. I have to edit and add captions to videos along with scheduling them, coming up with titles, descriptions, hashtags, tagging people, thumbnail design, etc. I have to be tech support and solve every tech problem they have. I have to manage their database and answer some of their client’s phone calls too regarding whatever questions they have. I am now expected to be their project coordinator too.Regarding coding related things, they want me to automate employees’ entire workflow, be a cybersecurity expert, design user interfaces, automate website creation for clients, and build AI agents. I do not have the experience, knowledge, or time to do many of these tasks and despite trying to explain these concerns to my employer, it goes on deaf ears as “it’s critical for the company as clients come first.” I only have so much time out the day to do things. It gets worse though.I am expected to attend the employer’s conferences they host or attend for hours of my weekend for free and they keep handing me entrepreneurial books that I have to read on my own time (I spark noted all of them) and then I have to join their book club for those books. I am getting messaged on night after working hours constantly inquiring about various tasks too.There is excessive micromanagement in my opinion that just makes my life miserable. I am expected to give a detailed report every hour (yes, every hour) on what work I’ve done, what work I’m currently doing, the work I have remaining and it’s ETA, what setbacks I’ve had, and proposed solutions. At the end of the day, I’m expected to give a report on what I’ve learned for the day. I also have keep time of every task I have done. There are constant impromptu meetings asking all of this information above along with the fact that we have a Jira like website that has this information already which makes it insanely redundant.What is the craziness level here? Have any of you experienced this before? This does not seem normal to me whatsoever.EDIT - I am the only tech worker in the company.",

A few months ago my company sent out an anonymous survey, that asked the typical stuff like on a 1-5 scale do you feel fairly compensated for your work, do you feel there is plenty of career opportunities at the company, do you feel there is enough resources/people to complete tasks, I approve of my direct manager, etc. I remember looking into the survey at the time and I was pretty confident at the time that it was anonymous, not that I really had anything to worry about if it wasn't as I didn't have any scathing reviews or anything. I don't think I'd face blowback for my responses. We had a decent response rate of about 80% in our dept from what I recall.Fast foward couple of months to last week, my direct manager sent out an email to me and all the devs under him (not the entire dept and not everyone who is under him but just us devs) asking us to reply with our 1-5 rates for *some* of the questions we were already asked on the original survey. I missed this email, so he called me on teams today to ask me for my response. I was a bit bewildered, so I asked him directly, are my responses I'm giving you anonymous and why are we being asked the same survey questions we were already asked? He said the responses are anonymous as he'd take my 1-5 rating and just average it out with everyone else's and give that average back up the chain of command. He added that the call we were on isn't being recorded and that the reason why he's asking these is because he was asked by HR and people higher up the totem pole to reask these questions again.Some of the questions he asked was about being paid fairly, or do I find it easy to work with other people from other departments. That kind of stuff.Now I like my manager. I think he's an honest guy that I could grab a beer with. I don't think he'd lie to me, but I'm pretty bewildered why HR and higher-ups would want us to re-answer the same questions we already answered and now for the data to be collected by role and who the direct report is.I didn't give any answer that I think would cause blowback to me, but I'm not sure what to make of this.",
