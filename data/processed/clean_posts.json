        "content": "Recently interviewed at DoorDash. Onsite had 4 rounds System Design, Data Modeling, Business Partner and Leadership The recruiter who had reached out regarding the role had transferred my profile to other recruiter at onsite process. This new recruiter , not friendly. In a cold email said that I should book time on her calendar for a prep call. Well there was not a single slot available for next 3 weeks. I kept checking for couple of days and finally found one. On the day of call she rescheduled for different time. On the call read the same pdf that she had shared with me over the email on what to expect. Not a great conversation. I’ve met really good recruiters who are friendly enough. System Design question - question was quite big 6-7 lines. I’ll put it in simple words - Design DataBricks! Yes, you read it right! Interviewer was interested in knowing how will I write exact YAML code for this. I was able to answer all his questions.Data Modeling - Design fitness app. But the interviewer wanted me to draw visualizations. Well never in my past 8 years of work experience I had to do any visualizations but looks like DE in DoorDash work on visualizations as well. It wasn’t a basic graph , some advanced trend graph. Business Partner - DoorDash expanding business how will you go about it etc. basic questions interviewer also seem to be onboarded on the approachesLeadership - Hiring Manager joined 2-3 minutes late. Didn’t bother to apologize. I ignored that and continued to talk with my positive energy. He said he will leave 10 minutes at the end for me to ask any questions. Questions were normal tell me about the time kind. Situation based. I answered all. He had multiple follow up questions. Kept asking something from the list. It was almost 5 minutes to end the meeting and then he stopped and started sharing about the team. Even here he didn’t ask if I have any questions. I had to ask him when we were at time if I can ask couple of questions. I felt like I performed well.Next day morning Recruiter’s cold email came in that team has not decided to move forward. Happy to answer any questions anyone has.",

        "content": "Hi all,I wasn't planning to share my article here. But Only this week, I had 3 conversations this week wit fairly senior data engineers who see AI as a thread. Here's what I usually see:* Annoyed because they have to support AI enigneers (yet feel unseen)* Affraid because don't know if they may lose their job in a restructure* Want to navigate in \"the new world\" and have no idea where to startHere's the essence, so you don't need to read the whole thingAI engineering is largely data engineering with new buzzwords and probabalistic transformations. Here's a quick map:* **LLM = The Logic Engine.** This is the component that processes the data.* **Prompt = The Input.** This is literally the query or the parameter you are feeding into the engine.* **Embeddings = The Feature.** This is classic feature engineering. You are taking unstructured text and turning it into a vector (a list of numbers) so the system can perform math on it.* **Vector Database = The Storage.** That's the indexing and storage layer for those feature vectors.* **RAG = The Context.** Retrieval step. You’re pulling relevant data to give the logic engine the context it needs to answer correctly.* **Agent = The System.** This is the orchestration layer. It’s what wraps the engine, the storage, and the inputs into a functional workflow.2Don't let the \"AI\" label intimidate you. The infrastructure challenges, are the same ones we’ve been dealing with for years. The names have just changed to make it sound more revolutionary than it actually is.I hope this will help so of you.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’ve been in FAANG for about 5 years now, across multiple teams and orgs (new data teams, SDE-heavy teams, BI-heavy teams, large and small setups), and one thing that’s consistently surprised me is how little classic data modeling I’ve actually seen applied in practice.When I joined as a junior/intern, I expected things like proper dimensional modeling, careful handling of changing business meaning, SCD Type 2 being a common pattern, and shared dimensions that teams actually align on — but in reality most teams seem extremely execution-focused, with the job dominated by pipelines, orchestration, data quality, alerts, lineage, governance, security, and infra, while modeling and design feel like maybe 5–10% of the work at most.Even at senior levels, I’ve often found that concepts like “ensuring the business meaning of a column doesn’t silently change” or why SCD2 exists aren’t universally understood or consistently applied. In tech-driven organizations it is more structured, but in business-driven organizations it's less structued (Organization I mean ±100-300 people organization).My logic is because compute and storage got so much cheapier over the years, the effort/benefit ratio is not there in as many situations. Curious what others think: have you seen the same pattern?",

        "content": "I’ve been spending time lately looking into how big tech companies use specific phrasing to mask (or highlight) their updates, especially with all the chip investment deals going on. Earlier this week, I was going through the Microsoft earnings call transcript and (based on what seems like shared sentiment in the market), I was curious how Fabric was represented. From my armchair analyst position, its adoption just doesn’t seem to line up with what I assumed would exist by now...On the recent FY26 Q2 call, Satya said:>Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric's annual revenue run rate is now over $2 billion with over 31,000 customers... revenue up 60% year over year.The first thing that made me skeptical is the type of metrics used for Fabric. “Annual revenue run rate” is NOT the same as “we actually generated $2B over the last 12 months.” This is super normal when startups report earnings, since if a product is growing, run rate can look great even when realized trailing revenue is still catching up. Microsoft chose run rate wording here.Then I looked at the previous earnings where Fabric was discussed. In FY25 Q3, they said Fabric had 21k paid customers and “40% using Real-Time Intelligence” five months after GA, but “using” isn’t defined in a way that’s tangible, which usually is telling. In last week’s earnings, Satya immediately discusses specific metrics, customer references, etc. for other products.A huge part of why I’m also not convinced on adoption is because of the forced Power BI capacity migration. I know the world is all about financial engineering, and since Microsoft forced us all to migrate off of P-SKUs, it’s not hard to advertise those numbers as great. The conspiracist in me says the numbers line up a little too neatly with the SKU migration:* $2B in revenue run rate / 31,000 customers ≈ $64.5k per customer per year. * That’s conveniently right around the published price of an F64 reservationObviously an average is oversimplifying it, and I don’t think Microsoft is lying about the metrics whatsoever, but I do think the phrasing doesn’t line up with the marketing and what my account team says…The other thing I saw was how Microsoft talks when they have deeper adoption. They normally use harder metrics like customers >$1M, big deployments, customer references, etc. In the same FY26 Q2 transcript, Fabric gets the run-rate/customer count and then the conversation moves on. And that’s it. After that, I was surprised that Fabric was never mentioned on its own again, nor expanded upon, and outside of that sentence, Fabric was always mentioned with Foundry.Earnings reports aren't everything, and 31,000 customers is a lot, so I went looking for proof in customer stories, and the majority of the stories are just implementation partners and consultancies whose practices depend on selling Fabric (Boutiques/Avanade types), not a flood of end-customer production migrations with scale numbers. (There are are a couple of enterprise stories like LSEG and Microsoft’s internal team, but it doesn’t feel like “no shortage.”)Please check me. Am I off base here? Or is the growth just because of the forced migration from Power BI?",

        "author": "Lastrevio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm reading \"Spark: The Definitive\" guide and there's a part about how user defined functions in Python can be inefficient. This is the quote: \"When you use the function, there are essentially two different things that occur. If the function is written in Scala or Java, you can use it within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that there will be little performance penalty aside from the fact that you can’t take advantage of code generation capabilities that Spark has for builtin functions. There can be performance issues if you create or use a lot of objects; we cover that in the section on optimization in Chapter 19. If the function is written in Python, something quite different happens. Spark starts a Python process on the worker, serializes all of the data to a format that Python can understand (remember, it was in the JVM earlier), executes the function row by row on that data in the Python process, and then finally returns the results of the row operations to the JVM and Spark.Starting this Python process is expensive, but the real cost is in serializing the data to Python. This is costly for two reasons: it is an expensive computation, but also, after the data enters Python, Spark cannot manage the memory of the worker. This means that you could potentially cause a worker to fail if it becomes resource constrained (because both the JVM and Python are competing for memory on the same machine). We recommend that you write your UDFs in Scala or Java—the small amount of time it should take you to write the function in Scala will always yield significant speed ups, and on top of that, you can still use the function from Python!\" I heard from Reddit that this book was written a long time ago and some things may be outdated. Is this still relevant with the latest versions of Spark? Are Python UDFs still significantly slower than Scala/Java UDFs in Spark? If yes, have you ever encountered a situation at work where someone actually wrote a UDF in Scala or Java and avoided using Python for the sake of performance increases?",

Which downstream dashboards break Table-level lineage says \"everything connected to this table\" (useless, 200 false positives). Column-level says \"these 3 specific dashboard fields\", which is actually helpful.**What didn't work****My first attempt: Regex parsing SQL**Wrote a bunch of regex to pull column names from SELECT statements. Worked for simple queries. Completely fell apart with CTEs, subqueries, and window functions.Example that broke it: WITH customers AS (   SELECT      c.id as customer_key,     c.email as contact_email   FROM raw.customers c ) SELECT customer_key, contact_email FROM customersMy regex couldn't track that customer\\_key came from c.id. I gave up after 2 weeks.**My 2nd attempt: Query INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA only**Thought we could just use Snowflake's metadata tables to see column relationships. **Nope**. INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA tells you schemas exist, not how data flows through queries.I found success by parsing SQL properly with an actual parser, not regex. I used sqlparse for Python but JSQLParser works if you live in Java world.Query Snowflake's QUERY\\_HISTORY view, parse every SELECT/INSERT/CREATE TABLE AS statement, build a graph of column → column relationships.**The architecture** Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY    ↓ Extract SQL (last 7 days of queries)   ↓ SQL Parser (sqlparse)   ↓ Column Mapper (track renames/transforms)   ↓ Graph DB (Neo4j) + Search (Elasticsearch) import sqlparse from snowflake.connector import connect # Pull recent queries queries = snowflake.execute(\"\"\"   SELECT query_text    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY    WHERE query_type IN ('SELECT', 'INSERT', 'CREATE_TABLE_AS_SELECT')   AND start_time > DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) \"\"\") for query_text in queries:     parsed = sqlparse.parse(query_text)[0]          # Extract SELECT columns     select_cols = extract_columns(parsed)          # Extract FROM tables and resolve schemas     source_tables = extract_tables(parsed)          # Handle SELECT * by querying schema     if has_star_select(select_cols):         select_cols = resolve_star_expressions(source_tables)          # Build edges: source_col -> output_col     for output_col in select_cols:         for input_col in output_col.dependencies:             graph.add_edge(                 from_col=f\"{input_col.table}.{input_col.name}\",                 to_col=f\"{output_col.table}.{output_col.name}\",                 transform_type=output_col.transform             )**Some issues I ran into****1. SELECT \\* resolution**When you see SELECT \\* FROM customers JOIN orders, you need to know what columns exist in both tables at query execution time. Can't parse this statically.The solution is to Query INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA.COLUMNS to get table schemas, then expand \\* to the actual column list.**2. Column aliasing chains** SELECT    customer_id as c_id,   c_id as cust_id,  -- references the alias above   cust_id as final_idYou have to track the alias chain through the entire query. The symbol table gets really messy really fast.**3. Subqueries and CTEs**Each level of nesting creates a new namespace. The parser needs to track which customer\\_id is which when you have 3 nested CTEs all selecting customer\\_id.**4. Window functions and aggregates**SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY customer\\_id) means the output column depends on revenue (for the calculation) and customer\\_id (for the partition), but differently.Your lineage graph needs different edge types: \"aggregates,\" \"partitions\\_by,\" \"direct\\_reference.\"**Performance at 50K tables**Parsing 7 days of query history (about 500K queries): 2 hours Storage: Neo4j graph (200M edges), Elasticsearch (column name search) Query time: \"Show me everything downstream of this column\" = sub-2 seconds Query time: \"Where is customer\\_id used?\" = sub-1 secondTo save yourself a future headache, save the 20% of lineage paths that get queried 80% of the time.**What I’m still struggle with**Cross-warehouse lineage. My data flows Snowflake → Databricks → back to Snowflake. This approach only sees the Snowflake side.Real-time updates. I run lineage extraction every 6 hours. If someone on my team changes a column and immediately asks \"what breaks?\", they get stale data.ML pipelines. Notebooks that do df.select(\"customer\\_id\") don't show up in Snowflake query logs. That’s a blind spot.What's your current table count? Curious where others hit the breaking point. Sorry for the wall of text!",

What’s an acceptable boundary to have with your employee?To me it seems like a duct tape fix for other problems. If things are breaking so much you want an on call, maybe you need to reevaluate your software lifecycle process.

Apache Arrow It's the technology you didn’t even know you loved. It’s how Streamlit improved load speed, how DataFusion moves DataFrames around, and the memory model behind Polars. Now it has its own SQL protocol with Flight SQL and database drivers via ADBC. The idea of Arrow as the standard for data interoperability feels inevitable. DuckDB I was so late to DuckDB that it’s a little embarrassing. At first, I thought it was mostly useful for data apps and lambda functions. Boy was I was wrong. The SQL syntax, the extensions, the ease of use, the seamless switch between in-memory and local persistence…and DuckLake. Like many before me, I fell for what DuckDB can do. It feels like magic. Postgres I used to roll my eyes every time I read “Just use Postgres.” in the comments section. I had it pegged as a transactional database for software apps. After working with DuckLake, Supabase, and most recently ADBC, I get it now. Postgres can do almost anything, including serious analytics. As Mimoune Djouallah put it recently, “PostgreSQL is not an OLTP database, it’s a freaking data platform.” Python Where would analytics, data science, machine learning, deep learning, data platforms and AI engineering be without Python? Can you honestly imagine a data world where it doesn’t exist? I can’t. For that reason alone it will always have a spot on my Mount Rushmore. 4 EVA.

        "author": "seagullbreadloaf",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I'm currently working in a data science role but was thinking about making the switch to data engineering. I have a background in statistics and have been working as a data scientist in biomedical research in academia for 1.5 years. This is my first job since finishing my Masters in statistics. When I first started the job, I was responsible for cleaning datasets from clinical trials (this was 90% of the work), statistical modeling, creating visual aids like graphs and charts, and presenting and explaining my work to biologists. After 6 months, my manager told me I \"wasn't a good fit\" for the role because I \"lack curiosity\". I wouldn't say he was wrong. I didn't mind the work but it also didn't excite me and I didn't find it that fulfilling.I was transferred to a different team within the same company and my main project became writing programming scripts to automate compression of thousands of files from patient databases, and creating lookup tables containing information on all the files (such as patient identifiers, visit dates, etc.) This involved a lot of identifying and sometimes renaming files that were mislabeled, had missing information, or used different naming conventions, and make sure these edge cases were accounted for in the compression process. We also received multiple batches of files from different sources, and I had to modify the scripts to account for all the nuances between different sources. I noticed I enjoyed these projects much more and that I'm very precise and good at paying close attention to small details. I liked how expectations were more well-defined with this project and was more like \"it either works or it doesn't\", rather than the previous data science role which was much more open-ended. I feel like I do better when expectations are more structured and consistent, rather than exploratory. My new manager also noticed the new role was a much better fit for me.That being said, I'm thinking about pivoting into data engineering for my next role because I feel it may be a better fit for me. I've been looking at job postings for data engineering roles, but I don't have many of the skills required for a lot of these roles. My work so far has mainly been in R since that's what my company uses, and I've had some exposure to SQL and Python. I know Python and SQL are important in data engineering and tech is all about transferable skills, but I feel like I don't yet have the toolbox to switch to data engineering, nor do I have strong software engineering skills. I'm also not sure if I will be a strong candidate considering how competitive the job market is nowadays. My plan for now is to learn the important skills so that I'm able to make the switch.Those of you who switched from data science to data engineering, what was your experience like and how did you navigate that shift? What are the most important data engineering skills/tools I should familiarize myself with to become a competitive candidate and be ready for interviews? What are some good resources you would suggest for learning these skills/tools? And do you have any general advice for me?",

        "author": "wtfzambo",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# SOLVED: See solution a the bottomHello, I have been searching far and wide for a solution to my predicaments but I can't seem to figure it out, even with extensive help of AI.# TL;DR:I have a skewed dataset representing 9 clients. One client is roughly 10x larger than the others. I’m trying to use `repartition` to shuffle data across nodes and balance the workload, but the execution remains bottlenecked on a single task.# Details:I'm running a simple extraction + load pipeline:`Read from DB -> add columns -> write to data lake.`The data source is a bit peculiar: each client has its own independent database.The large client's data consistently lands on a single node during all phases of the job. While other nodes finish their tasks very quickly, this one \"straggler\" task bottlenecks the entire job.I attempted to redistribute the data to spread the load, but nothing seems to trigger an even shuffle. I’ve tried:* Salting the keys.* Enabling Adaptive Query Execution (AQE).* `repartition(n, \"salt_column\")` , `repartition(n, \"client_id\", \"salt\")`.* `repartition(n)`See picture:https://preview.redd.it/yo94vesrk2ig1.png?width=5030&format=png&auto=webp&s=399be044a1f8a3e9557553b97056141ed342b0b3In very short pseudocode, here is what I'm doing: data = [] for db in db_list: # Reading from 9 independent source DBs data.append( spark.read.format(\"jdbc\").option(\"db\", \"table\").load() ) df_unioned = union_all(data) df_unioned = df_unioned.sortWithinPartition(client_id) # This is where I'm stuck: df_unioned = df_unioned.repartition(100, \"salt_column\") df_unioned.write.parquet(\"path/to/lake\")Looking at the Physical Plan, I've noticed there is no `Exchange` (Shuffle) happening before the write. Despite calling `repartition`, Spark is keeping the `numPartitions=1` from the JDBC scans all the way through the `Union`, resulting in a 'one-partition-per-client' bottleneck during the write phase.Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope :(PS:A couple of extra points, maybe they're useful:\\- This data in specific is quite small, just a few gigabytes (i'm testing on a subset of the full data)\\- For the record, the repartition DOES happen: if I do \\`repartition(100)\\`, I will have 100 tiny files in the data lake. What doesn't happen is the shuffle between nodes or even cores.# SolutionIt was AQE + a later query in the job causing this. This later query, which comes after writing out to data lake, does an aggregation on the \\`client\\_id\\`. Apparently, AQE understands this and goes \"instead of doing two shuffles (1 for repartitioning and another one to aggregate) I'm just gonna do zero since the data is already partitioned by \\`client\\_id\\`\".",

If they forbid caching but my internal latency requirements are low, how aggressive can I be with caching their responses without violating contracts?* **Sharding:** For the ledger, is sharding by \"Account Id\" dangerous if we have Hot Accounts (like a central bank wallet)?What am I missing here?**Source Question:** I found this scenario on PracHub (System Design Qs).

No transformation is being done. Data is all strings, lot of null values but no huge stringsThe connection is made via a service principal, but the dataflow won’t complete a refresh because of the large table. When I check the refresh history, the three small tables are loaded successfully, but the large one gets stuck in a loop and times out after 24 hours.What’s strange is that we have other dataflows pulling much more data from different data sources without any issues. This one, however, just won’t load the 1 million row table. Given our capacity, this should be an easy task.Has anyone encountered a similar scenario?What do you think could be the issue here? Could this be a bug related to Dataflow Gen1 and the Databricks connection, possibly limiting the amount of data that can be loaded?Thanks for reading!",

        "author": "dbjan",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi! I've been to several data warehousing projects lately, built with the \"medallion\" architecture and there are a few things which make me quite disturbed.First - on all of these projects we were pushed by the \"data architect\" to use the Silver layer as a copy of the Bronze, only with SCD 2 logic on each table, leaving the original normalised table structure. No joining of tables, or other preparation of data allowed (the messy data preparation tables go to the Gold next to the star schema).Second - it was decided, that all the tables and their columns are renamed to english (from Polish), which means that now we have three databases (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different names for the same columns and tables. Now when I get a SQL script with business logic from the analyst, I need to transcribe all the table and column names to the english (Silver layer) and then implement the transformation towards Gold. Whenever there is a discussion about the data logic, or I need to go back to the analyst with a question, I need to transpose all the english table&column names back to the Polish (Bronze) again. It's time consuming. Then Gold has still different column names, as the star schema is adjusted to the reporting needs of the users.Are you also experiencing this, is this some kind of a new trend? Would't it be so much easier to leave it with the original Polish names in the Silver, since there is no change to the data anyway and the lineage would be so much cleaner?I understand the architects don't care what it takes to work with this as it's not their pain, but I don't understand that no one cares about the cost of this.. : DAlso I can see that people tend to think about the system as something developed once, not touching it afterwards. That goes completely against my experience. If the system is alive, then changes are required all the time, as the business evolves, which means the costs are heavily projecting to the future..What are your views on this? Thanks for you opinion!",

        "content": "Hello. I’d like to start by saying that this is my first time asking a question in this kind of format. If there are any mistakes, I apologize in advance. I should also mention that I have very little experience in the Data Engineering field, and I haven’t worked in an organization that has a standard or mature Data Engineering team. My knowledge mostly comes from what I studied, and for some topics it’s only at a surface level, with little real hands-on experience.I currently work in an organization that does not have sufficient resources to recruit highly skilled Data Engineering personnel, and most of the work is driven by the data analytics team. The current systems were mostly built to solve immediate, short-term problems. Because of this, I have several questions and would like to seek advice from experienced members of this community.My questions are divided into several parts, as follows:* What kind of Data Tech Stack would be most appropriate (Open Source, Cloud Services, or Hybrid)?* For a Data Orchestrator, is a code-based approach (such as Dagster or Airflow) or a GUI-based approach (such as SSIS) better in the long run, especially if the Data Engineering team needs to scale?* What roles should exist within a Data Engineering team (e.g., Lead, Infrastructure, Operational Service), or is it actually unnecessary to divide the team into sub-roles?* How should we choose Data Storage to suit each layer? Is it necessary to use newer technologies (such as Data Warehouse or Data Lakehouse), or should we choose based on the expertise of the organization’s IT department, which is likely more familiar with OLTP databases?* For a Data Dictionary, should it be embedded directly into table names for convenience, documented separately, or handled through a dedicated platform (such as DataHub)?* To comply with PDPA / security audits, should data be masked or encrypted before it reaches the data storage that the Data Engineering team has access to? And which department in the organization is typically responsible for this?* As someone who can be considered a new Data Engineer, could you please recommend skills that I should learn or further develop?Lastly, if there are any parts of my questions where I used incorrect terminology or misunderstood certain concepts, please feel free to point them out and explain. I’m still not fully confident in my understanding of this field.Thank you in advance to everyone who takes the time to share their opinions and advice. PS. English is not my native language.",

I work with dbt, Snowflake, Fivetran, Power BI and Python.Now I’m looking for new jobs because I’m very underpaid, and while I’m getting some interviews I can’t help but feel like I might be getting more if I could check the box of having a degree.I was talking to my boss the other day and he said me I should consider getting a business degree from WGU just so I could check the box, since I already have proof of having the technical skills.After looking at the classes of the IT management degree, it looks like something that I could get done faster than a CS degree by a lot, but at the same time I’m not sure if it would end up being a negative for my career because it would look like I want to do a career change, or if that time would just generally be better invested in developing my skills sans degree, or just going for the CS degree.Would it be a waste of time and money?",

I am a recent computer science graduate who started working for a large non-profit organization which is reliant upon an old, very complex, ERP system (say... a few hundred tables, hundreds of millions of records). They don't provide an API, integrations are done by directly touching the database. Each one was developed ad-hoc, as the need arose over the last 2 decades. There is some code sharing but not always. 2 integrations which ostensibly provide the same information may have small divergences in exactly how they touch the database. They are written in a mix of C# and SQL stored procedures/functions. Many of these are very complex. Stored procedures call stored procedures and inserting an entity may wind up touching 30+ tables. A lot of the time, it's required. The ERP manages finances, staff, business operations; there is a lot of conditional logic to determine what to insert, update, delete, etc.. Are there any tools or techniques that could be useful here? I'm comfortable programming, but if a tool can do a job better and more efficiently, I'd rather use it.",

        "title": "Does partitioning your data by a certain column make aggregations on that column faster in Spark?",
        "author": "Lastrevio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "If I run a query like ``df2 = df.groupBy(\"Country\").count()``, does running ``.repartition(\"Country\")`` before the groupBy make the query faster? AI is giving contradictory answers on this so I decided to ask Reddit.The book written by the creators of Spark (\"Spark: The Definitive Guide\") say that there are not too many ways to optimize an aggregation:>For the most part, there are not too many ways that you can optimize specific aggregationsbeyond filtering data before the aggregation having a sufficiently high numberof partitions. However, if you’re using RDDs, controlling exactly how these aggregationsare performed (e.g., using reduceByKey when possible over groupByKey) can bevery helpful and improve the speed and stability of your code.The way this was worded leads me to believe that a repartition (or bucketBy, or partitionBy on the physical storage) will not speed up a groupBy.This, I don't understand however. If I have a country column in a table that can take one of five values, and each country is in a seperate partition, then Spark will simply count the number of records in each partition without having to do a shuffle. This leads me to believe that repartition (or partitionBy, if you want to do it on the hard disk) will almost always speed up a groupby. So why do the authors say that there aren't many ways to optimize an aggregation? Is there something I'm missing?EDIT: To be clear, I'm of course implying that in an actual production environment you would run the .groupBy after the .repartition more than once. Otherwise, if you run a single .groupBy query, you're just moving the shuffle one step above.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "> Disclaimer: I currently work at LanceDB and have been a member of Lance's and Hugging Face's open source communities for several years.Recently, Lance became an [officially supported format](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-x-huggingface-a-new-era-of-sharing-multimodal-data/) on the Hugging Face Hub. Lance is an open source, modern, columnar lakehouse format for AI/ML datasets that include multimodal data, embeddings, nested fields, and more. LanceDB is an open source, embedded library that exposes convenient APIs on top of the Lance format to manage embeddings and indices.Check out the latest Lance datasets uploaded by the awesome OSS community here:https://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3AlanceWhat the Hugging Face integration means in practice for Lance format and LanceDB users on the Hub:- Binary assets (images, audio, videos) stored inline as blobs: No external files and pointers to manage- Efficient columnar access: Directly stream metadata from the Hub without touching heavier data (like videos) for fast exploration- Prebuilt indices can be shared alongside the data: Vector/FTS/scalar indices are packaged with the dataset, so no need to redo the work already done by others- Fast random access and scans: Lance format specializes in blazing fast random access (helps with vector search and data shuffles for training). It does so without compromising scan performance, so your large analytical queries can be run on traditional tabular data using engines like DuckDB, Spark, Ray, Trino, etc.Earlier, to share large multimodal datasets, you had to store multiple directories with binary assets + pointer URLs to the large blobs in your Parquet tables on the Hub. Once downloaded, as a user, you'd have had to recreate any vector/FTS indices on your local machine, which can be an expensive process.Now, with Lance officially supported as a format on the Hub, you can package all your datasets along with their indices as a single, shareable artifact, with familiar table semantics that work with your favourite query engine. Reuse others' work, and prepare your models for training, search and analytics/RAG with ease!It's very exciting to see the variety of Lance datasets that people [have uploaded](https://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3Alance) already on the HF Hub, feel free to share your own, and spread the word!",

        "content": "Hello all,I'm an IT undergrad who's in the middle of a data engineering internship program at a service company and I'm completely unprepared for it. For lack of a kinder way to put it, I recognize my current training + location is focused on outsourcing jobs for low pay and high turnover, typical cert mill stuff for cheap third world work, and they're not really focused on quality. Frankly, I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm having certifications and courses for cloud providers, Databricks, dbt, etc. thrown at me without guidance or feedback and I'm not really learning a thing and feel paralyzed when it comes to trying to approach any actual problems. Like, I can follow along on coursework projects, finish cert exams, and follow Databricks notebook labs, etc. but I couldn't really tell you what I'm doing or do anything without my hand held and pulling up documentation and code examples on the side for things as basic as a CSV loader. I'm not really sure how all these parts come together in a real environment either, like when one would use dbt vs spark for transformations. I don't use LLMs because I want to be able to do it myself first, but I see my peers get so far ahead with them while I haven't completed anything of note *and* I still can't say I understand any more than them.I've seen some beginner project ideas, or advice to build something relevant to my interests, but I'm honestly lost for where to start even there. I'm sorry if this is quite silly. I know there's no perfect solution, but I was wondering if there are any semi-guided project outlines or study resources anyone can recommend. Alternatively, do you think it's worth it to put a hold on the data engineering track and focus on BI analyst-focused concepts? One of my biggest concerns is not being skilled/educated enough to land or hold *any* job at all and I fear not being able to catch up in time before completing this internship.",

Legacy company, cool people, very nice atmosphere, I do well, team is good, boss values my work, no rush, no stress, you get the drift. The job itself however has become very boring. The most pleasant part of the work is unnecessary (front end) so I'm left with same stuff over and over again, pumping quite simple reports wondering if end users actually get something out of them or not. Plus the salary could be a bit higher (it's always the case) but objectively it is OK.So here I am, getting this scary thoughts that... this is it for me. That I could just coast here until I get old. I'd miss better jobs, better money, better life.SoThe most \"smooth\" transition path for me would to break into data engineering. It seems logical, probable and interesting to me. Sometimes I read what other people do as DE and I simply get jealous. It just seems way more important, more technology based, better learning experience, better salaries, and just more serious job so to speak.Hence my question..**With this new AI era is it too late to get into data engineering at this point?*** I read everywhere how hard it is to break through and change jobs now* Tech is moving forward* AI can write code in seconds that it would take me some time to learn* Juniors DE seem to be obsolete cause mids can do their job as well Seniors DE are even more efficient now**If anyone changed positions recently from BA/DA to DE I'd be thankful if you shared your experience.**Thanks",

Nodes need shared state like sessions, user creds, quotas, and proxy pool data.a. My current proposal is: each node talks only to a central internal API using a node key. That API handles all reads/writes to Redis/DB. This gives me tighter control over node onboarding, revocation, and limits blast radius if a node is ever compromised. It also avoids putting datastore credentials on every node.b. An alternative design (suggested by an LLM during architecture exploration) is letting every node connect directly to Redis for hot-path data (sessions, quotas, counters) and use it as the shared state layer, skipping the API hop. -- i didn't like the idea too much but the LLM kept defending it every time so maybe i am missin something!?! I’m trying to decide which pattern is more appropriate in practice for systems like gateways/proxies/workers: direct datastore access from each node, or API-mediated access only.Would like feedback from people who’ve run distributed production systems.",

It also accounts for [both inputs and side inputs](https://github.com/lpraat/inbq?tab=readme-ov-file#concepts).You can use inbq as a [Python library,](https://pypi.org/project/inbq/) [Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/inbq), or via its [CLI](http://github.com/lpraat/inbq?tab=readme-ov-file#command-line-interface).Feedbacks, feature requests, and contributions are welcome!",

Downstream users query Segment with event date filter, so it’s the ideal partitioning key to prune the maximum amount of data.We ingest data into Iceberg hourly. This is a read-heavy dataset, and we perform Iceberg maintenance daily. However, the rewrite data operation on a 1–10 TB Parquet Iceberg table with thousands of columns is extremely slow, as it ends up touching nearly 500 partitions. There could also be other bottlenecks involved apart from S3 I/O.Has anyone worked on something similar or faced this issue before?",

Nobody at the org has really any experience in this, so I've been tasked to look into how do we make this possible.Currently, our ADF setup uses templates that include a set of maintenance tasks such as row count checks, anomaly detection, and other general validation steps. Many of these responsibilities can be handled in dbt through tests and macros, and I’ve already implemented those pieces.What I’d like to enable is a way for every new dbt project to automatically include these generic tests and macros—essentially a shared baseline that should apply to all dbt projects. The approach I’ve found in Snowflake’s documentation involves storing these templates in a GitHub repository and referencing that repo in dbt deps so new projects can pull them in as dependencies.That said, we’ve run into an issue where the GitHub integration appears to require a username to be associated with the repository URL. It’s not yet clear whether we can supply a personal access token instead, which is something we’re currently investigating.Given that limitation, I’m wondering if there’s a better or more standard way to achieve this pattern—centrally managed, reusable dbt tests and macros that can be easily consumed by all new dbt projects.",

The source database is a production RDBMs, so ingesting RDMBS change tracking rows into bronze (append only) is going to really be valuable to the client. However, the client is aware that they won't be getting new columns automatically.We're approaching new columns like a change request. If they want them in the data platform, we need to include into bronze first, then update the model in silver and then gold.To approach it, we'd get the new field they want; include it into the ETL pipeline. We'd also have to execute a one-off pipeline that would write all records for the table into bronze where there was a non-null value for that new field as a 'change' record first.Then we turn on the ETL pipeline, and life continues on as normal and bronze is up to date with the new column.Thoughts?

        "author": "Beneficial-Flow-2105",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I built BigAsk, a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language. It’s a fairly thin wrapper over the Gemini CLI meant to address some shortcomings it has in overcoming data querying challenges organizations face.I’m a Software Engineer in infra/DevOps, but I have a few friends who work in roles where much of their time is spent fulfilling requests to fetch data from internal databases. I’ve heard it described as a “necessary evil” of their job which isn’t very fulfilling to perform. Recently, Google has released some quite capable tools with the potential to enable those without technical experience using BigQuery to explore the data themselves, both for questions intended to return exact query results, and higher-level questions about more nebulous insights that can be gleaned from data. While these certainly wouldn’t completely eliminate the need for human experts to write some queries or validate results of important ones, it seems to me like they could significantly empower many to save time and get faster answers.Unfortunately, there are some pretty big limitations to the current offerings from Google that prevent them from actually enabling this empowerment, and this project seeks to fix them.One is that the best tools are available in a limited set of interfaces. Those scattered throughout the already-lacking-in-user-friendliness BigQuery UI require some foundational BigQuery and data analysis skills to use, making their barrier to entry too high for many who could benefit from them. The most advanced features are only available in the Gemini CLI, but as a CLI, using it requires using a command-line, again putting it out-of-reach for many.The second is a lack of safe access control. There's a reason BigQuery access is typically limited to a small group. Directly authorizing access to this data via the BigQuery UI or Gemini CLI to individual users who aren't well-versed in its stewardship carries large risks of data deletion or leaks. As someone with experience working professionally with managing cloud IAM within an organization, I know that attempts to distribute permissions to individual users while maintaining a limited scope on them also requires considerable maintenance overhead and comes with it’s own set of security risks.BigAsk enables anyone within an organization to easily and securely use the most powerful agentic data analysis tools available from Google to self-serve answers to their burning questions. It addresses the problems outlined above with a user-friendly web interface, centralized access management with a recommended permissions set, and simple, lightweight code and deployment instructions that can easily be extended or customized to deploy into the constraints of an existing Google Cloud project architecture.Code here: [https://github.com/stevenwinnick/big-ask](https://github.com/stevenwinnick/big-ask)I’d love any feedback on the project, especially from anyone who works or has worked somewhere where this could be useful. This is also my first time sharing a project to online forums, and I’d value feedback on any ways I could better share my work as well.",

        "content": "I am on an integration pipeline and manage the repo for it. I inherited it and made some slight tweaks but did not make the system from scratch. Its really a one way integration between two OLTP systems where webhook from System A writes to apigw which routes to a lambda which writes to dynamo where another lambda on a schedule reads from dynamo and writes unprocessed records to System B. There's also another flow where we have a lamdba check System B to see if users have a token and if if they don't, the lambda writes them to SQS where we have another lambda batch from SQS, grab a token from System A and write them back to users in System B.Its my first real pipeline as a \"Data Engineer\" but it feels like integration engineering not DE. It gets slightly more DE related where we are landing that same webhook data into S3 and materializing it in Redshift for downstream analysis. But im not involved in the code for this part, just the SQL querying for our group's own reporting on the data. Not sure where to go for next job, I am lacking the DBT and airflow skills most DE roles require and I have these cloud skills and some IaC stuff as well to sprinkle on top of my SQL and python skills. I have been a DE title for a year now (was Senior Data Analyst at same company and did some DA/DS for a few years before that) at diff companies) and I want to change roles and make more money for my family. Not sure what jobs to shoot for or how to market myself... Event Driven DE? Not sure. Also, I'm new to reddit so forgive me if there's a better board for this. One more thing is I have been reading books like DDIA so my systems thinking is getting good but my coding skills are rotting because I'm really just trouble shooting the logs and only enriching the code maybe once a month. This post is all over the place but I just need some general guidance.",

        "content": "I started at a company a little over 3 years ago as a DE. I had previously had a solution/data architect position working in AWS but felt like I was \"missing\" something when it came to new pipeline design vs traditional warehousing. I wanted to build a Kimball model but my boss didn't want one. I took a step back and at the same time moved into a medium/large sized business from startup culture. I wanted to see their design and identify if/what I was misunderstanding. A consulting firm came in and started changing things, changing everything. I was not in these discussions because I was new and still learning the code base but the pipeline used to have 4 layers, data lake, star schema, reporting layer and finally a data warehouse layer (flat tables that combined multiple reporting tables to make it super easy for low skilled analysts to use). The consulting firm correctly said we should only have 3 layers but apparently didn't provide ANY direction or oversight. My boss responded by removing the star schema! well they technically removed it but simply merged the logic from two layers into one script... pushing the entire concept of data warehousing into the hands of individual engineers to keep straight. I wish I could describe it better but let's just say it takes experienced top level engineers months of hand holding to get straight. Anyway I'm sure you see the problem I'm talking about. Threw me soo far off track and I started questioning EVERYTHING I knew! lost my confidence and my recruiter picked up on it. How do you talk about horrible decisions that you've been forced to work with but at the same time not making yourself look bad. this could be in conversations at conventions, meet ups or even slightly higher stakes type of meetings.",

        "content": "So my boss recently told me that try-catch statements are \"garbage\" and that I should avoid using them when developing. This wasn't specific to any particular language - they seemed to mean it as a general programming principle. I'm pretty confused because I thought error handling with try-catch was fundamental to most modern programming languages. I know it can be misused (like catching exceptions and doing nothing, or using exceptions for control flow), but completely avoiding it seems extreme. Is there some programming philosophy or best practice I'm missing here? Are there alternatives to try-catch that are considered better? Or is my boss maybe referring to specific anti-patterns that I should be aware of? Has anyone else encountered this \"no try-catch\" philosophy? What are the actual best practices around exception handling across different languages? Any insight would be really helpful - I want to understand if there's something legitimate here or if I should push back on this guidance. ‐-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When people say vague things like \"That's not good programming,\" I always ask, \"Why?\"Why is it garbage? Why is it bad design? Why isn't it good programming?When I asked that, they said, \"You should at least make a program that doesn't produce errors,\" and then laughed at me.Anyway, thanks for all the responses.

The fact that people are saying that \"Programming is dead\" infruits me so much.And AI can't even code to save it's life. It spits out nonsense inefficient code that doesn't even work half the time.Most students in my university do not have any programming skills. They just rely on LLMs to write code for them. They think that makes them programmers but these people don't know anything about Big O notation or OOP or functional programming or have any debugging skills.My university is literally hosting workshops titled \"Vibe Coding\" and it pisses me off on so many levels that they could have possibly approved of this.Many Companies in my country are just hiring people that just vibe code and double check the output codeIt genuinely scares me that I might not be able to work as a real software engineer who writes elegant and scalable systems.

I think it can be useful in the right contexts and when used well.But if you learn OOP as a course in college, you'd know that professors seem to think that it's God's perfect gift to programmers. My biggest problem is that colleges overemphasize inheritance as a feature.Inheritance can be useful, but when used improperly, it becomes ridiculously difficult and annoying to work with. In software engineering, there is a concept called \"orthogonality\", and it's the idea that different parts of your code should be independent and decoupled. It's common sense, really. If you change one part of your code, it shouldn't fuck up other parts. It makes testing, debugging, and reasoning about your program easier.Inheritance completely shits on that.When you have an inheritance tower two billion subclasses deep, it's almost guaranteed that there will be some unpredictable behavior in your code. OOP can have some very subtle and easy to overlook rules in how inheritance and polymorphism work, so it's very easy to create subtle bugs that are hard to reason about.So yeah. By all means, learn OOP, but please do it well. Don't learn it the way professors have you learn it, focus on composing classes rather than inheritance.",

Like somewhere I'd absorbed this idea that real programmers write clean elegant code on the first try, and if I couldn't do that, I wasn't ready to build yet.So I'd go do another tutorial. Where the code was already clean. Where I could follow along and feel competent without risking being bad at something.The thing that broke it was just... accepting I was going to write garbage. Not as a temporary state until I got good. As the permanent reality of programming. Everyone writes garbage first and then improves it.My first real project was mass truly mass mass terrible. Nested if statements everywhere, variables named \"thing2\", logic that made no sense. But it worked. And finishing something that worked, even badly, taught me more than all the tutorials combined.I swear I post even the ugly code on WIP Social now, and seeing other people also posting imperfect work made me realize everyone's first drafts are bad.

Even so, I'm a persistent person who learns quickly and doesn't give up when something doesn't work out.My goal today isn't to \"make easy money,\" but to learn a real, in-demand skill that makes sense in the long run—ideally something I can do remotely and independently.I'd appreciate constructive feedback on:whether my thinking is flawedwhat skills you see as most valuable for a young person (programming, data, automation, something else)what you would avoid if you were starting overI know I'm not the only one who's tried something like this at my age, so I really value any realistic advice.

        "author": "UsefulExplanation131",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey, everyone. Im really hoping to get outside perspectives on some difficulties ive been experiencing while learning to program. I keep experiencing burn out and exhaustion over and over again and I can’t figure out why it keeps happening. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong anymore and just can’t think clearly about my situation anymore. Here is some background: Rough timeline of my programming journey: August 2022- I begin working through TOP curriculum with the goal of seeing if i enjoy programming. I decide that i do enjoy it -> Feb 2024 - I physically and mentally burn out from my job as a delivery driver. Managing my job, programming, and therapy was too much and I quit after i got injured while working.  March 2024- after spending a year going from 45 mins of studying/week to 10 hours/week, a mental health crisis, and 1 month after quitting my job, i complete the foundations module of TOP -> Nov or Dec 2024 - I take advantage of being unemployed and living off savings to focus hard on programming. I build up to studying 25-30 hours/week consistently. I realize I don’t like front end stuff. I choose the js path on TOP, skip the “advanced html/css” and “react section,” but complete everything else up to the file uploader project of the “NodeJS” section. Around December i take a small break to focus on an art project, and that snowballed to a few months of no programming (though i think that would’ve happened regardless if i took a break or not). -> Feb 2026 - the past year and few months were a blur of trying so hard to build back the habit of programming as well as i did the first time. I spend some months completely dreading programming and unable to start and some months of still struggling, but able to at least show up mostly consistently. I follow a pattern of on for 2-3 months to off for 2-3 months. After i learn I don’t like front end stuff and realize that endlessly building endpoints was equally dreadful, i decide to focus on other backend topics and keep finding myself bouncing around. I spend a few months on [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) then burn out. I go to nand2tetris to switch things up, last a month, then burn out. I decide to learn C from “C programming: a modern approach,” to switch things up again, and actually have some fun, but things fizzle out again. Every attempt leaves me broken and exhausted. At this point, I don’t know what to do. It’s getting harder and harder to restart. The feelings that kept me going during my most consistent periods of study, feeling like im improving and growing as a person and programmer, the satisfaction and euphoria of solving some problem that I genuinely believed i could not solve, just have been completely absent for so long. During all of this, ive been working hard in therapy to resolve a lot of things including social anxiety. I bring this up because i have bad social anxiety that prevents me from going to local programming meetups, participating in online programming communities, and applying for jobs. Going at this mostly alone just adds another layer of complexity to it all. Ive made a lot of progress on that front but still have a ways to go. I haven’t programmed in a couple months now and its like no amount of time away makes me dread programming any less. I feel spiritually broken. Im too close to my situation to think objectively anymore. What do y’all think i could do differently? Why does programming keep becoming this thing that i dread? Am i focusing on studying too much and not spending enough time making projects? For me, the hardest part about this whole journey (and ive realized this applies to many, maybe most, endeavors) hasn’t even been the intellectual side of things. That’s hard, sure, but by far the hardest part has been the emotional side of things. Specifically, having to find a way to program consistently over time. That’s the aspect of all of this that is the most soul crushing. It was hard to get yourself to program today, and guess what? You have to do it all over again tomorrow. And the day after. Maybe not every single day, but most weeks, most months. How do y’all not get overwhelmed with this? I think i do a decent job of focusing only on the short term but the big picture and the stakes are always on the back of my mind. I do find enjoyment in solving some programming problems, but I can’t deny that I wouldn’t be pursuing this if it wasn’t a well paying career that doesn’t require a degree. Which is the reason why i even decided to see if i enjoy programming and why i still pursue it after all this struggle. Every job ive had up to this point has been low skilled work. Server, cook, cashier, delivery driver, etc. I’m almost 25 and i want and need to get a career going. I can’t keep living the life that ive been living and programming seems to be a good enough fit. It’s intellectually challenging, doesn’t require a degree, well paying, and i find a lot of it enjoyable (even if there are a lot of things i find tedious and annoyingly boring).That being said, i do have ideas that get me excited and could be solved using code. Some of my programming project ideas include:* Something similar to GitHub but for digital artists to save snapshots of their artwork. * Data management system for iot devices. Inspiration came from thinking about how massive amounts of data from telescopes are efficiently stored and organized* A tool that takes a 3D model and allows you to see the cross section along the axial planes* A massive library of artworks that pulls artwork from the online catalogs of museums and other collection websitesI can’t help but feel like i am not ready for any of these projects and that I need to keep studying and learning before i can attempt any of them. That was part of the inspiration to learn c, to better learn how databases work by making a simple database since these are all data intensive projects. Anyway, if anyone has anything to share about what I could do better, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading, ill stop yapping now",

I’ve even been getting vids of Terry Davis making cool stuff even though he’s not programming in c++. All this has led to me wanting to learn it not only to make fun stuff but also to help teach me more about programming as I feel using a low level language might teach me more. However, I’ve seen a lot of hate towards c++ even having someone go as far to make a 2 hour video hating on it:face_with_bags_under_eyes:. It’s been making me wonder if it’s worth it to just learn it for fun given how steep the learning curve is and whether there may be any alternative languages that I guess could fulfil the same role.",

And I'm absolutely obsessed with programming!For the last 2.5 years I've explored many fields of CS and I've absolutely fallen in love with ALL of them:• Frontend design with Flutter.• Game development with the Godot game engine.• Backend development with Django.• low level system design with C and Rust.• programming language and compiler design with Haskell. Every 6 weeks or so I bounce between my interests and create a project in one of them, and honestly it's been great so far. My peers criticize me and tell me to just choose 1 thing and get good at it. But I didn't listen. I was having too much fun and making steady progress in all my interests.But last week when I wanted to create a bigger game I realized something... I'm missing so many fundamentals of game development despite me learning it for the last 2.5 years !I still didn't know any 3D modeling. Didn't understand Shaders. Barley knew anything about 3D dev in general. Didn't know how to create 2D assets.And this was a pretty bad feeling. I wanted to create something big after 2.5 years of learning; But couldn't do much because I didn't have enough experience.And yeah I realized this pretty much applies to all my interests:• The most advanced flutter app I made is a Basic calculator.• Every game I've made is a 2d arcade game with stock assets.• I haven't even learned Authentication with Django yet.• I don't know how to program in any system language. Just watching random videos about C and C++• I've only created 2 new Programming languages and they're both toy languages with limited use cases.• I'm still not experienced enough with Haskell to create anything I can think of.Honestly I'm having a crisis right now. I feel like I should just focus on backend to get hired and game-dev as my main non-work hobby. But I also love the other stuff so much and don't wanna abandon them !I love all of them so much and I wish I can do everything at the same time.

The base system is promising and could be excellent, if the QA was more thorough.***So, why do I say coddy is utter garbage?** \\- The website is riddled with bugs, from non-loading lessons to timeouts and very... very slow validation.\\- A lot of the lessons have errors: They aren't properly formated, do not explain all the methods and systems needed to actually solve a lesson.\\- The \"daily challenge\" system is a joke. Its some poorly made AI system that gives you a basic ass task like \"Print hello world 10 times\" despite being at chapters like HashMaps etc.\\- There are numerous lessons where they do not actually explain to you what the desired output needs to be (given, you can see that by clicking the \"expected output\" toggle - but you should be able to see exactly what you need to do from the challenge description. \\- This last point goes hand in hand with the issue that the output needs to be exact. They had one extra space at the end of their output, despite not showing that because you're tasked with printing the result of each itteration on a new line anyway? Instantly lose the \"first try\" challenge.\\- Courses aren't even finished. I started the Python and Java course at the same time, hoping to refresh my python knowledge and picking up Java at the same time. Java's whole point is to be an OOP-language. Guess what: Section 3 \"Object oriented Programming\" is \"Coming Soon\":trade_mark:. What the actual fu\\*\\*?\\- The website is clearly built around just monetizing everything as agressively as possible. I got lucky and was able to use a discount code during November to get 30% off monthly subscriptions so it was \"only\" 14.95 a month. Still: I do not feel like that value is really justified. The website has a lot of AI-Slop and wannabe intelligent assistance systems that either fail, timeout (I now know this is a firebase website because the website is printing firebase errors everywhere on every fuc\\*\\*\\* interaction) and lots of lessons are very, very poorly worded.This could've been a 8.5/10 rating but as it stands, I'd say coddy is at best a 4/10 and you should probably look elsewhere.To their credit: They recently updated their Quizz section which made it less buggy and a lot more interactive.",

Reality is I really don't apply a ton of the complicated algorithims and principles all the time (though my memory of them still definitely helps).Curious if there are any structured free \"courses\" that are recommended to brush up, and delve deeper on concepts like data structures and algos then I could go when I learned them at school. In particular networking (one of my weaker spots for sure). I've seen mentions of free harvard, and berkeley resources, but curious if theres any other reccomendations!",

There is also an \"harder\" version of it where you need to print 2 pyramids. you know, the beginner level stuffs..since i dont have prior syntax knowledge i asked AI to generate me a code in order to check it, study it and understand it. and after i did it, i felt everything was clear, i knew what every line did and why. NICE RIGHT?\\#\\##\\###\\####when it came part 2 i decided to imperatively not use AI and only using my knowledge acquired from the first exercise to complete it.this time the first of the two pyramid had to be reversed, so with blank spaces before the \"#\" symbols. Like this:\\#\\## \\###\\####So how do you reverse a pyramid? by starting printing spaces instead of ashes right ? perfect. This concept was pretty obvious and clear in my mind, as it should be, but the application? impossible. I could't \"invent\" a way to do it. I just lacked the creativity, even if i had all the starting points in front of me.The formula to print the ashes was the same exact formula for basically all the other operations in the program:for (int s = 0; s < height - i; s++) { printf(\" \") }the only difference here is that im subtracting the variable (i) from the (height), because as the height increases i should also decrease the number of spaces. Perfect, logic and it works...BUT I COULDNT INVENT IT MYSELF!!! i totally lacked the creativity to think about subtracting (i) from (height) in order to solve my problem...i knew about the base formula and what it did, but i couldn't modify myself and understand what to doI HAD TO LOOK AT THE SOLUTION IN ORDER TO UNDERSTED WHAT TO DO.this is the very first set of exercises, this is the base. This is \"hello world\" level almost and yet i failed miserably.I feel super bad because i genuinely love the idea of becoming a good programmer. im 100% convinced about it.but this kind of misses makes me think that im just retarded to be honest... Imagine at a job when things gets serious and i can't even wrap my had around the simplest of problems...i'd get fired, or not even assumed probably.so yea, tell me what you think...tell me how miserable my story has been your eyes.Please just be hard and tell me the truth.",

        "title": "Coupling data with behaviour considered harmful",
        "author": "Achereto",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I've seen a couple of posts by people new to programming struggling with understanding OOP and people in the responses making claims about the benefits of OOP. I want to give a bit of a different perspective on it, having written OO code for over 15 years and moving away from it over the last 2-3 years.The core idea of OO is to model things analogue to the real world. So for example a `Datetime` object would represent a specific date and time, and everything related to that (like adding a second or minute) would be implemented by the object. It would also allow you to compare dates in an expressive way. Some languages allow you to have something like `if (today < tomorrow)`, or calculate the difference using `one_day := tomorrow - today` which is neat. **This approach couples data with behaviour.** If you need to add behaviour to a class and you don't own the class, you can't just add the behaviour to the class, and if the fields of the class are private you also can't easily access them from the subclass. So you're already facing a design problem. Yes, people have thought about it and found solutions but the key is that the coupling of data and behaviour *created* the design problem that had to be solved. With structs and functions you could just write a new function and would be done. No design problem in the first place.But the problem becomes worse: With objects acting on their own behalf you lose the efficiency of [iterating over data and modifying it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAVbI1HIzCE). For every update on an object, you have to call a method and create significant computation overhead (and no, the compiler usually can't optimize this away).In fact, the problems created by coupling data to behaviour (like classes do) has become such a pain for developers that we started teaching \"Composition over Inheritance\". In simple terms this means that an object (containing data) shouldn't implement its own behaviour any more, but instead provide placeholders for other objects that implement specific behavior can be used by the original object, effectively decoupling data from behaviour again (undoing OO). One of the better talks explaining this principle is [Nothing is Something by Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE) from ~10 years ago. In her example in the second half of her talk you can see that the `House` class is stripped down to data and placeholders for behaviour, giving her the maximum flexibility for new features.To reiterate: **OOP couples data with behaviour. The design problems arising from this are best solved by decoupling data from behaviour again**If you need more convincing data, then you can look at all the [OOP Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns). 13 of those 22 patterns (including the most useful ones) are actually separating data from behaviour, 3 are debatable if they do (Composite, Facade, Proxy) and only 6 (Abstract Factory, Prototype, Singleton, Flyweight, Memento, Observer) aren't about separating data from behaviour.If coupling data with behaviour is the root problem for many design problems in programming and the solutions people come up with are different ways to decouple data from behaviour again, then you should clearly avoid coupling them in the first place to avoid all of these problems.So what should you learn instead of OO? I would say that Entity Component Systems (ECS) are a good start as they seems to continue emerging as a solution to most design problems. Even \"Composition over Inheritance\" is already a step towards ECS. ECS have become more popular of the last years with both Unity, Godot, and Unreal Engine switching to it. There is a fantastic video about the [ECS in Hytale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglU107_DA4) as well, explaining how this makes modding extremely easy. More upcoming companies will do ECS in the next years and learning it now will put you in an advantage in the hiring processes. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. :)(ps: not sure if \"Tutorial\" is the right Flair because I don't actually show code, but it may be the best fit for explaining a concept and its downsides)",

From what I can tell, pretty much nobody here (who uses Python) is writing modular, testable code, it's mostly just scripts in notebooks.So my question is should I be using OOP for everything I build, even if I'm the only one touching the code? How do I know when something actually needs proper classes and structure vs just being a straightforward script?Like I get the theory behind clean code and all that, but when you're building a niche pipeline for one specific use case, does it really need to be over-engineered?

I tried VS code while trying to pursue a personal project in order to learn some coding by myself.I got this idea when I made a graph that looked like a room on python. Basically, it had multiple coordinates. I thought what if I code a room like that and then add frames of things that depict how I see her soul. I want to complement them with little notes. She is an artist herself so I would love for the gallery to have her own pieces too. I want it to be a reflection of her and our memories and her soul.But I don't really know coding like that. Please help me. I am here because I don't want to use AI chatbots to write codes for me. I want this project to be extremely intentional. I need your help!My questions for now-1. What application should I use to code this?2. What are your opinions on the feasibility of this project? Do you think I can do it considering my experience with coding? (I think I can but please be honest)3. Can you direct me towards the libraries that I can use to make these possible. I will scoop the internet for codes and information based on the libraries. 4. Do you have any insights or ideas about what I can do more to make this a fun and nice little gesture for her.Thank you!",

If two objects have the same hashCode, can I be 100% sure they are the same?2. If not, why do we even have hash codes? Why not just use `==` for everything?3.

I decided maybe the problem was with web dev, maybe I'm just not good at it. so I pivoted to data analysis. the same problem followed me.whenever I exit the comfort zone by closing the tutorial video, and just open a blank excel sheet and start a project on my own, the panic attack comes back.this is preventing me from becoming a professional, and I can't land a job this way.I'll stay stuck in my current non tech job which I hate.any advice?",

One thing to note is that I've always been very interested in indie game development and dream of creating my own game someday.

I studied mechatronics engineering, but life put me in the way of software development. I began working with C# and Windows forms to produce videogames, that was my first job as programmer as freelancer, then I moved to a work where I use C# and Unity to create virtual trainings, then I moved to a company where I provide support to a web site touching a little of SQL, C#, .NET, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Classic Visual Basic,looking learn new frameworks I moved to another company where I learn React and Angular, for a while there I work as Front End Developer, there was a Layoff and then I moved to a company where I currently work as a user experience engineer. I have touched a lot of frameworks but I cannot consider an expert in anything, of course I know something, otherwise it would have been impossible to pass the interviews, but I would love to have solid formation in front, back, databases and design systems including cloud, I have seen a lot of \"paths\" or courses but in the end no one is so clear or provide any solid knowledge.Any suggestion is very welcome, thanks beforehand for your suggestions and comments.",

I'm a recent CS graduate (also did a bootcamp 2 years ago) and while I completed all these things, I still don't feel like a programmer or someone who thinks like one. My older sister is a tech lead at X company and I've legit seen her break problems down one by one when presented with an issue, even problems that have nothing to do with tech lol, I still remember the first time I seen her do that and I've been wanting that ever since but I feel like a fraud. How did you guys get better at this? I've been more or less coding everyday since October trying to find a job and whenever I'm presented with a bug or an issue in my code I don't really approach it like actual programmers I just sit in my chair thinking, trying to beat my brain for a solution, sometimes it works, sometimes I end up just asking AI for help. (The other day I spent like two and a half hours trying to debug an \"edit inline\" feature for a finance app i was making and it was the most easiest solution ever that i could've solved on my own if i knew how to google/be resourceful Also, how did you guys get better at reading documentation? What is your process when you're learning new tech? I'm pretty bad at reading documentation I have to re-read certain MDN things like a million times for it to click. I think the overload of information on certain docs is what messes me up, but idk These are all things that I think are holding me back and I want to get better at so I can become a better programmer and not be too dependent on AI since no one knows where this is all going, because tbh AI can easily fill those gaps for me but then I'll never actually feel like a programmer or break problems down like the example I gave of my older sister.

I would have guessed that because of the parenthese surroundng `buf++` that the post-increment would happen before the dereference, causing the data to be stored one byte ahead of where it is expected. Why doesn't that happen?Edit: Corrected macro. I missed a parenthesis somewhere the first time.",

        "content": "A bit of a niche question, but I'm hoping someone in the community could help me out with this, since I'm finding a scarce amount of resources online regarding this topic. I'm a bachelor of music student and my main focus has been in emerging music technology for a long time, but it was only recently when I took an elective course in Pure Data that my mind was opened to the possibilities of creating my own VSTs, and it wasn't until even more recently that my roommate/bandmate suggested that he use his electrical engineering course to good use and we make music hardware together. Naturally, I love this idea, and we've been conceptualising a few admittedly ambitious ideas for boutique guitar pedals, synthesizers and other music hardware that we'd love to use ourselves, but now that he's started his EE course, I'm at a position where I really do have to start locking in and learning the relevant programming. I'm aware it'll take years before we're both skilled enough to create anything close to the ideas that we have now, but I figure it's never too early to start learning now. For VSTs in particular, I know the JUCE framework for C++ is the standard, and I've found a decent amount of resources on that, so I'm not too worried about it. My bigger question regards the hardware side of things. Which microcontrollers are standard for pedals, eurorack modules, synthesizers, etc, or does it depend more on processing power and other factors i'm not yet aware of? Is C++ a good language to know or should I also think about branching out and learning other languages instead? How does one even write code for microcontrollers and make it interact with the electronic components on the PCB? Are these stupid questions? As you can tell, I am truly lost in the dark here as I haven't an ounce of programming experience (outside of pure data and briefly learning GML when I was younger) but I know I can learn it, I just desperately need to know where to start, where to find resources, who to talk to, and what I should focus on learning now. Thank you very much in advance!",

I’m aware of the concept of encapsulation but I can’t really fully grasp \\*why\\* having a private variable is that important. I saw a few explanations about using it so you don’t have to change things across systems if the private variable is changed but that also confused me a bit. Another reason I saw was that it’s for security reasons, however this one doesn’t quite make sense to me because can’t you just use setters and getters? How would someone even see/use the information in the private class if they didn’t already have access to the entire file? Sorry if these are dumb questions ack.

How do you build software that doesn't end up breaking down the line both in terms of complexity/management/organization but also speed/performances/optimization? What is the strongest strategy?I know OOP and design patterns have been developed to fix organisation issues.But on the other side, there is a movement towards data oriented designs that prioritize efficiency and speed. Optimization for the hardware. The DS&A side of things.And they kind of seem to clash.But I tried the two and everything I make ends up breaking either being two slow/rigid with lack of control and dynamism if I go full OOP or if I go full DOP then at first it's a breath of fresh air with total freedom and speed of execution and so on but then I fall into madness pretty quickly as things get more complex and hard to keep track of.And I been stuck in that infernal cycle loop of doom for a long time and it's starting to feel like there isn't really a good solution and software may be a lot more limited than it seems to beWell software or my brain. As I found OOP ends up making the hardware fail but DOP ends up making my mind failPerhaps this may just be a skill issue on my part? I mean it definitely is but perhaps the answer lies lower level and I'd just need to \"get good\".But that introduces another issue though. If you program full stack and dive too deep, you end up taking the habit of over engineering everything and then development takes ages...But on the other side if you use only the most automated tools/libraries to make things really fast, you end up with slow and low feature slop that's turning your pc cooling system into a jet engine...I feel so lost... I been giving it my all in game development for soon to be 2 years programming a lot and been studying computer science for 1 year and I been tryharding the shit out of it but it's like I don't even know what to practice practice anymore.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi,I’m working on a small app project and trying to understand how the app “WhoLiked” is able to access and display users’ liked TikTok videos.According to TikTok’s public documentation, access to liked videos is restricted to the Research API, which is limited to non-commercial, non-profit use. Monetization is not allowed under these terms.However, “WhoLiked” appears to offer this functionality in a consumer app with in-app purchases, without requiring users to manually export and upload their data.From a technical and compliance perspective, I’m wondering:* How could “WhoLiked” technically access this data?* Are there any officially supported ways to implement this use case?* If not, does this likely involve methods that violate TikTok’s API terms or privacy policies?I’m trying to build an app that follows platform rules and avoids legal, account, or app store risks, so I’d appreciate insights from developers who have experience with similar integrations.Thanks!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "The situation is the following: both my parents are retired, and because they have neither hobbies nor social life, they spend most of their time at home watching the news. Due to this I noticed a deterioration lately in their mental health and mood. I thought I could download some of the series they used to watch time ago, store them in a USB and connect it to the TV so they can watch that instead of the news all the time. My parents are old and they would not know how to navigate through Netflix or other platforms, so I‘d have to do it this way.What I would like, and here is my question for you, is a file in the USB that randomly plays any video file in the USB. My parents basically use the TV as background noise so they wouldn’t care about what’s playing or follow the episodes in a given order. I want a file that they click on it and it plays whatever in the USB stick, and I need it to be random so it doesn’t always play the same episode first. I also need it to play episodes non-stop, so that they don’t need to click on the file after every episode.I have some knowledge in Python and bash, so if you give me a hint on what kind of file could do such a thing maybe I can write it on my own. The approach I can think of is the following; when I click on this file it will:- Collect all the file names in the USB (or the ones with a video format).- Sort them on a random order.- Grab the first 20 files on the list.- Play this 20 episodes as a playlist.On a computer I could write it so that VLC plays this list of files, but on a TV I don’t know how it could be done. It’s also not a Smart TV, so I cable install apps.",

My boyfriend is a software engineer and I study Poli-sci, a complete different world but I had always been deeply curious in his work and what it means. He is a very patient and great teacher but I wanted some ideas. I am super autistic and when I do a deep-dive on topics that I am not familiar with, I often face two questions:1. How do I get to the point of understanding the language of this topic intuitively?2. What can I do with this information? (in the sense of how is what I learned applied and how can I apply it)And these stall me, especially because finding direction in this is quite hard. Programming has its own language peform the actual languages which I am learning a lot of googling and writing it down (got a dictionary growing here). It is a lot and feels overwhelming but is super stimulating. In terms of what I can do with this information, I am working on making my own blog that I can basically upload on (upload used loosely bc I can also write in the code itself) with the help of my boyfriend. Our steps are decidely working with HTML and JS. *Yes I can use AI, I know how AI is useful in many ways but I want to do everything from scratch. I am not focused on speed, I am focused on learning the most I can because I want to understand what I am doing.* **Do any of you, experienced or not, have any ideas or tips on how I can learn code effeciently? What projects can I do? Aside from learning python, what languages should I expose myself to?**",

If you're here simply because you are looking to make a lot of money, you're in the wrong place\"This is what the dean of students told Jordan Belfort (The Wolf of Wall Street) and his fellow classmates his first day of dental school. Belfort dropped out.A lot of you all here need to take some inspiration from that. Gatekeepers are annoying I know but the doom and gloom in this field has reached a point where I, as a senior engineer in this field, feel a call to gatekeep a little bit.The COVID era job market is never coming back - at least not any time soon which may as well mean never for those of you trying to break into this field with no passion. And that word is the heart of what I want to get at here; passion.Obviously there are still dentists today. Most of whom became dentists well after Belfort was a student and discouraged from his dreams. Just as there will be software engineers well into the future.But the people that became dentists despite the market drying up did so because they had a true passion for the field. It still pays well sure but there was a golden age that has now passed and this is where CS is now.This post isn't to straight up tell you to give up on a CS career. But, if you have been struggling to find a job for awhile now, you should take a step back and a bit of time to reflect on why you are here. If its just for the money, it might be time to pivot to something else.The golden age of software engineering is overEDIT: This post went from 70+ upvotes to sub 10 in a matter of minutes. Reddit is controlled by bots and is generally a bad place to solicit life and career advice. You cannot trust what you see on this platformEDIT 2: Don't overanalyze the dentist analogy. Like I originally said there are obviously still dentists today. And they make great money IF they get jobs. The analogy is not to say they don't do well if they land jobs its to say they do well IF THEY DO land jobs. And thats the challenge of the current CS market. Its great money IF YOU CAN LAND A JOB. And to land a job in todays market you can't just mail it in. Thats my point",

And also you’re welcome.Moments spent in Power BI dashboards, watching shifts in purchasing behavior, tracking category growth in Kombucha, Spindrift, and non-alcoholic beverages, and translating those insights into actionable strategy? Ecstasy.

My company is working incredibly hard to force our engineers to use agentic AI to code. They claim that they want in the next 6 months that some kinds of code to eventually be done entirely by agents, including the review process. They've also set a baseline that all engineers know how to use tools like Claude code in their every day work.When pressed on the issue, our CTO admitted that on average, pre things like Claude, our engineers only spent about 1 hour per day on actually writing code. The rest was spent in meetings, writing RFCs, designing, etc. To me, this says that coding was never the actual issue. So seriously, what exactly am I missing? Is there something magical that's happening right now that makes the current agents with the current context window constraints able to handle highly complex systems?Do the folks at the top really not care about the cognitive decline associated with these kinds of tools? Is my conspiracy theory right that they're just trying to outsource us like every capitalist before them?",

        "author": "iwuvpuppies",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I made this post to help explain the current state of software development jobs, especially for new and junior developers. I hope this eases some of your worries. It is long, bear with me.Software Engineering, like any other careers is cyclical. Jobs are at the mercy of demand, trends, and capital. We saw an influx during 2010's and especially during and after Covid (early 2020's) when companies started hiring to hoard talent.Lets get to the layoffs. For those who think layoffs are the direct result of AI, you are not completely wrong. But there are more factors at play. The hard reality is the American economy may be in the midst of economic hardship (recession). This takes us to my first point.1. Companies using AI as an excuse to downsize and make the books look good.First reason: Executive Bonuses. Public companies are at the mercy of quarterly reports. One bad quarter could cost some asshole millionaire his/her job. This sadly incentivizes short term gains and hurts the company long term. But who cares as long as they get their bonus right? AI is a goldmine for execs. They buy a Claude or Copilot subscription and start firing devs. They then take the money they were paying those devs back to the board or shareholders and get rewarded with a bonus.Second reason: Optics. Instead of telling shareholders they need to cut costs (signs of weakness), companies can now conveniently say \"AI Efficiency\". “We don’t need as many people” sounds better than “we can’t afford them”. To top that off, the market rewards any mention of AI with a stock bump. Again the millionaire assholes gets their bonus.2. Management is not immune to industry trends. Leadership is not perfect, they will make mistakes. Unfortunately we are often the victims of those mistakes. Executives talk to peers, copy what other companies are doing, then push it internally. Often times, this comes in the form of asking devs to vibe code/prompts/use agents.3. Take a close look at motivations. The same people dooming and glooming software development are often the ones collecting million dollar bonuses for selling the hype and tools.Below is how things will play out:After management finishes downsizing and the quality of the product goes to shit (either from the vibe coding or short staffing), we will see the following:* Companies admiting AI didn’t deliver the expected benefits* Anyone tied to the AI initiative gets fired (after they get their million dollar bonuses of course)* Start hiring engineers again* AI repositioned as “assistive\" rather than substitutiveTime and time again we have seen this with offshoring, outsourcing and any form of automation.My recommendation, if you enjoy coding, keep doing it. After the hype and fad dies down, this job will continue to be in demand.“In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death, taxes, and executive bonuses”",

        "content": "I've been a SDE in FAANG for almost 5 years, mostly rated Top Tier each year, worked on lots of scope, and left last year due to moral reasons and burning out from ever increasing workloads from Big Tech. I took a large break to heal and moved back in with my parents to reconnect since I moved far away to pursue this role and I figured it would be easy to land a Job near my hometown which is near a big city.BUT its been about 6 months after I started seriously searching and it feels like all of the jobs openings are in Big Tech and I can barely find roles that would I felt would be regular jobs a few years ago. Every small-mid size company has only 1-2 roles open at a time, if at all, and the competition is intense. Every application has hundreds of people applying based on LinkedIn and Indeed.I don't think I qualify or want to push myself to take Senior roles, which have much more openings by far, but for Mid Level roles, I feel like I'm looking a unicorn. Friends who work in non Big Tech jobs tell me how wonderful it is to work in a low stress environment and have coworkers who have been there for decades, while I feel like I'm going crazy just looking for a job.I knew the job search would be bad, but its genuinely horrible and I can't imagine what someone without experience or less experience than what you'd get at FAANG would be going through right now. I'm leveraging use of all resources of networks, cold calling, and the like, but with how dry the market is, every rejection and non offer after long interview sessions hits like a truck.I love this work, am staunchly anti-AI, and don't expect a large paycheck for my next job, but is it so hard of an ask for fulfilling work that I don't have to think about all day and on weekends?? (shout out last employer!!)I landed my FAANG job from an internship and I have no idea if this is the norm or if I've just been privileged. How was the market actually before all of this? I know the pandemic was a hot market for SDE jobs, but its hard to believe given the dichotomy between today's market. The only consistent interview requests I get now are from big tech companies and I'm trying my absolute best to not re-enter the meat grinder for as long as possible. Is there any hope for a healthy job in this economy??",

I said blatantly that it is good for boilerplate and understanding the repo and changes done, and great for tests, albeit still needs significant edits. For actual development work, it has proved lackluster.He was pushing that coding was dead and AI should be able to do all of it now, so we should all be much faster. He also mentioned software quality in the same discussion, advocating AI should make it easier. He then gave an example of someone he knew in a well known company who was very experienced, IC6 level, and he was bring told that he needs to use AI or go away. Whilst using AI has been useful, I do think the extent of it's usage is being stretched significantly by people who are even developers or were themselves. How does everyone find using AI for their companies so far? When i make a new side project and do simple client side work, it's great and I rarely need to read any code. But for my corporate job, it still hallucinated a lot even with very specific prompting. Am I doing it wrong and has this improved significantly to the level my manager was claiming, or is it still useful for learning and planning to some extent but not execution?

I was essentially doing the work of other tech leads in the company, but there was always a vague reason promotion to get the title I was already doing wasnt coming. It was always \"next cycle\". I left and went to another company. Hired as a Senior, within about a year or two I'm basically acting tech lead again in terms of responsibilities. But again, every cycle I was told I'd be promoted in the *next* cycle and it never happened. After frustration, I left and started the cycle again at my current company. I'm now approaching my 4th anniversary and the same cycle has played out again, and I'm sensing the same excuses coming as to why no promotion will happen again this year.I'm very frustrated. I'm working at a higher level than my title suggests and have been for a long while now. No offense to the people around me but I now report up through people with much less experience.If I leave, I can't get past a screening for a \"lead\", \"staff\", \"principal\" roles because they want a few years at that title already. If I accept another Senior position, I'm basically back to \"Day 1\" and have to grind to reach the ever elusive carrot or promotion in a few years and I'm worn out of trying hard, having responsibility pushed on me, but never actually getting the reward. What do people at this level do. I'm good at my job from a technical perspective and I seem to be well trusted in terms of people skills, managing a team, but the political side of forcing promotions seems to not be something I'm good at. Edit: Thank you for the helpful and respectful comments, it has given me a few things I need to think about and improve my approach towards. For the hostile comments, I'm not quite sure why my question has made a few folks so angry but I wish you well regardless. Edit 2: Received a Reddit Cares for this post. Unacceptable.",

I thought that I had made some sort of mistake or forgot to do something.Last night, HR messaged me and said that my manager has asked that I lower the ratings that I gave to all of my reports.I'm upset by this for many reasons and don't know how to respond.I work in the same office as my manager and feel like we have a decent relationship. Why is he going through HR instead of coming to me?I gave my reports ratings that I sincerely believe they deserve. My boss is completely non technical and has no idea what makes a good software engineering employee. He's not qualified to rate them. If my employees don't deserve the rating that I gave them, then what do they need to do in order to get the higher rating, since they're already doing those things? I don't know how to respond, because every way forward involves something that has the potential to hurt my career, my employment status, or my integrity.I could lie to my employees and make something up as to why they didn't deserve better. That's likely the best thing for my employment status and career, at least at this company. But it makes me absolutely sick.I could tell my employees that I rated them higher but that my boss, who they have daily contact with, didn't think they deserved it. That doesn't feel like a good idea.I could refuse to change the rating. That's also not going to go well for me.My decision as of right now is that I'm going to set up a . meeting with HR and tell them that I'm not going to change their ratings without some convincing justification.I feel like if my boss wants the ratings changed, then my reports should be moved under him, and he needs to own their ratings. I'm unhappy about it in any case, but I'm more comfortable if he owns what he's done and the software engineers know it was him. I left my last company for similar reasons, and I'm now considering switching again.Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed?Update: After reading the advice here, I've messaged HR to set up a meeting with them to try and understand:1. Why they want me to downgrade my ratings2. How do I tell my reports that calibration forced me to rate them lower even though they're doing everything they were supposed to be doing to get their ratings? (I did not rate both employees the same,)3. If my employees ask how to get the higher ratings, what do I tell them, since they were already doing what the HR document lists?",

Is it still a \"kill yourself spending all your free time to grind, grind, grind\" sort of scenario?My bread and butter during my career has mostly been PHP. Obviously it has a reputation, though I'd like to think I've done a lot of \"real\" engineering with it—not just WordPress plugins and whatever small, hacky BS it's known for. I worry that will hold me back—not because of my skill level, but because of PHP's reputation. Is that a valid concern?I'm also far enough into my career to have a comfortable amount of savings and not all the energy of a 22 year-old, so I'm not willing to take an insanely demanding job with crazy hours and stress.

I am also minoring in Statistics and Management and have applied for a Master's program as a backup.Academically, I have done well with a 3.7 GPA and I have never really struggled to understand CS concepts. With a few hours of focused studying, I can usually grasp everything and do well on exams. The issue has not been that the material is too hard. It is more about motivation and how I feel about the path I am on.After freshman year, where I honestly did not do much career wise, reality hit me in my second year. I felt like I had to catch up. I took on multiple research projects to make up for my lack of industry experience, built personal projects, constantly took 20 units a quarter along with some community college classes, and spent a lot of time grinding LeetCode. I really pushed myself because I thought that if I did everything right, the results would come.But even after all that effort, I did not see the outcomes I expected in terms of internships or job offers. That gap between effort and results has been mentally exhausting. Over time, the constant grind with no clear payoff has worn me down, and I have lost the excitement I used to have for CS.I have realized that I do not hate problem solving. I still like thinking through ideas and solutions. I especially enjoy working with numbers and seeing patterns, which is why my Statistics and Management minor has felt more interesting recently. What I do not enjoy is the actual process of coding. Sitting and building things line by line feels draining, even though thinking about the solution at a higher level feels engaging.Right now I am not excited about more studying, more interview prep, or more side projects. I want to work and get real experience instead of staying in this cycle of preparation. Applying for a Master's was partly strategic because I have not landed a job yet, not purely because I am excited to keep studying.At this point, I am trying to figure out if this loss of passion is just temporary burnout from overworking myself, or if my interests are actually shifting toward something more analytical or business focused rather than pure software engineering.I know I am just ranting and will probably just get flamed in the comments (please be nice)",

I am 26F and currently have 5 YoE and an engineering degree from an Ivy. In December, a recruiter from Capital One reached out to me. I guess at one point I had applied in the past and was rejected but my name was in their system and they wanted to consider me for a Senior Software Engineer (Principal Associate) role. I kinda thought eh, what the hell why not, but after a little brushing up on Leetcode I managed to pass the online assessment and the Power Day and am now at the team match phase. The recruiter called me yesterday to let me know that while I still passed, they ultimately are going to offer me a Software Engineer (Senior Associate) role, which is the level below what I interviewed for. I'm honestly shocked I even passed so this is still good news, and according to Levels.fyi I would be making \\~160k base in NYC which is significantly more than what I make now.Now that I've passed and I'm waiting to hear back about team match, I was looking on Blind and Reddit about working at Capital One and I worry that the culture is really cutthroat. Apparently every 6 months they PIP 15% of employees per team and it's common for new hires to get cut. This is really concerning to me. My entire career I've been more used to a startup environment where there is obviously a chance of layoffs (and have been through one) but they weren't cutting teams every 6 months. Going from having mostly startups on my resume to having somewhere with more name recognition like Capital One might be more beneficial for my career in the long run, plus the compensation is significantly more than what I make currently. However, I worry that I'll be out of a job in 6 months and with this current job market I don't think most people are in a place to take risks. I'm weighing the pros and cons and I'm not sure how to proceed once I hear back about team match and get an offer. Should I stay at my current job, or take the leap?",

For the longest time I was quite against using AI to develop code because I wanted to enjoy the challenges, solve problems etc. I simply enjoy my job too much to want to delegate it away.And recently, I've been experimenting with some AIs (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude) because as much as I enjoy my job, I don't want to fall behind. But my real, hands on experience was that AI was only really useful as a glorified autocomplete, generating boilerplate code, and maybe stuff like terraform skeleton code. It's good for things that are not a problem at all and that I can do quite fast myself anyway, but whenever I try to use AI to solve an actual problem/something I'm stuck on/something that requires logic, it always fails miserably. Trying to talk it into actually doing the work, and even pointing out the mistakes (and entering the, 'you're right, I'll fix that!' loop for ever), it makes me feel like a Sisyphus, and it never goes anywhere. Pretty much every single time I've attempted it, I was better off writing the code myself anyway. But everywhere I look, I see people about agentic ai, using ai in development and increasing the productivity 10x, etc. but in reality, these are never followed up with real life actual examples, it just feels like a cloud of buzzwords and people parroting what's currently popular.",

It means that you need either a git worktree or having multiple directories for the same repo, each with code for a different feature. Needless to say, that's very hard to manage! I tried it with two directories and I got lost, forgot which directory had what, push it all on the same branch and had to fix is later. It only made me slower and tired. Yet leadership expectations is that each engineers runs TEN! agents at once.At the stand up today I was expected to work and finish three tasks at the same time and I just can't do it. My brain doesn't work like that. I forget about the first agent when I start interacting with the second one.It's sad really, that they're taking an amazing thing that has so much potential and it should be fun to learn, and ruining by this greedy, ruthless mindset. And it's a \"do it or leave\" kind of situation.In the meantime everybody else is pushing branch after branch with four parallels agents like it's nothing.

Luckily, I got an offer from a company that was willing to teach me a low-code platform to be a developer in (Pega). Things were pretty ok but I eventually changed roles to do manual QA and I'd been doing that for about 3 or 4 years. Due to government lockdowns and budget cuts, I got laid off and now I'm not really sure what I can do. Since I went into manual QA, my pega dev skills aren't really up to snuff, and my regular Java/C++ skills are definitely extremely rusty. I've applied to both Pega dev jobs as well as manual QA jobs, but I'm trying to figure out what else I can do in the meantime.I'm considering going into pharmacy technician jobs since I have connections there, but on the coding side I'm not really sure what I should do to bounce back. Should I try and relearn my pega skills even though there are less jobs up for that? Relearn java/c++ thru bootcamp or otherwise? Try and learn javascript or python for automated testing roles? New language entirely like Cobol or Rust? I'm just feeling very lost and not sure where the best use of my time would be. Edit: just to mention what my current plan is, right now I'm studying for a pharm tech certification so I can get a job to supplement/replace my unemployment checks. Once the cert is sorted, I was gonna continue applying for manual QA roles and maybe even entry level/junior dev roles while also looking into other, less coding-centric tech roles to pivot into so I can have a more financially stable long-term full-time job.",

HR and people involved feel good drafting a super demanding job posting requirement and process. I internally cringe when I compare it to what actually is the job.The truth is no one wants to challenge it, my theory is it’s because in terms of optics. When leaders and execs say they hire senior only, it gives the impression that they are raising the bar, that they work on super hard problems, that the org super mature, etc... No one wants to say the truth that sometimes \"well actually what we work on here is not too hard, let's get a coachable hire we can invest in\". Last we tried we got shut down hard.What happens then, we eventually find someone senior enough that can pass the process, then they are underutilized, get frustrated and leave. Or they stay but invent problems and over engineer (and some important basic work does not get done).In the recent job posting I worked on, we had to remove a line about how \"you will get to coach juniors\" because we literally don't have any now. The simple tasks haven't disappeared, it’s just that seniors are wasting time on them instead of juniors.Frustrated with this, can anyone relate?[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qwmnv8)",

I have about 15 credits in CS for a teaching cert through a regular state university. However I would like to upskill slowly and earn a CS degree. I already have a AS, BA and a MA degree from regular schools. I do not have a CS degree. I would like to use WGU seeing as I have other regular degrees, but I dont want a hiring manager to see that degree as inferior. My main reason for using WGU is the online component and cost. I cant afford to stop working, I am in my early 30's, not college age any longer. Just curious what peoples opinions are. I realize the market is utter shit right now, I would like to get this degree at my own pace, and *perhaps* transfer to industry. I enjoy teaching CS and its stable. However it would be nice to have another option.",

I understand that I alongside many others are cooked with the market at the moment, especially with the time I've wasted. What can I do? I really want to stay in SWE and I don't see myself doing anything else but I am open to other technical positions for the meantime just so I can financially stabilize myself. Based in NYC, at this point, I will consider any technical field a great starting point. I also would like to know what my options are for SWE? Should I continue working on personal projects and pushing out as much as I can? I get no interviews at all, which leads me to believe my resume is lackluster and it's probably because most of my projects are old. It's something I'm self aware of and actively try to fix but I usually abandon projects half way through for no reason. I'm still working on that part of myself but I would just like to know if it's even worth it at this point. tl;drWhat other tech positions can I apply for to stabilize myself?

The 2nd human can think in a truly independent way regardless of what the first human has tried. Hallucinations can still happen between humans but they are much rarer and even when they do happen are usually understandable and predictable.In short, I've observed that human collaboration is scalable in a way that AI agent collaboration is not.It's almost as if due to the simple fact that each human has a unique neural net wiring, human collaboration is able to make discoveries and break throughs that a single neural net whether synthetic or biological, cannot compete against.It's as if the current state of the art for AI is still only at the level where it's a tool. If I didn't know better, I would say investors are being duped into believing it'll reach true human level autonomy. Surely, these benevolent tech \"leaders\" wouldn't bend the truth like that.",

        "author": "kyngslyr",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m a backend software engineer with about 2.5 years of experience, mostly working with .NET/C# and SQL. I’m currently at a service-based company and was promoted fairly early into a senior/lead-type role, which means I’ve had exposure to architecture decisions, client calls, and owning delivery end to end.Lately though, I don’t feel great about where I am. The work is very project-driven, there isn’t much real product thinking, and there’s no meaningful senior mentorship above me. I’ve learned a lot by being pushed into responsibility early, but it also feels like I’m starting to plateau, and I’m not convinced staying longer actually improves my long-term trajectory.I recently went through interviews with a US-led SaaS company, and they’ve communicated intent to extend an offer. The role is titled “Support Engineer,” which is what’s making me hesitate. On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role.From conversations with their engineering leadership, though, this doesn’t sound like a traditional ticket-only support job. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes. They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path.What I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment.There’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.If you’ve worked in product SaaS companies or made a similar move, how would you look at this? What would you watch for early on to tell whether it’s actually a stepping stone versus a dead end? Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?EDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.",

I'm glad to have gotten the experience, but it meant that I took 6 years to graduate in the first place.Applying to jobs feels worthless. It feels like I might as well have no degree and no experience. I can't tell if it's because of the sites I'm using to look for jobs, or because AI, or recession, or because my resume isn't good enough (which means grads with actually no experience are completely fucked). Currently I'm unemployed and applying to jobs here and there that look like I match their requirements and pay decently well, in the 70-85k range makes sense to me for SE MI with experience and a degree.I've been slowly building a website that I think provides a niche unique utility to a gaming community I've been in for over a decade as a side project, nothing super serious. Though I think I can monetize it through ads or a freemium model and maybe just pour my efforts into that as somehow a better alternative. Is it crazy to think that investing my time into my own site that could just flop and make no money is the way to go? I figure it's either gonna support me or be a good portfolio addition, but I don't know if it's short-sighted to consider self-employment the way to go or if the dev doomerism has simply taken control of my brain.What do you guys with experience think? Is it stupid to focus on self-employment opportunity? Or is it the way to go when the industry is shutting its pants over AI and other problems?- Edit to clarify my YOE and graduation.",

        "content": "Hi, I'm a Cloud Data Engineer with 5 YOE, up until now my work has been quite traditional, i've worked with ETL and ELT, recently I even began my \"seniorship path\" by forming a couple new resources in the team and managing by my own several projects with a quite difficult stakeholder.Everything was (more or less) fine. The problem started recently, where my manager decided that I have to learn Business Intelligence, in particular how to make dashboard (a task that I hate and I'm really bad at since I have basically zero aesthetic sense), in order not to present my job to internal stakeholders, but to sell them outside the company (and this worries me A LOT, I spoke about this with my internal stakeholder and he seemed worried too).My perception about why this did happen was that the head of data made some terrible choices that burned out the budget and now they have to find a way to save money (about 60% of the BI team left not being replaced recently). They'll probably to sell this transition as a new way to intend the Data Engineering job, compliant with our target company model.Now I'll soon have to speak with my manager about this, I'll for sure tell him that I'm not ok with this, and that I expected to proceed in a more managerial path, rather than taking on more technical work, that I cannot do and I'm not brilliant with. But I fear that this won't make any changes. So what would you do in my place?I thought about:1. Leaving the company (the market isn't as bad as in the US, so it's not out of questions, but i still would like to have an offer first)2. Take a step back and ask for part-time trying to use the free time to land some other job (perhaps freelance or something different)3. Go to HR, tell them that I'm not anymore happy with my position and see if there's something else available withing the company.4. Comply and see what happens (if they will fire me, they'll have to give me an exit bonus)TL;DRAs a Data Engineer forced to take on even Business Intelligence tasks due to corporate politics. I hate them and I suck at them. What would you do in my place?",

I don’t miss writing code itself. I don’t see myself continuing to write code in the long term.I want to work more with people, at a “zoom-out” level, have more influence on decision-making, work with stakeholders, etc.On one hand, this sounds exactly like product management, but I’m worried about becoming a junior again in today’s tough market, and also about a potential pay cut (or at least not increasing my salary for the next few years).On the other hand, there’s the team lead path, which is appealing because it preserves some technical involvement (at least at the design and architecture level) and usually comes with higher pay. But I’ve never managed people and don’t know how I’d be at it.I’d appreciate insights.",

I've done a few system design interviews before, but those were whiteboarding sessions. I haven't had to actually code up a full system under time pressure and validate it against a suite of test cases.Are there any sites where you build a system in code and run it against a test suite? Essentially, Leetcode but for system design? Or problem sets/files that I can work through and then locally run the tests myself? I've already found some LeetCode problems like \"Design an In-Memory File System\" and \"Web Crawler,\" but I'm curious what else is out there.Any resource recommendations on OOP design principles and patterns, too? I'm currently going through System Design Interview by Alex Xu, but that's about it.Lastly, I'd love any advice for those who have taken this OA. Definitely a bit nervous!Thanks!",

I guess my main question is what aspect of applying to new roles should I be prioritizing my time towards? Should I be mass applying to any position that fits my experience, brush up on LeetCode, or just do both?I see a lot of people stressing about learning LeetCode and how most places ask some type of DSA problem. When I was searching for my first position, out of 580ish jobs, only 1 out of the 4 second round interviews I had consisted of answering some LeetCode style problem. I know they were LeetCode problems given the fact that I had actually completed them while studying up on LeetCode (Roman Numeral Conversion, Linked List problem). But also, I hear people say on this subreddit that studying LeetCode ALL DAY EVERYDAY is for people who want to break into FAANG or some adjacent company and that most companies won't be too harsh on applicants knowing how to solve LeetCode problems. I guess if you were a fairly recent graduate coming off your first job, what would be your priorities if you were going to be searching for a new job while having SOME experience?",

I'm personally fine with customer facing roles but definitely don't want to stray further from the traditional SWE path. What do you guys make of this?
