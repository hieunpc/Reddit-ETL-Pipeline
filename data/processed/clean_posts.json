If I were to go elsewhere, I have no idea if I could answer some SQL and Python questions to even break into another company. It doesn’t even feel worth practicing regularly since AI can help me do everything I need regarding code changes and I understand how all the systems tie together. Do companies still ask raw problems without letting you use AI? I guess after writing this post out, I can already tell it’s just going to take raw willpower and discipline to keep myself sharp. But I’d like to hear how everyone is battling this feeling.",

        "content": "Just as the title says. Fabric has been a pretty rough experience.I am a team of one in a company that has little data problems. Like, less than 1 TB of data that will be used for processing/analytics in the future with < 200 people with maybe \\~20 utilizing data from Fabric. Most data sources (like 90 %) are from on-prem SQL server. The rest is CSVs, some APIs.A little about my skillset - I came from a software engineering background (SQLite, SQL Server, C#, WinForms/Avalonia). I’m intermediate with Python and SQL now. The problem. Fabric hasn’t been great, but I’ve learned it well enough to understand the business and their actual data needs.The core issues:* Random pipeline failures or hangs with very little actionable error output* Ingestion from SQL Server relies heavily on Copy Data Activity, which is slow and compute-heavy* ETL, refreshes, and BI all share the same capacity* When a pipeline hangs or spikes usage, capacity shoots up and Power BI visuals become unusable* Debugging is painful and opaque due to UI-driven workflows and preview featuresThe main priority right now is stable, reliable BI. I'm open to feedback on more things I need to learn. For instance, better data modeling.Coming from SWE, I miss the control and being granular with execution and being able to reason about failures via logs and code.I'm looking at Databricks and Snowflake as options (per the Architect that originally adopted Fabric) but I think since we are still in early phases of data, we may not need the price heavy SaaS.DE royalty (lords, ladies, and everyone else), let me know your opinions.

The necessity for complex types like VARIANT and STRUCT seems to be rising. Which is increasing the need for data modeling not decreasing it. It feels like some company leaders now believe you can just point an LLM at a Kafka queue and have a perfect data warehouse which is still SO far from the actual reality of where data engineering sits today Am I missing something or is the hype train just really loud right now?",

How is it at your work? Do people actually vet the information given and critically assess it, or do they just plug it into whatever pipeline that exists and call it a day?I have seen a lot of questionable DAX queries from people I assume have very little to no clue as to why they have made it like that. The complexity of the queries are often worrying as it displays a very high level of trust in the result that has been given to them. Stuff that \"works\" in the moment, but can easily break in the future.What are your experiences? Have you seen anything in production that made you go \"oh, this is BAD!\"?",

        "author": "kotrfa",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I know this subreddit kinda hates LLM solutions, but I think there is an undeniable and underappreciated fact about this. If you search on various forums like SO, reddit, community forums of various data platforms etc. for terms like (would link them, but can't here):1. fuzzy matching2. string distance3. CRM contact matching4. software list matching5. cross-referencing \\[spreadsheets\\]6. ...and so on, you find hundreds or thousands of posts dealing with seemingly easy issues where you have the classic example of not having your join keys exactly matching, and having to do some preprocessing or softening of the keys on which to match. This problem is usually trivial for humans, but very hard to generically solve. Solutions range from stuff like fuzzy string matching, levenshtein distance, word2vec/embedding to custom ML approaches. I personally have spent hundreds of hours over the course of my career putting together horrendous regexes (with various degrees of success). I do think there is still use for these techniques in some relatively specific cases, such as when we are talking about big data and stuff, but for all those CRMs systems that need to match customers to companies that are under 100k rows of rows and so on, it's IMHO solved for negligible cost (like dollars compared to hundreds or thousands of hours of human labour). There are different shades of \"matching\" - I think most of the readers imagine something like a pure \"join\" with matching keys, a pretty rare case in the world of messy spreadsheets or outside of RDBMs. Then there are some trivial cases of transformation like capitalization of strings where you can pretty easily get to a canonical form and match on that. Then there are those cases that you still can get quite far with some kind of \"statistic\" distance. And finally there are scenarios where you need some kind of \"semantic distance\". The latter, IMHO the hardest, is something like matching list of S&P500 companies, where you can't really get the results correct unless you do some kind of (web)search. Example is e.g. a ticker change for Facebook in 2022 from FB to META. I believe today LLMs opened the door to solving all of those.For example, a classic issue companies have is matching all the used software by anyone in the company to licenses or whitelisted providers. This can be now done by something like this python-pseudocode: software = pd.read_csv(\"software.csv\", columns=[\"name\"]) suppliers = set(pd.read_csv(\"suppliers.csv\", columns=[\"company\"])) def find_sw_supplier(software_name: str, suppliers: set[str]) -> str | None: return call_llm_agent( f\"Find the supplier of {software_name}, try to match it to the name of a company from the following list: {suppliers}. If you can't find a match, return None.\", tools=[WebSearch], ) for software_name in software[\"name\"]: supplier = find_sw_supplier(software_name, suppliers) df.loc[idx, \"supplier\"] = supplierIt is a bit tricky to run at scale, and can get pricey, but depending on a task it can be drawn down quite significantly depending on the usecase. For example, for our usecases we were able to trim down the cost and latency in our pipelines by doing some routing (like only sending to LLMs what isn't solved by local approaches like regexes) and by batching LLMs calls together and ultimately fit it into something like (disclosure: this is our implementation): from everyrow.ops import merge result = await merge( task=\"Match trial sponsors with parent companies\", left_table=trial_data, right_table=pharma_companies, merge_on_left=\"sponsor\", merge_on_right=\"company\", )and given these cases are basically embarrassingly parallel (in the stupidest way, you throw every row on all the options), the latency mostly boils down to the available throughput and longest-llm-agent-with-search, in our case we are running virtually arbitrary (publicly web-searchable) problems under 5 minutes and 2-5$/1k of rows to merge (trivial cases are of course for 0, most of the cost is eaten by LLMs generations and web search through things like serper and stuff). This is of course one of the few classes of problems that are possible now and weren't before. I don't know, but I find it fascinating - in my 10-year career, I haven't experienced such a shift. And unless I am blind, it seems like this still hasn't been picked up by some of the industries (judging based on the questions from the various sales forums and stuff). Are people just building this in-house and it's just not visible, or am I overestimating how common this pain point is?",

I have owned and delivered a significant and highly used 'customer 360' MDM data product as the main/sole data engineer in my team, but my role is really just that - I don't do much else outside of Snowflake. We also don't use Dbt so I don't have any real world experience with that either. Similar to another post made on here recently, I don't know how to do a lot of stuff that is mentioned on here simply because I've never had the chance to. I don't really know what containerisation is, I don't know how to spin up VM's, all the different Azure/AWS tools. In terms of technical skills, I would rank myself as the following:* SQL - Intermediate (maybe creeping into advanced here and there but I need AI help). I can write production level code* Data modelling - beginner (can design/build a 3nf and star schema, I dont understand data vault)* Python - I'm not specialised at all as we don't really use Python too much but I can write Python code well enough that it is understood by anyone, although it might not be optimal, and I can understand/copy most Python code I've seen. I have a few Python projects I've done over the years.* APIs - no experience* Kafka - understand the concepts but I find it so complicated. I've made a new topics and connectors with a lot of help.* Dbt - 2 projects I've done on my own, no experience at work.* Airflow - played around with it with some personal projects but nothing major - my team doesn't use it at work so I have no opportunity to* CI/CD - fairly good understanding* Documentation - I can make good documentation.",

        "content": "hello. After 6 years of working in data analytics with NGOs, I transitioned last year to a data engineering role. I was hired for the position because I have decent python/ SQL while every other technical person uses R or Excel. My manager, who worked in big companies, worked with big 4 consulting, and taught data engineering at university, is the lead of our data unit. we are expected to centralize survey data across multiple countries and different Humanitarian contexts. The problem is my manager is not taking the lead on any work related to this objective, strategy or implementation. He spent 9 months doing nothing but small contributions to an internal R package, correcting data tests for new hires, and organizing meetings. while I found myself doing tool discovery and teaching myself DE from the ground up. for now I have managed to. write a data ingestion pipeline with dlt, orchestrated with GitHub actions running via docker on azure. But I am getting frustrated as I am not getting the technical guidance, not the strategic Vision for the project. I feel like our progress is too small, and eventually someone from the senior team (who are not data engineering knowledgeable) will notice and fire us. I asked him multiple times to push back on menial small tasks , and he does for a while then goes back to the same shtick. The one time I managed to engage him in the implementation of the pipeline, he fixated on dlt getting 'seemingly' stuck at the load phase, took 3 weeks experimenting.. only for me to take on the same task and write a report in two days about how the issue is that our postgres instance runs out of IOPS quickly during initial loads and the slowness has nothing with dlt or my implementation. I am asking for guidance on how to make the best out of this as I am certain I cannot make the move to another job any time soon .",

Iceberg tables with partitions just aren’t properly supported by Terraform, so we ended up with a pretty ugly workaround that’s hard to read, reason about, and debug.I’m curious: Do you run a similar setup?

Do you bootstrap tables some other way (dbt, SQL, custom scripts, Glue jobs, etc.) and keep Terraform only for the “hardcore-infra”?Would love to hear how others are approaching this and what’s worked (or not) for you.

Due to memory and compute limits (I’m currently using Google Colab), I can’t load the entire dataset into memory at once.What I’ve done so far:- Randomly sampled ~1 lakh (100k) rows- Performed EDA on the sample to understand distributions, correlations, and basic patternsHowever, I’m concerned that sampling may lose important data context, especially:- Outliers or rare events- Long-tail behavior- Rare categories that may not appear in the sampleSo I’m considering an alternative approach using pandas chunking:- Read the data with chunksize=1_000_000- Define separate functions for:- preprocessing- EDA/statistics- feature engineeringApply these functions to each chunkStore the processed chunks in a listConcatenate everything at the end into a final DataFrameMy questions:1. Is this chunk-based approach actually safe and scalable for ~30M rows in pandas?2. Which types of preprocessing / feature engineering are not safe to do chunk-wise due to missing global context?3. If sampling can lose data context, what’s the recommended way to analyze and process such large datasets while still capturing outliers and rare patterns?4. Specifically for Google Colab, what are best practices here?-Multiple passes over data?-Storing intermediate results to disk (Parquet/CSV)?-Using Dask/Polars instead of pandas?I’m trying to balance:-Limited RAM-Correct statistical behavior-Practical workflows (not enterprise Spark clusters)Would love to hear how others handle large datasets like this in Colab or similar constrained environments",

        "content": "Hi all,I am ingesting data from an API. On each notebook run - one run each hour - the notebook makes 1000 API requests. In the notebook, all the API responses get combined into a single Dataframe, and the dataframe gets written to a bronze delta lake table (append mode).Next, a gold notebook reads the newly inserted data from the bronze table (using a watermark timestamp column) and writes it to a gold table (also append).On the gold table, I will run optimize or auto compaction, in order to optimize for end user queries. I'll also run vacuum to remove old, unreferenced parquet files.However, on the bronze layer table, is it necessary to run optimize and vacuum there? Or is it just a waste of resources?Initially I'm thinking that it's not necessary to run optimize and vacuum on this bronze layer table, because end users won't query this table. The only thing that's querying this table frequently is the gold notebook, and it only needs to read the newly inserted data (based on the ingestion timestamp column). Or should I run some infrequent optimize and vacuum operations on this bronze layer table?For reference, the bronze table has 40 columns, and each hourly run might return anything from ten thousand to one million rows.Thanks in advance for sharing your advices and experiences.",

I come from a non-technical background and so it's been a steep learning curve for me. I've learnt a lot but I'm struggling to balance pragmatism and best practice. For context:\\- We are a small team on a central data platform \\- We do not have any defined data modelling standards or governance standards that are implemented\\- The plan was to move away from our current implementation towards a data mart design. We have a DA but there's no alignment at the senior leadership level across product and architecture so their priorities are elsewhere\\- Analysts sit in another department The engineers on my team are understandably advocating for bringing in some foundational modelling, standards work but the company expects quick outputs. I want to avoid over-engineering but I'm concerned we will incur a lot of tech debt later on down the line that will need to be unpacked - that's on top of the company not getting the value it envisioned with a platform.For anyone who has been in this situation do you have any guidance on whether you have:\\- Taken a step back to focus on foundational work? I know a full-scale enterprise data model is not happening at this point but is there something we can begin to bring into our sprints for our higher value use cases? \\- Do you have a definition of 'good enough' to help keep you moving while minimising later pain? I really want to do the best for the team while bearing in mind the questions I know I'll get from leadership in the value of this kind of work. I've been collecting data around trust and in interpreting the data to help evidence this.A huge thank you in advance .",

        "content": "Where I work, there is no Scrum. Tickets keep coming in, and the coordinator distributes them and sets priorities. There are no sprints, because management frequently overrides priorities due to requests from the board and other management areas—almost on a daily basis. It’s basically a ticket queue that we execute as it comes.During the day, I receive many different demands: validating data, mapping new tables, checking alerts from failed processes, discussions about possible data inconsistencies, reviewing PRs, helping interns, answering questions from people on other teams, etc.Sometimes more than 10 people message me at the same time on Teams. I try to filter, organize priorities, and postpone what is not feasible to do on the same day, but more demands arrive than I can realistically handle, so tasks keep piling up.We do have a team board, but I don’t like tracking everything there because some tasks are things like “talk to person X about Y” or “validate what person X did wrong,” which I don’t want to expose directly to colleagues and managers. So on the board I keep things more generic, without many commentsLately, I’ve been putting everything into a single markdown file (tasks and personal notes). The most urgent items go to the top of the list as a simple TODO, but it keeps growing and sometimes it becomes hard to manage tasks and prioritiesNaturally, there are tasks that never get done. My manager is aware of this and agrees that they should only be prioritized when it makes sense, but new ones keep coming in, and I miss having a tool where I could search for similar tasks or something along those linesHave you ever faced this difficulty in organizing tasks? Do you have any tips for a simple workflow? I tried using some tools like Todoist and Taskwarrior, but I ended up preferring the ease of searching in a single file, even though it grows very large very quickly and eventually becomes messy and difficult to manage.

        "content": "Afternoon folks, long time lurker, first time poster. I have spent some time recently getting up to speed with different ways to work with data in/out of Apache Iceberg and exploring different analytics tools / visualisation options. I use Cloudflare a lot for my side projects, and have recently seen the 'Beta' data platform products incl. the idea of https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/. So, I decided to give it a go and see if I can build a real end to end data pipeline (the example is product analytics in this case but you could use it for other purposes of course). I hope the link to my own project is OK, but it's MIT / open source: https://github.com/cliftonc/icelight.My reflections / how it works:\\- Its definitely a beta, as I had to re-create the pipelines once or twice to get it all to actually sync through to R2 ... but it really works! \\- There is a bit of work to get it all wired up, hence why I created the above project to try and automate it. \\- You can run analytics tools (in this example DuckDB - https://duckdb.org/) in containers now and use these to analyse data on R2. \\- Workers are what you use to bind it all together, and they work great. \\- I think (given zero egress fees in R2) you could run this at very low cost overall (perhaps even inside the free tier if you don't have a lot of data or workload). No infrastructure at all to manage, just 2 workers and a container (if you want DuckDB). \\- I ran into quite a few issues with DuckDB as I didn't fully appreciate that its single process constraints - I had always assumed it was actually a real server - but actually it seems to now work very well with a bit of tweaking, and the fact it is near Postgres capable but running on parquet files on R2 is nothing short of amazing. \\- I have it flushing every minute at the moment to R2, not sure what this means longer term but will send a lot more data at it over coming weeks and see how it goes. Happy to talk more about it if anyone is interested in this, esp. given Cloudflare is very early into the data engineering world. I am in no way affiliated with Cloudflare, though if anyone from Cloudflare is listening I would be more than happy to chat about my experiences :D",

I've been in my most recent role for 3 years and I realised at about the 2 year mark that I was about as senior as I could get in my team and was not learning anything new - simply applying my extensive experience/knowledge on the field to providing solutions/analyses for stakeholders.That realisation combined with a live demonstration from Snowflake on the agentic future of analysis got me looking for the next logical career step. There is a data engineering secondment opportunity in my org that will likely be made permanent, so I really need to knuckle down and decide.Over the last year, the most enjoyment that I've had has not been when providing any insights, but in building data models for reports and in creating small tools using Streamlit/Python to help stakeholders/team members self-serve and reduce friction. The tool-building component is what I found the most enjoyment in because it was all new with a steep/rapid learning curve. Creating the actual permanent BI reports is also interesting and rewarding, but less engaging because there's generally less of a problem to solve there. What does everyone find the most engaging about their role in data engineering?I don't actually have any formal training or experience in working in an ITIL system as I've always operated under a merchandising/marketing team structure, so I'm not sure at all how I'd go with a more rigid structure and more rigid processes. Has anyone moved in a similar fashion from a more \"fast and loose\" team to a more structured/process-heavy team? What are the pros/cons there?And finally, what does everyone find the most frustating about data engineering? From my brief exposure to the teams that handle it, I imagine that it would be stuff like; undocumented data sources and trying to find the correct joins, validation and constant data quality checks, getting clear answers from a BA on the requirements so that you can create an efficient schema/model.",

        "author": "BuissnessRake",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello! This is my first post in this sub. I’ve seen a lot of strong practical advice here and would like to get multiple perspectives on how to approach a messy data cleanup and modeling problem.Until recently, I worked mostly at startups, so I never dealt with serious legacy data issues. I just joined a midsized private company as an “Analyst.” During the hiring process, after hearing about their challenges, I told them it sounded like they really needed a data engineer or more specifically an analytics engineer. They said nope we just need an analyst, which i thought was odd. FYI: They already have an ERP system, but the data is fragmented, difficult to retrieve, and widely acknowledged across the company as dirty and hard to work with.Once I joined, I got access to the tools I needed fairly quickly by befriending IT. However, once I started digging into the ERP backend, I found some fundamental problems. For example, there are duplicated primary keys in header tables. While this can be handled downstream, it highlights that even basic principles like first normal form were not followed. I understand ERPs are often denormalized, but this still feels extreme.Some historical context that likely contributed to this:* In the past, someone was directly injecting data via SQL* The company later migrated to a cloud ERP* Business processes have changed multiple times since thenAs a result, naming conventions, supplier numbers, product numbers, and similar identifiers have all changed over time, often for the same logical entity. Sales data is especially messy. Some calculated fields do not align with what is defined in the ERP’s data dictionary, and overall there is very little shared understanding or trust in the data across the company.Constraints I am working under:* I have read-only access to the ERP and cannot write data back, which is appropriate since it is the raw source* of-course the ERP is not a read-optimized database, so querying it directly is painful* There are over 20,000 tables in total, but after filtering out audit, temp, deprecated, and empty tables, I am down to roughly 500 tables* Total row count across those tables is likely 40 to 50 million rows, though normalization makes that hard to reason about* I am the first and only data-focused hireThe business context also matters. There are no real long-term data goals right now. Most work is short-term:* One-week automations of existing manual processes* One to two month dashboard and reporting projectsStakeholders primarily want reports, dashboards, and automated spreadsheets. There is very little demand for deeper analysis, which makes sense given how unreliable the underlying data currently is. Most teams rely heavily on Excel and tribal knowledge, and there is effectively zero SQL experience among stakeholders.My initial instinct was to stand up a SQL Server or PostgreSQL instance and start building cleaned, documented models or data marts by domain. However, I am not convinced that:1. I will get buy-in for that approach2. It is the right choice given maintainability and the short-term nature of most deliverablesAs a fallback, I may end up pulling subsets of tables directly into Power BI and doing partial cleaning and reshaping using Power Query transformations just to get something usable in front of stakeholders.So my core question is: **How would you approach cleaning, organizing, documenting, and storing this kind of historically inconsistent ERP data while still delivering short-term reports and dashboards that stakeholders are expecting?**If I am misunderstanding anything about ERPs, analytics engineering, or data modeling in this context, I would appreciate being corrected.",

My on-call rotation isn’t bad, and generally speaking there is only a handful of small things to worry about, re-triggering jobs, making sure next job ran fine if it’s important but not being paged important etc. but it def does effect my social life and I walk around all week with a gloomy stressed/anxious outlook (a lot of the issues that I get are edge cases and piecing together documentation from different sources to hopefully fix it, these don’t happen often but it’s usually coincidentally me getting them alot lol). I work in the transportation/logistics/shipping industry, so we are a 24/7 company, so we have to make sure data is up to date for all groups around the clock, a majority are 9-5 processes, but we do have our big loads in the morning when generally speaking it’s a bit lighter.I feel it’s part of the course for being in data that it’s not uncommon to be on-call, but would love to know what industries I should look at generally that do not have an on call rotation",

        "content": "I’m a senior developer working currently as a Team Leader for big corporation. We are currently recruiting and amount of junior, mid and sometimes even senior developers, who cannot write a simple code by their own without using AI is absolutely ridicoulous.AI can be helpful at work, but when you learn, it can hurt you more than it helps. It gives you answers too fast. You paste the code, it runs, and you feel good for a moment… but you don’t really know why it works. Then later you get a different problem, something small changes, and suddenly you are stuck. And the worst part is: you don’t build the “debug muscle”, and debugging is a big part of programming.I see this with juniors sometimes. They can produce code, but when I ask “why did you do it this way?” they can’t explain. When tests fail, they panic. When an error shows up, they don’t know what to try first. It’s not because they are not smart. It’s because AI took the hard part away, and that hard part is exactly what builds skill and confidence.When you learn, the best thing is to struggle a little. Write the code yourself. Read the error message. Try to understand what the program is doing. Use print logs or a debugger. Read docs. It feels slow and annoying at first, but this is how you become strong. This is how you start to “see” problems.If you really want to use AI, use it like a helper, not like a driver. Ask for a hint, not a full solution. Ask what an error means. Ask to explain one line. And only do it after you tried alone for some time.",

Noticed clear patterns across all successful implementations that our initial design was completely missing.They make sharing incredibly easy with pre-written messages and one-click options, show clear benefit to both referrer and referred person like \"give $10 get $10\", display progress toward rewards so you know how close you are, prompt sharing at natural moments like after completing task not randomly, make rewards actually valuable not just badges or points.Applied all these patterns to our feature by simplifying sharing to one click with customizable message, implemented two-sided incentive with real value, added progress tracking prominently, triggered share prompts after positive experiences like successful workflow completion.Feature launched 3 weeks ago and referral rate is 23% meaning almost quarter of users refer at least one person, PM says that's way higher than initial goal of 10%. Honestly just copied what works for other products instead of making up our own approach, turns out proven patterns exist for most features and following them works better than trying to be original.Biggest lesson is when building growth features research is more important than innovation, these patterns have been tested millions of times already so just implement what works.

Is it okay to start directly with Go, and are there enough junior Golang jobs?",

It's not that I dont like my work, in fact i love doing it, i love fixing bugs and solving problems, but when i hear others talk, especially people younger or also having the same year of experience as i have, talk about programming, using terminologies in which i have no idea what they are or what they mean, using different tools and knowing lots of stuff a beginner programmer should know, i cant even do the technical stuff like setting up projects, i keep thinking to myself that i am nowhere as good as my peers. I start to doubt my work and losing hope on improving. One of the main reason i learned how to program (learnt more on the job than i did in college majoring in programming) and do my work is due to the already existing code and learning from it, and i guess i can understand basic programming logic, also being reliant on AI. Outside from work, nothing,I have no idea about anything not involving my work. Idk just sharing cause i feel like a fraud after seeing people try so hard learning programming and truly genuinely is trying to learn. I tried learning but the feeling of being a fraud actually stops me from trying even more.Edit: Now with AI booming, programming might not be my career path.",

Like when learning promises, I'd link it back to callback functions and explain how they solve callback hell. Building a web of connected knowledge instead of isolated facts.I also keep a running list of common mistakes I make in a separate doc. Like forgetting to return in array methods or mixing up async/await syntax. Reviewing my actual errors is way more useful than rereading correct examples. Stack overflow obviously helps when I'm stuck but I try to understand WHY something works instead of just copying the solution.My current setup is a mix of tools that work together pretty well. I use vscode obviously for coding, github for version control and tracking my projects. For learning and retention, I keep my notes in remnote cause it automatically makes flashcards and quizzes from my notes. I also use codepen for quick experiments when I want to test something without setting up a whole project.Still got a long way to go but at least now I'm not forgetting everything I learned last week. If you're struggling with retention maybe try something similar, just actively test yourself instead of passively rereading notes. MDN docs are great as reference but terrible for remembering stuff.",

        "content": "I've been learning and teaching code for 3+ years now. When I first started, I spent 6 months on tutorials—Udemy courses, YouTube playlists, online guides. I could explain what a function was, what a loop did, but I couldn't build anything without a tutorial holding my hand.The frustrating part? Everyone said \"Just build something!\" but nobody explained WHAT the gap actually was.Here's what changed for me:**The Gap:** Tutorials teach you SYNTAX. Real development teaches you DECISION-MAKING.When I built my first real Laravel API (not a tutorial project), I hit a wall I'd never seen: \"How do I structure the database for this?\" A tutorial would say \"use this schema.\" Real work demands: \"Why this schema vs. that schema? What are the trade-offs?\"**Three Projects That Actually Made Me a Developer:**1. **A broken todo app where users couldn't delete items.** Sounds silly, right? But it forced me to learn soft-delete logic, migrations, rollback procedures. That project taught me more than 20 tutorials.2. **An inventory system for a friend's small business.** Suddenly I had a real user with real expectations. I couldn't hide behind \"this is just practice.\" I had to handle authentication properly, learn payment integration, deal with edge cases (what if someone deletes a product while another user is viewing it?).3. **Rebuilding my first API from scratch.** After 6 months, I looked at my original code and realized it was garbage. No structure, no error handling, no validation. I rebuilt it properly. That's when I went from \"I can code\" to \"I understand why code is structured this way.\"**The Biggest Mistake I Made:**I spent 3 months optimizing my code for performance before I even had users. Completely pointless. Turns out the real bottleneck was database queries, not my beautiful algorithms.**What Finally Clicked:**It wasn't a single moment. It was repeating this cycle 10+ times:* Build something broken* Realize it's broken when it's used* Fix it properly* Understand WHY it broke* Never make that mistake againThat's how you actually learn.**For anyone reading this:** You're not broken if tutorials feel useless and real projects feel impossible. That's literally everyone. The gap is real. You close it by building 10 bad projects, not 100 good tutorials.What's the ONE project that finally made coding click for you? I'm genuinely curious what the turning point was.",

I think it would be very helpful to use a mobile app builder⁤ to get off the ground, so please let me know if you have any recommendations⁤ for an app builder too!For context, I'm a Data Analyst working from home and I have a lot of free time after work that I want to use for something productive.

Anyway too much information but my question is does anybody have any recommendation where to find a tutor to help with Assignments, studying for Exams, etc? Our school actually has a free tutoring service for CS majors but most of the tutors are juniors or seniors and I think they just do it for their resume since you can tell their heart is not really in it lol.... No offence but yeah I want someone who can actually focus on the specific problems I have and guide me through the work so I can actually UNDERSTAND it not just do the problem in front of me and say \"See?\" And I also tried a site called Wyzant last semester, it's honestly quite expensive and the guy I chose was actually quite good but honestly a bit unreliable with scheduling and stuff so we didn't end up meeting much.

Should I spend more time trying to resolve these problems? I feel like, as someone starting out, it would be a waste of time to spend hours stuck, rather than learning from my mistakes.",

This happens every time i try to learn even though I always try my hardest to understand what every line of code does, so I was just wondering how do you guys keep all that info stored in your heads, should I be taking notes while learning?

But I’ve recently been reading about the job market for ux/ui design (which is my area of interest and eventual job seeking) and have read that the barrier of entry is a lot higher and that AI will be doing a lot of the front-end work for companies. I’m concerned that I’d be wasting my time only focusing on front-end and not have it pay off. I like programming because you have to keep up with emerging technologies and always have to improve. With that said I have some questions:1. Will getting a cs degree actually help me find a job? From what I read on this subreddit it seems like everybody recommends that you have a degree to stand out and land a job. 2. Should I continue my self study and switch to a full stack learning program to stand out? (Which I’m seriously considering) And if I do what additional learning should I do? I’ve read on here that DSA is something that companies look for when hiring, should I add that to things I should study? What projects should I create that will help me stand out to companies when I feel competent enough in my skills? (Again under the assumption I switched to full stack) I welcome all feedback! Don’t hold back, I need the REALITY of what I need or should do. I’m fully committed continuing learning, I just need a better idea of the path ahead of me. Thanks",

        "content": "I'm a manual QA who is interested in learning to code with the purposes of moving out of QA and into a jr role (eventually. I know it's a long game.) My unit is going to be downsizing over the next year or two as our automation platforms increase in scope weening out the need for largescale manual testers. This will be the second time I'm going to get downsized out in replacement for devs. I want to avoid going through this cycle a third time, so I'm making it a priority to start learning development so perhaps I can move into something a little more stable longterm. (Let's pretend AI isn't a thing at the moment.) Here's the issue: I don't really own any personal computers. I've always had work issued machines, and I can't use it for personal projects. What I do have is an old thinkpad (I'm talking really old.) I've since swapped the old harddrive out and replaced it with an SSD and doubled the ram so it's at least functional... I then installed Ubuntu on it. With legacy hardware such as this (it's a thinkpad x220 from 2011....that keyboard tho!) what are my actual options? I know I won't be building native iOS apps on this brick.... but what are some domains I could actually consider working towards some subject matter learning? Coming from a windows only work environment, I'm actually very excited to work in a *unix environment proper. Here are things I'm interested in:* Ruby / Rails (ruby is so funky)* Webdev in general (html/css/js + framework of choice)* C development / OS dev / Kernel Dev (out of my league difficulty wise but probably the most doable on legacy linux machine)* infosec / security (I can mangle this laptop, nobody will care.)* stretch option: windows app dev with c# and visual studioI'm very curious about programs like The Odin project for one of the first two points. Looking through it, its interesting that it forces you to use git and pull down and push up your work into a github repo which is FANTASTIC to replicate a real life workflow. I really don't like writing in the browser based editor for freecodecamp (though, it might migrate me to an editor later in the program I dunno)Given that linux is a brand new thing to me, I'm finding it to be an amazing environment to move around in. It's just so fascinating. It would be a good place to learn C because I'm not afraid of blowing up the machine by messing with a kernel file or something. (I have ubuntu on a bootable USB and can full wipe/install in about 20 minutes)AS someone who only has cursory domain knowledge of these areas of interest, there are likely things I'm not fully aware of, or considering when making a decision. If you or your best friend asked you \"I have this old POS laptop with linux on it and I want to turn it into a second career eventually. What should I do?\" How would you answer? Thanks so much!",

I'm in my senior year, my friends keep saying I am in a good situation (they’re focused on frontend and UI/UX, so I’m not in the same boat as them), that I am in a better state than they are, but I don't know what to do in the internship or OJT phase of uni, I tried to apply once for voluntary internship, but there was an assessment, within 2 weeks we need to learn a framework as an assessment we need to finish a 2 full stack web application, first one I passed I used a REST architecture which I am familiar with so it was easy, then the second one we need to learn Vue js as-well as graphql in ruby on rails, ruby on rails was the easy part, but the time constraint on finishing the assessment was the problem, had trouble in balancing uni and that assessment, so I was removed, and I haven't tried to apply to an internship again after that. The main problem I have right now is that I overly relied on AI in my later projects. I know how to code (OOP concepts, SOLID and DRY), some DSA, but on coding interviews, I didn't do well. I overthink the solution, and so I failed some test cases. I'm trying to relearn what I knew before AI affected me. Any advice in general, I'm taking a Java NC III class right now, as well, to rebuild my Java familiarity. I'm in my senior year, and I don't know what internship I want. Should I go dev because I have been doing this for a very long time, or go into networking, because that is a niche and programming is needed there as well?",

(learning for fun, will probably have project ideas to implement in the future as I'm always full of project ideas)Now the course is making me download a code editor (sounds relevant indeed, was starting how much longer I would only be able to code inside the course's website) which is called Visual Studio Code. But when I went to download it I realised they advertise themselves as an open-source AI code editor. I'm all for open source, but the AI bit really bugs me. I don't want AI nowhere near my projects, like, ever (I want a planet i can keep living on), and especially not when learning (I teach (human) languages and maths and know how important the thinking process is) (and no i'm not using Codecademy's AI and am annoyed that it is there but at least i don't have to click the button? So wish there'd be free / cheap courses without AI too but couldn't find them either).So I tried looking up \"no AI text editors\" and only found \"no-code AI tools\". I tried \"AI-free\" stuff and found \"free AI\" stuff.Is there somewhere, like a list of resources, that I could find good non AI text editors, and any non-AI things I may need in the future (I don't even know what I'll need lol)If you have old non-AI tools that are still perfectly functional what are they? *(not sure if context is useful, I'm learning HTML + CSS on Windows, probably will be switching to Linux soon)*Thanks for the help! :)",

I don’t have a strong background in search / constraint solving / routing algorithms, so explanations at a conceptual or introductory level are very welcome.This link should show the geometry of the problem and some attempts I made with explanations of why I rejected them, but hopefully the problem makes sense without it.

I don't **KNOW** that there exists a solution with the constraints I've set forth but i think there probably should be. If anyone can show that there cannot exist a solution for some reason and suggest alternate constraints that most closely match what I have while having a solution that would be appreciated too.# What I’m asking for* Is this a known class of problem (or combination of problems)? I've looked at a number of approaches but none of them seem to fully encapsulate the problem.* Are there standard algorithmic approaches or heuristics for problems like this?* Is this usually approached with backtracking, graph search, maze-routing ideas, constraint programming, or something else?* Are there examples of similar problems (even outside batteries) that might be good references?I’m not (necessarily) looking for a turnkey solution (though if i was provided with a simple answer I would not be upset) I’m trying to understand **how people normally reason about and structure problems like this** so I can move in a productive direction.This kind of combinatorial / routing problem is *not* what I usually work on, so I may not know the right terminology or standard methods. If you have suggestions, explanations, or even “you should look up X” pointers, I’d really appreciate it.Thanks for reading, and I’m happy to clarify details if needed.",

Using these, I try to figure out which shift an employee worked, whether they were late, overtime, etc. Day shifts work perfectly fine, but night shifts and overlapping shifts are causing issues.Shifts are very flexible: some start early, others late, many cross midnight, and some overlap. Because of this, grouping punches by calendar day doesn’t work. Processing is done by a scheduled job that must run at a specific time. The problem is that at that moment, some shifts are still in progress while others are starting, which leads to incomplete or incorrect grouping—for example, a punch during a night shift might be interpreted as a full shift or a very short one.I’m looking for a general approach to assign raw timestamped events to shifts when shifts can overlap or be incomplete at processing time. Any patterns, strategies, or best practices would be super helpful.",

She started to give ds that don't fit, couldn't state time complexity of alternatives, even the most simple array.Twist: I wrote review to recruiter stating that I high suspected she uses AI code generator during the interview.

I leave work exhausted from doing absolutely nothing, which is somehow worse than having too much to do.Some coworkers told me to wait until my manager officially moves me into the main plant, but the waiting is starting to feel endless.

For those of us who don't have plenty of YOE, you will get drowned out by other candidates who do. That's the reality. There are simply too many people applying to public job postings for the odds to be in your favor. It's possible to make it this way, but highly unlikely.**If you are a new grad, junior, or intermediate, networking is the key.** You must lean on your network. Tell your family, friends, and the people you bump into what you're looking for. Take that step, make the cringe LinkedIn post to announce your job hunt is underway, mention what you're good at, and ask your peers to chime in and leave a nice comment. My ego prevented me from doing this for too long, but as soon as I did, people reached out. Since then, I've been in so many interviews that I don't even have time to apply for jobs.

        "content": "This past week I was asked to tech lead a project that was completely vibe coded by senior VPs and c suite at my company, and I kind of have no idea what’s going on.One of the high ups that I report up through, got me on a one on one call and spent a good amount of time glazing me before explaining that the him and a lot of other executives at the company have spent the past couple months vibe coding what he described as “the most important product at the company right now”.He then proceeded to say that he really wants me to tech lead this product and get it into production. I think I was kind of still warm and fuzzy from being glazed so much that I just kind of immediately said yes (also in my experience when someone higher up, asked you to do something you say yes, that’s just kind of the way I’ve gotten as far as I have in my career, it sucks, but it’s paid off for me). He also mentioned that by accepting this, I was not allowed to hand code anything, I had to “fully embrace, vibe coding“ whatever that means. I also managed two other teams, that work on five other products and when I asked this individual “ what’s gonna happen there?” he basically was like “ you’ll pretty much be able to do this on the side!” :flushed_face:Basically, since then, I have pulled down the code and it’s a absolute mess, aside from the fact that the performance is utterly atrocious and it’s extremely slow and unintuitive, the code is literally a trash fire pile of AI generated slop. Absolutely no organization, insane architectural decisions that for the sake of anonymity, I won’t go into. And overall, just like an insane volume of code that it would take a human being a very very very, very, very, very, very long time to read through and understand even half of it.All the while I’ve been trying to make heads or tails of the code base the executives keep pushing 1 million commits a day, they are like rejoicing in their slack channel. They are so over the moon that finally they can just build whatever they want. Ironically they don’t see the pattern that every time they push something they report a bug or report something else being broken, but I’m also not banking on them noticing that pattern.They keep making remarks about how companies that aren’t doing exactly what they’re doing right now are going to fail. They keep making remarks that they finally solved the puzzle. It’s becoming clear that they do not value software engineers and they’ve got it all figured out, from their perspective.I’m not really sure what to do here, I have a product manager that has been tapped to product manage this and we had a call today where we were basically”WTF is going on”. We have a meeting next week to level set, but I’m just kind of anxious for the outcome of that part of me kinda just wants to say in the most professional way possible “ I don’t know what you guys really need me for it seems like you’ve got it figured out and if you don’t mind, I’d like to focus on my day-to-day tasks”.Like gun to my head, I think the idea of shipping this to customers is suicidal for our company. It’s an insane amount of code that no one really understands what’s going on, which means the only person that can effectively fix bugs is Claude and I’ve heard horror stories of Claude really not being able to handle big projects.I just don’t know what to do because I feel like if I was trusting my gut, I would say let’s slow down and talk about what we actually want to build, take some time to actually pass through the code and make sure that we’re making smart choices. But I just know that that would be met with such resentment and distain. I feel like this is a group of individuals that is so angry that for so long people that know what is going on have gotten in the way of what they want, which is more more more now now now.Has anyone else experience this? What should I do?",

They said at this stage they needed less development and a sales guy in my spot.I ask if it was performance related but they said no and only offered a little criticism that the only critique i had was I couldve understood certain parts of the app more but I literally built a big chunk of it so idk. The ceo even undercut that criticism by saying i certaintly could do my job better and look even if it was perfect I dont think it would effect this decision. Its just the stage were in and if this project were to ever pick back up we would love to you have you back. he said he thought the world of me and said i should know hes not the type to mince words but he said he would give a recommendation to whoever. My manager was all quiet in the corner and kinda just said he echoed what the ceo said and just said at this stage of the development we expected to be in a certain spot and it didnt happen.(I almost took that as a personal critique but idk its just raw right now). Apparently they made the decision during christmas but didnt want to tell me until now. I told them I would just walk out quietly at the end of the day(we only had 10 minutes left.) they both seemed genuinely sad but idk I expected my manager to say more knowing he knew but he was just tucked away quiet. Anyway im ranting but I guess thats just the nature of these types of jobs I guess. I kinda saw it coming when we were burning money and they couldnt get people fully on board with the beta. I just feel kinda used.Just kinda wanted some advice on what jobs are more stable. Ive literally done product oriented jobs with a established product. Consulting and now a start up.

Yes, I have been unemployed.What I can do is a fair amount of leetcode problems (easy to medium is perfectly doable, perhaps 60-70% of the mediums, hard can get tricky since that requires time complexity optimization)I am also able to think a bit creatively (not in an impressive way by any means, but just to express I’m not stunted in that category). For example earlier I thought of a blueprint of a website app (which I’m sure already exists, but it works side by side with how I feel at the moment, so I thought why not). Called “Today, I did it.” Basically enter within a field different activities you did for the day, run that though an ai api to quantify that action in numbers and spit it back out. There’s a daily meter/quota to fill and maybe some kind of currency that can be used to buy trophies (not sure yet). It definitely aligns with how I feel today, because I’ve been in a mental standstill for a long time now, and trying to push throughI guess my ultimate questions are:1. What are my options on getting back on my feet?2. Is programming completely out of the question at this point?3. What fields could I possibly pivot to with a computer science degree?4. How in the world do I hide the idle period between 2018 and now? I’m sure it looks horribleThanks in advance",

        "content": "Hi all,Apple is my dream company and I have been practising very hard for the interviews. I currently work at one of the big banks, graduated from a top 10 CS uni (no 1 in country) and have 2.5 years of professional experience. Life there is good, I get along well with colleagues and we like each other, but my goal has always been to get into a big tech company. The bureaucracy and nature of a bank really stifles engineering i feel, hence my decision to transfer. I simply felt Apple is the pinnacle of engineering standards and I would want to learn from Apple instead.Recently, I had the interview with the hiring manager for the first round and he seemed really disinterested in me early on, but not necessarily from the start. His body language shows it, he would rock his body back and forth. He asked me only resume-focused questions and just asked one simple technical question which i got correct and then ended the interview.I was quite taken aback because when i sit for interviews at the other major tech companies, I had expected a rigorous technical questions but it wasnt the case for Apple which felt really strange to me. Then, yesterday (2 days after my interview) my status on the applications portal showed in the 'Archived' state.To add on some context, I feel it might have been my work experience. I am relatively early in my career but have a few short stints of about 1 year each and I am only 10 months in the bank.Also, in the bank, we dont have root access and i read in big tech they tune kernel parameters for the hyper-scale traffic, use /proc for troubleshooting as it has less overhead and has more info like we can see what version of binary its run, spread out interrupts alongside cores (RSS), etc. So, my Linux professional experience is clearly not stellar tho i know a lot of theory from reading.When i described some stuff to the hiring manager specifically about our disaster recovery process, i am guessing it could feel really different and strange to him that we have to take screenshots and failover abruptly (not canary) and other stuff but that is simply the protocol of the bank.I would appreciate any advice from you all on my situation. If you were an interviewer / hiring manager , why would you behave the way the Apple Hiring Manager did to me during my interview ? I have been very polite throughout but sth about my interview he was probably dissatisfied. Maybe I rambling away or what not ?Thank you to this awesome community in advance and you all have a great week ahead!",

        "author": "LongjumpingPage6168",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, like the title, I don't understand the point of online coding assessments that major companies give on HackerRank, CodeSignal, CodeVue, etc. that we have to do on our own, while being proctored with camera and microphones on. I am OK with technical interviews with another engineer where we can code together and I can communicate my thoughts, processes, and my knowledge while programming. However, what's the point of stupid online assessments that major companies shove down our throats? You tell me that I have to do these proctored online assessments without any access to Internet (I cannot search for syntax or anything related to the coding problems) and I have to program with the camera and microphones on, and I cannot talk or look at anywhere else during the assessment because I'm afraid they would cause me of cheating. No one would hear me communicating my thoughts or processes during coding. And if I cannot pass all test cases within the time limit, I'm automatically eliminated from the hiring process, and my application would be thrown away, all of my past work experiences, skills, and projects I have gained over the years would be useless for them. And even if I pass all the test cases, I can still not move forward due to other reasons.People said that I have to do LeetCode, and I have practiced on my own for years on both LC, HackerRank, CodeSignal,... and solved over 100 problems... I also reviewed all data structures and algorithms again, but at the end, what's the use? Even when doing coding assignments in classes my professors allow us to search online but why cannot I search anything during these stupid assessments? And you know that most of us cannot pass these assessments in this way. So, I fear that even if I do 1000 to 10,000 LC problems the result is still the same, when I know that the companies only care if I pass all the test cases in these coding assessments.And funnily, I got my first part-time web developer job on campus, and my first IT infrastructure internship at a Fortune 500 multi-industry company without any LeetCode-style interviews. Especially in the hiring process for my first internship program, I only had to go through phone screen with a recruiter, and a behavioral interview with the IT manager where we discuss about my projects and past experiences, and within a week, I got hired for the program. But now, I did not get the return offer from the company so I have to do all of these LC over again with no hope.I feel like this is the only thing that fails me to get the full-time career I need after my graduation in May 2026. The other things like resume, networking, communication, interview skills, I am still learning and improving everyday, but these assessments feel hopeless to me. Just thinking about how I can be unemployed after graduation drives me crazy and makes me feel so embarrassed.And I've heard some people said I can skip these assessments with referrals. Is this true? I have friends who are working in these companies and I used to work with some of them, or we had little interactions but we're still in good terms. How do I reach out to them in a professional way to get the referrals? Can someone tell me? I'm out of options.",

        "content": "Inspired by a [previous post](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1or3gyj/my_experience_interviewing_in_2025_with_5_yoe/) from a few months back.Sankey diagram: https://i.imgur.com/sYt3l2y.pngSome terms:* Withdrawn = I withdrew from the process, due to lack of interest for moving forward, or for timing* Rejected = They rejected me and communicated so* Ghosted = They did not respond (either to the initial application or after any rounds had been completed)* Outreach = They reached out to me via email (cold, to my personal inbox) or referral (someone I used to work with connected me with the founder/recruiter)Some tidbits about my profile:* I've worked exclusively at small-to-medium startups, anywhere between Seed and Series C* Based in San Francisco, open to remote or hybrid roles* Current base in the range of 230-250k* Currently employed, with tenure 4 years* Full stack SWE looking for full stack / frontend roles* This is my third time doing a serious job search of this manner.* Total YOE = 7Been at my current company for over 4 years, and looking to leave to find new challenges and more interesting work. Outside of that I was pretty happy at my job and would not have minded if I didn't get any offers (other than the obvious blow to my ego).Almost all of my jobs were applied through Welcome To The Jungle, formerly Otta. I responded to a few recruiter email reachouts, but only if the recruiter worked directly for the company, rather than for a third party. I did not apply to any companies as practice; I only applied to companies that I genuinely wouldn't mind working for and whose salary range was within at least what I was making now, or more.Almost all companies followed a pretty standard process - recruiter call, technical screen, hiring manager screen, onsite. All companies did not ask any leetcode or brainteaser questions (I did my best to filter those companies out). One company had an online assessment before I talked to anyone, and a take-home later in the process that took ~10 hours. I had fun doing the take home and did not mind the time it took.Preparing for my interview was pretty straightforward. Because I was targeting companies with no leetcode, I did not prepare for coding assessments at all. I did well on interviews that required me to write code (save for one, where I flubbed due to a misunderstanding of the problem / incorrect assumption as it was based on a real-life product). For system design, I used the free versions of HelloInterview (I did not pay for membership like the other post), but I did have an existing lifetime membership for GreatFrontEnd for FE system design. I did not find it that useful for the interviews I encountered.For scheduling interviews, the majority of them were scheduled from 6AM-9AM PT (east coast morning), or (2PM-6PM PT) (west coast afternoons), depending on where the company was located.For the companies that I got rejected, I think my weakest area was for sure system design questions, and doing technical deep dives of my work projects. Two of the five companies that rejected me provided detailed feedback, which I appreciated and understood their perspective. Some rejections were purely tactical errors on my part.In the end (just before new years), I accepted a remote role for +20% base, and a lot more equity than my current role. The role I accepted was one where I was most interested in the company anyway; both offers I received were from companies I would've been happy joining. The entire process took a little less than two months from the initial offer being sent, to me accepting an offer.Happy to answer any questions.",

This team is entirely focused on replacing an existing internal platform within the company and I've been stuck on doing mindless CRUD work for the entire 2+ years I've been working. The product is essentially created out of a war started between two directors who disagreed on the current approach of the platform at the company.Besides the messy team origins, my biggest difficulty has been gaining a deeper domain knowledge and be able to insert myself into key initiatives. I'm not sure if it's bad luck or just me not being smart about which work I pick up, but I somehow always end up taking tasks that don't help me to stand out or make a huge noticeable impact. Our team suffers from very poorly written stories and constantly unclear product requirements so it tends to be a roulette when taking on work for the sprint.Additionally, sometimes seniors and tech leads are secluded from ad hoc conversations that happen between leadership, so requirements get changed on the fly at times or critical information is missed leading to mistakes and constant miscommunication of requirements.Regardless, I screwed up during these few years and couldn't make a name for myself within my org. I've missed my chance to work on more impactful projects and take ownership on bigger features. I've fallen into the state of being a feature monkey and don't see myself going forward any further nor do I think it's worth as several engineers and managers have already begun leaving my org.This experience has made me question whether I should even bother continuing engineering as a career. I'm starting to think I'll be capped as a junior / mid level engineer due to my inability to play the game right. I already feel so behind compared to my peers and have really nothing impressive to talk about in interviews in terms of feature ownership.Overall, working at corporate has started to make me dislike development and I have no motivation or energy to upskill or tackle side projects anymore. I'm pretty lost as for what to do at this point as no team is willing to hire internally and my current endeavors for external opportunities has been absolutely awful. Anyone else feel this way?tl;dr: mediocre engineer barely surviving at current company, starting to resent full stack work, and hopeless in terms of other job prospects",

        "content": "I’ve been working as a backend engineer for around 2 years now, and lately I’ve been feeling pretty disengaged.Most of the work feels like *gluing things together*: APIs, ORMs, queues, configs, cloud services, etc. Even when it’s “complex,” it often feels like complexity from coordination rather than depth. I don’t feel like I’m learning fundamental ideas anymore, just new tools and patterns.I tried branching into AppSec thinking it would be deeper, but honestly it felt even more shallow lots of checklists, scanners, and “best practices,” with limited opportunity to really understand systems at a fundamental level (at least in what I’ve seen so far).Now I’m questioning a few things:* Is this just what industry software engineering feels like after the initial learning curve?* Am I just not going deep enough in backend (databases, distributed systems, performance, internals)?* Or should I pivot and focus more on computer science–heavy areas (OS, compilers, networking, databases) either through a role change or serious self-study?I don’t hate programming, but I miss the feeling of wrestling with hard problems instead of wiring services together. Curious if others felt this around the 2–3 YOE mark and what paths helped:* going deeper in backend?* moving to infra / systems / performance?* Masters and Phd (Academia)* or just accepting that most jobs are like this?Would appreciate perspectives from people a few years ahead of me. I come from a third world country so it might be an issue too. I do not see much capable SWE and the problems we are solving is just bs or easy things. Also most SWE have no real depth no cs foundations just vibe coding.",

The last job took me 400 apps in 2021 so I already know this isn't that many applications considering the current market. I’ve mainly been applying on LinkedIn and have been using Simplify to fill out applications.I realize I’m slowly falling apart because there’s a lot going on in my mind. I honestly feel like I’m not even that great of a developer yet. I spent so much time trying to rush my degree and focused on sending applications that I realized I’ve started to get worse at coding. I’m considering pursuing an OMSCS through Georgia Tech, but I’m not sure if a master’s degree is worth it right now. It would allow me to learn more, possibly specialize in ML/AI, and apply for internships. Admittingly it would also allow me to redirect my mental burden of job apps towards something else. On the other hand I might be spending more time and money for little to no difference.Typing this out I realize I should probably at least spend my time re-learning some of the things I’ve forgotten while building out some more projects. If anyone has any insight or a different job search approach they’d recommend I’d really appreciate it. I’m not too sure which job boards I should rely on outside of LinkedIn and I’m a little hesitant to use AI auto-apply resources.Added my resume below for review: [Resume](https://i.imgur.com/ZGPCMja.png)",

        "content": "This was for Delivery Consultant. My understanding, is that it's like a consulting arm of AWS where consultant go to clients and act as temporary employees more or less.Have 5YOE, been out of work for a year. Just got the AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification and then applied to the role. 2 months ago, contacted by recruiter after applcation and passed OA. My recruiter asked me to prep 10 STAR stories as well as LeetCode and to wait 3 weeks before scheduling the phone screen which I thought was overkill, but could appreciate that she wanted me to be as prepped as possible. Phone screen was with a chill friendly guy I believe one of the hiring managers for this department. We did 1 STAR with some follow ups, as well as a AWS system design problem which went over smoothly, and then a basic coding challenge which was easy to complete. He hinted that I would be moving forward, which I did 2 days later. Scheduled the final loop for a month right after the holidays.1st interview guy seemed chill and only asked LPs. Ended 15 min early.2nd interview, was with a woman who at end informed me she was not part of this department (so the bar raiser), had a friendly introduction. Again, only LPs where she did some follow up, but no hardcore grilling. Ended about 20 minutes early.3rd interview, was the hiring manager who also did only LPs with me. Again follow ups which I answered, but was prepared for. Halfway through the interview, she all of a sudden asks, you have experience working in small teams, but tell me about roles with big teams and organizations. I was a little off guard and asked if we were still doing the STAR format. She said if I wanted to. I gave a brief story about 3 years of my experience working at a large telecomm comapny (which I already answered with STAR stories from), and mentioned about the dozens of teams I interacted with, and how I worked in a major lift and shift project with microservices with over 50 services and 200 people. She went on and said how as an L5 they were looking for someone with experience leading large organizations, etc. even though at the beginning she said the role varies a lot (startups, large companies, short term and long term contracts) She then asked me the final LP. I asked if she wanted as story from the telecomm company. She glared at the screen and sharply answered \"sure\". I wasn't sure if this was hostility, or her following interview protocol, but I just mentioned I didnt have any stories left that I havent told her or answer that question, so I talked about one from my 1st job at a 6 person startup. At the end, she did a q and a, and then just said my recruiter would be the point of contact from now on. Again, didnt really read into it, but everyone else just mentioned \"oh, you got 3 interviews left, good luck\" or somethign like that. Ended 20 min early.4th interview next day, was friendly guy who did 1 LP, followed by some Leetcode. The coding was quite easy (easy/medium) and didn't really have much issues other than some syntax (like making sure 'self' was used when setting up the function). He was friendly and enthusiastic about me getting the optimal solutions. Ended on time.5th interview the following day was chill guy who did a few LP in the first half. The second half was a barrage of questions in sytem design. I got maybe 75% of them, especially the ones I remember from my SA Pro cert. The ones I didn't, he assured me it was ok, nobody gets them all. But who knows, maybe I missed some that I shouldn't have. We only had a minute left at the end for q and a, but he was willing to stay a bit overtime to answer questions for me.Next day, get the automated reject email. If I were to guess, it might have somethign to do with the 3rd interview with the hiring manager. From what I've read, most people feel they do well on their LPs, but who knows, maybe I didn't. I prepped the 10 STAR stories, and didn't reuse them for the same interviewer, but maybe I needed more across all of them? Researching, I've heard varying opinions. Finally, I dunno if I was just outclassed by another candidate or an internal candidate I don't know about. Just a bit down since I spent 2 months prepping LeetCode and refining and rehearsing my STAR stories.",

During the call they will mention what the tech stack is, what the project is about and why my experience is a good fit and more.One of the question is always \"why are you looking for a new role\". I usually answer it in an honest way and say that I am looking for more challenging engineering opportunities, faster pace environment etc.The recruiter will say that they will review my resume with the hiring manager and if they want to move forward they will set up an OA or move to a technical round.However, I haven't been able to move forward to the next round 3 times in a row now and I don't think it is an issue with my resume if I am getting noticed by the HR. Could it be that I answered the \"Why are you looking for a new role\" part incorrectly and I need to lie instead of being honest? I have a feeling answering that question truthfully makes me seem not as experienced.I am only applying for qualified roles that say 2 or 3 yoe required so I am not overshooting or applying to roles I am not qualified for.",

Has anyone in the twilight of their career been in a similar situation and successfully found a lower stress job? What is the market like for the less exciting places that might not pay as well but also don't have a hustle culture where you have to compete with your colleagues to just not be the next one laid off?",

From what I read online, even smaller models can be useful as long as you don't expect them to know human language / how to talk. I sort of believe the future is in understanding how emergent behavior occurs and what the thresholds for it are, and I would like to study that more. I would like to explore continual learning.

Off the bat I don't expect a crazy pay boost, but I at least want to set myself up to get there. And, with the job market not so great, I don't expect to just suddenly will myself into a new job which is why I'm looking for advice. I frankly suck at leetcode and I haven't interviewed anywhere since getting my first job 3.5 years ago. Do I just have to take the next few months to grind out LC questions and hope to get good? Should I start looking and applying now or later? I don't use LinkedIn, do I really need to build a profile to land a better position or am I ok without it? And did I miss the boat by not making FAANG straight out of school?I sort of feel doomed to be stuck at this mediocre job forever despite having the ambition to do so much better.",

This would probably result in a very secure job with a good salary and benefits etc. I am not currently a professional programmer, but have done a fair bit of coding in my work as a researcher (engineering, not computer science). I think I am good enough at programming to understand the code. The reason I am in talks about taking over the codebase is because I am familiar with the purpose and utility of the project (my personal research is closely linked to the program) and have done some minor development for them in the past. However, the amount of code is a bit daunting. It is not incomprehensible by any means but also not particularly well documented as it is mostly developed by one person.Is this a foolish endeavour? If not, how should I go about learning the code basically from scratch? I wouldn't be completely on my own but I don't expect a very structured onboarding plan. I imagine this is not an extremely common, but also not completely unique situation so I value any input or experience you may have.",

I'm in NYC if that makes any difference.I did full stack at my old job, mostly with React and Node.js, along with mostly AWS services. Since I've only interviewed when I first started, I don't have a lot of experience interviewing and don't know what to expect nowadays. I've been studying full time mostly DSA and system design for the past two months and feel like I'm almost there with that. I'm thinking there will also be some live coding implementations that I'm going to incorporate more into my studies. Curious if anyone has good exercises or resources regarding what companies expect for the implementation round. Looking for insights on what to expect and resources outside of DSA/system design.

I just recently did a pre screen interview with a recruiter from a big company that I was shocked even reached out to me as I hear nothing, and I passed that. The next step is a technical interview. I was told it will consist of 1-2 DSA medium questions which will be a majority of the interview, followed by some potentially light fundamental questions and talking about my background. I have no problem talking about my background, but the live coding really terrifies me. This is my first ever technical interview as my current company doesn’t do them. I feel the stakes are extra high because of how bad the market is, and the pay is very high. My DSA skills are horrid as is, and the idea of having to narrate live what I’m doing without going silent for too long and then receiving follow up questions makes me think there’s no chance I pass. I guess this post is more of venting than seeing assistance, but I guess I’m looking for some advice. I’m really scared I’ll go silent as I try to think and have no idea what to do",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I've been reading through this subreddit lately to manage my anxieties of my future career. I saw a lot of varying comments, some encouraging and others not so much. I have decided for myself that I will stick with my passions for SWE but I'd love to get some advice or hear some other people's opinions.For some background, I'm a junior in a university that is not the best for CS and I have had 0 internships so far. My dreams were to be a SWE ever since I started coding in highschool in 2022.My second semester in college (2024) I started doing research with a CS professor that I liked and have continued it ever since. During my time at university, I also developed and published a Google Chrome extension, mainly to make life easier, and also a VSCode extension, for my professor's research.I also love using Django and have built several full stack web apps (although mainly CRUD). But, I have never deployed something other than on a web service platform like Vercel, Onrender, or Heroku. I'm aware that most of the web apps I build are not scalable and will most likely break if more than 1,000 requests hit an endpoint at once. I also know some things like CI/CD or unit tests are very important for real world projects but I've always thought those things are experiences gained at an internship.I have started applying to internships ever since I was a sophomore and I also attended a career fair last year in the spring. I only started keeping track at the start of my junior year and so far I have more or less applied to 150 intern positions. Only had 2 companies (one small, one medium sized) reach out after for an interview after the OA, but I most likely bombed both because there were no responses after. I know AI is having a big impact on the job market and there are also layoffs happening in tech companies, but I also know several people who still landed internships at Meta and even Google.So, I just wanted to know if anybody could recommend some strategies to stand out more as an applicant or just give some basic advice on my next steps.
