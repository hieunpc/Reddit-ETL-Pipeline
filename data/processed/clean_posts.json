        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I work with datasets that are not huge (GBs to low TBs), but the pipeline still needs to be reliable. I used to overbuild: Kafka, Spark, 12 moving parts, and then spend my life debugging glue. Now I follow a boring checklist to decide what to use and what to skip.If you’re building a pipeline and you’re not sure if you need all the distributed toys, here’s the decision framework I wish I had earlier.1. Start with the SLA, not the techAsk:* How fresh does the data need to be (minutes, hours, daily)?* What’s the cost of being late/wrong?* Who is the consumer (dashboards, ML training, finance reporting)?If it’s daily reporting, you probably don’t need streaming anything.2. Prefer one “source of truth” storage layerPick one place where curated data lives and is readable by everything:* warehouse/lakehouse/object storage, whatever you have Then make everything downstream read from that, not from each other.3. Batch first, streaming only when it pays rentStreaming has a permanent complexity tax:* ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills. If your business doesn’t care about real-time, don’t buy that tax.4. Idempotency is the difference between reliable and hauntedEvery job should be safe to rerun.* partitioned outputs* overwrite-by-partition or merge strategy* deterministic keys If you can’t rerun without fear, you don’t have a pipeline, you have a ritual.5. Backfills are the real workloadDesign the pipeline so backfilling a week/month is normal:* parameterized date ranges* clear versioning of transforms* separate “raw” vs “modeled” layers6. Observability: do the minimum that prevents silent failureAt least:* row counts or volume checks* freshness checks* schema drift alerts* job duration tracking You don’t need perfect observability, you need “it broke and I noticed.”7. Don’t treat orchestration as optionalEven for small pipelines, a scheduler/orchestrator avoids “cron spaghetti.” Airflow/Dagster/Prefect/etc. is fine, but the point is:* retries* dependencies* visibility* parameterized runs8. Optimize lastMost pipelines are slow because of bad joins, bad file layout, or moving too much data, not because you didn’t use Spark. Fix the basics first:* partitioning* columnar formats* pushing filters down* avoiding accidental cartesian joinsMy rule of thumbIf you can meet your SLA with:* a scheduler* Python/SQL transforms* object storage/warehouse and a couple checksthen adding a distributed stack is usually just extra failure modes.Curious what other people use as their “don’t overbuild” guardrails. What’s your personal line where you say “ok, now we actually need streaming/Spark/Kafka”?",

To add context, I live in Germany and have about 2.5 full time YO and 2 years of internships in data engineerings. - Offer 1: Big Airline company - main tech stack: Databricks, Scala, Spark - Note: I will be the only data engineer in the team working with an analysts, intern and team lead. - High responsibility role and a lot of engagement needed- Offer 2: Mid size 25 YO ecommerce company - main tech stack: Azure Fabrics, dbt, python - Note: I will be the only data engineer in the team working with 3 analysts and team lead. - The want someone to migrate their old on-prem tech stack to azure Fabrics and use dbt to enable analysts - High responsibility role and a lot of engagement needed- Offer 3: Tech start up (Owned by big German auto maker) - main tech stack: AWS, python, protobufs - Note: data platform role. I will be working with 4 data engineers (2 senior) and a team lead - Medium responsibility role as there are other data engineers in the team My main back ground is close to offer 2 and 3, but I have no experience in databricks (The company ofc knows about this). I am mostly interested in offer 1 as the company is the safest in this market, but have some doubts about whether the tech stack is the best for future job changes and if it is popular in DE world.

Most experienced DE has less skill in git than others. Our repo is mainly with DDLs, airflow dags and SQL scripts (we want to soon start using dbt so we get rid of DDLs, make the airflow dags logic easier and benefit from other dbts features).We have test & prod environment and we currently do the feature branch strategy -> branch off test, code a feature, PR to merge back to test and then we push to prod from test. (test is our like mainline branch)Pain points:•⁠We dont enjoy PRs and code reviews, especially when merge conflicts appear… •⁠sometimes people push right to test or prod for hotfixes etc.. •⁠we do mainline integration less often than we want… there are a lot of jira tickets and PRs waiting to be merged… but noone wants to get into it and i understand why.. when a merge conflict appears, we rather develop some new feature and leave that conflict for later..I read an article from Mattin Fowler about the Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches and while it was an interesting view on version control, I didnt find a solution to pur issues there.My question is: do you guys have similar issues? How you deal with it? Maybe an advice for us?Nobody from our team has much experience with this from their previous work… for example I was previously in a corporate where everything had a PR that needed to be approved by 2 people and everything was so freaking slow, but here in my current company it is expected to deliver everything faster…",

They complain about distribution keys and the trouble with parsing of json logs. They are struggling with Redshift's SUPER data type. They claim it’s \"weak for aggregations\" and requires awkward casting hacks. They want snowflake because it works no frills (especially VARIANT and dot notation) and they can query semi structured data.The big argument is that savings on Redshift RIs will be eaten up by the salary cost of engineers having to constantly tune WLM queues and fix skew.What needs to be picked here?

I'm only 26 and honestly, I can't imagine working 9-5 until I turn 50 or 60. I'm drafting up some ideas, learning and researching what's required to create products on my own. Once I'm confident enough in an idea and the progress, I'll probably quit. Or get fired because I'm distracted. Staying for a few for months because of financial constraints.Anybody else have similar experiences? I find it so weird that I was so interested in DE just a year ago, still confident that I can perform well in it, but completely lost interest to put in the effort because in the end I know I'll just get paid peanuts for the actual amount of work I'll do (pay in my country is garbage). The only thing that might change this would be life changing compensation, but obviously that requires much more prep that I don't know if I have the time for (or the ability for that matter). Even that wouldn't be a sustainable way out of this dumb rotten week cycle we humans invented for ourselves. Work like a mchine for 5 days and be tired for the rest of the day after work? Recover from that shit for 2 days and then get back to it again? Fuck. That.Thanks for listening to my rant, please share your own thoughts, because obviously there's lots of people who enjoy what they do and have much more \"work endurance\" than me. Also curious to see if there's more people who feel the same way as me too.",

        "content": "I am currently involved in a database migration discussion at my company. The proposal is to migrate our dbt models from PostgreSQL to BigQuery in order to take advantage of BigQuery’s OLAP capabilities for analytical workloads. However, since I am quite fond of PostgreSQL, and value having a stable, open-source database as our data warehouse, I am wondering whether there are extensions or architectural approaches that could extend PostgreSQL’s behavior from a primarily OLTP system to one better suited for OLAP workloads.So far, I have the impression that this might be achievable using DuckDB. One option would be to add the DuckDB extension to PostgreSQL; another would be to use DuckDB as an analytical engine interfacing with PostgreSQL, keeping PostgreSQL as the primary database while layering DuckDB on top for OLAP queries. However, I am unsure whether this solution is mature and stable enough for production use, and whether such an approach is truly recommended or widely adopted in practice.",

BUT, the iceberg-rust writer ecosystem seems to lack a high-level API. It requires significant boilerplate to manually write Parquet files and commit transactions to Glue.The Question: For those running high-frequency ingestion:Is the maintenance burden of a verbose Rust writer worth the performance gains for 30s batches?Or should we just eat the cost/latency of Python because the library maturity prevents \"death by boilerplate\"?(Note: I asked r/rust specifically about the library state, but here I'm interested in the production trade-offs.)",

        "content": "I’ve written about my job on this sub before but I really am at a loss at times and come here to vent frequently. I am fine with hearing it’s a me problem, I really am. But I don’t know how to work faster when everything feels so chaotic upstream of me. I am not eating well, working 8+ hours and finding myself really sleepy (taking 2 naps a day these days) that are signs of burnout I’ve been experiencing especially over the last few months. I’ve been given feedback about not being as fast as the team anticipates on projects. Currently, I’ve been focusing on migrating old projects to a new architecture we plan to use by early next year. I really started being 100% dedicated to this work as of October/November of this year, which gives me 2-3 months to migrate my old projects to this new architecture. In theory it sounds easy to my higher up: all I have to do is copy + paste and tweak my old code to new architecture and that’s it. Except it’s not that easy:1. In current architecture, I built several views that depend on each other. When deploying on this architecture, nobody made me aware (bc nobody seems to know) that changing things in upstream views causes deployment failures until I started working on this and my only workaround is to delete downstream views -> push -> confirm deployment successful -> make changes to upstream views-> push -> confirm deployment -> bring back deleted views -> push -> confirm deployment. This has caused a lot of delays and plenty failures that made me have to go to SWE team to fix that sometimes took the whole day to resolve 2. Naming conventions and the way the data is stored have changed in new architecture with no documentation about this, leaving me to figure out using “eyeball” technique to see where new data is stored and changing my code accordingly 3. Data in old architecture is not always coming through new architecture and I have to just figure this out by checking discrepancies and opening tickets for missing data that doesn’t get resolved no matter how much I ping people to look into it or fix it (I also don’t blame them because I feel other people are inundated too)4. Validation is a nightmare, I’ll have 30+ discrepancies and after checking code and data is there, I have to go through these records one by one to see why it’s not there by comparing tables. It turns out that some records are not meant to be in the new architecture, which I was not told until later when I did validation and had to compare what info from our schema tables was missing between the two. I have to look for specific clues between the old and new dataset for indication whether something is valid or not so I can document there is a reason for discrepancy 5. Documenting all of this and more is a task of its own 6. Ongoing enhancements are expected to be added to some projects I have one project that is comprised of 10 SQL views. The expectation was this would take 2 weeks but it took me a month: 1. creating the views and aligning them to new data model 2. dealing with random/unanticipated failures because of how these views are connected that I can only ask the SWE team to because they can tell me what things in my code that used to be compatible with this new architecture aren’t anymore 3. Validating data and having discrepancies no matter how many times I’ve fixed any errors because some things are “discrepancy by nature” of this new model which I either document and write an explanation of why it’s valid or a something I have to open a ticket for 4. The new way we’re modelling data sometimes doesn’t work for existing projects and I have to add more lines of code to work around that This is not new of the culture of my team. They give me several projects at a time thinking it will take 2 weeks. It takes longer for me and I have been told I have a consistent issue with slowness that makes me feel it’s a me issue. I explain to management my process, I started documenting all issues way more, but nobody gives me constructive advice on what I can do differently to work “faster” and it makes me feel like a failure. One of the advices I was given was “ask for help” but whenever I do, nobody is able to help. When there were holidays, I asked overseas employees to help me investigate a discrepancy an came back to see nobody was able to do it no matter how many people I pinged and explained the issue in detail. As a side note, some of the code I’m migrating now was a nightmare to develop in the first place - it was projects I inherited with no documentation, no idea what the project outcome should look like or what “acceptance criteria” deems the project complete or not. The code was 1000 lines and took several minutes to run with poor performance issues. Like a million full joins, sub queries within subqueries. I was once asked to add something to a where clause in this query and unknowingly broke something that I didn’t realize was a break bc I have no idea what the end result is supposed to look like. I was told to reverse it immediately and asked the SWE team who told me we can’t simply reverse our daily pipeline. The colleague who asked me to made the change became furious and this is where negative feedback about me started. I later worked hard to re-develop this whole project, breaking down the code into separate parts in order to join these separate views together at the end to make cleaner, optimized code. The team did like that work, but even then, issues would arise - upstream pipeline would fail, I have to interrupt my 10 projects to manually get a dataset, upload it through our transformation tool, export and manually put back into S3 that takes 30+ minutes. Later, it turns out that simple joins to create the end table aren’t enough per requirements because of unanticipated quirks with the data that requires a full join and 2 additional CTEs to get right. Basically, I’m just really tired. The business requirements are really ambiguous and a work in progress, our data is in different constantly changing formats and we have failures or changes of me upstream of I have to keep track of while working through other projects and stop everything to fix it. Of note, most of my team members are not strong technically but do have domain knowledge, yet I feel domain knowledge is not enough because the way we do things technically feels very poor as well. Sorry to make everybody read all this, I don’t have any other friends who work in data who I can vent to about this.",

        "content": "Hi all,I’m designing a data warehouse and running into an issue with changing business keys and lost history.Current modelI have a fact table with data starting in 2023 at the following grain: - Date- Policy ID- Client ID- Salesperson ID- Transaction amountThe warehouse is currently modelled as a star schema, with dimensions for Policy, Client, and Salesperson.Business behaviour causing the issueSalesperson business entities are reorganised over time, and the source system overwrites history.Example:In 2023:- Salesperson A → business key 1234- Salesperson B → business key 5678- Transactions are recorded against 1234 and 5678 in the fact tableIn 2024:- Salesperson A and B are merged into a new entity “A/B”- A new business key 7654 is created- From 2024 onward, all sales are recorded as 7654No historical backfill is performed.Key constraint - Policy and Client dimensions are always updated to reference the current salesperson- Historical salesperson assignments are not preserved in the source- As a result, the salesperson dimension represents the current organisational structure onlyProblemWhen analysing sales by salesperson:- I can only see history for the merged entity (“A/B”) from 2024 onward- I cannot easily associate pre-2024 transactions with the merged entity without rewriting historyThis breaks historical analysis and raises the question of whether a classic star schema is appropriate here.QuestionWhat is the correct dimensional modeling pattern for this scenario?Specifically:- Should this be handled with a Slowly Changing Dimension (Type 2)? - A bridge / hierarchy table mapping historical salesperson keys to current entities? - Or is there a justified case for snowflaking (e.g. salesperson → policy/client → fact) when the source system overwrites history?I’m looking for guidance on how to model this while: - Preserving historical facts- Supporting analysis by current and historical salesperson structures - Avoiding misleading rollupsThanks in advance",

I've become a SME at my work on SQL Server internals and am usually a go-to for technical questions.I've been job-hunting for the last couple of months and haven't had too much luck getting an offer. A major part of this is the combination of the really bad job market and the Q4 wind down,I realize. But I'm lacking in a few areas that would make me competitive.I've been getting a steady stream of interviews but I've gotten feedback from a few jobs that they went with candidates with more experience in their cloud platform and/or the specific orchestrators and tools they. This has been pretty frustrating since a large reason I'm trying to get out of my current role is that I'm well-aware that I'm behind in modern technologies. My role doesn't have much opportunity for me to get experience on the job without switching teams, but that would require uprooting my family's life and moving to another city due to RTO.I'm planning to spend time over the next few months outside of work building projects with AWS, Snowflake, Airflow and other modern tools, so I can speak more to it during interviews.

The type model reflects the needs of modern applications and allows for rich annotations with semantic information that can be evaluated and understood by developers and by large language models (LLMs).JSON Structure’s syntax is similar to that of JSON Schema, but while JSON Schema focuses on document validation, JSON Structure focuses on being a strong data definition language that also supports validation.The JSON Structure project has native validators for instances and schemas in 10 different languages.The Avrotize/Structurize tool can convert JSON Structure definitions into over a dozen database schema dialects and it can generate data transfer objects in various languages.

        "author": "Better-Department662",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks - looking for some architecture feedback from people doing this in production.We sit between structured data sources and AI agents, and we’re trying to be very deliberate about how agents touch internal data. Our data mainly lives in product DBs (Postgres), BigQuery, and our CRM (SFDC). We want agents for lightweight automation and reporting. Current approach: Instead of giving agents any kind of direct warehouse access, we’re planning to run them against an isolated sandboxed environment with pre-joined, pre-sanitized views pulled from our DW and other sources. Agents never see the warehouse directly.On top of those sandboxed views (not direct DW tables), we’d build and expose custom MCP tools. Each of these MCP tools will have a broader sql query- with required parameters and a real-time policy layer between views and these tools- enforcing row/column limits, query rules, and guardrails (rate limits, max scan size, etc.).The goal is to minimize blast radius if/when an LLM does something dumb: no lateral access, no schema exploration, no accidental PII leakage, and predictable cost.Does this approach feel sane? Are there obvious attack vectors or failure modes we’re underestimating with LLMs querying structured data? Curious how others are thinking about isolation vs. flexibility when agents touch real customer data.Would love feedback - especially from teams already running agents against internal databases.",

Whereas with S3 tables, you use a native AWS catalog, and maintenance is automatically handled. When would someone choose one over the other? Is there anything fundamentally wrong with the self-managed route? My plan was to ingest data using SQS+ Glue Catalog + PyIceberg + PyArrow in ECS tasks, and handle maintenance through scheduled Athena-based compaction jobs.",

For instance we calculate durations daily and we sum these daily durations to get the weekly resultThe goal is ultimately to feed custom-made user dashboards and reports.A very spaghettish code of mine translates these aggregation definitions into templated Clickhouse SQL queries that we store in PGSQL.At night an Airflow DAG runs these queries and stores the results in the db.It is very painful to understand and to maintain.## What we want to achieveWe would like to simplify all this and to enable our project managers (non technical), and maybe even later our customers, to create/update them, ideally based on a GUI.I have tried doing some mockups with Redash, Metabase or Superset but none of them really fit, mostly because some of our aggregations use intricate CTEs, have post-treatments, or use data stored in Maps etc..I felt they were more suited for already-clean business data and not big telemetry tables with hundreds of columns, and also for simple BI cases.## Why am I humbly asking for your generous and wise advicesWhat would your approach be on this?I was thinking about maybe a simpler/sleeker yaml format that could be easily generated by our PHP backend for the definition.Then for the conversion into Clickhouse queries,I was wondering if you guys think that a tool like DBT could be of any use in order to template our functions and generate the SQL queries, and even maybe to trigger them.I am rather new in Data Engineering so I am really curious about the recommended approaches, or if there might even be some standard or frameworks for this.We're not the first ones to face this problematic for sure!I just want to precise we'll go fully opensource and are open to developing stuff ourselvesThank you very much for your feedbacks!",

Despite that, I still think it offers a lot of value as a fast, easy way to explore data files of various formats - even ones with millions of rows. So I figured I'd share it with this community, as you might find it useful :)Beyond just viewing files, you can also sort, filter, calculate new columns, etc. The documentation is sparse (well, non-existant), but I'm happy to have a chat with anyone who's interested in actually using the app seriously.Even though it's browser-based, there's no sign up or server interaction. It's basically a local app delivered via the web. For those interested in the technical details, it reads data directly from the filesystem using modern web APIs, and stores projects in IndexedDB.I'd be really keen to hear if anyone does find this useful :)**NOTE:** I've been told it doesn't work in Firefox due to it not supporting the filesystem APIs that the app uses. If there's enough of a pull to fix this, I'll look for a workaround.",

For example:groupBy(profile\\_id,gti,window(event\\_timestamp, windowDuration, \"1 minute\"))Spark didn’t allow joining those three streams for outer join limitation error between streams.We tried to work around it by writing each stream to the memory and take a snapshot every 60 seconds but it does not only output the changed rows..How would you go about this problem? Should we maintain three rolling time windows like we tried and find a way to join them or is there any other way you could think of?Very lost here, any help would be very appreciated!!",

        "content": "Hello all,I recently started using snowflake in my new company.I'm trying to build a metadata driven ingestion pipeline because we have hundreds of files to ingest into the plateform.Snowflake advisors are pushing the snowpipe for cost and efficiency reasons.I'm leaning more towards parametrized copy into.Reasoning why I prefer copy into : Copy into is easy to refactor and reuse, I can put it in a Stored procedure and call it using different parameters to populate different tables.Ability to adapt to schema change using the metadata tableRequires no extra setup outside of snowflake (if we already set the stage/integration with S3 etc).Why I struggle with Snowpipe :For each table, we need to have a snowpipe.Schema change in the table requires recreating the snowpipe (unless the table is on auto schema evolution)Requires setting up on aws to be able to trigger the snowpipe if we want the triggering automatically on file arrival.Basically, I'd love to use snowpipe, but I need to handle schema evolution easily and be able to ingest everything on varchar on my bronze layer to avoid any data rejection. Any feedback about this ?One last question : Snowflake advisor keep is telling us cost wise, snowpipe is WAY cheaper than copy into, and my biggest concern is management that would kill any copy into initiative because of this argument. Any info on this matter is highly appreciated Thanks all !",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Context:We have an old MSSQL Server on prem + Alteryx for orchestration/transformations + Tableau server for visualizations. Our data \"team\" is basically just me, plus my manager and coworker - both of whom are mostly comfortable just with data visualization in Tableau. Our data comes in from various vendors (20+) in the form of flat files in SFTPs or API endpoints. Nothing overly crazy, no streaming, no more than 1-2 GB over the course of a day.While Alteryx has been \"good enough\" the last 10 years, their rapidly rising costs has led us to research various options at how we can modernize our data stack and keep costs low. My manager has given me free reign to research various options and come up with a plan that we can execute over 2026, just with the understanding that our company has a footprint in Azure, so I shouldn't branch out to AWS or GCP for example.Proposal:+ Azure Blob Storage to ingest and store all our vendors' files and data on a daily/hourly basis+ Dagster+ (hybrid) for orchestration+ Deltalake tables created/updated in blob storage for staging, warehouse, and marts layers using delta-rs and polars for transformations+ For serving to BI tools, use external tables in a Databricks SQL warehouse pointed to delta tables+ Keep Tableau as is, reduce our need for Alteryx over time to just last mile transformations/adhoc analysis for my other team membersOther considerations:+ DBT: I did some of their courses and tried to recreate an existing pipeline using dbt-core orchestrated by Dagster and it seemed overkill for my purposes. Everything I liked in it was already covered by Dagster, such as data lineage, testing, and the features that might be nice require cloud. I'm also more comfortable writing transformations in Python rather than SQL.+ Table maintenance: I'm aware that external tables are not managed by DBX and it's on me to manage the tables manually (optimize/vacuum). I figure I can set up a script that runs once a month or something to automatically do it.+ Why delta-rs? Again, we don't have overly complex data needs or sizes that require Spark computing costs. Our machines are perfectly capable of handling the compute requirements that we need. If we get to ML models down the road, then I'd probably run those in DBX notebooks and rely on their computing power.Has anyone else ran a similar design before? Any pitfalls or limitations to be aware of?",

        "author": "poopdood696969",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m running into a Snowflake permissions issue that I can’t quite reason through, and I’m hoping someone can tell me if this is expected or if I’m missing something obvious.Context: we’re on Snowflake, tables are built with dbt and orchestrated by Dagster. Tables are materialized using DBT (so the compiled dbt code is usingcreate-or-replace semantics). This has been the case for a long time and hasn’t changed recently.We effectively have two roles involved:* a read-only reporting role (SELECT access)* a write-capable role that exists mainly so Terraform can create/provision tables (INSERT / TRUNCATE, etc.)Important detail: Terraform is *not* managing grants yet. It’s only being explored. No Snowflake grants are being applied via Terraform at this point.Historically, the reporting role had database-level grants:* usage on the database* usage on all schemas and future schemas* select on all tables* select on future tables* select on all views* select on future viewsThis worked fine. The assumption was that when dbt recreates a table, Snowflake re-applies SELECT via future grants.The only change made recently was adding schema-level future grants for the write-capable role (insert/truncate on future tables in the schema). No pipeline code changed. No dbt config changed. No materialization logic changed.Immediately after that, we started seeing this behavior:* when dbt/Dagster recreates a table, the write role’s privileges come back* the reporting role’s SELECT does notThis was very obvious and repeatable.What’s strange is that the database-level future SELECT grants for the reporting role still exist. There are no revoke statements in query history. Ownership isn’t changing. Schemas are not managed access. Transient vs permanent tables doesn’t seem to matter.The only thing that fixes it is adding schema-level future SELECT for the reporting role. Once that’s in place, recreated tables keep SELECT access as expected.So now everything works, but I’m left scratching my head about why:* database-level future SELECT used to be sufficient* introducing schema-level future grants for another role caused this to surface* schema-level future SELECT is now required for reporting access to survive table recreationI’m fine standardizing on schema-level future grants everywhere, but I’d really like to understand what’s actually happening under the hood. Is Snowflake effectively applying future grants based on the most specific scope available? Are database-level future grants just not something people rely on in practice for dbt-heavy environments?Curious if anyone else has seen this or has a better mental model for how Snowflake applies future grants when tables are recreated.",

        "content": "Folks, I’m working on a data VCS similar to Git but for databases and data lakes. At the moment, I have a headless API server and the code to handle PostgreSQL and S3 or MinIO data lakes with plans to support the other major databases and data lakes, but before I continue, I wanted community feedback on whether you’d find this useful.The project goal was to make a version of Git that could be used for data so that we data engineers wouldn’t have to learn a completely new terminology. It uses the same CLI for the most part, with init, add, commit, push, etc. The versioning control is operations-based instead of record- or table-based, so it simplifies a lot of the branch operations. I’ve included a dedicated ingestion branch so it can work with a live database where data is constantly ingested via some external process. I realize there are some products available that do something moderately similar, but they all either require learning a completely new syntax or are extremely limited in capability and speed. This allows you to directly branch on server from an existing database with approximately 10% overhead. The local client is written in Rust with PyO3 bindings to interact with the headless FastAPI server backend when deployed for an organization. Eventually, I want to distribute this to engineers and orgs, but this post is primarily to gauge interest and feasibility from my fellow engineers. Ask whatever questions come to mind, bash it as much as you want, tell me whatever comes to mind. I have benefited a ton from my fellow data and software engineers throughout my career, so this is one of the ways I want to give back.",

        "content": "Hi guys, I have a kind of difficult situation. Basically: * In 2020, I was working as, essentially, a BI Engineer at a company with a fairly old-fashioned tech stack. (SQL Server, SSRS reports, .NET and a *desktop application*, not even a webapp.) My official job title was just Junior Software Engineer. I did a bunch of data engineering-adjacent things (\"make a pipeline to load stuff from this google spreadsheet into new tables in the DB, then make a report about it\" and such)* Then I got sick and had to take medical leave. For several years. For some reason, my job didn't wait for me to come back.* Eventually I got better. I learned Python. I'm really much better at Python now than I ever was at .NET, though I'm better at SQL than at either. * I built a stupid little [test project](https://github.com/manya-t/infinitecraft) doing some data analysis and such. * I started looking for jobs. And continued looking for jobs. And continued looking for jobs.* Oh and btw I don't have a college degree, I'm entirely self-taught.In the long term, I want to break into data engineering, it's... the field that fits how my mind works. In the short term, I need a job, and any job that would take me would rather take a new grad with more legible qualifications and no gap. I'm totally willing to take a pay cut to compensate for someone taking a risk on me! I know I'm a risk! But there's no way to say that without looking like even more of a risk.So... I guess the question I have is, what are some steps I can take to get a job that is at least *vaguely* adjacent to data engineering? Something from which I can at least try to move in that direction.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m working on a project that consumes a stream coming from a Kafka server containing json data that I need to process and store in a relational model, and ultimately in graph format. We are considering 2 approaches:1) ingest the stream via an application that reroutes it to a Marquez instance and store the harmonized data in Postgres. Enrich the data there by adding additional attributes, then process it via batch jobs running on azure app service (or similar) and save it in graph format somewhere else (possibly neo4j or delta format in databricks). 2) Ingest the stream via structured streaming in databricks and save the data in delta format. Process via batch jobs in databricks and save it there in graph format. Approach 1 does away with the heavy lifting of harmonizing into a data model, but relies on a 3rd party open source application (Marquez) that is susceptible to vulnerabilities and is quite brittle in terms of extensibility and maintenance. Approach 2 would be the most pain free and is essentially an ETL pipeline that could follow the medallion architecture and be quite robust in terms of error proofing and de bugging, but is likely to be a lot more costly because structured streaming requires a databricks compute to be available 24/7, and even the batch processing jobs for enriching the data after ingestion were written off as being too expensive by our architect. Are there any cheaper or simpler alternatives that you would recommend specifically for processing data in open lineage format?",

        "content": "I've answered a few questions in the last few days about stuff like \"what language should I learn\" and \"should I learn to code?\"With respect to the askers, those questions are wrong-headed. Code isn't the hard part. On this topic, here is myI reply that we programmers use languages as tools. We use those tools to create programs. We test those programs. We package those programs. We sell those packages, or publish them as open source, or deliver them to an employer, or whatever. We get bug reports from users. We fix (some of) those bugs. We repackage and republish. Code is only part of the trade of programming. Professional programmers understand what our users need. We have clear vision for what a finished software package is and does and looks like. We get our work tested, packaged, and across the finish line. Along the way we write some code. The thing is, if we can do the other things well, the code is (usually) pretty easy, comparatively. At the same time, pure code isn't finished and doesn't have any users. That gets very boring very fast.Wanna see some examples of software packages of a scale that one person -- you -- can make and publish and try to attract live people as users?* These are Javascript utility packages. https://www.npmleaderboard.org/* These are plugins for WordPress: https://wordpress.org/plugins/* ...for Python. https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Topic+%3A%3A+Artistic+Software * Indie games. https://itch.io/There are other lists and repositories of packages out there for the searching. Laying down lines of code is just a part of our trade. The programmers of many of those packages did the whole job: explanation, instructions, code, testing, packaging, publishing, and then bug fixing. Read through some of the package descriptions; they'll give you a feel for what a piece of finished software looks like.Don't be too intimidated by the packages that turn up on the first page of these lists. The best of them have been around for many years, and have been through a lot of changes to perfect them. But those packages started somewhere. Yours can too.Make good software and stay in touch.",

Feel the satisfaction of simply pressing \"execute\" and watching your drone do all the hard work.Unlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression.Farming earns you resources which can be spent to unlock new technology.Programming is done in a simple language similar to Python. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts you will need by introducing them one at a time.While it introduces everything that is relevant, it won't hold your hand when it comes to solving the various tasks in the game. You will have to figure those out for yourself, and that can be very challenging if you have never programmed before.If you are an experienced programmer, you should be able to get through the early game very quickly and move on to the more complex tasks of the later game, which should still provide interesting challenges.Although the programming language isn't exactly Python, it's similar enough that Python IntelliSense works well with it. All code is stored in .py files and can optionally be edited using external code editors like VS Code. When the \"File Watcher\" setting is enabled, the game automatically detects external changes.Hope you like the coding game concept! :)You can find it here:  [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The\\_Farmer\\_Was\\_Replaced/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160?utm_source=RD)",

        "content": "This is a topic that I've been really wanting to talk about.The market for teaching people how to program is very lucrative (gold rush and selling shovels, all over again), so don't listen to just to whoever claims to be an authority.On instagram, I saw this video of a person (I won't mention who it is, but many of you probably already know him) talking about how if you want to impress people in a C++ tech interview, instead of doing \"for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {}\" the boring \"amateur\" way, you have to do \"for (auto i{0uz};)\" in order to look cool and experienced.Well, first off, you're not really impressing many people (except maybe for beginners) by applying these tricks. People who don't program won't know the difference, and experienced programmers genuinely won't give a shit (and might in fact think your code is inferior, since it's less readable now).But most importantly, memorizing lots of tricks won't make you a good programmer. You know what makes you a good programmer? Understanding fundamentals and learning creative problem solving, that's what you really need.Please, for the love of God, stop following pop-coding \"coaches\". Their advice is often useless, and can waste your time by making you focus on the wrong things. As far as they're concerned, they WANT you to waste your time on them because it gives them more watchtime. Spend your time by instead working on projects you're interested in and reading up on the fundamentals of coding.Rant over.",

I have also had books recommended to me, but reading is honestly worse for me, as I seem to be one of the slowest readers on planet Earth.I would love to start building projects, but I am afraid that I will miss a lot of the nuances and \"gotchas\" of C++ that may come to bite me later in interviews or debugging for instance.

I've been using freeCodeCamp since 2023 and I loved its structure: learn a concept -> guided project -> unguided project. That format works great for me and I learned a lot of stuff that I still remember.The big problem is: FCC removed its video content. Staying focused on long lectures is a huge problem for me, because of that I can't learn on freeCodeCamp anymore.So now I’m looking at alternatives:* Scrimba: seems interactive and video-based, which I need, but from what I've understood there are no projects where you actually get to write *everything* on your own and it's really shallow in terms of libraries and general depth* The Odin Project: To me personally it seems impossible to learn here, because there's lots and lots of text which is just a big no-no for my small clip thinking brain (thank you, tiktok).* freeCodeCamp: still amazing structure, but now mostly text-only which also makes it hard. The bite sized video lectures were perfect, but they're not there anymore.I’m not a total beginner. I know vanilla JS pretty well (up until DOM stuff from FCC), but once frameworks, Node libs, databases, backend tools, etc. enter the game, I stops working. So I'm searching for a deeper dive into the full ecosystem:* JavaScript & TypeScript* Node.js + Basic libraries like os, fs, http* React + Tailwind* Git, Linux, Docker* SQL* possibly Kubernetes and CI/CDIdeally, the platform should:* go really deep, not just scratching on the surface-level* include project-based practice (guided and unguided are nice)* offer both frontend and backend (can be in two different places) or full-stack* videos would help a **lot** (<- underline that twice)* certificates are a huge plus but not required, if it's a good course then certs aren't important at allBudget isn’t the deciding factor. I just want the most effective structure for actually retaining and practicing the material.For people who’ve used these platforms or any other platforms: which one fits this learning style best?Thanks in advance!",

Once fundamentals like problem solving, logic, and basic programming got stronger, switching or adding new domains felt much easier because most things differ only in syntax or tools, not in core thinking.Now I’m trying to be more intentional:* one main domain* strong basics* limited resources* consistent practiceFor people who’ve been through this phase:* Did you also jump across domains initially?* What helped you finally narrow things down?* Any advice for students who feel lost early on?",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I’m looking for honest advice and different perspectives on a possible career change (or career expansion).I have a degree in International Business, but after graduating I worked in roles unrelated to my degree, so I don’t have professional experience directly connected to it. At the same time, I’ve become genuinely interested in learning programming / software engineering — not only as a potential career switch, but also as a new skill I could combine with my business background in the future and as a strong plus on my resume.Here’s my situation and my doubts:• I can’t realistically commit to a full-time traditional university (time + cost).• A bootcamp appeals to me because of the structure, guidance, accountability, and also the opportunity to meet people and network.• English is not my first language, and although I use it daily, I want to keep improving. Being in an environment where I’m pushed to communicate more in English feels like a plus.So far, I’ve started learning on my own:•freeCodeCamp•Planning to try The Odin Project nextI’m realistic about expectations:•I know a bootcamp won’t guarantee a job•I know the market is competitive•I understand I may not get hired right awayMy goal is to build real skills, start with solid foundations, and keep studying long-term. Even if I initially apply for jobs related to my original careerOne important factor is that I currently have the option to stop working for about 6 months, since my husband can support me during that time. That’s why I’m seriously considering an intensive learning path like a bootcamp, so I can fully focus during that period.I looked into Hack Reactor, but my experience has been concerning:•I was told about a full scholarship. I applied and 3 weeks later they informed it wasn’t available for now. •I pass the CCAT test, contacted them to know about the next steps. Someone told me they will contact me but is been almost a month a haven’t heard for them. Because of that, I’m unsure whether Hack Reactor — or bootcamps in general — are still an option right now.So my main questions are:1.Bootcamp vs community college vs online university — what would you recommend in 2026 for someone in my position?2.Is a bootcamp still worth it mainly for structure, foundations, and momentum?3.Are online universities that people often recommend on Reddit actually a good option?4.If you were in my situation — limited time/money, strong motivation, and a non-tech degree — what path would you choose?Thanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences.

        "content": "Hello folks, I am studying CS at my penultimate year and I feel really overwhelmed about the heave load and so many different languages we have to use. We are currently have modules regarding databases, advanced programming and api development with a client app. The problem is that the database lectures was so theoritical but for the assignments we had to create 2 DB systems with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, without learning any of these languages during lectures. I hardly managed to do the assignments since it was the first time I had to write postgre and mongo and they assessments required to apply advanced knowledge to code the systems. On the API module it was the same. The professor focused on teaching material regarding how to complete the weekly assignments but the final one was doable since the most of the part covered from the weekly tasks. On advanced programming we had to use c# that we used in the previous years but we had to create a cross platform app with blazor and we never saw examples during lectures on how to set up a blazor app and I felt overwhelmed from the amount of reseach I had to do myself. The following semester we have an IoT's module and the prof told us we will create an IoT device in a simulator with python for the final assessment. We never touched python before. The other module is about game development and they changed the curriculum to use unreal engine with c++ instead of unity, we never wrote c++ before. The last module is about penetration testing and the module guide says that we will have to write bash scripts and python to simulate some attacks on our Uni's servers. What do you recommend me to study during our next semester's gap in order to cope with the assessments and not get frustrated again?",

I ran into an issue with one of the exercises, where I couldn't add any lines to adjust any parameters because every time the finished graph was closed, everything I entered into the REPL was deleted from the queue and I had to enter the whole program into the REPL again.I went to AI to find this out, and asked about putting this all into a script. Two days later I have a script, an understanding of why I would have multiple files for a script (for separation of concerns), why I would put these files in the project directory and not a \\~/bin directory, and a few other things that I can't recall atm, but that I did not know before, or without, AI.I had to do some thinking to figure out what the script was doing, but not much thinking. I asked the AI a ton of questions along the way. I didn't simply copy-pasta the whole thing, but that only sounds like I'm justifying after-the-fact. Am I doing myself a dis-service?

I've heard things like Design Patterns by Gang of Four is good and also Head First Design Patterns and Head First Object Oriented Analysis and Design.

        "author": "TypingTadpole",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I confess that I have a standard / frequent question around \"how do I create X type of app\", but there are three twists to the question, I promise! The FAQ helped, but before I go off and running, I want to \"test\" my hypothesis.**First, I'm old**. Not too old to learn (approaching 60), just that I have old programming experience. So I typed programs from computer magazines in BASIC into Commodore VIC-20s and PETs back in the 80s and saved them on cassettes; I learned BASIC and STRUCTURED BASIC in high school in the 80s; I took BASIC/FORTRAN/COBOL courses in university in the 90s. I learned enough to write a menu system in BASIC for running in DOS back in the '80s that allowed me to add/subtract items, write batch files that would launch when the menu closed and then reopen the menu when I was done running whatever program was, compile it and run it in DOS. Used it for years. So I have \\*\\*\\*SOME\\*\\*\\* experience. Just nothing recent. Oh, and I also can debug basic HTML / CSS issues on websites but avoid javascript stuff at least for now. I'd rather run WordPress with free plugins than program my own. I'm more of a user than a developer. The second twist is that I have **two very specific needs** in mind, both of which could perhaps be done with a robust GUI and back-end database instead of programming it. But well, I want something a bit more customizable to my specific issues to solve. So, like the videos recommend, I have specific problems to solve that will keep me interested! The first is harder and I have more passion for it; the second is easier and maybe where I should start, even though I'm not as excited about it.And the third twist is that I am **NOT trying to build a revenue stream**. I'm open to having a small revenue stream tied to it enough to buy myself a coffee if someone wants the extra \"bits\", but just looking to use the apps myself, $$ is not my goal. If others in my immediate community find it useful, I'd be open to sharing the apps everywhere for free and with no advertising. Maybe some \"extras\" available in a pro version for $1 or something.The first need would be a mobile app (iOS and Android) that acts like a **field recorder** as if someone was doing a survey or recording a business transaction BUT without local wifi/internet access. So, like you were out in the woods, say, doing biology research and you wanted to record which birds you saw, and the date/time/interesting details. BUT you also want to be able to record the equipment you were using and the place/location with sort of default \"profiles\". Like, \"Profile 1\" says you're using equipment X, Y, Z; Profile 2 says you're using X, A, B; Profile 3 says Y, Z, B, etc. But I want to load the default profiles in as starter info. There are existing database apps that do this, but I have some unique usage links that I'll need to pull from unique style databases too, which the database apps didn't have the power to do. Ultimately, I need the initial recording apps (mostly dumping info into a set of fields in a database) and then once I'm back in civilization, uploading them to a more powerful PC app that would be almost the same software in PC form, with some extra printing, formatting, layout features. I confess I have no idea where that info is saved on the phone, or the PC, or the inbetween bits (common upload to cloud when there's a connection? Like synching photos?). Just that I want the data to eventually be in the PC for more processing. It's not very complicated for operations (input screen, load profiles, enter data, save data, load previous records, etc.), and the graphics needs are not very sophisticated (very functionally focused). If it was the early 90s, I'd be tempted to even use COBOL. The app will do no calculations or advanced graphics; it's almost entirely a text-based database entry and retrieval function with some flex on forms.The second need is similar but even simpler in design. It's like **a quiz game.** Questions, with 4 possible answers, timed. It could be used as a game or as a flashcard-type study aid. I have a specific purpose in mind, but the functionality is basically that of a trivia game -- load small database (say 25 Qs about topic 1), go through the Qs, have options for hints or retries, get score at end, equivalent of a global leader board (so some internet required). But all single player, not live games with others, no live online element. And the extra twist for this one is I would love to be able to do it in iOS, Android, AND a version for my website for those who DO have access. The mobile apps would work differently, and I don't NEED a website version, but I'll keep my options open. The FAQ tells me to use Kotlin or Java (for Android); Objective-C or Swift (for iOS); C#, VB or JS for Windows Phone; or use PhoneGap / Titanium in HTML/CSS/JS. Oh and C# for the Windows PC version (no, I am NOT going to try MAC too). But with my specific two-use functionality...is that the way to go? I'm fine to learn new tricks, just want to make sure I'm learning the right tricks.",

What mental steps should I be practicing?What I'm struggling with so far:* Foundational Math (Floor/Ceiling, Powers, Logarithms). I understand what a log is, but feeling its impact in binary search is different.* Algorithm Principles & Efficiency (Time/Space Complexity, Big-O). Is Big O notation like a set formula? * Arrays (Operations, Insertion/Deletion)* Searching (Linear, Binary Search)* Basic Algorithms (Array Merging) I'd really appreciate any help. I'm a visual learner so if you can recommend any YouTube channels or websites that are exceptional at teaching the problem-solving process would be great. Something that kinda holds your hand through the why before the how. I'd also like to know how you personally learnt to think algorithmically. Are there specific practices (like a certain way of using pseudocode, drawing diagrams, etc.) that helped you?Please help me find an effective way to practice and learn this.",

A simplified example:`SomeClass::unit_under_test(){ this->f(); // changes the state of this // ... }`I've used C++ syntax since that's the language I'm using, but the question itself is not specific to C++. For those unfamiliar, `this` refers to the current object of the class that you are in scope of.My question is: how do you properly test `unit_under_test`? I am not really that interested in testing `f()`, because there is a separate unit test for that. I also can't mock it without making changes to source code, because there is no way to link in a mock for `f()` that will end up getting called here instead of the actual member function.You could also imagine that `f()` could be fairly complex. It could itself call a bunch of other functions that do various things and which should themselves be unit tested. Digging into the implementation of those functions starts to feel like it's getting outside the scope of the test of just this function.So, it seems hard to know how best to test this kind of thing, and I wanted to know what others' thoughts are.",

I want to check whether this is a known limitation or something wrong in my build/integration.Target:NXP [i.MX](http://i.MX) RT1064 (1 MB internal SRAM + 4 MB Flash) on bare-metalToolchain: arm-none-eabi-gcc with newlib-nanoDisplay: 16x128 LED matrixUI: LVGL with a custom HarfBuzz text shaping hookStack: size - 64kB ; stack region: SRAM\\_DTCHeap: size - 128kB ; heap region: SRAM\\_OC2Libraries:FreeType 2.13.2 (static) + HarfBuzz 8.3.0 (static, Meson build)Font: NotoSansDevanagari, AnjaliOldLipi and so on as a C arrayAll threads, atomics, glib, ICU, getenv, etc. are disabled. No pthreads, no OS services.I have two build setups with very different behavior.Case 1 (non-cyclic build):I build FreeType without HarfBuzz, then build HarfBuzz with FreeType, and do NOT rebuild FreeType again with HarfBuzz enabled.Result: English text works and Indic gives me hard fault at GSUB.Case 2 (cyclic build, as described in FreeType docs):Build FreeType without HarfBuzz.Build HarfBuzz with FreeType enabled.Rebuild FreeType with HarfBuzz enabled.Result: English and Indic text breaks, hard fault or hb\\_font\\_destroy gives error.The fault consistently appears somewhere in the GSUB path. The backtrace usually goes through hb\\_shape(), hb\\_shape\\_full(), hb\\_shape\\_plan\\_execute(), hb\\_ot\\_shape(), and apply\\_forward() in GSUB. In some runs the crash appears closer to hb\\_font\\_destroy(), in others during hb\\_shape(), so I suspect memory corruption or an assumption violation rather than a single bad call.Important observation:When FreeType is NOT rebuilt with HarfBuzz, English works but Indic fails.When FreeType IS rebuilt with HarfBuzz, both English and Indic fail and I get a hard fault.Occasionally, I also get an access violation and I found this:[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation)My understanding (please correct me if wrong):HarfBuzz does all shaping (GSUB/GPOS, Indic, Arabic, etc.) and FreeType loads glyphs and rasterizes them. The FreeType :left-right_arrow: HarfBuzz cyclic dependency mainly exists for auto-hinting improvements, not for shaping correctness.Since my display is a very low-resolution 16x128 LED matrix, hinting quality is not very important, but correct glyph order is.So my questions are:1. Is HarfBuzz GSUB shaping expected to work on bare-metal targets with no OS and newlib-nano?2. Is rebuilding FreeType with HarfBuzz actually required if shaping is already done by HarfBuzz?3. Are there GSUB code paths that assume stack size, libc behavior, or memory features that may not exist on embedded targets?4. How much stack and heap would be required for proper Indic rendering?I have attached an image from the IDE incase anyone wants to check.If you happen to know someone who might be familiar with this issue, I’d really appreciate it if you could share this with them. Any help would be greatly appreciated!Even a confirmation that this configuration is unsupported would be very helpful. Thanks a lot for any pointers you can share.

        "content": "Hi everyone, I’m a 3rd-year CS student aiming for a career in physics simulation or engine development. I’ve always been into physics, so I’m planning to build some simulations (like cloth sims or inverted pendulums) using C++ and OpenGL/DirectX to learn the ropes.The problem is, I’m getting mixed signals. I talked to two professors: one encouraged this \"hands-on\" approach, but the other advised against it. I think the latter was warning me not to get bogged down in theory or \"reinventing the wheel\" instead of learning modern tools, but I’m not 100% sure.To be honest, I don’t go to a top-tier university, so I’m pretty insecure about my math/physics background compared to students from elite schools. I’m worried that I might be chasing a pipe dream.Is implementing physics from scratch the right way to build a portfolio for this role? Or should I be focusing on something else? Please be brutal—I need a reality check.",

Not sure if it’s the correct reasoning but would great to help some help.1. The earnInterest() method only relates to two of the subclasses, so it has to be implemented in CurrentAccount even though that concept does not exist there. We could move this method to the individual subclasses instead of the superclass.2. The withdraw() method is becoming confusing. One account can only withdraw if it has not reached its withdrawal limit, while another can only withdraw if it is not within the maturity lock. This is arguably fine because the method is abstract, so it is expected that the logic will differ between subclasses.3. There is a large amount of duplication in the withdraw() method. Inheritance is supposed to help avoid this, but because each account needs slightly different rules, the duplication becomes unavoidable.4. If we were to add another product where we couldn’t deposit or withdraw or potentially both then this would be another case where inheritance is bad as we would have to throw an exception or then build another abstract class which has withdraw and deposit and then those account classes that have those methods would have to extend off that",

I have plans to create automation software like an automatic maze generator and solver and etc. I've started 3Blue1Brown algebra lessons and problem solving as well.Although, I am using Claude AI to coach me additionally. I don't ask AI to write for me the code I want, but I do use AI to explain to me principles, to show me certain commands, how you call stuff, I ask about the logic. I never implement a code that I do not understand and sometimes spend hours reading on a topic an asking questions. Still, I feel a bit guilty for using AI for additional coaching, but I'm just a little slow when it comes to learning and need my own time and speed and I need a lot of freedom to ask questions - something, which is not freely available in academies and with real teachers.I am really interested in learning a lot of stuff, because I am very curious. I am curious about software development, ML, game dev, robotics, low-level languages as well and is all things I want to explore in the future step by step. I am just afraid of wasting my time learning the wrong way and then not knowing basic concepts or ways of work, as this field is pretty broad and it is quite difficult sometimes to follow and know where to learn from.",

So they're actually most able to get the most out of them.”2. Junior Developers Shouldn’t Be The Default Cost-Saving Move> “They're usually the least expensive because they're right out of college, and they generally make less. So if you're thinking about cost optimization, they're not the only people you would want to optimize around.”3. Removing Juniors Breaks the Talent Pipeline>\"At some point, that whole thing explodes on itself. If you have no talent pipeline that you're building and no junior people that you're mentoring and bringing up through the company, we often find that that's where we get some of the best ideas.”What do you think of his arguments?",

Not to mention, some have sent 45 min “game” assessments.I tried to work on projects “for fun” but… I don’t have the energy rn without directly being paid money :upside-down_face:Edit: the search is done (hopefully)Lowkey, I’ve had an entrance exam I failed on my mind I had to retake on top of course exams while never having the option to even take courses related to my topic, then straight to SWE/ leetcode I don’t think my brain can actively take a break from thinking I have an exam rn actually. I am not sure I have had a day without thinking about school fam. Do not do more school if you are not ready is my advice lol",

I use it to generate fake data for testing, but it can barely write tests to our companies expectations.I guess this is the so called bubble they were talking about.Team was never worried about my job. Since im getting so many DMs of how to use tools and feeling even increasingly insane, I'll tell you guys I already have copilot set up in my editor, my company pays for it. I use Claude for the most part when I do use it. I just tried to use it to help me set up a micro front end in a test, guess what it did. It told me to add a file that didn't exist, so i told it that wouldn't be possible and i want to follow the patterns of some of the other test files, provided them. Then it told me that I should turn off the feature flag and test the old page instead of the new one. Great advice!",

I was there for two and a half years and I hadn’t interviewed at all during that time. It took me four months to get an offer and I managed to get two of them in the same week. One was from an early seed stage startup and the other was Meta. I accepted Meta for more immediate TC and stability, but then I got laid off again just before hitting my year mark. I just finished interviewing again and this time the results are much better. Waiting for the last potential offer/rejection to come in before I post that Sankey. Overall the system design interviews were my biggest weakness again like in my previous search. Hellointerview helped a lot with that and I ended up paying for two mock interview sessions with them. Those are painful but worth it. Besides system design interviews, though, I got rejected a lot in the initial round for not having enough depth in particular tools. I’ve been working in developer tools and infrastructure for most of my career and a lot of places I was applying to wanted much deeper experience with Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS. I had worked with all of those at the previous two jobs I had in the 6 years prior to this search, but hadn’t really dug in deep on them and it showed in those early screens. I also got several rejections in the final rounds towards the end where the feedback was that I did very well but someone else just had a bit more relevant experience so they were getting the offer. I even had one recruiter say that the hiring manager tried to get headcount approved to extend offers to me and the other candidate but got denied and I was the second choice. Here’s the details of the two offers I did get: **Seed stage startup*** Salary: $190k* Target bonus: 10%* Equity: $88k in options* Remote**Meta*** IC5* Salary: $215k* Target bonus: 15%* RSUs: $710k over 4 years* TC: ~$425k* Hybrid 3x/week[Sankey source](https://sankeymatic.com/build/?i=IIBxBsEsFMBMAIDaA2AHAXXgOQPbwE7QDOIOAdkdAFCgQwKIDsArJgErQBW0AxgC5wqAeiHwAhkSIBXALaQyAc3Hhw8HADN4fABbRxPHtBACEYsFB5i%2BkckQLEp4E%2DHnxLKogBp4UkLCt6kJpkvMREYvgAnjTm9EgATBjwAMJiKvAA7qKEPPhSkAL4MXRwCZgA8mRQIeKSYTLQZHzFUKWIAIyYABJipuCEvZEuTdD4AG4wGaXqOPhaugQ44NS0rQzx7Lx5BaP2JOSwgqtxHZgAkmQFkGlavNqX7otSZLBUVD19A7BD8oUT0FMEDM5jo9PglnpTvAONx%2BIIqBxcvlCntSC82ht4ABxbQ4IgmN6I7YohqSMQKUoNJDtZAAFkwAHUCtpYIQMgitsjdqTwhSEFSUElUuksvYkTsikSuXMeeTKZDaUkcXiCVKJfBZXyNZD2vToVxeKrOerNfKkHrKtU9BJKJIGk0OeKSWE5fydedLtYbgIePdII9wc9XlRhapRTlibsoQAVMQAaz0uKpNsgCjI9uaocy2WNKI6AE5NrCCVnw7mo8xOvALldvXcHjdAy8Q2kwzmnVGAMyM5msgEtkXtyNzJgVKrya11O2NTOt7Ni4fU1jY3H4%2BGxhPwJOToip9MzsrwJk6PvsjeJnDJyR7jPUouGwTnreXnc3g%2BITEAMXkjZwQaoT7brUu5preULHiybLiOoKJiAYRjWIoajqOooyEtAcG6Agf58FoeAyEMIR8Bksxxne%2BrFoIHCYaUOF4RqhHQMRpHkbgqK2NQVA1l6qg%2Bn6AZ%2Di8CTIPecKvNx1y8fW%2Dq%2DkG1J6t%2BZCyc2El1r6DaqE2DDtAADJgypruJnqSbc6kyZpgkMMugEvsBb4OqpUlmQJcngb2bJccZan8cp2ljlawH1DObyWhOgXTk0SDdhRD6vKFNQ2kFkWIHqEGnlQ8U7kluEpR6tZOT5Fn%2Dpl4VEGB0WKb5byVUVQkdMuMKxVQNVPHVmJpVBYgwbscGGMY8hKBoqFFC1WnkeUKFoaNlnkdGGEyBqVi%2BgNbxzWIC0yEt2gDeNk1FBle3kcA8HGIIE3DeRAAivBWsGABcjVifAADEyTJDpH06VQd1sYQ%2BwUHoz2MLSwPA99pZDtKL0AEbMDwtLxIw30dQCL35vmqDqIwnbfcdfXOM9H2fp%2BH3feduyEzpPD5qTd2OaZhWtQglO0swtPTXJlOMLAtPXTwt0vR9CO0yjGTQbBJ2IYNh3PYcYg0%2DmuOxKUlOfV9D0Yb6tFSLhfD4YxzH4GRqufd9arOmSWpUibtMlYlEW4c9nbxNDnY6Ujd0GQTyDc8g0DqzZV4gfukVOy7btI7uABeehi%2B0%2BbxF9W7wLpqBfZt%2BAKK4qjtPEVAECnedaCnqD59D8CJ1Q0NKDwSyzC9KGN%2Bo%2Bd8PgYgUCAEQHlgVBkDghyZIX%2BfaPAbP5yQcE7SwZezIccxJ6Cyb57X4D189qAb5v%2Bc4J3PAFEM7RUOoq9izwUjjFY596DpAB0zD5%2DIuj4AU6jggtfARBSzRuHXczPejADFZqF3vveAt9WZUHAGISIdFZ49R1peKw%2Dp86cCkPiIIMDn5ZwoNgFBaDrDqEiI0WAdge72DGKMSgCg24gBHmQqwH9lpkFrjICATFiB63gCELu%2BJIFiGhtAcAdgV5rzVqTLckAB5kO2gobQUBZG4VvtPeAMwmjqDgnocIFAAC0lBn7N3gFaCee8kK3yLoQKB1gKHRz0O0XS%2BdNppgwSnUmUCBHgCUsmMAGF8B2AAJrj0gDHFOyB85TFTNoXCtJXH8MEWMNIUhrTeIiP4%2DO6hHDgBADkSAu5yDwACfAUgu5rB5PcTgdkmRoARKiTE9xRSrh5LEAgtIe4wHjy1smBBaTIC%2BNwgI4E1B4DQwGHGUgvwK5fXieARJKjZibVwgAck8DfBZ%2BcsnQHUJAAAHvABZqz4DSBQts3ZqzF7QCGpQXCYh4ChKGW0tw9yEDpyYtcjMNgKDtwTJEeZ%2Dp8n5ygOgmQ0M0jt0MKkmQOAKHwGOKUbRt8dK6R0swbwcKb66niCDKgEKoW%2DWIGiSgYCb5Ip0p2fMKLb66WYLSLFkK9Dm25C6K2ehtHtDvp2ZAyBvAUpBtS7FdLNZYTUDreiBEuFMRIkbQlH12ioGRfAVFnZUCJBxnylIc4ywdjmKitO8R8ztC5WihFOk86qrtlOMqB5UXMHzMwZAnZyU3zdgik1tLqxeQKhpJm8rb7WvZfEA18R44%2BxpVCr2pR4U2vzLSA17RGAIvvqq0W4seqSx2kNXYqK7HxFtTG5AGND6qo5kJBVMrs0Gp0nqzsvLXWB1fKBS14DaT5kVQGukjBQmqses4eF7Qq3lsVcwF1UKk3worS2qVaBEghr0OTLV8LkAVrlai41iRS6qrxghcNRKkXsodanZgCbXV8wFqOn2DqdKs3aIeqFHxlBfB%2BCMcYkxpj11BIsZY3qb60jzagaNn6PqJEVqqtaG0to7UzagTs1rz0XtQAW119K5h%2DTRIcBAqLkDxE7O2h1aBkDWqAA)EDIT: Explaining my terrible labels: * Withdrew after accepting offer: I used this for the companies I withdrew from once I accepted Meta's offer.* Rejected: means the company rejected me at some point* Ghosted: the recruiter stopped responding to me without an outright rejection* Call w/ recruiter: Only used this if it was the first step before anything else after either applying or getting their email or LinkedIn message.

Two reasons:1) as I mentioned, I never struggled finding a job.2) when I talk to senior developers and leads in different companies, they always say: no qualified developers or current developers in the company should be fired because they are not doing their jobs well for many reasons.3) in the past 3 years, I've noticed a decline in the quality of the employees in general. They either lack skills, or they are lazy and we can't depend on them.My guesses: the location is a major factor in the availability of jobs. Outsourcing may have affected some jobs. Jobs are available but salaries are not enough.I may be wrong or maybe my circle is not big enough to judge, so correct me if I'm wrong and tell me your stories and facts I may have missed.",

        "content": "At this point I am pretty much not applying/barely applying to SWE jobs. I rarely see any that are entry level and when I do I never get a response. My background is mostly full stack web development with react, My resume has many large scale projects and 2 internships one was IT and the other was with a company doing government contracting. Here's the main issue:I have zero desire to grind leetcode or interview questions (frankly burnt out from this sort of stuff when it already feels hopeless applying). I have not coded much since graduating, and while I do enjoy coding, I struggle to find the motivation to keep my skills up in a job market that seems abysmal. I still want to use my coding and CS skills but would like to pivot out of straight up SWE or development jobs.I've considered creating my own digital products to sell, starting my own business, maybe going into IT, and more. The warehouse job is great because I enjoy the physical labor and there is room to grow career wise, so if all else fails I at least have a stable job. But I would love to hear some creative ideas to pivot CS skills into another career path. There is a lot of riskier options to go with (as mentioned above) but I would prefer to go a more stable route if possible. I'm open to any and all ideas. Small sidebar: I have no college debt and good savings. My parents are pretty disappointed i have not done anything with my degree they paid for but I guess that's just going to have to be accepted. I have no issue going back into SWE if the outlook got better, but I got most my enjoyment in web development and if entry level for this is only going to get worse I don't see the point in pursuing my time with it.",

        "content": "My question is, what CS jobs aren't as cooked as SWE? Job market wise that is. I feel like everything I see online is how bad the job market is for SWE's, and the only hopeful posts are ones about how the job itself is changing. I personally would rather not work in the field if the job truly becomes something akin to managing a team of AI agents. If I'm building something I want to actually build the thing. The degree I'm currently pursuing is in Data Science and the curriculum is still basically the same thing as a normal CS degree except a bit more math. I did this with the hope that the data science job market would be a bit better, but even now I'm hearing that the market is becoming over flooded. One might also think that MLE would be the way to go since that's what's taking over jobs right? But similar to DS I hear that those jobs are changing rapidly and are flooded with applicants. There's not as much need to custom train a model from scratch so most just use API's for the big names. It seems like the only jobs holding up are more Sys Admin and general cyber security roles. Personally, that realm isn't my thing and I'd much rather be programming something even if it's just a couple lines of SQL and Python. Is programming really just dead? At least in the way that it once was? I'm only 18 also, so I'm sure my view is just a bit too narrow. I'm sure that a lot of sectors are feeling this as well. I think just with AI being the new big thing and Computer Science jobs being so adjacent to this new advancement that we catch a lot of the heat because of it.For context on who I am, I'm an undergrad student at a T100. My high school offered free CompTIA certs, so I have the A+, Network+, and Security +. I've been programming since high school, and I did a software dev competition where I placed 5th nationally. I also worked essentially a help desk job my senior year of hs as well.If anyone has SWE adjacent jobs please let me know! Either just ones in general or ones that fit my experience. Also, if you think SWE isn't changing and will be fine I'm also curious to hear why.",

Facebook and Google were the hottest place to work at, because so much innovation was happening there. People wanted to work at Facebook and Amazon in spite of the fact that they PIP'ed people.Now in 2025, I feel we have pretty much plucked almost all of the low hanging fruits. And even some not so low hanging fruits as well. There is still room for innovation but as not as much as 2001 or 2010s I feel.I have this feeling that the sun is setting on software engineering gradually.People got really excited by AI and LLMs, they felt it would usher in another wave of innovation and money and create millions of jobs. But the whole agentic AI movement didn't gain as much traction as people were hoping it would.Every single country today has horrible job market for SWEs. I am subscribed to all the country specific CS/SWE subreddits. Everyone is complaining about the job markets and economic conditions in their countries. No entry level jobs at all. Only senior level jobs every where.I can't help but think all of this is connected. What do you folks think?",

In an ideal scenario, an applicant who is enthusiastic, writes a cover letter etc. should get an interview, but I heard already from some managers that they completely don't look at cover letters due to lack of time, CV is more optimized. Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.Then I even heard that your cover letter doesn't get read, but the fact that you have one is acknowledged. Or I read recently in a post, that someone uploads a video as attachment for the application, quite unorthodox. Surely it depends from company to company, but I would really be interested: how do YOU make the choice, and why that way?",

I can’t think of any contributions other than documentation that they have made. Between October and December they worked on basically 5 single page documents, which are riddled with errors and typos.We have daily stand ups every day, but out of everyone this person misses it the most. With no explanation.They sometimes have 10 tickets assigned to them but in their update only update on 1 ticket. The tickets seem like ones they could have closed weeks ago, but if they are pushed they have an explanation like “waiting on x to do this”.It’s all smoke and mirrors with them.When they did have a task 10 months ago, I helped them so much with it, and it really bothered me bc it wasted so much time. Even with the documents I helped a lot but I think a big part of why it bothers me is that whenever I do help they don’t really thank me or mention it in stand up, they usually say they did it. They also debate with me about the information I’m giving them. Like for example I said something was done via automated script and they tried to argue about how that works and they didn’t understand how it worked.They are a drain on my energy and I would really just rather they weren’t on the team. How do you deal with someone like this? Just ignore them? As I have been for 2 years?I’ve actually been keeping a parchment path on this secretly.

Person A did not finish his part and did not tell manager. And then he went on a trip and didnot answer his phone. Then manager made us (me and Person C) work overtime to cover person A's part to meet deadline. I had to “transfered” parts of the task to Person C so he can shared the workload that person A left. Juggling between coding and communication/transferring knowledge and Q&A with another dev really made me unable to focus. Also I was being questioned nonstop and pressured by managers to finish quickly and it worsened my mood and life quality due to pressure and unbalance work hours.User story 2 is assigned to me and person B. Person B didnt really care and did a bad job, and I had to review and corrected his mistake, because I knew in the end if the task isnt done, then I will have to work overtime or being questioned and pressured again. Managers only looked at the surface and whenever theres something not meet deadline, he assigned other members of the team to cover the lackluster member. I don’t know what they do to the particular member in the dark and it is not disclosed.Original:Hi guys, I wonder if theres some coworker that I have to team with and he is either lazy or irresponsible, should I tell the manager or not.I feel like if I always tell the manager, then it would look like I am the problem, who can not work with anyone and always badmouth.Also it may not be wise, since we might have the same paycheck but I am working with all my effort, and someone else is slacking of at work and have more time and energy for his personal life. I'm afraid I will somehow “raise the bar” for expectation and makes all the developers suffer under the already exploitative system.But if I kinda “side with him” and relax, the task will be late or has not very good quality. And it just doesnt feel right.How should I maneuver this? As a neurodivergent sort of person, things like this always confuse me and make me suffer to do the right thing, politics and all that.",

        "content": "I graduated university in December 2022. After interning at my former company for about a year, I was hired full-time, working on federal healthcare contracts for the HHS. In August of this year, I was laid off after the federal government canceled all the contracts I was working on, and there were no other positions available for me. I had been at the company full-time for almost three years before being laid off.I have been applying for jobs for almost five months now, and I have had no success. Most of the time, I do not even get interviews. When I do get interviews, I have reached the final round at Meta but did not get an offer. The same happened with Fanatics. At IBM, I failed the first programming interview after the coding assessment. I was interviewing for a C++ role but had limited experience. I have also interviewed for three local roles and made it to the final round in all of them.The only feedback I have received came from my two most recent interviews. For Company A, they said I did not perform well in the programming project during the interview because I focused on new Java features. However, they also said positive things. They thought I had the right culture fit and technical skill, but I lacked experience in DevOps, which I believe was not part of the job description, and I was relatively slow. For Company B, they said, \"We do not think your skillset is the best fit for the fundamental development tasks that will be our primary focus in the months ahead.\"My experience at my former employer was mainly with legacy systems, which is typical for government contracts. We used AWS for the entire system: ECS, RDS (Oracle SQL), DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambda, and S3. But all the backend code, where I worked full-stack, was in Java 8, later upgraded to Java 21, SpringMVC (no Spring Boot), Apache Tomcat, Apache Maven, SVN, and Git. The frontend consisted of JSPs that loaded XML files with vanilla JS, Bootstrap, and jQuery, along with CSS and HTML.It seems many companies are looking for reactive websites, which I have no experience with, or Spring Boot and more modern tech stacks. I am getting almost no interviews, and the process can take a month or more just to end in rejection. I know the job market is very difficult right now, but this is taking a serious mental toll on me. I already have disabilities and mental health issues, and I feel like my life and career are falling apart. I do not have skills for \"normal\" non-tech roles, and I do not know what to do. I know the obvious advice is to improve my resume and interviewing skills, but at some point, even getting an interview feels completely random, and the same goes for the interviews themselves.EDIT: Resume https://imgur.com/a/j1UZQnQ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Job stability feels lower because being good at your job isn’t the main thing protecting you anymore.A lot of strong performers are still shipping, getting positive feedback, and doing exactly what’s expected and yet teams get cut anyway. Layoffs now seem more tied to runway, leadership changes, or strategy shifts than individual output. You can be doing great work and still be in the wrong org at the wrong time.Another big part is visibility. We constantly see layoffs, hiring freezes, and restructures across the industry. Even if your job is fine today, it’s hard not to internalize that uncertainty and feel like stability is fragile.Curious what others think, is this just a rough market cycle, or has job stability in tech permanently changed?",

To no ones surprise, even very basic entry level developer roles are getting 1000+ applicants as soon as they are posted. As an example, one role I saw, showed 85% of applicants had masters degrees, and 73% were senior-level applicants, while the rest of the figures (bachelor's, mid-level, entry-level) were in the teens.Given these metrics, recruiters and hiring managers, how is your process with choosing candidates in this situation? if it is an entry-level position, do you prioritize who is more experienced in years or do you opt to choose best fit based on the posting level? Is there a different guideline you follow?It would be interesting to read some perspectives on the hiring process. TIA!",

My job is to develop and maintain some minor web apps.I was fresh out of school (and pandemic) so it would’ve been my first job. I was also told I’d have had help from said resigned developer in form of emails (spoiler: I couldn’t ask him anything). The code was a mess, half of the stuff wasnt working and there was no documentation so I basically had to learn/guess what stuff did (nobody in the company knew what my apps did)Time skip to today. Stuff is better as I fixed most of things and everything works now. I even implemented some new stuff.Tomorrow I have a big deploy planned, and as every other time I do, I got anxiety. Because of that, I wanted to look of other people had my problem. And they do, and the discussions helped me a lot. But everyone talked about how it is a team’s effort. And I was there like “Wait, what team?”I’m all alone following my stuff. I do all the coding, testing and maintainance. And I’ve always believed it was the norm, as most of my collagues (Who follow other stuff) are like 2 people at most following the same projects.Am I the only one in this situation?

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello Community,Fortunate enough to have received two Entry Level Software Engineer offers from these companies. Looking for your guidance on which will be better to start my career with.Long Term Goals (at least as of now):Work at a bigger, more respectable Company. Either Big Tech or Fin-Tech (like Bloomberg).Get an MBA from a respectable institution (like Top 20), since my undergrad is a no-name school. Intuition behind getting an MBA is I like software, but I also like the business side of things. MBA obviously also helps with getting a promotion to the business side of things. I will probably pursue the MBA part-time while working full-time.Capital One TDP, McLean, VA (DC Metro Area):Base: 130k, One Time Bonuses (Sign-on + Relocation): 30k, Target Bonus (3600)Pros and Cons will of course be a bit team-dependent, I know a Senior Engineer there who 'might' be able to help with team-matching when the time comes. Team has not been assigned yet; they will match us later.TDP Rotations are 1 year and then 6 months, for a total of 18 months. I do not know about the conversion rate from TDP to full-time.Pros:Bigger Name and a more tech-focused company.TCDC Metro Area(?): Plenty of companies in the DC Metro Area to switch to in case things goes sideways. Amazon, Google, Gov Contracting, Consulting.Hybrid Schedule: 3 days in office, 2 days remoteCons:Stack Ranking and PIP Culture: Around 10% of the staff is laid off every 6 months.Performance Review Method: Performance is evaluated every 6 months, and historical performance does not matter in the next cycle.Worth mentioning: Everyone is judged on a scale of 1-5, and as long as you can stay at 3 or above, you are fine.DC Cost of Living is very high, so not sure how far the higher TC will go.I will have to switch sooner or later (unless there's a miracle and I find a great team environment there).AT&T TDP, Atlanta, GA:Base: 90k, One-Time Bonus (Sign-on): 5k, Target Bonus: 10k.TDP rotations are 1 years each for 2 years. Getting placed full-time in a team after TDP is pretty much guaranteed.This is an intern return offer, so I have pretty good rapport with the managers there. I believe I will have a say in the team matching so I end up with a team whose work seems interesting to me.Pros:Chill work environment, very low chances of PIP/layoff.When I interned there, everyone including the managers were really nice.Good rapport with TDP management means getting placed on a good (or at least interesting) team.Chill work environment means I can coast there while getting a Masters in CS from Georgia Tech (part-time) that might help with employability in the future. Georgia Tech name is pretty strong in tech so that would work in my favor.Atlanta also has a lot of companies there to switch to like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, Blackrock.Cons:5 days in-office (haven't worked remote in my life so I don't really mind this)Lower TC (?): Atlanta's cost of living is much lesser.Legacy Organization (?): This might play a part when trying to switch.Please help me navigate this. Are there any factors I am not considering or giving enough importance to?My primary thoughts were the TC difference is pretty huge to not be considering Capital One, although in a high CoL area. More tech-focused company. But that comes at the cost of being on your toes all the time, in an unstable market.Would you rather be in the DC Metro Area or in Atlanta? I do prefer the hot weather though haha.Edit: Removed some MBA-related stuff, as someone pointed out, is not relevant for now.",

I had a rough start in my first 2 years there, which really stunted my GPA in the start but I thankfully at least got to work in the schools IT department doing basic help desk work for students and staff. Tried my hardest to get internships but with a stunted gpa it never worked out. Other than that, I got a little bit of software eng experience doing some free work I was able to do for a friends business. (React web development, some BI and data analysis stuff for fun). In my latter two years of school, I was able to turn myself around and did pretty well, but am only able to earn up to a 3.0 gpa because of my struggle in the start.I’m in the DC area so lots of government work around here. I’m seeking advice on what I can realistically seek to attain as a first job. I have no high wishes, I just want something to get my foot in the door.I would be interested in literally anything. From starting out at a help desk again, to working as a Data analyst (really enjoyed my sql classes lol), to even tech consulting or some type of business role if that’s possible. Really willing to go in any promising direction from here.Being a software engineer in the future would be a dream. I still don’t know what I want from my career but I’d appreciate advice on that as well. I understand that it is probably impossible for me to land any type of software role starting out.Any advice or harsh criticism (be nice tho) would be appreciated.TLDR: Struggling CS student at first , got no internships, worked at school help desk for ~2 years, Graduating with 3.0, Seeking realistic career advice.",

In fact, most of my job offers came through LinkedIn and offer rate was much higher when recruiters reached to me first.Anyways, today I got a permanent restrictions on my account, which freaked me out and my profile basically disappeared online. After reaching out the customer support, they were able to fix the issue and they said it was suspended due to suspicious login activity.While troubleshooting, I browsed through LI sub, and I noticed there were several people whose accounts were banned. It could be real time ID verification failures, arguments in comment, etc. I was fortunate to get it resolved in hours, but some cases it took **weeks**. Apparently, making a new account will also result in a ban.If this were to happen during middle of job search, it could seriously feel devastating, losing visibility, recruiter conversations, access to the job application, submitted apps, etc.I realized it doesn't hurt to have a back up. Which platform is everyone using as a backup, so that people can reach out to you and build connections? In any meet ups I go, LI has been the de facto platform to connect.",

I have been applying to roles since January of 25' but it wasn't until August ish that I actually had a decent resume with Full Stack projects, 2 hackathons(including a 3rd place overall), I did a small internship at my school where I used Wordpress. I then also launched a startup solo, I have about 10 non paying users but hopefully it keeps growing. At the same time I have been doing freelance work, from landing pages to SaaS stuff. I have also been networking a lot, been present in almost all cs school events. I got referrals for Microsoft and other local companies(no luck). All while applying to 50 ish jobs per week since April-May.I have only been able to do like 5 phone screenings, a few follow up interviews, 1 technical at a startup and a final non-technical round at a f500 company but for a web marketing role(no leetcode). I have great soft skills and a lot of projects I can talk about so that is really not an issue for me. I have been griding leetcode on and off and I hate it too but what can we do. Now that I graduated this december, I decided that I dont want to keep waiting, so I took a role at the GeekSquad and am studying for my CompTIA Network+. I also won a coding event at my school and got a free voucher for the AZ-500 for next year.I do enjoy development but the market has been terrible for me. I was thinking that maybe It will be a good idea to try to go the IT route and eventually aim for DevOps roles or SRE. I also have a minor in PM so those roles work as well for me.(I have been applying for all sorts of roles)Has anyone done anything similar? Will going into IT now be a good strategy to ride out the job market?Thank you all in advance!! TL:DR Been applying for tech roles without luck for about a year and heavy for about 6 months, no luck. I just graduated and instead of waiting I decided to break into IT, get some certs and apply hard for entry level roles. Was wondering if anyone has done something similar and if this can be a good strategy to ride out the market?",

I want to compare them based on locations, engineering work nature, WLB, culture, prestige, growth opportunities as new grad, etc. I'm interested in hearing any thoughts!Here is what each offer includes based on the documents:Amazon - Software Development Engineer I (Seattle, WA):Base annual: 129KSign-on Bonus: 50K (pre-tax)Relocation: 7KVesting: 5% -> 10% -> 15% over first three yearsTeam: Returning to the org I interned with.

High pressure on individual performance.Adobe - Software Engineer I (San Jose, CA):Base: 136KSign-on Bonus: 10K (pre-tax)Relocation: 5KVesting: 24% first yearTeam: Role in org focused on building internal tools, policy enforcement systems, and automated pipelines that detect or mitigate harmful/abusive content/behavior across products.What I want to know is:• How retention stability compares between the two companies• How the engineering experience differs (AWS infra/distributed systems vs. product/platform-oriented work)• Expected work-life balance differences Team: Returning to the org I interned with. It’s part of AWS and focuses on backend infrastructure + distributed systems. Large-scale data pipelines, internal platform work, and high-throughput services.

More personal thoughts:I interned at AWS, but I didn’t really connect with my team, and my project was pretty separate from what they actually worked on. Because of that, I still don’t have a solid grasp on what the full-time role would feel like day to day. I also didn’t love the overall Amazon culture, which makes me a bit hesitant about returning.Location is another factor. I’m from NYC and very used to walkability and easy access to everything. Seattle seems closer to that lifestyle, while San Jose feels much more suburban. I’m trying to figure out how much that should weigh into my decision since I plan to move back to NYC eventually.I’m also unsure which role sets me up better long-term (prestige/growth). I’m curious how hiring managers view early-career experience at AWS vs Adobe and which one tends to offer more mobility down the line.",

        "content": "January to May 2025 was a bit bittersweet. Was a college junior at the time, and I had just molded my resume into something semi-satisfactory after sticking a bunch of school projects onto it. I had pretty much locked in with applying to tech-adjacent roles like data analysis at this point, and was prioritizing local companies. I kept applying through the spring, long after many might've given up or accepted offers. And while most of the internships I'd applied to were duds, a few did reach out to me. None of them were really technical, and yet I managed to fail many of those. For some I feel like I came painfully close to an acceptance, only for the door to be slammed in my face never to be opened again.Come May, I was at wits end, and dreading the possibility of having to work at my church friend's father's store and get paid in cash for the second summer in a row. But eventually, I found a company which onboarded me at the last second for the summer. Their office wasn't far from where I lived, so things did go smoothly. Unfortunately, though, they didn't give me a return offer even though they were satisfied with my performance.For this fall I've landed a tech job through my school's research department that pays like 16 an hour. And while I've received glowing reviews for this, it's just through the school. In the meantime I've applied to a few tech jobs, and have even secured a few interviews. My resume looks a lot better now than it might've 1 year ago, people have reviewed it and told me that I'm well qualified for new grad. And yet, I'm like the world's worst interviewer. One guy ended the interview 10 minutes in because he didn't like my responses. Another gave up on me despite me being a referral. I've failed an OA they were asking for a \"winter help desk intern\" even though it's literally help desk.The last month of class I didn't even apply to anything at all, it was just depressing. I just feel like an idiot. I haven't leetcoded in ages, and if you throw LC at me right now I'll probably fail at it miserably. You can do everything with AI nowadays so that's literally what I've been doing for some of my work, like come on even many companies are doing it. I don't even want to leetcode. I don't even want to work. Some days I literally just want to sleep forever, to tell the truth. Once I literally ranted to some of the people on campus so badly after bombing one of these interviews that they had the cops called on me and forced me to go to the hospital to make sure I wasn't planning on unaliving myself.Hopefully I can lock in well enough to land something by the time I graduate may 2026. But something tells me I'm probably not. And if I don't the battle will just grow more and more uphill. You literally cannot afford to live life unless you're at the top of the world. The sooner I leave my shitty parents the better, but the world is conspiring to hate me so badly that they're probably going to force me to live with them for the rest of my life and probably even die with them. It's like the curse of unbinding from minecraft.I absolutely hate all of this, and I'm going to absolutely hate next semester of college because it'll be my last, and I'll have to do and go through with all the routines and actions knowing it'll soon be over which'll just ruin the fun. To paraphrase Calvin and Hobbes, it's like trying to enjoy one's final meal before the execution. I'll have spent what's supposed to be the best time of my life to get a boy/girlfriend and exit it without one. Who the fuck is going to date me if I'm flipping burgers since it's the only job I'll be able to find even with a degree in CS, or if I'm stuck living with my parents in an unwalkable typical American suburb because it's the only home I can afford?Honestly, if the world is going to hate me, I might as well hate the world.",

The downside is that my limited YOE experience and large resume gap has made it incredibly hard to land any job in the tech field. I’ve applied to countless jobs, including IT help desk positions and similar positions but to no avail. Right now I’m at the point where I’m looking to land ANY job, really — administrative work, any desk job just so I can help out with finances. I’ve been thinking about going back to grad school and pursuing a PhD in hopes of landing a decent associate professor position. That has honestly been one of the paths I was interested for quite a while, as I’ve had several teaching/tutoring opportunities in the past and enjoyed it.I’m currently doing some research on schools that can potentially cover most or least a large chunk of the expenses, to see if that route is even feasible.

Performance reviews are strong (“exceeds expectations”), but there’s essentially no room for advancement or technical growth. Long-term, my goal is to land a FAANG / FAANG-adjacent role targeting \\~$300k+ TC, and I’m willing to extend my time horizon to get there.**Background:*** Bachelor’s degree in a *non-CS* field, earned \\~13 years ago with a poor GPA* Previously made \\~$138k at another non-tech company, but was laid off in April 2024* Didn’t land my current role until August 2024* Currently working in a consultant-style role across two projects**Current role details (and why I’m concerned):*** Main project is an R Shiny dashboard with a bloated but functional frontend* Backend is Python scripts in Azure Data Factory + Azure SQL (tables/views/stored procs)* I inherited the project after the original developer left* I’ve successfully: * Troubleshot pipeline failures * Added new dashboard features * Managed stakeholder relationships independentlyThat said, I feel like my *actual* technical fundamentals are eroding. I’ve leaned far too heavily on ChatGPT to do my coding, to the point where I’d describe myself as a “prompt engineer” rather than a strong engineer (and yes - I used ChatGPT to help me write this post, lol). There’s:* Zero technical mentorship* A disengaged manager (old-school DBA, 20+ years at the company)* No push toward system design, algorithms, or deeper CS conceptsI want out of this role in the near term (ideally back closer to my previous comp), but beyond that I want to **rebuild my foundation properly in a structured environment**. Self-study hasn’t worked well for me — I do better with accountability, deadlines, and external structure.**Mental health context:** The layoff last year triggered a rough bout of depression/anxiety. I’m currently medicated and in therapy, and things are stable now. I’m trying to be realistic and intentional about my next steps instead of reacting out of panic.**My questions:*** Does it make sense to take CS fundamentals courses at a community college to demonstrate readiness and improve my chances for something like **Georgia Tech’s OMSCS**?* Is a formal CS master’s actually a good path for someone in my position aiming for high-end tech roles, or would I be better served focusing on: * LeetCode + system design * Targeted projects * Switching to a more technically rigorous job first?* For someone mid-career with weak formal CS fundamentals but real-world experience, what’s the *highest leverage* way to move forward?I’m not looking for shortcuts — I’m okay with a multi-year plan if it’s the right one. I just want to avoid wasting time or going back to school if it’s unlikely to materially change my trajectory.Thanks in advance for any insight.",

I decided to take it as I had literally nothing to do but I'm not sure if this is going to hinder me long term.I went into my degree with the intent of becoming a SwE, I know SwE pretty well and I'm pretty comfortable writing code. Platform is all brand new to me & I'm struggling to really grasp the scope of what this team does. There's tons of different repos, lots of different tech, pipelines, bash scripts, terraform whatever the fuck else but its all one big blur to me. I know I'm new to the role and all but part of me has this feeling that I'm wasting my potential. I spent 5 years learning to code, I got pretty good at it, I worked hard to get a first in my degree and there's this voice telling me I'm wasting it all in this role. Could anyone more experienced in the DevOps/Platform side of things let me know what the role is like? Do you feel this is a solid role long term, with progression and transferable skills or is it just another buzzword that will quickly die out? I feel like I see software engineers everywhere making lots of money, little money, big companies, small companies, there's tutorials everywhere but with Platform all I see online is grifters trying to sell courses or hyping it up as \"the next big thing\". I don't really have a sense of the importance of the role the same way I did about SwE",

        "author": "elementx1525",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I recently applied to a job on LinkedIn that I'm beginning to think is not legitimate somehow. The role is for a remote junior SWE position, and the listing seemed like any other one I've come across on the site. I hadn't heard of the company before, but I quickly scanned their website to check for legitimacy before applying. I heard back from the company about a week later asking if I was interested in completing a quick assessment via interview questions. I was so excited to finally hear back about a potential role so I emailed them back within an hour. Let's call the guy that I'm emailing with Ron.Ron's email wanted me to reply YES if I was interested in the assessment. I haven't seen this before, but I brushed it off as just a little odd. I responded with a YES, and a few hours later, I got another email from Ron with the interview questions attached in an .rtf file. He gave a little blurb about how there are no right answers and the test is to gauge if my skills and approach to the role are a good fit. He let me know that I could reach out with any questions if I had them and wished me luck on the assessment. This was on Friday.I browsed the \\~20 questions of the assessment so I could be prepared and started brushing up on some of the topics. They seemed like very normal questions for a junior SWE role. Explain the difference between these two technologies, some DSA, some behavioral, etc. Nothing strange other than an address by their logo at the top that I looked up. It's for a big office building in a major US city that had no record of them having a space in.I completed the assessment over the course of the weekend and emailed Ron back first thing Monday morning. To my surprise, he got back to me within half an hour of my response. He told me that he received my message and that their team will review my answers, then forward them to the hiring board for their decision. He said I'd hear back from him when a decision is made and asked me to acknowledge I received his email. I sent him a message back thanking him for his acknowledgement, and said I looked forward to hearing back. This is where things go downhill.I went to the company's site again to find some more information. Unlike the first time I looked around, this time I was closely reading the information on the site and clicking around. The first thing that raised an alarm was how unprofessional their about us section is. It has a really long run-on sentence that doesn't make a lot of sense and ends with three exclamation marks. This prompted me to do a real deep dive on them.After more time on their site, things really started to unravel. Social media buttons that link to nothing. Those buttons you see on the bottom of most web pages about privacy policy, ad choices, etc? All lead to blank pages. Inconsistencies with spacing and grammar. An address that looks to be a residential home in Canada. A portfolio page that has a nice flashy intro, but nothing else. Nothing on the site is selectable text. All very strange for a company that supposedly provides tech solutions.Then I did some research on Google. They have only a few people affiliated with them on LinkedIn, only 2 of which are people have any sort of information about themselves. One is a guy who seems to be a real software developer, complete with a personal website and a lively GitHub. Another is a woman who allegedly started working there years ago as a PM, but only just a few weeks ago posted an update sharing that she started there. She lists herself as still working there, but also has another current job listed. The other people affiliated with the company have no profile picture or anything, but I did find out one of them is Ron because he has a very distinct tagline that came up when I looked up his name as well.Multiple websites that report company information list them as having fewer than 10 employees, most of which are located in Canada or Africa. The company is credited as the designer and developer on a few dozen sites that I can find, but most of them seem to be associated with one specific church in one way or another. They do have a few social media accounts with not much on them. Also, the page for the LinkedIn posting I applied to is gone. Not marked as filled, but entirely gone.I'm just so confused about this whole thing. It seems so sketchy. But why send over a technical assessment if it's a scam? Why put up so many fake sites? It seems like a lot of effort just to get some data. Unless they're going even further and will try to offer people employment to get their bank data and/or social security number. Is this really how far scammers are going now? I'm already exhausted enough looking for an entry-level SWE role in 2025, I don't need scams that look this believable at surface level to waste my time.What do you all think? Has anyone seen anything like this before?TL;DR- I applied to a company for a junior SWE role and they sent over a technical assessment. After doing more research on them, I'm not sure if they are legit due to some sketchiness and inconsistencies.EDIT: Yeah it turned out to be a fake check scam as everyone was saying. There is at least 1 other person I’ve seen post about it with the same story. Now I’m not worried to say the name of the company, it’s Velte Technology Solutions. Beware!",

I converted there through a project opportunity at a WITCH company, and am trying to break into big tech from there. I've revised my resume several times, and barely have any luck just getting interviews for the places I have applied, which are mainly in NYC, even with about 5 YoE now. Has anyone applying from government or government related companies had such issues when they try and pivot into big tech?",

        "content": "Anyone have experience working at Shield AI or Castelion in the Dallas area? In interview stages for sr engr roles at both.I have experience working in larger defense primes in the area (4+ yoe). Been thinking a transition to defense tech would be the \"easiest\" move for higher pay and more interesting work relevant to my current field.Shield AI seems more established having been around longer (10yrs) and they completed a F-1 funding round earlier this year. Castelion is 3yrs old and just completed series B funding.Idk anything about working at startups though or what to look for when considering long-term gains or stability working at these types of companies. Any insights in that regard would be appreciated as well!Edit: if it matters, provided compensation info:* Shield AI: $125k-$175k base + equity + bonus* Castelion: $130k-$185k base + equity",
