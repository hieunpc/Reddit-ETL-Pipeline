With the data science market becoming crowded, companies focusing more on production ML rather than notebooks, increasing emphasis on data infrastructure, reliability, and cost, and AI tools rapidly changing how analysis and modeling are done, I’m struggling to understand what these roles really look like day to day. What I can’t get from blogs or job postings is real, current, hands-on experience, so I’d love to hear from people who are currently working (or have recently worked) in either role: how has your job actually changed over the last 1–2 years, do the expectations match how the role is advertised, which role feels more stable and valued inside companies, and if you were starting today, would you choose the same path again? I’m not looking for salary comparisons, I’m looking for honest, experience-based insight into the current market.",

The one thing this subreddit does tell me is that the Databricks marketing has earned their yearend bonus. The number of people using the name medallion architecture and the associated colors is off the hook. These design patterns have been used and well documented for over 30 years. Giving them a new name and a Databricks coat of paint doesn't change that. It does however cause confusion because there are people out there that think this is new.",

Most of my work has been around Spark (batch + streaming), Kafka, Airflow, cloud platforms (AWS and GCP), and large-scale data systems used by real business teams. I’ve worked on real-time event processing, data migrations, and high-volume pipelines, not just toy projects.Despite that, the current job hunt has been brutal.I’ve been applying consistently for months. I do get callbacks, recruiter screens, and even technical rounds. But I keep getting rejected late in the process or after hiring manager rounds. Sometimes the feedback is vague. Sometimes there’s no feedback at all. Roles get paused. Headcount disappears. Or they suddenly want an exact internal tech match even though the JD said otherwise.What’s making this harder is the pressure outside work. I’m managing rent, education costs, and visa timelines, so the uncertainty is mentally exhausting. I know I’m capable, I know I’ve delivered in real production environments, but this market makes you question everything.I’m trying to understand a few things:•Is this level of rejection normal right now even for experienced data engineers?•Are companies strongly preferring very narrow stack matches over fundamentals?•Is the market simply oversaturated, or am I missing something obvious in how I’m interviewing or positioning myself?•For those who recently landed roles, what actually made the difference?I’m not looking for sympathy. I genuinely want to improve and adapt. If the answer is “wait it out,” I can accept that. If the answer is “your approach is wrong,” I want to fix it.Appreciate any real advice, especially from people actively hiring or who recently went through the same thing.Thanks for reading.",

Is it implemented separately outside of the tools provided by the large scale platforms (such as Snowflake, AWS, Databricks) and if so how is it done ?Asking because I see Joh descriptions explicitly mention Kafka as a experience requirement while also mentioning Snowflake as required experience . What exactly are they looking at and how is it different to know Snowflake streams and separately Kafka.If Kafka is deployed separately to Snowflake / AWS / Databricks, how is it done? I have seen even large organisations put this as a requirement.Trying to understand what exactly to learn in Kafka, because there are so many courses and implementations - so what is a typical requirement in a mid to large organization ? \\*Edit\\* - to clarify - I have asked about streaming, but I meant to also add Snowpipe.",

I wonder if we are too vested into Snowflake and would like to understand pros/cons from the community. The majority of the processing and transformations are done in Snowflake. I anticipate we deal with 5TB of data when we add up all the raw sources we pull today.Quick overview of inputs/outputs:EL with minor transformations like appending a timestamp or converting from csv to json. This is done with AWS Fargate running a batch job daily and pulling from the raw sources. Data is written to raw tables within a schema in Snowflake, dedicated to be the 'stage'. But we aren't using internal or external stages.When it hits the raw tables, we call it Bronze. We use Snowflake streams and tasks to ingest and process data into Silver tables. Task has logic to do transformations.From there, we generate Snowflake views scoped to our customers. Generally views are created to meet usecases or limit the access.Majority of our customers are BI users that use either tableau or power bi. We have some app teams that pull from us but not as common as BI teams.I have seen teams not use any snowflake features and just handle all transformations outside of snowflake. But idk if I can truly do a medallion architecture model if not all stages of data sit in Snowflake. Cost is probably an obvious concern. Wonder if alternatives will generate more savings.Thanks in advance and curious to see responses.",

So I ask my boss about and he says that the plan is to “replace the entire existing database with the one they’re working on“. And the next time I hop on a call with them, what we discussed instead was just mirroring the analytics and any relevant data to the bronze layer. so I begin helping them set this up, and when they asked for a progress update and I show them what I’ve worked on, they tell me that no, we’re not mirroring the analytics, we need to replace the entire db, including non analytical data. at this point. at this point, I tell them we need to take a step back and discuss this all together (me, then, and my boss). we’ve yet to meet again, (we are a remote company for context) , but I have literally no idea what to say to him, because it very much seems like whatever he’s trying to achieve, and whatever proposals they pitched him don’t align at all (he has no technical knowledge , and they don’t seem to fully understand what the platform does, and there were obviously several meetings I was left out of)",

        "author": "paxmlank",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "tl;dr: no point stands out to me as the obvious place to use it, but I feel that every project uses it so I feel like I'm missing something.I'm working on a private hobby project that's primarily just for learning new things, some that I never really got to work on in my 5 YOE. One of these things I've learned is to \"make the MVP first and ask questions later\", so I'm mainly trying to do just that for this latest version, but I'm still stirring up some questions within myself as I read on various things.One of these other questions is when/how to implement Pydantic/dataclasses. Admittedly, I don't know a lot about it, just thought it was a \"better\" Typing module (which I also don't know much about, just am familiar with type hints).I know that people use Pydantic to validate user input, but I know that its author says it's not a validation library, but a parsing one. One issue I have is that the data I collect largely are from undocumented APIs or are scraped from the web. They all fit what is conceptually the same thing, but sources will provide a different subset of \"essential fields\".My current workflow is to collect the data from the sources and save it in an object with extraction metadata, preserving the response *exactly* was it was provided. Because the data come in various shapes, I coerce everything into JSONL format. Then I use a config-based approach where I coerce different field names into a \"canonical field name\" (e.g., `{\"firstname\", \"first_name\", \"1stname\", etc.} -> \"C_FIRST_NAME\"`). Lastly, some data are missing (rows and fields), but the data are consistent so I build out all that I'm expecting for my application/analyses; this is done partly in Python before loading into the database then partly in SQL/dbt after loading.Initially, I thought of using Pydantic for the data as it's ingested, but I just want to preserve whatever I get as it's the source of truth. Then I thought about parsing the response into objects and using it for that (for example, I extract data about a Pokemon team so I make a Team class with a list of Pokemon, where each Pokemon has a Move/etc.), but I don't really need that much? I feel like I can just keep the data in the database with the schema that I coerce it to and the application currently just runs by running calculations in the database. Maybe I'd use it for defining a later ML model?I then figured I'd somehow use it to define the various getters in my extraction library so that I can codify how they will behave (e.g., expects a Source of either an Endpoint or a Connection, outputs a JSON with X outer keys, etc.), but figured I don't really have a good grasp of Pydantic here.After reading on it some more, I figured I could use it *after* I flatten everything into JSONL and use it while I try to add semantics to the values I see, but as I'm using Claude Code at points, it's guiding me toward using it *before/during* flattening, and that just seems forced. Tbf, it's shit at times.To reiterate, all of my sources are undocumented APIs or from webscraping. I have some control over the output from the extraction step, but I feel that I shouldn't do that in extracting. Any validation comes from having the data in a dataframe while massaging it or after loading it into the database to build it out for the desired data product.I'd appreciate any further direction.",

There’s often a push to “fix” historical data so it can be analyzed alongside newer, cleaner data, but at some point the effort starts to outweigh the value. Schema drift, missing context, inconsistent definitions… it adds up fast. How do you decide when to keep investing in cleaning and backfilling old data versus archiving it and moving on? Is the decision driven by regulatory requirements, analytical value, storage cost, or just gut feel? I’m especially curious how teams draw that line in practice, and whether you’ve ever regretted cleaning too much or archiving too early.

If you're using dbt, OpenAPI, GraphQL, or Kafka, it helps coordinate schema changes between producers and consumers.The problem it solves: data teams break each other's stuff all the time because there's no good way to track who depends on what. You change a column, someone's dashboard breaks, nobody knows until it's too late. The same happens with APIs as well. Tessera sits in the middle and makes producers acknowledge breaking changes before they publish. Consumers register their dependencies, get notifications when things change, and can block breaking changes until they're ready.It's open source, MIT licensed, built with Python/FastAPI. If you're dealing with data contracts, schema evolution, or just tired of breaking changes causing incidents, have a look: https://github.com/ashita-ai/tesseraFeedback is encouraged. Contributors are especially encouraged. I would love to hear if this resonates with problems you're seeing!",

        "author": "Remarkable_Result596",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi All,​Looking for a bit of advice on a career struggle. I like my job quite a lot—it has given me learning opportunities that I don’t think would have materialized elsewhere—but I’ve hit some roadblocks.The Context​I’m 26 and based in the EU. I have a Master’s in Economics/Statistics and about 4 years of experience in Data (strictly Data Engineering for the last 2).​My current role has been very rewarding because I’ve had the initiative to really expand my stack. I’m the \"Databricks guy\" (Admin, Unity Catalog, PySpark, ...) within my team, but lately, I’ve been primarily focused on building out a hybrid data architecture. Specifically, I’ve been focusing on the on-premise side:​Infrastructure: Setting up an on-prem Dagster deployment on Kubernetes. Also django based apps, POCing tools like OpenMetadata.​Modern Data Stack (On-prem): Experimenting with DuckDB, Polars, dbt, and dlthub to make our local setup click with our cloud environments (Azure/GCP/Fabric, onprem even).​Upcoming: A project for real-time streaming with Debezium and Kafka. I’d mostly be a consumer here, but it’s a setup I really want to see through. Definitely have a room impact the architecture there and downstream.​The Problem​Even though I value the \"builder\" autonomy, two things are weighing on me:​The Salary Ceiling: I’m somewhat bound by my starting salary. I recently learned that a new hire in a lower position is earning about 10% more than me. It’s not a massive gap, but it’s frustrating given the difference in impact. My manager kind of acknowledges my value but says getting HR to approve a 30-50% \"market adjustment\" is unlikely.​The 6-Month Notice: This is the biggest blocker. I get reach-outs for roles paying 50-100% more and I’ve usually done well in initial stages, but as soon as the 6-month notice period comes up, I’m effectively disqualified. I probably can't move unless I resign first.​The Dilemma​I definitely don’t think I’m an expert in everything and believe there is still a whole lot of unique learning to squeeze out of my current role, and I would love to see this through. I’m torn on whether to:​Keep learning: Stay for another year to \"tie it all together\" and get the streaming/Kafka experience on my CV.​Risk it: Resign without a plan just to free myself from the 6-month notice period and become \"employable\" again.​Do you think it's worth sticking it out for the environment and the upcoming projects, or am I just letting myself be underpaid while my tenure in the market is still fresh?​TL;DR: 4 YoE DE with a heavy focus on on-prem MDS and Databricks. I have great autonomy, but I’m underpaid compared to new hires and \"trapped\" by a 6-month notice period. Should I stay for the learning or quit to find a role that pays market rate?EDIT:Thanks for all the feedback. I think quitting materialized as the best move I can make given the circumstances. After looking into it, the 6-month notice period on a standard employment contract seems to be a significant gray area. Under local law, contract terms generally cannot be worse for the employee than what is written in the national statutes (which would normally be 1 month for my length of service). However, custom arrangements are possible, and there is a chance the company’s version is legally valid, meaning I might be stuck with it.​My plan: I am not making any moves yet. I am going to consult with the National Labor Inspectorate and a legal expert to get a formal opinion. I need to know if this clause is actually enforceable or if it would be thrown out of court.​If the 6 months is likely valid: I will probably resign immediately to \"start the clock\" so I can be free to look for a new job sooner.​If it is likely invalid: I will start applying for jobs like a normal human being, knowing I can legally leave much earlier.​I don’t want to risk a lawsuit or a permanent mark on my official employment record for \"abandoning work\" without being 100% sure where I stand.",

It’s been about \\~5 years since I last seriously was in the market for new opportunities, and I’m back in the market now for similar senior/staff-level roles. The area I feel most out of date on is **system design/data architecture rounds**.For those who’ve gone through recent DE rounds in the last year or two:* In system design rounds, are they expecting a **tool-specific design** (Snowflake, BigQuery, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, etc.), or is it better to start with a **vendor-agnostic architecture** and layer tools later?* How deep do you usually go? High-level flow + tradeoffs, or do they expect concrete decisions around storage formats, orchestration patterns, SLAs, backfills, data quality, cost controls, etc.?* Do they prefer to lean more toward “design a data platform” or “design a specific pipeline/use case” in your experience?I’m trying to calibrate how much time to spend refreshing specific tools vs practicing generalized design thinking and tradeoff discussions. Any recent experiences, gotchas, or advice would be really helpful. Appreciate the help.",

I thought this would allow me to keep the main DB disconnected at all times and instead, attach the working as a reading and auditing platform. Then, any data that needed to re-integrate with main, I'd run a promote script between the two. This all sounded good in theory until I realized that I can't attach either while there's a lock on it.I'd love any suggestions for DuckDB integrations that may solve this problem, features I'm not privy to, or alternatives to DuckDB that I can easily migrate my database over to.Thanks in advance!",

GraphQLite is an SQLite extension that brings graph database functionality to SQLite using the Cypher query language.The idea came from wanting graph queries without the operational overhead of running Neo4j for smaller projects. Sometimes you just want to model relationships and traverse them without spinning up a separate database server. SQLite already gives you a single-file, zero-config database—GraphQLite adds Cypher's expressive pattern matching on top.You can create nodes and relationships, run traversals, and execute graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and shortest paths. It handles graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes comfortably, with sub-millisecond traversal times. There are bindings for Python and Rust, or you can use it directly from SQL.I hope some of y'all find it useful.GitHub: [https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite)",

        "content": "Asking as a Data Engineer with mostly enterprise tools and basic experience. We ingest data into Snowflake and use it for BI reporting. So I do not have experience in all these usages that you refer to. My question is, what is the actual usable output from all of these. For example, we load data from various to Snowflake using COPY INTO, use SQL to create a Star schema model. The \"usable Output\" we get in this scenario are various analytics dashboards and reports created using Qlikview etc.\\[Question 1\\] Similarly, what is the output of a ML pipeline in data bricks ?I read all these posts about Data Engineering that talk about Snowflake vs Databricks, PySpark vs SQL, loading data to Parquet files, BI vs ML workloads - I want to understand what is the usable output from all these activities that you do ?What is a Machine Learning output? Is it something like a Predictive Information, a Classification etc. ?I saw a thread about loading images. What type of outputs do you get out of this? Are these uses for Ops applications or for Reporting purposes?For example, could an ML output from a Databricks Spark application be the suggestion of what movie to watch next on netflix ? Or perhaps to build an LLM such as ChatGPT ? And if so, are all these done by a Data Engineer or an ML Engineer?\\[Question 2\\] Are all these outputs achieved using unstructured data in its unstructured form - or do you eventually need to model it into a schema to be able to get necessary outputs? How do you account of duplications, and non-uniqueness and relational connections between data entities if used in unstructured formats?just curious to understand the modern usage, by a traditional warehouse Data Engineer?",

The only type of cleaning being done is some deduplication logic (very manual) and some type casting. This means a lot of the data that goes into reports and downstream products aren’t uniform and must be fixed/transformed at the report level.All these tiny problems are handled in scripts when new tables are created in silver or gold layers. So the scripts can get very long, complex, and contain duplicate logic.So..\\- at what point do you see it necessary to actually do data cleaning? In my opinion it should already be implemented but I want to hear other perspectives.\\- what kind of “cleaning” do you deem absolutely necessary/bare minimum for most use cases?\\- i understand and completely onboard with the thought of “don’t fix it if it’s not broken” but when does it reach a breaking point?\\- in your opinion, what part of this is up to the data engineer to decide vs. analysts?We are using spark and delta lake to store data.Edit: clarified question 3",

I’ve started learning Airflow, ETL/ELT concepts, Spark, and the basics of GCP and AWS. However, I feel like I’m missing structure, mentorship, and especially a community to help me stay motivated and make real progress.At the moment, I don’t enjoy my current tasks, I don’t feel like I’m developing professionally, and the salary isn’t motivating. I still have about 15 months left on my contract, and I’d really like to use this time wisely to prepare a solid transition.If you have experience with a similar transition, or if you work in data engineering, I’d love to hear:* how you made the switch (or would recommend making it),* what helped you most in terms of learning and positioning yourself,* how to connect with people already working in the field.Thanks a lot in advance for your insights.",

        "content": "First of all, Happy New Year 2026!Hi folks, I'm a long time lurker on this subreddit and a fellow Data Infrastructure Engineer. I have been working as a Software Engineer for 8+ years now and have been entirely focused on the data infra side of the world for the past few years with a fair share of working with Apache Spark.I have realized that it's very difficult to manage Spark infrastructure on your own using commodity cloud hardware and Kubernetes, and this is one of the prime reasons why users opt-in for offerings such as EMR and Databricks. However, I have personally seen that as companies grow larger, these offerings start to show their limitations (at least in the case of EMR from my personal experience). Besides that, these offerings also charge a premium on compute on top of the charges for using commodity cloud.For a quick comparison, here is the difference in pricing for AWS c8g.24xlarge and c8g.48xlarge instances if you were to run these for an entire month, showing the 25% EMR premium on your total EC2 bill.**Table 1: Single Instance (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$2,794.79|$3,493.49|$698.70||c8g.48xlarge|$5,589.58|$6,986.98|$1,397.40|**Table 2: 50 Instances (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$139,740|$174,675|$34,935||c8g.48xlarge|$279,479|$349,349|$69,870|In light of this, I started working on a platform that allows you to orchestrate Spark clusters on Kubernetes in your own AWS account - with no additional compute markup. The platform is geared towards Data Engineers (Product Data Engineers as I like to call them) who mainly write and maintain ETL and ELT workloads, not manage the Data Infrastcructure needed to support these workloads.Today, I am finally able to share what I have been building: [Orchestera Platform](https://orchestera.com/)Here are some of the salient features of the platform:* Setup and teardown an entire EKS-based Spark cluster in your own AWS account with absolutely no upfront expertise required in Kubernetes* Cluster is configured for reactive auto-scaling based on your workloads: * Automatically scales up to the right number of EC2 instances based on your Spark driver and executor configuration * Automatically scales down to 0 once your workloads complete* Simple integration with AWS services such as S3 and RDS* Simple integration with Iceberg tables on S3. AWS Glue Catalog integration coming soon.* Full support for iterating on Spark pipelines using Jupyter notebooks* Currently only supports AWS Cloud and the us-east-1 regionYou can see some demo examples here:* [Developing Spark applications using Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/jupyter-notebooks/)* [Using Iceberg tables with Spark](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/iceberg-hello-world/)If you are an AWS user or considering using it for Spark, I would request you to please try this out. No credit card required for using the personal workspace. Also offering 6 months of premium access for serious users in this subreddit.Also very interested to hear from this community and looking for some early feedback.I have aslo written [documentation](https://docs.orchestera.com/) (under active development) to give users a head start in setting up their accounts, orchesterating a new Spark cluster and writing data pipelines.If you want to chat more about this new platform, please come and join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9TXybZcd).",

        "content": "Greetings, data engineers & tinkerersAzure help needed here..I've got a metadata-driven ETL pipeline in ADF loading around 60 tables, roughly 150mil rows per day from 3rd party Snowflake instance (pre-defined view as source query). The Snowflake connector for ADF requires staging in Blob storage first.Now, why is it so underwhelmingly slow to write into Azure SQL? This first ETL step ingestion takes nearly 3 hours overnight, just writing it all into SQL bronze tables.Snowflake-Blob step takes about 10% of the runtime, ignoring the queue time, the copy activity from staged Blob to SQL is the killer.I've played around with parallel copies, DIUs, concurrency on the ForEach loop - virtually zero improvement.On the other hand, it's easily writing +10mil rows in a few minutes from Parquet, but this Blob to SQL bit is killing my ETL schedule and makes me feel like a boiling frog, seeing the runtime creep up each day without a plan to fix.Any ideas from you good folks on how to check where the bottleneck lies? Is it just a matter of giving the DB more beans (v-cores, etc) before ETL - would it help with writing into it?No indexes on bronze tables on write, the tables are dropped & indexes re-created after write.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Greetings. I am trying to train an OCR system on huge datasets, namely:* [OCR Cyrillic Printed 1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DonkeySmall/OCR-Cyrillic-Printed-1)* [Synthetic Cyrillic Large](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pumb-ai/synthetic-cyrillic-large)* [Cyrillic Handwriting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/constantinwerner/cyrillic-handwriting-dataset)They contain millions of images, and are all in different formats - `WebDataset`, `zip` with folders, etc. I will be experimenting with different hyperparameters locally on my M2 Mac, and then training on a [Vast.ai](http://Vast.ai) server. The thing is, I don't have enough space to fit even one of these datasets at a time on my personal laptop, and I don't want to use permanent storage on the server. The reason is that I want to rent the server for as short of a time as possible. If I have to instantiate server instances multiple times (e.g. in case of starting all over), I will waste several hours every time to download the datasets. Therefore, I think that streaming the datasets is a flexible option that would solve my problems both locally on my laptop, and on the server. However, two of the datasets are available on Hugging Face, and one - only on Kaggle, where I can't stream it from. Furthermore, I expect to hit rate limits when streaming the datasets from Hugging Face. Having said all of this, I consider just uploading the data to Google Cloud Buckets, and use the `Google Cloud Connector for PyTorch` to efficiently stream the datasets. This way I get a dataset-agnostic way of streaming the data. The interface directly inherits from PyTorch `Dataset`: from dataflux_pytorch import dataflux_iterable_dataset PREFIX = \"simple-demo-dataset\" iterable_dataset = dataflux_iterable_dataset.DataFluxIterableDataset( project_name=PROJECT_ID, bucket_name=BUCKET_NAME, config=dataflux_mapstyle_dataset.Config(prefix=PREFIX) )>The `iterable_dataset` now represents an iterable over data samples.I have two questions: 1. Are my assumptions correct and is it worth uploading everything to Google Cloud Buckets (assuming I pick locations close to my working location and my server location, enable hierarchical storage, use prefixes, etc.). Or I should just stream the Hugging Face datasets, download the Kaggle dataset, and call it a day? 2. If uploading everything to Google Cloud Buckets is worth it, how do I store the datasets to GCP Buckets in the first place? [This](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcs-connector-for-pytorch/blob/main/demo/simple-walkthrough/Getting%20Started%20with%20Dataflux%20Dataset%20for%20PyTorch%20with%20Google%20Cloud%20Storage.ipynb) and [this](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcs-connector-for-pytorch/blob/main/demo/image_segmentation/README.md) tutorials only work with images, not with image-string pairs.",

I'm a data hoarder/enthusiast looking for a system to tag a variety of file types and directories in Windows (I'm not opposed to learning a different OS). The default \"Properties\" (for the NTFS ?) are easiest to search, but you can't tag all file types or directories.I use XYPlorer as my file explorer and I like it as a general file browser. I liked the flexibility of the tags, but didn't like how running a script in Command Line to bulk rename hundreds of image files would break the tag link since the tags are all recorded in a tag.dat file (which I'm not opposed to writing something to also change it in there, but I also didn't think it was a very flexible tag data storage method. I'm gathering people's experiences in hopes of finding something I can invest time into when it comes to tagging my media and being able to access it. Things I'm looking for:1. Ease of access (I figure I can write a script to handle the tag hierarchy and categories as needed)2. Tag flexibility (like bulk renaming a tag)3. Ease of tag-ability (while I liked Adobe Bridge to edit tags, it didn't flow the best for me)4. Data versatility (if I can access the data for different visuals at some point or export it into an Excel format)5. Kind of an extra would be doing the opposite of point 4 (adding tags from an Excel spreadsheet)Questions I have:1. Is it more efficient for my uses for tags to be in one main file (like how XYPlorer stores it's tags) or sidecar files (which I liked the concept, but not how TagSpaces did it, and I'm worried about a search function scouring all the sidecar files)?2. Are there other solutions that exist now that I haven't experienced?My solution that stands now is to figure out the way XYPlorer can natively batch rename files and just go with all tags being in the plain text file. I would love to know if anyone has encountered other options. Thank you! EDIT: Or maybe a SQL situation.",

You personally log errors provided by the ‘opposing’ company for why this process didn’t complete. 55% of the time you get an actual reason provided and steps to resolve by sending a communication or resolving by updating or correcting issue with information provided. Other times it will be a generic reason provided by the ‘main team’ and nothing notated by the ‘opposing team’ and you would have to do additional research to send the proper communication to a client or their advisor/liaison. Or figure out the issue and resolve it then and there. 3. There are appropriate forms of communication to send to the client/advisor with steps to complete the process. If you collected data from the top biggest ‘opposing teams’ and have data to present would they be able to change some of their rules? Would you be able impose stricter guidelines at the point of entry when information comes through so the issue ceases before reaching point b? Once enough data and proof have been collected and shown to these ‘opposing teams’? 4. Issue is there is no standardization for these rejection reasons. The given ones in lists are not exhaustive enough. Majority work but do not fit all situations. If you were to see the same rejection reason from specific ‘opposing teams’ aka Firms. How would you collect and present that data to impose change? Could you collect enough data organize it by Firm, rejection reason, true reason & system reason, time/date, and visualize it? “This firm caused by X amount to y. This firm caused us xyz if we were to do this and eliminate this it would save us xyz. Basically reducing same reoccurring issues so we could focus on more complex things?

The app identifies each file type and assigns a category. It groups files with same category and total file count in each category then displays that information in main UI. It creates category folders in desired location and moves files to their category folders.*The best part is: The File Organization is Fully Customizable.*This is one of the important feedback that i got. The previous version didn't have this feature. In this latest version, in app settings, there are file organization rules.The app comes with commonly used file types and file categories as rules. These rules define what files to identify and how to organize them. The predefined rules are fully customizable.Add new rules, modify or delete existing rules. Customize the rules how you want. In case you want to reset the rules to defaults, an option is available in settings.**Target Audience:**The app is intended to be used by everyone. TidyBit is a desktop utility tool.**Comparison:**Most other file organizer apps are not user-friendly. Most of them are decorated scripts or paid apps. TidyBit is a cross-platform open-source app. The source code is available on GitHub. For people who worry about security, TidyBit app is available on Microsoft Store and Linux Snap store. The app is also available to download as an executable file for windows and portable Linux App Image format on GitHub releases.Check the app: [TidyBit Github Repository](https://github.com/Veda-Swaroop/TidyBit)",

Now they are advocating a proprietary DW technology like all the other players (snowflake, fabric DW, redshift,.etc)Conclusions seem to be obvious:- they are not going to open source their DW, or their lakebase- they still maintain the importance of delta/parquet but these are artifacts that are generated as a byproduct of their DW engine.- ongoing enhancements like MST will mean that the most authoritative and the most performant copy of data is found in the managed catalog of their DW.The hype around lakehouses seems like it was so short lived. We seem to be reverting back to conventional and proprietary database engines. I hate going round in circles, but it was so predictable.EDITED: typos",

        "content": "I’m having a hard time finding my “PEOPLE” online, and I’m honestly not sure if I’m searching wrong or if my niche just doesn’t have a clear label.I work in what I’d call high-code AI automation. I build production-level automation systems using Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Prefect, and LangChain. Think long-running workflows, orchestration, state, retries, idempotency, failure recovery, data pipelines, ETL-ish stuff, and AI steps inside real backend systems. (what people call \"AI Automation\" & \"AI Agents\")The problem is: whenever I search for AI Automation Engineer, I mostly find people doing no-code / low-code stuff with Make, n8n, Zapier...etc. That’s not bad work, but it’s not what I do or want to be associated with. I’m not selling automations to small businesses; I’m trying to work on enterprise / production-grade systems.When I search for Data Engineer, I mostly see analytics, SQL-heavy roles, or content about dashboards and warehouses. When I search for Automation Engineer, I get QA and testing people. When I search for workflow orchestration, ETL, data pipelines, or even agentic AI, I still end up in the same no-code hype circle somehow.I know people like me exist, because I see them in GitHub issues, Prefect/Airflow discussions. But on X and LinkedIn, I can’t figure out how to consistently find and follow them, or how to get into the same conversations they’re having.So my question is:\\- What do people in this space actually call themselves online?\\- What keywords do you use to find high-code, production-level automation/orchestration /workflow engineers, not no-code creators or AI hype accounts?\\- Where do these people actually hang out (X, LinkedIn, GitHub)?\\- How exactly can I find them on X and LI?Right now it feels like my work sits between “data engineering”, “backend engineering”, and “AI”, but none of those labels cleanly point to the same crowd I’m trying to learn from and engage with.If you’re doing similar work, how did you find your circle?P.S: I came from a background where I was creating AI Automation systems using those no-code/low-code tools, then I shifted to do more complex things with \"high-code\", but still the same concepts apply",

A year starts with day 1 until it hits day 365; a book starts with chapter 1 until it reaches the ending chapter. Almost everything has a sequence. Programming does not have that; you have to have the ability to learn things out of sequence. You can't wait until you have the entirety of JS learned before you move on to something like React. Heck, you will probably never get there in a lifetime, as there will be new additions to the language and deprecations. I have a degree, I have been self-studying, and I am still unemployed. When I start learning a library, it is hard to sort of know what to pick up and then move on and hit the library only when you need it again.This is a barrier, or at least one of the barriers that makes programming a high-paying job. We need to have a different kind of approach to learning to code. I have been trying to adapt my brain's wiring so that I only learn what is important and move on. But from my question to senior programmers here, how do I overcome this? I am 29 years old; for reference, I have never been employed.",

I didn’t sit there any let them run it I simply said hey I know this is weird but instead of telling you my skills and answering all the typical questions can I just show you? They just kinda looked around and said sure. Before I officially applied I did deep research on the company. Looked into trends and markets and made a sample project. Long story short I made a backend and front end for a billing systems. I saw that they had recently acquired a billing company. After my presentation and showing off my project they smiled and said we will call you. Not even 30 minutes later they called and said that I would not be doing the other two interviews and sent me an offer letter. I was honestly so confused and happy?I was always told that projects were never the way to go and to just do the interviews and meet and greets.

I learnt (just explored, not completely) python c cpp and just recently java. I really liked java out of these. C cpp feels very strict language and python felt like it was very lazy, unserious, and very indisciplined language. I felt java somewhere in the middle of this. I dont know whether my views of these languages are actually true or not, but id like to hear from you whats your opinion. Also should i continue with java and dig deeper, and explore more?",

I actually understood every part of it. It's just a simple SDL window that shows sprites of Link from one of the old Legend of Zelda games. The sprites change directions depending on which key I press. Up, down, left and right. Now I will try to figure out how to make the sprites change while I hold the key so I can make it look like Link is walking towards the direction I am holding. Again, it's very simple for most people here but I just wanted to share because I think it's the first time I felt like I had fun with it instead of just being frustrated. Hope you all have a happy new year!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I have been in that place, scrolling infinitely looking for the best (if that even exist) project to learn/upskill/get hired/whatever, but today I have finally understood why people advice: \"Find something that interest you\". I understand the pressure of been unemployed, undergrad or still learning and wanting to build something that becomes the key to getting out of that situation.I’m fortunate to have a job that combines IT support and some backend work. While it’s not as difficult as other situations, I still want to keep improving to reach better roles. And I’ve been there too. Day after day trying to figure out what to build to improve, and even so I believe the previous advice still applies.So, what is that project that interest me so much and made me change my mind? Just a self-hosting e-book library. Sorry if I disappointed someone (I'm not). I got a Kindle a few weeks ago and since I also like home-labs and self-hosting I looked for an app, but every one feels like artificial and not personal, and as a book lover, I want my library to feel personal, something that I truly own, so I decided to build one.You may think, what can an e-book library teach? Well, is not about the specific case of my app, but more of the concept/problem itself that needs to be implemented or solved that can be applied for many contexts. For example: what if an user have 5000 books? How should I store the covers vs basic metadata (cache vs database)? How can I process all that books in seconds (concurrency & parallelism to improve performance)? How can I avoid the rate limits of an external api? How do I keep the database in sync if the user manually deletes a file? What if I implement an internal ddbb back up tool? Can I pass all the books from kindle to the library directly?And even if I knew about some of that questions before, applying it yourself will always teach you more that just theory.Some people will think that thinking about all that stuff early in the project may be over-engineering, but who cares, is your project you can do whatever you can with it according to your objectives, not someone else ideas. So thanks to everyone who has always given that advice, and for those who are in the situation I mentioned, it’s better to build a project that seems simple on the surface, but where you really dive deep than creating something that looks good on paper but you’re not invested in.",

I’m looking for some serious advice on how to push myself forward when I feel like I’m stuck at a standstill. To give you some context: I’ve never considered myself a natural at tech. I didn’t do any advanced prep before starting my degree, and honestly, I struggled through my first year. I managed to pass, but looking back, I realize I was just surviving, not actually learning.This year, due to personal circumstances, I had to switch to online classes. It’s been a disaster for my learning style. My professor primarily uploads modules and assessments without live sessions, leaving me to teach myself through YouTube and documentation. Here is the predicament: In trying to teach myself, I realized I’ve forgotten a lot from my first year. Even the most basic concepts have slipped away. I’ve decided to \"start from scratch\" while still trying to keep up with my current 2nd year workload. I’m currently grinding through Java learning strings, characters, loops, and operators while simultaneously staring down a mountain of Networking and SQL coursework including C++ and other programming languages that we’ve studied in my first year that I have to run through again, I feel completely overwhelmed. My progress feels incredibly slow. I see others online who seem to grasp these concepts effortlessly, and I can’t help but feel a deep sense of envy and doubt. I’m questioning if I’m even making progress or if I’m just not cut out for this. I’m not planning on changing my course I genuinely want to be good at this but the anxiety that I’ll never \"get it\" is starting to take over. I know going back to face-to-face classes eventually will help, but I also know that won't fix the fact that I'm currently starting from zero.Has anyone else felt like they were \"starting over\" in the middle of their degree? How do you deal with the slow progress and the feeling that you'll never catch up?I’d really appreciate any advice on how to manage this workload or how to change my mindset so I can stop feeling like a failure.",

I have books, pages, youtube tutorials and much more, but I still don’t have an «end-goal» with those. What should I work toward learning? I got interested in OpenGL, and started there. It went alright, but it is some steps ahead of my very basic knowledge and it ends with me just copying code without *really* understanding most of it.

I've tried pro sports, making music, running a photography business, content creation, landscaping, serving, along with a ton of other things to which I've had varying success in.But nothing really seems to give satisfaction like programming, now I'm new to programming, I only really have been \"doing\" it since like the last few months.Two main things I've coded.\\- A league of legends cool down app (it basically tracks when an enemy uses key spells in the game, the tracking is manual you have to tap the button to start it)\\- A program that trains a specific skill in League of Legends called kiting, which is basically clicking your mouse fast in a specific sequence.I think the fun part of programming is you can just make things, it's like Lego but you have no limits and growing up I always loved Lego.Another aspect I like is while I am very good at content creation, I've had close to 500 million views on social media from content I've made. Content creation doesn't really scratch the same itch.It's like with content creation you make things that people watch but how impactful is that? Half of the stuff we watch we don't even remember ....but with coding you make things that people USE.And that's what I think is so cool.Part of me worries that because I'm bad at math I'll never really \"get\" programming, I also worry I'm not smart enough for it...but I enjoy it.Anyway I don't know if this post is something that people will love, or not, but I just wanted to share it. It's late here, 4am and I've been really struggling last few days with figuring out what I enjoy.I've been trying to be a \"content creator\" for the last few weeks, and while I'm really good at it, I don't think I enjoy it. It feels really fake and tbh, a large portion of content out there is entirely fake anyway.I still don't really understand where I fit in with life, but I like the idea of making stuff people use and I see myself for the next while making programs or apps that solve simple problems in peoples lives.

        "content": "Hello! New poster here. I just started to practice some C# and learn its style with a couple simple projects. I guess I have some questions on it as a whole, firstly: for most cases where you need a data-holding object, do you just use a class? Coming from python I keep defaulting to a dictionary, but there it's extremely simple to initialize one with whatever key value pairs I need, whereas in c# the statement is so complex I wonder if it's because objects with more than just a string-number or string-string pairs are meant to be classes. Also, I read that classes are faster in execution.Secondly, I guess I've been struggling to explain the need for all the explicit type declarations and other things that to a beginner seem more complicated than they need to be. Like, it was very complicated in VS to just figure out how to run the script I created, having to choose a debugger and running console commands to get there. What do you do if you want to test a snippet of one script in isolation? Also, I had a class script in the same namespace as the main one, but its class wasn't being recognized. Eventually I noticed the class script was in a different subfolder of the project, so I moved it and it worked fine. But what's the point of a namespace if the file still needs to be in the same directory... I imagine all these details are for good reasons, so wanted to ask some experts haha",

I have seen suggestions regarding the app that I can use the HTML/CSS/JS + Electron + python but I have no clue if this is a good idea or not. Any comments would be greatly appreciated. Edit: I realized that I didn't add enough information for the app idea I have. I am adding the details I have now to help be more clear: It is an app for writing, but it is tailored first to Arab Writers, and I intend to add features to it along the way. I am not comfortable with the idea that I need different apps or resources to work on one novel or story. So, I want to make my own, an app that I can write in, export docs, it also can spellcheck, provide ambience (background and music), do grammatical checks suggestions, have some widgets inside the app that helps the writer move forward in the form of questions and answers that help with roadblocks in plot, characters, story, idea...etc.I hope this is a bit more helpful.",

The problem is… I’ve slowly realized that I really don’t enjoy frontend work.I don’t like dealing with UI, layout, styling, or making things “look nice.” I find it frustrating and draining. What I do enjoy is logic, problem-solving, data handling, and figuring out how things work behind the scenes. Deep down, I feel more drawn to backend development.Now I’m stuck mentally because: I’ve already invested around a year in TOP I don’t want to feel like I “wasted” that time I’m thinking of shifting toward backend-focused learning (maybe Python, APIs, databases, etc.)So my questions are:Is this a normal realization?Is my frontend knowledge from TOP still useful if I move to backend?Would switching to backend now be a mistake, or is it better than forcing myself to continue frontend?If you were in my position, what would you do?I’d really appreciate honest advice, especially from people who disliked frontend but found their place elsewhere.Thanks!TL;DR: 1 year into TOP, realized I hate frontend and prefer backend logic.

I found that the six xaml files of a MAUI project to be such a confusing mess, and the widget child (and children) feature of Flutter to be inconvenient for me to get used to. I am used to creating new objects in OOP programming. Then after consulting with AI I realized that React Native is probably the best choice of framework for mobile android development. In around mid December I decided that in 2026 I am going to start learning it. However I found that even the configuration (or setup) for React Native is super complicated. For example the JDK has to be between 17 and 20, and installing something on Android Studio SDK manager. Fortunately I sorted it all out with the help of AI's assistance in a few hours struggling attempts and managed to install React Native apps on my phone. React Native's code structure reminds of HTML at first glance. Hopefully in this year I will be able to independently write code for android apps through React Native. This is just my experience to note down, and a topic closely related to programming.",

This summer, I got interested in software development and started self-studying Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I really enjoyed it and decided to pursue a tech career.I got admitted to UNT for a traditional Computer Science degree, but financially it’s not feasible for me. Collin College offers a Bachelor of Applied Technology in Software Development, which is more workforce-focused than a CS degree. The program covers software development fundamentals, includes a capstone project, and has lighter math requirements. Essentially, it gives the skills needed for a software development career.My main concern is if employers will view this degree the same as a traditional CS degree? I’ve read that a CS degree is considered the “gold standard,” but I’ve also heard otherwise. I’m lucky to be able to pursue school debt-free with VA benefits and family support, so I’m trying to make the most practical choice.Would appreciate feedback or advice. Do you think this degree will open the same doors as a CS degree?",

        "content": "From a \"mechanical\" perspective, it seems like anything you can do with inheritance, you can do with composition.Any shared behavior placed in a base class and reused via `extends` can instead be moved into a separate class and reused via delegation. In practice, an inheritance hierarchy can often be transformed into composition by:* Keeping the classes that represent the varying behavior,* Removing `extends`,* Injecting those classes into what used to be the base class,* Delegating calls instead of relying on overridden methods.From this perspective, inheritance looks like **composition + a relationship**.With inheritance:* The base class provides shared behavior,* Subclasses provide variation,* The `is-a` relationship wires them together implicitly at compile time.With composition:* The same variation classes exist,* The same behavior is reused,* But the wiring is explicit and often runtime-configurable.This makes it seem like inheritance adds only:* A fixed, compile-time relationship,* Rather than fundamentally new expressive power.If \"factoring out what varies\" is the justification for the extra classes, then those classes are justified independently of inheritance. That leaves the inheritance *relationship itself* as the only thing left to justify.So the core question becomes:**What does the inheritance relationship actually buy us?**To be clear, I'm not asking \"*when is inheritance convenient?\"* or \"*which one should I prefer?\"*I’m asking:**In what cases is the inheritance relationship itself semantically justified—not just mechanically possible?** In other words, when is the relationship doing real conceptual work, rather than just wiring behavior together?",

If you’re going to take on customers with 24/7 operations, guess what that means for your overhead? Yup, you’re going to have to pay to staff your company to be able to handle 24/7 operations, not just expect your day shift people to handle it all at night and still come in and work a full shift the next day on fumes. Hire an IRC and set it up. Staff it with good technical people. Expecting day shift people to be machines and handle night shift stuff with barely any extra pay or using “duties as assigned” as your excuse not to pay extra for it, is the fastest way to lose staff and lose your company and end up drowning in lawsuits.If you’re gonna refuse to do that, then you better be prepared to pay out the nose to your day shift folks to expect them to wake up in the middle of the night or interrupt a family moment to fix someone’s stupidity. Stop cheaping out and expecting not to have to pay extra for it, then whining about turnover.",

After some brief chatting, they asked me to complete a take-home assignment to go ahead with the recruitment process. This is the link to said take home challenge: [https://bitbucket.org/brain0xlab/challenge/src/master/](https://bitbucket.org/brain0xlab/challenge/src/master/)It all seemed a bit suspcious and I wanted to check the repo out before cloning it and opening it myself.This repository contains a vscode auto run task: [https://bitbucket.org/brain0xlab/challenge/src/master/.vscode/tasks.json](https://bitbucket.org/brain0xlab/challenge/src/master/.vscode/tasks.json) <- This is a HUGE red flag.This task, through several layers of indirection, effectively downloads a stringified obfuscated JS script disguised as a json file from this link: [https://api.npoint.io/3b0e9f7bfcd85cc9e77d](https://api.npoint.io/3b0e9f7bfcd85cc9e77d)The JSON is downloaded via a \"env.js\" file downloaded from here (WARNING: malware script host): https://vscode-settings-bootstrap\\[dot\\]vercel\\[dot\\]app/settings/env?flag=306 (replace the dots with actual dots)You'll likely need to use curl -L or something to actually download it. This vscode-settings-bootstrap is likely hosted by the malware creators as this is the website hosting the actual malware stuff primarily. npoint is sort of just a general service.Notice how the env.js file downloads the malware script containing json from npoint, extracts the obfuscated js from the cookie field and runs it.I have not managed to gather more information about the malware script itself. I know it reads a bunch of system information, reads credentials from filesystem (e.g ssh private keys) and tries to upload them to some domain. I sorta gave up figuring out what domain it is since the script does A LOT of useless work to waste cpu cycles and my virtualbox was simply taking too long to get to the meaty part.I have reported the linked in profile and bitbucket repo.",

Bought a small cheap house in 2004 so my mortgage is now less than rent on a 1 bedroom apartment. Invested myself. Stock market has gone crazy since 2012. The 2000s were a dead decade and the market was flat. I went through 2 major bear markets. I got laid off or had a contract end 7 times in my 25 year \"career\". I dont really consider this a career.I was self taught. I got a useless political science degree in the 1990s. I was waiting tables. I took a coding bootcamp back in 2000. Took 1000s of resumes to get a job. I offered to work 80 hours/week to get my first job and did. Since the economy blew up right when I was starting out in tech. I am in the DC area so government contracting saved me.I don't think bootcamp will work today. I went back to school at night and got a Masters in Software Engineering while I was working.Glad I saved my money. I get crippling back pain there are few remote jobs. I have issues with my feet and will need another surgery on both of my feet. Using screens this long has caused really dry eye. I use eye drops all day long. So glad I saved my money. My dad got laid off about my age in the early 2000s and he was out of work for over 3 years. Its tough as you get older. He was in telecom and it was more dead in the 2000s than tech is today.Not sure what I am going to do. Travel is a problem for medical issues. I don't want to discuss my medical issues. Trying to start a diet. Increase my walking ,but that is tough to do in the cold. I live in Northern Virginia. Going to read more. Might see if there are any lonely housewives around I can keep busy.

I have found my self constantly using them to get ideas but one thing for sure, i have to know what I'm asking and what my goals are otherwise i will end up generating code that neither i understand or the agent itself and that's the whole point. It was never about the code but rather knowing what to write and where to write it. I don’t think people understand that if SWE is truly replaceable, then 99.9999% of all non-physical jobs are replaced, and we will be in an apocalyptic world.My assumption is that given we make more than other engineering jobs, this is mostly jealousy and wishing downfall on someone who is doing better than you!!",

        "author": "Cheap-Sparrow",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I (31m) am the tech lead of a small \"sub team\". We have 3 different groups reporting to the same manager. This manager is not a software engineer. I work at a FAANG company.My coworker (25m) is incredibly toxic. They have had multiple blow ups at others and myself. They won't use jira, they won't make merge requests, and every meeting with them is like walking on eggshells. They are late with all their code and it's very buggy. In order to not go through the MR process this coworker created their own repo and pushes directly to main. When we asked them to combine repos they get very agitated. We asked them to start making MRs for review and they flat out refuse and it causes the meetings to become very tense. My manager doesn't understand why merge requests are important and sees no issue with the coworker's behavior. We recently hired 2 new senior engineers. Within 1 month, both engineers have had issues with this person. They are both actively involved in the behavioral coaching of this person. One new hire told me \"this guy is the single worst behaved engineer I've ever worked with.\" He expects me, as tech lead, to deal with this situation. I think that's understandable but I have strict instructions to not get involved.I asked my manager to affirm my position as tech lead so I can get this coworker to make MRs and document their designs. My manager said \"No, if I do that then [coworker] will lose their shit and this is a really delicate situation right now.\"This young coworker hates me in particular. Probably because I am in charge? My manager has asked me to stay out of it so he can coach this guy himself. My manager told me \"I've never met someone like this in my entire career. I am completely flummoxed and I have no idea what to do.\"During one very public blow up, my manager was slacking me privately saying \"I'm confused why he's mad\" and \"just drop [this requirement]. You're right but we need him to feel like he's saving face\".The approach that we're taking is to let this coworker fail on his own. We aren't supposed to save their code when we find bugs, we aren't supposed to push for improvements. We are supposed to let them fail so they realize they need help. Our project is off track.One of the new engineers told me they are having a \"very hard time\" on the team because of this person. I feel a responsibility to respond to that but I have strict instructions to stay out of it. ***Okay. So here's my question.I'm being positioned to become the manager of this team. I said No a year ago because this engineer would have been my only report. My manager thinks I have the wrong attitude and \"[I] need to work with [coworker] because we can't just give up on everyone under the age of 30\". I think this person probably needs to be PIPed and let go. At my previous company (also faang) this would have resulted in a pip a long time ago, both for the attitude but also the sheer lack of deliverables.I can stay on the IC ladder and climb this way, but then a new manager will be hired. This hurts my chances of moving into management later. It also annoys my boss who wants me to just deal with the engineer by coaching instead of a PIP.* Should I take the manager position and have this person as my report, knowing my hands are tied when dealing with them? Or should I try to stay as an engineer?* Do I have an obligation to work with this person, like my boss is telling me? Or is this situation already beyond what is acceptable in the workplace?",

I never sold any stock whilst I was employed there, so I have a significant chunk of RSUs sitting in my investment account.Reading about my former company in the news now, I don't feel particularly confident about holding on for too much longer, but equally, I've spent enough time in tech to know that anything can happen in the market (although the AI wave does have me ever-so-slightly concerned). What have former FAANG employees who didn't sell during their employment done after? I'd appreciate any insights. I'm leaning towards selling 90% and holding 10%, but if there are better strategies I can consider, open to hearing from folks about that, too. P.S. Fully aware choosing to buy/sell is purely based on my own financial needs + goals, but this post is more focused on general advice and if former FAANG folks are holding or selling their RSUs",

        "content": "I was laid off 6 months ago. I've worked as a software eng in the bay area for about 13 years. I'm 38 now so I'm not young anymore but I still have to work since I can't retire.I've always considered myself as average intelligence for a software engineer with a very strong work ethic. This often got me noticed and promoted at the companies I've worked for. Technically, there are usually a few engineers on the team that are better than me.Interviews were never easy back then for me but I always felt like the jobs were given to me since my experience was great. I would typically talk about my projects and then do some whiteboarding problem where it felt like I was working alongside the interviewer. I think I've had probably 8 interviews in my entire life and got a no offer on 3 of them until recently.Ever since my layoffs, I've failed probably 5 interviews in the first or second round. The furthest I got was 5 rounds(they wanted a few more rounds and I could tell they were not super enthusiastic about me). The interviews seem a lot more toxic recently with interviewers asking me questions like \"what value can you bring if AI can do those things?\" With all these things, I stopped looking for a tech job completely and found a part-time retail job.I'm fortunate enough to have a small savings and the part-time retail job is slowing down my burn. I'm trying to break away from tech right now and find any career worth getting into where I can afford a family in the future ($20/hr in retail is very hard to make work for a single person). I have a year or two to figure something out.I spend some of my free time at the library just reading to get ideas on where I can go but I feel so lost. Here are some options I'm thinking about:**1. Grind leetcode, study AI/design, work on interview skills and keep interviewing until I find a tech job.***Pros:* *- Clear objectives* *- Good pay* *- Job is interesting for the most part**Cons:* *- Layoffs still on the table* *- Extremely difficult to get an offer (I dont even know what to study since questions are so random)* *- I really do not want to grind leetcode anymore***2. Change careers***Pros:* *- Fresh start and something that aligns better with my values* *- Maybe better work-life balance than eng (tradeoff with lower pay is fine)**Cons:* *- Have to do some soul-searching to find next career* *- Probably difficult to switch careers* *- Most jobs are probably slower and less mentally stimulating***3. Start a business***Pros:* *- Be your own boss (kinda not really)* *- No leetcode**Cons:* *- Hard grind that requires all your focus and dedication* *- I prefer more stability*With those 3 options, I'm leaning towards changing careers. The starting a business is something I think about a lot but it's not something I can just pull out of nowhere. The thought of going back into tech gives me anxiety through the roof. Unfortunately, I dont know what careers I can change into. The general field people around reddit have been proposing are the HVAC/therapist/nursing variety.I'm feeling lost right now and just wanted to air some thoughts out. Thanks for reading. Would love any thoughts or stories/experiences on how people are navigating this.",

When I was interning, there was another entry developer that stayed on for around two years but left due to no promotion (they said he kinda sucked delivery wise).I am told I do good work and meet expectations, I expect a promotion this year after a year of work post grad. But our team is a little dysfunctional in the sense that it isn't a team and individuals are siloed on specific applications. We have little to no documentation. So anytime I am introduced to new tech or systems, my seniors really do hand hold me, to which I am appreciative of. I am not the type that asks the same questions over and over, I just need to see it once throughly and I can replicate what they've taught me.The problem is, after a year of this siloed style of work, I am getting burnt out. I can not stand coding. There have been multiple occasions for multiple projects where I have stayed at work alone and extremely late, staying until 8-10pm, just typing away at my computer. Recently I have been tasked with developing an entire web app alone. It's functionality seems simple but no application meant for production is ever simple. We are understaffed, so there is nobody else to divy up project tasks with. I've asked if we have any plans to get more entry hires on the team and it is always met with a soft no, the company is on a hiring freeze, economy yada yada.I talk with my friends from uni who are all working. Their teams practice agile and scrum philosophies, and their coding tasks are divided up for multipe team members. They love their jobs. Their eyes bulge when I tell them about my work load and my work effort. I always feel unfortunate when I hear about how lucky they have been, but really, it sounds like those types of tech teams are the standard and I am the unlucky one to have landed in an underdeveloped team. Senior developers can afford to ignore a team dynamic like this and still be successful in it.In my eyes, saying that this is too much work is basically telling them I am not up for the job and I might as well quit honestly. I know I can handle it, I mean I am meeting their latest expectation for an entire web application on my own, but I do not want to handle this anymore. It used to make me so happy to run an application and see the results of my hard work in action, but I genuinely can't even stand opening visual studio anymore.With how bad the job market is, I am scared to walk away. But I know if I continue to eat my feelings about this, I might turn impulsive and quit without any plan for my career or cut ties in a bad way. I don't want to fall into a slump.",

I spend half my time coding and the other half in meetings. I enjoy managing and have great reports. However, my team’s scope of work has become smaller recently, supporting UX Design Systems for our product. I did this type of work earlier in my career and I’m not that excited about it. I’m also fighting for scope with a peer manager. My product area is pretty high pressure with 50-60 hour work weeks, but it’s predictable and stable. It’s highly unlikely I’ll be promoted any time soon.Given this situation I’m thinking about changing teams and moving into a more exploratory team that works on AI applied to concept product features and tries to get AI features into production. This seems more interesting, but I’d have to give up my manager role and go back to being an IC. I know several people on this new team, including the new manager and they all seem great. However, concept product features seem risky in a time when companies are trying to monetize as much as possible. There’s also no guarantee that I’ll be able to be a manager again on this new team.More context, I’m 46 and hope to stay working in tech until I’m 55. Getting direct AI experience seems useful to stay relevant for the next few years. My pay will stay the same regardless if I’m a manager or IC.",

Tech stack is mostly **.NET** (mix of legacy and .NET Core). I’m pulling in around **95k CAD TC** in a LCOL city (in the prairies) -- Hybrid position 1 day in the office. Did my CS degree at a top 3 Canadian university.The job is super stable, got good relationship with my team and my boss even sponsored my PR in 2023 (which I’m super grateful for). Future Projects are expected to be good (maybe closer to startup in terms of impact) but salary and my title might remain as is for years to come.But honestly, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m a bit underpaid, and on top of that, I’m pretty lonely here. While I have made friends with locals through sports activities, there's not a lot of community for people sharing my background (not from a typical immigrant country) compared to other prairie city I had moved from, and that’s starting to weigh on me.I’m thinking about moving to a different city perhaps BC, Alberta, Ottawa, maybe GTA. Ideally mid-to-large companies like banks, insurance or other legacy companies for stability. Planning to start applying early to mid next year since I need to stick around here for a few more months.Do you think I’ve got a decent shot at landing something in those cities? Preferably BC, AB or Ottawa. Any advice on timing, salary expectations, or companies to look at?**TL;DR:** Mid-20s, **5.5 YOE** (mostly .NET), making 95k CAD TC in a LCOL prairie city. Job is stable, good team, good projects but salary/title likely stagnant. Feeling lonely due to lack of cultural community. Thinking of moving to **BC, Alberta, Ottawa, or GTA** for better pay + diversity. Prefer mid-to-large companies for stability (banks, insurance, or legacy company).

As you might guess, this has its pros and cons. We do not have well-defined responsibilities at the job, so in this 1-year experience, I could work with every part of a software like CICD, BE, FE, AI, etc.BUTThis gives me a feeling of \"knowing a little bit of everything but not mastering anything\", so I decided to start with something with the new year. I enjoy the tasks that I would classify as CICD/DevOps the most. I really enjoy working with k8s, so I primarily have this in my mind to master, but I am not sure if it is the right thing since my experience/title is not mainly DevOps, and in the company, there is not much space to apply those skills on a scale I can write it to my CV, it is basically a couple of microservices. When I checked the jobs I am really interested in, I found that they mostly prefer Go. I have Go in mind too, but again, I have the same concern: I am not sure if a skill that I do not use at my job can help me get my next job.About Me:1 YOE, leetcoding daily (around 300 problems), not actively looking to change jobs, but want to stay interview-ready, and I will try my luck with big tech in 2026.

        "content": "Hi everyone!I'm 30, from Portugal, did a cs licence and master's and started working last year in a big 4, so I only have 1 year of experience doing data engineering. My goal has always been to be a versatile software engineer, I've always wanted to work with data, cloud, machine learning, devops (later in my career), qa and so on. But lately, my mind has been plagued with insecurities and I feel worried about my future. I'll try to provide as much context as possible.For starters, I have no idea where AI will take us and I'm starting to feel dependant on it after going through 4+ years without using it in college. The fun part of this field, for me, has always been to think and develop a solution to a problem, but I'm not a fast learner or fast thinker, and by the time I think of something, Copilot is giving me a much better answer in less than a minute. I don't know when and where to draw the line, when do I start to think \"Maybe I'm using too much AI now\" or \"I'm an engineer, I shouldn't be asking AI to help me solve this\"?Second, I feel like this field is starting to become a bit of everything, everywhere, all at once. There's constantly a new tech or stack to learn, then there's AI that you either embrace or refuse (with no clear winner here), then you also have to learn stuff from other subfields because they lay off people and you have to do the job of two, and the list goes on. I get home tired from +8h of work, I don't want to look at a screen and think \"Oh let's build a fun project or learn a new stack!\". I do try to get as much cloud certificates (aws, gc etc) as possible, since our company provides us the vouchers, but that's as far as I can motivate me to go.Then, I also feel like I'm trapped in this job because it's a project lottery and the market isn't looking fun for juniors. I'm working on building agents for our company and while this feels very up to date, I'm afraid it's only another hype that will fade with time and not get much use in the future. Somehow, due to the fact that I'm not coding much, I feel like I'll unlearn everything I've worked on for the past few years (and I did forget most of the stuff from college already) and then I won't have the required skills for better jobs in the future.I also really dislike the country I live in because of our extremely high rent prices and very low salaries (a 1bedroom apt is 50% of my salary right now). This makes me want to move to another country, but I don't know if it might be a good fit, if the market is also terrible there or if I even have a shot with all the competition.Bottom line of all of this is: **I never know if what I'm doing will help me grow and prepare me for a better future, and I don't know what's the right path to follow because I'm in constant doubt and uncertainty. I can't get motivated to work because I don't know if what I'm doing is meaningful to my future and I can't focus on one thing at a time.**Have any of you felt like this or have any advice to help me address this?",

        "content": "Hello, I recently graduated with a CS degree, and think I need to develop a more long term plan.What my goals are:The past 6 months I have been applying to junior developer roles, but not getting any interviews.I did an informational interview with someone working public cybersecurity in the Operational tech security field, and they advised making a 5 year plan. I spoke with them because I am also interested in a cybersecurity career as well. While I enjoy writing software more, I feel cybersecurity will be a more secure career in the long term.The truth is that I will take any tech job I can get, for any salary above minimum wage. But I understand that I need to have more specific goals and a plan. So I’m leaning towards committing to cybersecurity, creating a 5 year plans. As for what area in cybersecurity, I don’t know, but I’m thinking DevSecOps or other software security roles.My understanding is that cybersecurity is not an intro role and I need to work on personal project + certifications -> help desk role -> IT role -> more cyber security focused role.There’s so many certifications out there, I was recommend ISC2 to start with by the person I spoke to. I’m a little nervous about how expensive most certifications are, and ISC2 has an annual fee. What have I done so far:I have a portfolio with 3 demos for apps I made , some using ML. For example I made a custom pipeline that predicts if someone will be approved a bank loan based on historical data. This portfolio probably won’t help if I pivot to cybersecurity.Any advice on creating a plan in general, or choosing a career path, or what certifications to go for with the path I described would be greatly appreciated.",

Whats bothering me is this person did not do great at school. The only thing this person was superb at was knowing people. Like really knowing people, knowing what to expect in the exam, etc. Now to see to get into L6 position, does it mean knowing people also works in Amazon? Because my gut feeling tells me this person much have a lot of people already in Amazon for guidance and doing shit that matters.Now, I compare with myself, I'm barely a senior as of yet to due various reasons which weren't under my control and same YOE, 6.5 and make $135kHow far back am I financially? Title maybe one level back and I've been told here that there is no way to get into Amazon L6. Best bet is L5. To become L6, there has to be someone who leaves L6 to be opening for it. I'm have this thing that I messed up big time and should have left earlier and interviewed at Amazon. Because now I'm like 5 years or more behind.

        "content": "I came across a detailed guide shared by people who have cleared ML Engineer interviews at different companies and found it helpful to share. The process varies by company, but the core skills are consistent across big tech and startups.About the ML Engineer Interview Process:ML Engineer interviews typically include 4 to 6 rounds a virtual screen which has coding + ML basics, followed by onsite or virtual loops with coding. Expect 45 to 60 min sessions, often with live coding in a shared doc or whiteboard for design. Companies like Meta and Google emphasize productionizing models, while others focus on specific domains.PREPARATION:● Python is the main language that I use for programming.● Additionally, I am very good at the most common Machine Learning libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Scikit learn, TensorFlow etc.● The basic machine learning concepts are that I know supervised and unsupervised learning methods.● I can evaluate models using several metrics.● I understand overfitting versus underfitting and the relationship between bias and variance.● I also understand the differences between regression and classification models.My preparation was based on these courses:1.) Coursera AI of Everyone/ Deeplearning AI: Machine Learning Engineering for Production by Andrew Ng Concentrates on turning ML systems into real world applications, covering data pipelines, deployment, monitoring, and scaling necessary for ML Engineer positions, putting an emphasis on the real-world systems.2.) Fast ai: Practical Deep Learning A Hands on, code first method to building state of the art models quickly, very good for gaining practical intuition and confidence in implementing deep learning solutions from scratch.3.) Stanford CS229/CS230: Gives rigorous, university level depth in machine learning theory and deep learning that is excellent for the understanding of derivations and advanced topics that may come up in technical discussions.4.) LogicMojo AI & ML Interview Preparation Course: Focused specifically on machine learning interview preparation, with practice problems, ML system design patterns, and commonly asked interview questions. It helps for project development for interviews.MOVING ONTO THE PRACTICE AFTER THEORY:Practice coding without an IDE use Google Docs or plain editor to simulate interviews. Focus on implementing ML algorithms from scratch or debugging production issues.Great platforms for practice:● LeetCode - ML tagged + general coding● Kaggle competitions for end to end projects● [Interviewing.io](http://Interviewing.io) or Pramp for mocksFAQs Asked:1. Basic machine learning2. Model evaluation & metrics3. Feature engineering & selection4. Recommendation systems.5. Convolutional neural networks for vision, normal language transformation transformers for NLP.6. Scaling ML distributed training, data parallelism7. Production issues8. ML system design9. Coding: Implement linear regression, k-means, decision trees from scratch; PyTorch or TF basicsThis GitHub repo on Machine Learning Interviews is a solid checklist covering fundamentals to production topics.DURING THE INTERVIEW ASK YOURSELF:1. Do you feel confident explaining ML concepts clearly?2. Can you clarify problem requirements and ask good questions?3. Are you capable of delineating the whole Machine Learning system by talking about data, features, models, evaluation, deployment, and trade-offs?4. Is your code neat, effective, and without any error?5. Have you thought about real world constraints?6. Can you draw from past projects and experiences effectively?All the best! ML roles are in high demand and consistent practice on projects, mocks, and designs will get you there. If you are targeting specific companies, tailor to their products. Good luck",

Can you give me advice on which technologies are on demand and well paid when it comes to programming languages?I forgot to mention that in my current work almost all days, in reality, I am working up to 3 hours because the job is so relaxed from my side of microservices.

After dabbling in various areas that tech has to offer through internships and projects, I became interested in building the systems/infrastructure behind the AI/ML models that are in use nowadays. However, I couldn't find much information online on what this role even does because it seems relatively new and highly specialized. I am hoping to gather insight from industry professionals on things like:1. Is AI/ML Infrastructure basically just DevOps/MLOps? Or is it more involved (i.e. coding-wise, distributed systems, etc.)? 2. Could you explain what the day-to-day looks like? If you could also describe what a typical sprint (something like a new project task) looks like, that'd be great too. 3. Is a Master's/PhD necessary for this type of engineering? Personally, I am planning on attending my school's +1 Master's program, which (hopefully) will complement my knowledge/skills in this speciality. 4. On a related note... Is this role entry-level friendly? I.e. is it something that will be extremely difficult to break into as a new grad? If so, what would the career progression look like to eventually end here? 5. What type of courseload is most important? I'll be taking Distributed Systems next semester, Operating Systems in my senior year... It's admittedly quite \"late\" in my college career since I took a while trying to figure out what I wanted to do. These are recommendations that ChatGPT recommended to me but am seeking some further details from real experts and professionals.

Initial investors (and employees who were with the company when it was formed and granted c-shares) were paid out and new investors were brought in. There was a rumor that existing employees would be given equity. What ended up actually happening was that silently, about 1/3 of the employees were actually given c-shares/equity in the company. It wasn't just by title (ie, managers and above). It seemed to be almost arbitrary, perhaps based on some hidden merit or perceived importance to the company. I only found out about it because of work I do with our legal team, so clearly this wasn't made public to the entire company.I am not sure how to feel about this. Obviously, a privately held company can operate and do whatever they feel is best. However, when one of the core values of the company is transparency and honesty, I find it disappointing and troubling that they would handle things in this way, creating two tiers of \"value\" amongst the employees.",

Initially started as a IC analyst, later promoted to senior/engineer. I spent the majority of my time at that company in a hybrid technical/leadership role (5 years). Moved to a government department in 2021 as a data scientist, quickly promoted to leading the DS team and worked in senior DS leadership positions since, mostly management responsibilities with some technical data science work. At the moment I wear a lot of hats and am good at everything, but not a specialist in anything. Basically anything remotely linked to data becomes my remit. Plus, a lot of my time gets soaked up in HR issues & firefighting. so I can’t focus as much with being a technical specialist as I am spread thin although I’ve always wanted to progress as a data engineer. I have had a good career with executive level responsibilities and I am wondering if I should just fully pivot into pure leadership now, and maybe make it a goal to get a “head of” or director position in the next few years. I’m hesitant because I still feel fairly young and that I have more to give when it comes to engineering but I’m not sure what the best path is for me. It’s just becoming abundantly clear that I can’t do it all and I probably should narrow my focus. Interested to hear from anyone who made a similar decision and what swayed you.",

        "content": "This story might be all too familiar. Context I am a 5th year student about to graduate thankful to have a full time job lined up. I am 70% excited 30% scared. I went into CS because I genuinely enjoyed coding from a young age, might I say even good at it. I was able to spend hours at my desk working on personal coding projects, or overengineering assignments simply for the joy of it. I was so good in fact I remember in first year for our introductory coding course I rolled out of bed 2 min before my exam (covid times so online) finished the exam in 15 minutes went back to sleep and got a high 90 on it.My Data Structures course was the final time I coded without the help of AI. it was taught in C and I was able to comfortably implement various Data Structures, like trees, linked lists, etc in C with a full conceptual understanding but since AI came out I have fallen into the hell hole that is vibe coding, and I feel embarrassed and scared. during my internships it first began with using AI to ask for help to make a component look good, or refractor some code, or debug something. then at one point asking it to implement entire components. and during my final internship basically vibe coding my entire project. Although i still would dive in and make sure the code made sense and that I could explain it. Everything I vibe coded impressed managers and my team who went on to actually implement my project into production. However I still fell like a fraud. All my uni courses I have more or less AI'd my way through with a few exceptions. I even remember one time I promised myself not to use AI for an assignment. so I used vs code instead of Cursor. In the file i remember adding a comment like:`################` `# Course Code` `# Assignment X` `################` `# Question 1: Pascal Triangle.`Based of just that that copilot provided a tab that was the entire assignment done, I of course accepted the tab and it passed all test cases without a hitch. I was initially excited about how much more productive AI made me, but as of late I have begun despising my dependence on AI to product. I act as a high-level manager just prompting it what to do. I no longer have the ability to understand the code. so if it breaks it's just me asking it to fix it again. and with me starting my full-time position in the new year I'm worried that this hole I have dug myself into is gonna be my demise. It has affected my confidence greatly because I simply do not understand what is being written anymore. it's more or less a foreign language. I do not know what best practices are anymore.I see my peers that did not rely on AI the same way, have a much deeper understanding of their work, and review code at a much more intricate level. They also build much better looking projects than me and are quicker as well, as they use AI more as a helping hand than doing their entire jobI feel it is too late to brush off my JavaScript book and go through all the concepts again. I just need some advice on what to do at this point. I'm joining a fast-moving team and am expected to start producing results very quickly. I dont want to rely on vibe-coding, because I know it wont be outputting the best code. but at the same time I cannot rely on myself as I barely know anything. I guess I'm trying to tackle the fundamental problem that I have no real valuable skillset at this point that is of benefit to anyone.I did not use AI to write or proofread this post so forgive any grammar mistakes please!",

Anyways recently started learning python and planning to do some back end small projects to get the hang of it since I kind of enjoy web related stuff more, plus some leetcode practice. But my question is when switching will I need to start over as Jr dev back end? Or maybe I could adapt my CV to land some mid level dev? Will my current experience be any useful for getting interviews or should I just try to start anew? Don't know if it matters but I'm still young it's just my second job, so I don't mind as much starting over, although if possible I guess I would like to at least for it to be a side grade.",

Ex: Front End, Back end, etc. But recently, I felt like I've wanted a change tech wise. (It's also really hard too get these jobs as of right now). So i was wondering about other technology fields like data analyst, IT, Business Analyst, etc. How is this field? Should I get certifications? Do you have any other suggestions for other tech fields I should look into?",

I get that the goal is to be productive and independent, but are there people here who had more accompanying and supportive mentorships when they didn’t know much? Is this just the price of entry? I’m just feeling discouraged moving forward into other internships and I’m not looking for a repeat of what happened. Especially in an unpaid environment. I didn’t get to make a single significant contribution to the code base or get any project done of any kind. I’m going for round 2, but what positive indicators should I look for in an internship I need to have 20/20 vision here and not end up knee deep in water. Thank you!",

I'm a second year, so it's not too late to fully switch and make more swe projects, but in the short term how could I show off my game projects on my resume? Some of them are from game jams which I had a leading role in, however i've asked ai to review my resume and it said that they hurt more then help for a non game dev role. Is it worth putting those games and other long term game dev projects on my resume, especially if 3/4 of my projects section is those?",
