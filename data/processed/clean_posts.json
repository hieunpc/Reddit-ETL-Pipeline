        "content": "I've been thinking about how companies are treating data engineers like they're some kind of tech wizards who can solve any problem thrown at them.Looking at the various definitions of what data engineers are supposedly responsible for, here's what we're expected to handle:1. Development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data2. Producing high-quality data and consistent information3. Supporting downstream use cases4. Creating core data infrastructure5. Understanding the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, AND software engineeringThat's... a lot. Especially for one position.I think the issue is that people hear \"engineer\" and immediately assume \"Oh, they can solve that problem.\" Companies have become incredibly dependent on data engineers to the point where we're expected to be experts in everything from pipeline development to security to architecture.I see the specialization/breaking apart of the Data Engineering role as a key theme for 2026. We can't keep expecting one role to be all things to all people.What do you all think? Are companies asking too much from DEs, or is this breadth of responsibility just part of the job now?",

        "content": "Recently interviewed at DoorDash. Onsite had 4 rounds System Design, Data Modeling, Business Partner and Leadership The recruiter who had reached out regarding the role had transferred my profile to other recruiter at onsite process. This new recruiter , not friendly. In a cold email said that I should book time on her calendar for a prep call. Well there was not a single slot available for next 3 weeks. I kept checking for couple of days and finally found one. On the day of call she rescheduled for different time. On the call read the same pdf that she had shared with me over the email on what to expect. Not a great conversation. I’ve met really good recruiters who are friendly enough. System Design question - question was quite big 6-7 lines. I’ll put it in simple words - Design DataBricks! Yes, you read it right! Interviewer was interested in knowing how will I write exact YAML code for this. I was able to answer all his questions.Data Modeling - Design fitness app. But the interviewer wanted me to draw visualizations. Well never in my past 8 years of work experience I had to do any visualizations but looks like DE in DoorDash work on visualizations as well. It wasn’t a basic graph , some advanced trend graph. Business Partner - DoorDash expanding business how will you go about it etc. basic questions interviewer also seem to be onboarded on the approachesLeadership - Hiring Manager joined 2-3 minutes late. Didn’t bother to apologize. I ignored that and continued to talk with my positive energy. He said he will leave 10 minutes at the end for me to ask any questions. Questions were normal tell me about the time kind. Situation based. I answered all. He had multiple follow up questions. Kept asking something from the list. It was almost 5 minutes to end the meeting and then he stopped and started sharing about the team. Even here he didn’t ask if I have any questions. I had to ask him when we were at time if I can ask couple of questions. I felt like I performed well.Next day morning Recruiter’s cold email came in that team has not decided to move forward. Happy to answer any questions anyone has.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "https://i.redd.it/fsa3dtvkfrgg1.gifHello all!I'm new in this subreddit! I'm a Data Engineer with +3 years of experience in the field.As shown in the attached image, I'm making an ETL simulator in JavaScript, that simulates the data flow in a pipeline.Recently I came across a Linkedin post of a guy showcasing this project : [https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival](https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival)He made a little tower defense game that interactively teaches Cloud Architecture basics.It was interesting to see the engagement of the DevOps community with the project. Many have starred and contributed to the Github repo.I'm thinking about building something silimar for Data Engineers, given that I have some background in Game Dev and UI/UX too. I still need your opinion though, to see whether or not it is going to be that useful, especially that it will take some effort to come up with something polished, and AI can't help much with that (I'm coding all of the logic manually).The idea is that I want to make it easy to learn Apache Spark internals and distributed computing principles. I noticed that many Data Engineers (at least here in France), including seniors/experts, say they know how to use Apache Spark, yet they don't deeply understand what's happening under the hood.Through this game, I'll try to concretize the abstract concepts and show how they impact the execution performance, such as : transformations/actions, wide/narrow transformations, shuffles, repartition/coalesce, partitions skew, spills, node failures, predicate pushdown, ...etcYou'll be able to build pipelines by stacking transformer blocks. The challenge will be to produce a given dataframe using the provided data sources, while avoiding performance killers and node failures. In the animated image above, the sample pipeline is equivalent to the following Spark line : `new_df = source_df.filter($\"shape\" === \"star\").withColumn(\"color\", lit(\"orange\"))`I represented the rows with shapes. The dataframe schema will remain static (shape, color, label) and the rendering of each shape reflects the content of the row it represents. Dataframe here is a set of shapes.I'm still hesitant about this representation. Do you think it is intuitive and easy to understand ? I can always revert to the standard tabular visualisation of rows with dynamic schemas, but I guess it won't look user friendly when there are a lot of rows in action.The next step will be to add logical multi-node clusters in order to simulate the distributed computing. The heaviest task that I estimated would be the implementation of the data shuffling.I'll share the source code within the next few days, the project needs some final cleanups.In the meanwhile, feel free to comment or share anything helpful :)",

There is so much more I could do would have wanted to do. Heck I have just been in one domain also.My company lately have been asking us to prepare datasets to feed to agentic AI. While it answers the basics right it still fails at complex things which require deep domain and business knowledge.There are several prompts injected and several key business indicators defined so the Agent performs good ( honestly if we add several more layers of prompt and chain few more agents it would get to answer come hard questions involving joining 6+ tables as well)Since it already answers some easy to medium questions based on your prompts the headcounts are just slashing. No I am good at what I do but I won't self proclaim as top 1%. I have very strong skillset to figure things out if I don't know about it. A coworker of mine has been the company for 6 years and didn't even realize how to solve things which I could do it ( even though I had no idea in the first place as well) . I just guess this person has become way more comfy and isn't aware how wild things are outside.Is there anyone actively considering goose farming or something else out of this AI field ?There is joy in browsing the internet without prompts and scrolling across website. There is joy in navigating UIs, drop downs and looking at the love they have put in. There is joy in minimizing the annoying chat pop that open ups at the website.And last thing I want to read is AI slop books by my fav authors.There is reason why chess is still played by humans and journalist still put heart out in their writing. There will also be a reason human DE/DS/DA/AE would be present in future but maybe a lot less.What's the motivation to still pursue this field ? I love anything related to data to be honest and for me that is the only one. I love eat and breathe data even if I am jobless now because of AI first policy my company has taken.",

My mission ended in December due to budget cuts, and I am currently “on the bench” (inter-contract) with my probation period ending soon.•The Issue: I am tired of the consulting model (instability, lack of ownership, dependency on random missions). I want to stabilize and, most importantly, transition into Analytics Engineering / Data Engineering.The Offer (Internal Role):I have an offer for a permanent contract (CDI) at an End Client (a digital subsidiary of a massive Fortune 500 industrial group, approx. 50 people in this specific entity).•Title: Senior Analytics Engineer (New position creation).•Tech Stack: Databricks / Spark + Power BI (Medallion architecture, Digital Performance & E-commerce focus). This is exactly the stack I need to master for my future career steps.•The “Catch”: The fixed base salary offer is 12.5% lower than my current base salary in consulting.•Variable: There is a 10% variable bonus (performance-based), which brings the total package closer to my current pay, but the guaranteed monthly income is definitely lower.My Plan / Strategy:1.Tech: Acquire deep expertise in Databricks and Data Engineering (highly in demand).2.Domain: The role focuses on Digital Performance / E-commerce, which seems valuable.My Questions for the community:1.Does taking a 12.5% step back on base salary seem justified to gain the Databricks expertise + the stability of an internal role?2.Is it risky to accept a “Senior” job title that pays below market rate for that level, or will the title itself be valuable on my CV in 2 years?3.Has anyone here taken a pay cut to pivot technically? What was the ROI after 2-3 years?Thanks in advance for your advice!",

I know we can transition to ML but I'm assuming that needs a math background. AI is an option but then you're competing with new grads (do we even stand a chance? Does our background experience help?). I'm asking for more general answers but my background issue is essentially being a jr-mid level at 3-4 different positions, all at smaller companies and more of a startup environment. Platform/cloud (AWS) engineering, bi developer, data engineer and architect. I would be EXTREMELY valuable if this background was at larger companies. From what I can see this isn't valuable unless you're senior/staff or a cloud architect level. They don't bring in jr/mid level and train them, at least not right now.",

        "content": "As title. **When** ***shouldn't*** **we go through the efforts of building a dimensional model?** To me, it's a bit of a grey area. But how do I pick out the black and white? When I'm giving feedback, questioning and making suggestions about the aspects of the design as developed - and it's not a dim model - I'll tend to default to \"should be a dim model\". I'm concerned that's a rigid and incorrect stance. I'm vaguely aware that a dim model is not always the way to go, but *when is that?*Background: I have 7 years in DE, 3 years before that in SW. I've learned a bunch, but often fall back on what are considered best practices if I lack the depth or breadth of experience. When, and when *not* to use a dim model is one of these areas.Most our use cases are A) Reports in Power BI. Occasionally, B) Returning specific, flat information. For B, it could *still* come from a dim model. This leads me to think that a dim model is a go-to, with doing otherwise is the exception.Problem of the day: There's a repeating theme at work. Models put together by a colleague are never strict dims/facts. It's *relational*, so there is a logical star, but it's not as clear-cut as a few facts and their dimensions. Measures and attributes remain mixed. They'll often say that the data and/or model is small: there is a handful of tables; less than hundreds of millions of rows.I get the balance between *ship now* and *do it properly, methodically, follow a pattern*. But, whether there are 5 tables or 50, I am stuck on the thought that your 5-table data source *still* has some business process to be considered. There are *still* measures and attributes to break out.EDIT: Some rephrasing. I was coming across as \"back up my opinion\". I'm actually looking for the opposite.",

Also, how do people upgrade themselves in this domain? Also, the tools are the backbone of this domain, how do poeple learn them even though they have not worked in any project around them in the job, I mean based on my exp, it is little difficult to learn them without actually working on them and way easier to forget? Do people usually fake the tool exp and then learn on the job? Also, when I have 1 year of exp, what are the expecations from me? Also, should I start working on my system design knowledge?

        "content": "Hey guys,Granyt is a self-hostable monitoring tool for Airflow. I built it after getting frustrated with every existing open source option:* Sentry is great, but it doesn't know what a dag\\_id is. Errors get grouped weirdly and the UI just wasn't designed for data pipelines.* Grafana + Prometheus feels like it needs a PhD to set up, and there's no real Python integration for error analysis. Spent a week configuring everything, then never looked at it again.* Airflow UI shows me what happened, not what went wrong. And the interface (at least in Airflow 2) is slow and clunky.What Granyt does differently:* Stack traces that show dag\\_id, task\\_id, and run\\_id. Grouped by fingerprint so you see patterns, not noise. Built for DAGs from the ground up - not bolted on as an afterthought.* Alerts that actually matter. Row count drops? Granyt tells you before the CEO asks on Monday. Just return metrics in XCom and Granyt picks them up automatically.* Connect all your environments to one source of truth. Catch issues in dev before they hit your production environment.* 100% open source and self-hostable (Kubernetes and Docker support). Your data never leaves your servers.Thought it may be useful to others, so I am open sourcing it. Happy to answer any questions!",

When something breaks, figuring out what was supposed to be true is not that obvious.We just released Soda Core 4.0, an open-source data contract verification engine that tries to fix that by making Data Contracts the default way to define DQ table-level expectations.Instead of scattered checks and ad-hoc rules, you define data quality once in YAML. The CLI then validates both schema and data across warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, DuckDB, and others.The idea is to treat data quality infrastructure as code and let a single engine handle execution. The current version ships with 50+ built-in checks.Repo: [https://github.com/sodadata/soda-core](https://github.com/sodadata/soda-core) Release notes: [https://soda.io/blog/introducing-soda-4.0](https://soda.io/blog/introducing-soda-4.0)",

        "author": "Lastrevio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm reading \"Spark: The Definitive\" guide and there's a part about how user defined functions in Python can be inefficient. This is the quote: \"When you use the function, there are essentially two different things that occur. If the function is written in Scala or Java, you can use it within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that there will be little performance penalty aside from the fact that you can’t take advantage of code generation capabilities that Spark has for builtin functions. There can be performance issues if you create or use a lot of objects; we cover that in the section on optimization in Chapter 19. If the function is written in Python, something quite different happens. Spark starts a Python process on the worker, serializes all of the data to a format that Python can understand (remember, it was in the JVM earlier), executes the function row by row on that data in the Python process, and then finally returns the results of the row operations to the JVM and Spark.Starting this Python process is expensive, but the real cost is in serializing the data to Python. This is costly for two reasons: it is an expensive computation, but also, after the data enters Python, Spark cannot manage the memory of the worker. This means that you could potentially cause a worker to fail if it becomes resource constrained (because both the JVM and Python are competing for memory on the same machine). We recommend that you write your UDFs in Scala or Java—the small amount of time it should take you to write the function in Scala will always yield significant speed ups, and on top of that, you can still use the function from Python!\" I heard from Reddit that this book was written a long time ago and some things may be outdated. Is this still relevant with the latest versions of Spark? Are Python UDFs still significantly slower than Scala/Java UDFs in Spark? If yes, have you ever encountered a situation at work where someone actually wrote a UDF in Scala or Java and avoided using Python for the sake of performance increases?",

Column-level says \"these 3 specific dashboard fields\", which is actually helpful.**What didn't work****My first attempt: Regex parsing SQL**Wrote a bunch of regex to pull column names from SELECT statements. Worked for simple queries. Completely fell apart with CTEs, subqueries, and window functions.Example that broke it: WITH customers AS (   SELECT      c.id as customer_key,     c.email as contact_email   FROM raw.customers c ) SELECT customer_key, contact_email FROM customersMy regex couldn't track that customer\\_key came from c.id. I gave up after 2 weeks.**My 2nd attempt: Query INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA only**Thought we could just use Snowflake's metadata tables to see column relationships. **Nope**. INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA tells you schemas exist, not how data flows through queries.I found success by parsing SQL properly with an actual parser, not regex. I used sqlparse for Python but JSQLParser works if you live in Java world.Query Snowflake's QUERY\\_HISTORY view, parse every SELECT/INSERT/CREATE TABLE AS statement, build a graph of column → column relationships.**The architecture** Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY    ↓ Extract SQL (last 7 days of queries)   ↓ SQL Parser (sqlparse)   ↓ Column Mapper (track renames/transforms)   ↓ Graph DB (Neo4j) + Search (Elasticsearch) import sqlparse from snowflake.connector import connect # Pull recent queries queries = snowflake.execute(\"\"\"   SELECT query_text    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY    WHERE query_type IN ('SELECT', 'INSERT', 'CREATE_TABLE_AS_SELECT')   AND start_time > DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) \"\"\") for query_text in queries:     parsed = sqlparse.parse(query_text)[0]          # Extract SELECT columns     select_cols = extract_columns(parsed)          # Extract FROM tables and resolve schemas     source_tables = extract_tables(parsed)          # Handle SELECT * by querying schema     if has_star_select(select_cols):         select_cols = resolve_star_expressions(source_tables)          # Build edges: source_col -> output_col     for output_col in select_cols:         for input_col in output_col.dependencies:             graph.add_edge(                 from_col=f\"{input_col.table}.{input_col.name}\",                 to_col=f\"{output_col.table}.{output_col.name}\",                 transform_type=output_col.transform             )**Some issues I ran into****1. SELECT \\* resolution**When you see SELECT \\* FROM customers JOIN orders, you need to know what columns exist in both tables at query execution time. Can't parse this statically.The solution is to Query INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA.COLUMNS to get table schemas, then expand \\* to the actual column list.**2. Column aliasing chains** SELECT    customer_id as c_id,   c_id as cust_id,  -- references the alias above   cust_id as final_idYou have to track the alias chain through the entire query. The symbol table gets really messy really fast.**3. Subqueries and CTEs**Each level of nesting creates a new namespace. The parser needs to track which customer\\_id is which when you have 3 nested CTEs all selecting customer\\_id.**4. Window functions and aggregates**SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY customer\\_id) means the output column depends on revenue (for the calculation) and customer\\_id (for the partition), but differently.Your lineage graph needs different edge types: \"aggregates,\" \"partitions\\_by,\" \"direct\\_reference.\"**Performance at 50K tables**Parsing 7 days of query history (about 500K queries): 2 hours Storage: Neo4j graph (200M edges), Elasticsearch (column name search) Query time: \"Show me everything downstream of this column\" = sub-2 seconds Query time: \"Where is customer\\_id used?\" = sub-1 secondTo save yourself a future headache, save the 20% of lineage paths that get queried 80% of the time.**What I’m still struggle with**Cross-warehouse lineage. My data flows Snowflake → Databricks → back to Snowflake. This approach only sees the Snowflake side.Real-time updates. I run lineage extraction every 6 hours. If someone on my team changes a column and immediately asks \"what breaks?\", they get stale data.ML pipelines. Notebooks that do df.select(\"customer\\_id\") don't show up in Snowflake query logs. That’s a blind spot.What's your current table count? Curious where others hit the breaking point. Sorry for the wall of text!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I'm currently working in a data science role but was thinking about making the switch to data engineering. I have a background in statistics and have been working as a data scientist in biomedical research in academia for 1.5 years. This is my first job since finishing my Masters in statistics. When I first started the job, I was responsible for cleaning datasets from clinical trials (this was 90% of the work), statistical modeling, creating visual aids like graphs and charts, and presenting and explaining my work to biologists. After 6 months, my manager told me I \"wasn't a good fit\" for the role because I \"lack curiosity\". I wouldn't say he was wrong. I didn't mind the work but it also didn't excite me and I didn't find it that fulfilling.I was transferred to a different team within the same company and my main project became writing programming scripts to automate compression of thousands of files from patient databases, and creating lookup tables containing information on all the files (such as patient identifiers, visit dates, etc.) This involved a lot of identifying and sometimes renaming files that were mislabeled, had missing information, or used different naming conventions, and make sure these edge cases were accounted for in the compression process. We also received multiple batches of files from different sources, and I had to modify the scripts to account for all the nuances between different sources. I noticed I enjoyed these projects much more and that I'm very precise and good at paying close attention to small details. I liked how expectations were more well-defined with this project and was more like \"it either works or it doesn't\", rather than the previous data science role which was much more open-ended. I feel like I do better when expectations are more structured and consistent, rather than exploratory. My new manager also noticed the new role was a much better fit for me.That being said, I'm thinking about pivoting into data engineering for my next role because I feel it may be a better fit for me. I've been looking at job postings for data engineering roles, but I don't have many of the skills required for a lot of these roles. My work so far has mainly been in R since that's what my company uses, and I've had some exposure to SQL and Python. I know Python and SQL are important in data engineering and tech is all about transferable skills, but I feel like I don't yet have the toolbox to switch to data engineering, nor do I have strong software engineering skills. I'm also not sure if I will be a strong candidate considering how competitive the job market is nowadays. My plan for now is to learn the important skills so that I'm able to make the switch.Those of you who switched from data science to data engineering, what was your experience like and how did you navigate that shift? What are the most important data engineering skills/tools I should familiarize myself with to become a competitive candidate and be ready for interviews? What are some good resources you would suggest for learning these skills/tools? And do you have any general advice for me?",

It was pretty cheap so it's not worth sending it back. My question is, is everything in the 3rd edition pretty much rewritten from scratch to account for new technologies? Or is it more like, there are just new chapters and sections to discuss the new techniques? Just wondering if it's worth even starting to read it while I wait for the 3rd edition to arrive, or if the entire thing is so outdated I shouldn't bother at all. Thanks!",

Also for our specific use case, ML inference is based on client timezones, so inference usually runs between 06:00 and 09:00 local time, but each energy market has regulatory windows that change when they need data by and it is best for us to run the inference closest to the deadline so that the lag is minimized.Interested in hearing about other data engineers' battle wounds when working with incremental/schedule/timezone conflicts.",

While I currently earn an ok wage (working in the EU and coming from a third world country), I feel like I don’t really see myself working in this line of work forever, and I don’t see strong career/wage progression here.While looking for a possible career shift that could play to my strengths, I stumbled upon analytics engineering/data engineering. A lot of articles and people I’ve read on gave me the impression that it might be possible to break into the field without having a degree specifically in the area (I have a degree in materials science and if my impression of this is wrong then sorry). Btw I basically dont have any programming or analytics background except the limited amount of time I had with Matlab.My question is:1. Do you think this will still be true in the coming years? Considering that I’m currently working full time and can only learn in my spare time after work, I don’t plan to break into DE immediately, as I know that’s basically impossible. But maybe breaking into data analytics or analytics engineering could be more realistic and doable?2. I'm currently starting with SQL and then plan on moving to Python, Git, some visualization tools and then dbt and cloud warehouses. Is this a solid plan or are there any other stuffs I should take into account? Any tips on typical mistakes that one can do early in these phase that might hinder/slow down my progress?3. What are your best resources for learning and for having a decent roadmap or plan to become a data analyst, analytics engineer, or data engineer? I don’t mind paying for a course if it’s worth it. So far I'm using SQLBolt, w3schools, thoughtspot for their free courses as a start. Are there websites where I can practice writing SQL queries a lot? Any youtubers who make quality videos?There is also the worry of AI coming in and disrupting the future job market but that is a topic that probably is gonna derail my questions here so lets skip that for now.I know no one can really predict what the future will be like, but I’d love to hear perspectives and experiences from people who have been in the industry, or even those just starting out.Thank you for reading and your help!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,I have inherited a pipeline where some of the inputs are reference data that are uploaded by analysts via CSV files.The current ingestion design for these is quite inflexible. The reference data is tied to a year dimension, but the way things have been set up is that the analyst needs to include the year which the data is for in the filename. So, you need one CSV for every year that there is data for.e.g. we have two CSV files, the first is *some\\_data\\_2024.csv* which would have contents:|id|foo||:-|:-||1|423||2|1|the second is *some\\_data\\_2021.csv* which would have contents:|id|foo||:-|:-||1|13||2|10|These would then appear in the final silver table as 4 rows:|year|id|foo||:-|:-|:-||2024|1|423||2024|2|1||2021|1|13||2021|2|10|Which means that to upload many years' worth of data, you have to create and upload many CSV files all named after the year they belong to. I find this approach pretty convoluted. There is also no way to delete a bad record unless you replace it. (It can't be removed entirely).Now the pattern I want to go to is just allow the analysts to upload a singular CSV file with a year column. Whatever is in there will be what is in the final downstream table. In other words, the third table above will be what they upload. If they want to remove a record just reupload that singular CSV without that record. I figure this is much simpler. I will have a staging table that captures the entire upload history and then the final silver table just selecting all records from the latest upload.What do we think? Please let me know if I should add more details.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I wanted to check something we’ve been seeing in my company with AWS Glue and see if anyone else has run into this.We run several AWS Glue 4.0 batch jobs (around \\~10 jobs, pretty stable workloads) that execute regularly. For most of 2025, both execution times and monthly costs were very consistent.Then, starting around mid-November/early December 2025, we noticed a sudden and consistent drop in execution times across multiple Glue 4.0 jobs, which ended up translating into roughly \\~30% lower cost compared to previous months.What’s odd is that nothing obvious changed on our side:* No code changes.* Still on Glue 4.0.* No config changes (DPUs, job params, etc.).* Data volumes look normal and within expected ranges.* The improvement showed up almost at the same time across multiple jobs.Same outputs, same logic. Just faster and cheaper.I get that Glue is fully managed/serverless, but I couldn’t find any public release notes or announcements that would clearly explain such a noticeable improvement specifically for Glue 4.0 workloads.Has anyone else noticed Glue 4.0 jobs getting faster recently without changes? Could this be some kind of backend optimization (AMI, provisioning, IO, scheduler, etc.) rolled out by AWS? Any talks, blog posts, or changelogs that might hint at this?Btw I'm not complaining at all , just trying to understand what happened.",

If data wasn’t touched in 30 days, we moved it to cold storage.I noticed a weird pattern in the AI space recently: **We are treating Vector Databases like cold storage.**We shove 100% of our embeddings into expensive Hot RAM (Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate), even though for many use cases (like Chat History or Seasonal Catalog Search), 90% of that data is rarely queried after a month. It’s like keeping your tax returns from 1990 in your wallet instead of a filing cabinet.I wanted to see exactly how much money was being wasted, so I wrote a simple open-source CLI tool to audit this.**What it does:**1. **Connects** to your index (Pinecone currently supported).2. **Probes** random sectors of your vector space to sample metadata.3. **Analyzes** the `created_at` or timestamp fields.4. **Reports** your \"Stale Rate\" (e.g., \"65% of your vectors haven't been queried in >30 days\") and calculates potential savings if you moved them to S3/Disk.**The \"Trust\" Part:** I know giving API keys to random tools is a bad idea.* This script runs **100% locally** on your machine.* Your keys never leave your terminal.* You can audit the code yourself (it’s just Python).**Why I built this:** I’m working on a larger library to automate the \"S3 Offloading\" process, but first I wanted to prove that the problem actually exists.I’d love for you to run it and let me know: **Does your stale rate match what you expected?** I’m seeing \\~90% staleness for Chat Apps and \\~15% for Knowledge Bases.**Repo here:** [https://github.com/billycph/VectorDBCostSavingInspector](https://github.com/billycph/VectorDBCostSavingInspector)Feedback welcome!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone! Long-time listener, first-time caller. I have an opportunity to offer some design options to a firm for ingesting data from an IoT device network. The devices (which are owned by the firm's customers) produce a relatively modest number of records: Let's say a few hundred devices producing a few thousand records each every day. The firm wants 1) the raw data accessible to their customers, 2) an analytics layer, and 3) a dashboard where customers can view some basic analytics about their devices and the records. The data does not need to be real-time, probably we could get away with refreshing it once a day.My first thought (partly because I'm familiar with it) is to ingest the records into a BigQuery table as a data lake. From there, I can run some basic joins and whatnot to verify, sort, and present the data for analysis, or even do more intensive modeling or whatever they decide they need later. Then, I can connect the BigQuery analytics tables to Looker Studio for a basic dashboard that can be shared easily. Customers can also query/download their data directly.That's the basics. But I'm also thinking I might need some kind of queue in front of BigQuery (Pub/Sub?) to ensure nothing gets dropped. Does that make sense, or do I not have to worry about it with BigQuery? Lastly, just kind of conceptually, I'm wondering how IoT typically works with POSTing data to cloud storage. Do you create a GCP service account for each device? Is there an API key on each physical device that it uses to make the requests? What's best practice? Anything really, really stupid that people often do here that I should be sure to avoid?Thanks for your help and anything you want to comment on, I'm sure I'm still missing a lot. This is a fun project, I'm really hoping I can cover all my bases!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So we had Spark, Trino, Flink, Presto, and Hive all hitting different catalogs and it was a complete shitshow. Schema changes needed updates in 5 different places. Credential rotation was a nightmare. Onboarding new devs took forever because they had to learn each engine's catalog quirks.Tried a few options. Unity Catalog would lock us into Databricks. Building our own would take 6+ months. Ended up going with Apache Gravitino since it just became an Apache TLP and the architecture made sense - basically all the engines talk to Gravitino which federates everything underneath.Migration took about 6 weeks. Started with Spark since that was safest, then rolled out to the others. Pretty smooth honestly.The results have been kind of crazy. New datasets now take 30 mins to add instead of 4~6 hours. Schema changes went from 2~3 hours down to 15 mins. Catalog config incidents dropped from 3~4 per month to maybe 1 per quarter. Dev onboarding for the catalog stuff went from a week to 1~2 days.Unexpected win: Gravitino treats Kafka topics as metadata objects so our Flink jobs can discover schemas through the same API they use for tables. That was huge for our streaming pipelines. Also made our multi-cloud setup way easier since we have data in both AWS and GCP.Not gonna sugarcoat the downsides though. You gotta self-host another service (or pay for managed). The UI is pretty basic so we mostly use the API. Community is smaller than Databricks/Snowflake. Lineage tracking isn't as good as commercial tools yet.But if you're running multiple engines and catalog sprawl is killing you, it's worth looking at. We went from spending hours on catalog config to basically forgetting it exists. If you're all-in on one vendor it's probably overkill.Anyone else dealing with this? How are you managing catalogs across multiple engines?---**Disclosure:** I work with Datastrato (commercial support for Gravitino).

        "author": "Beneficial-Flow-2105",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I built BigAsk, a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language. It’s a fairly thin wrapper over the Gemini CLI meant to address some shortcomings it has in overcoming data querying challenges organizations face.I’m a Software Engineer in infra/DevOps, but I have a few friends who work in roles where much of their time is spent fulfilling requests to fetch data from internal databases. I’ve heard it described as a “necessary evil” of their job which isn’t very fulfilling to perform. Recently, Google has released some quite capable tools with the potential to enable those without technical experience using BigQuery to explore the data themselves, both for questions intended to return exact query results, and higher-level questions about more nebulous insights that can be gleaned from data. While these certainly wouldn’t completely eliminate the need for human experts to write some queries or validate results of important ones, it seems to me like they could significantly empower many to save time and get faster answers.Unfortunately, there are some pretty big limitations to the current offerings from Google that prevent them from actually enabling this empowerment, and this project seeks to fix them.One is that the best tools are available in a limited set of interfaces. Those scattered throughout the already-lacking-in-user-friendliness BigQuery UI require some foundational BigQuery and data analysis skills to use, making their barrier to entry too high for many who could benefit from them. The most advanced features are only available in the Gemini CLI, but as a CLI, using it requires using a command-line, again putting it out-of-reach for many.The second is a lack of safe access control. There's a reason BigQuery access is typically limited to a small group. Directly authorizing access to this data via the BigQuery UI or Gemini CLI to individual users who aren't well-versed in its stewardship carries large risks of data deletion or leaks. As someone with experience working professionally with managing cloud IAM within an organization, I know that attempts to distribute permissions to individual users while maintaining a limited scope on them also requires considerable maintenance overhead and comes with it’s own set of security risks.BigAsk enables anyone within an organization to easily and securely use the most powerful agentic data analysis tools available from Google to self-serve answers to their burning questions. It addresses the problems outlined above with a user-friendly web interface, centralized access management with a recommended permissions set, and simple, lightweight code and deployment instructions that can easily be extended or customized to deploy into the constraints of an existing Google Cloud project architecture.Code here: [https://github.com/stevenwinnick/big-ask](https://github.com/stevenwinnick/big-ask)I’d love any feedback on the project, especially from anyone who works or has worked somewhere where this could be useful. This is also my first time sharing a project to online forums, and I’d value feedback on any ways I could better share my work as well.",

While I'm more interested in the DE side of things, I'm trying to keep things realistic and also include DA tools (I'm assuming landing a DA job is much easier as a trainee). My stack of tools, for now, is Python (pandas), SQL, Excel, and Power BI. I'm still learning about all these tools, but when I'm actually working on my projects, I don't exactly know where SQL would fit in. For example, I'm now working on a project that pulls data of a particular user from the Lichess API, cleans it up, transforms it into usable tables (using a OBT scheme), and then loads it into either SQLite or CSVs. From my understanding, and from my experience in a few previous, simpler projects, I could push all that data directly into either Excel or PowerBI and go from there. I know that, for starters, I could clean it up even further in pandas (for example, solve those NaNs in the accuracy columns). I also know that SQL does have its usefulness: I thought about finding winrates for different openings, isolating win and lose streaks, and that sort of stuff. But why wouldn't I do that in pandas or Python?[The current final table after the Python scripts; I'll be analyzing this. I censored the users just in case!](https://preview.redd.it/uywee59py4gg1.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=1188c1819ed4115924fbefc9285b217a61109fe6)Even if I wanted to use SQL, how does that connect to Excel and Power BI? Do I just pull everything into SQLite, create a DB, and then create new columns and tables just with SQL? And then throw that into Excel/Power BI? Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I've been trying to wrap my head around it ever since I started learning this stuff. I've been practicing SQL on its own online, but I have yet to use it on a real project. Also, I know that some tools like SnowFlake use SQL, but I'm wondering how to apply it in a more \"home-made\" environment with a much simpler stack. Thanks! Any help is greatly appreciated.",

Anyway, thought it might help folks who are learning and want to conceptualize what's actually happening beneath the abstractions: [How One Line of Python Triggers 12,000 Lines of Code - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6W2OGfxq0)",

Ever since I was a kid, I used to love the process of getting stuck, googling, watching half-relevant YouTube videos, reading forums, slowly piecing things together. That \"ohhh, wait, I get it now\" moment was addictive and felt \"earned\". Nowadays, I just give LLMs my problems and it solves them immediately or gives me step by step instruction on how to solve them. It is much faster but I do not wrestle with ideas long enough for them to sink in.It's like having the solution manual for every puzzle before I've even touched the puzzle. Yes, I know the answer, but I didn't learn it.And, I can feel my patience shrinking overtime. If something doesn't click in 30 seconds, my brain goes \"eh, AI will explain it better anyways\". I cannot sit with difficulty anymore. I'm not anti-AI but I miss the struggle. I miss feeling proud of understanding something because I worked for it. This is probably what people felt when the computer or the internet was invented as well, eh? New tech makes things faster but takes the fun away from certain things as well.",

I think it can be useful in the right contexts and when used well.But if you learn OOP as a course in college, you'd know that professors seem to think that it's God's perfect gift to programmers. My biggest problem is that colleges overemphasize inheritance as a feature.Inheritance can be useful, but when used improperly, it becomes ridiculously difficult and annoying to work with. In software engineering, there is a concept called \"orthogonality\", and it's the idea that different parts of your code should be independent and decoupled. It's common sense, really. If you change one part of your code, it shouldn't fuck up other parts. It makes testing, debugging, and reasoning about your program easier.Inheritance completely shits on that.When you have an inheritance tower two billion subclasses deep, it's almost guaranteed that there will be some unpredictable behavior in your code. OOP can have some very subtle and easy to overlook rules in how inheritance and polymorphism work, so it's very easy to create subtle bugs that are hard to reason about.So yeah. By all means, learn OOP, but please do it well. Don't learn it the way professors have you learn it, focus on composing classes rather than inheritance.",

Not as a gimmick but because the pattern behind that word game, templates with typed blanks filled according to rules, turns out to be structurally how computing works at every level (with a grain of salt).

At the same time, I’m trying to think ahead and understand which direction in programming might be right for me. The problem is that while I’m looking at different fields, everything seems interesting, and I can’t decide what to focus on.How did you figure out which path was right for you? What helped you make that decision?Did you choose based on interest, job opportunities, difficulty, or something else?",

I started this program because I like math and analysis and I thought data science would be a reasonable career choice. There’s obviously a bit of programming, and the problem is that we barely get any help and it’s constantly way above our level. We have assignments each week. The assignments aren’t very fun either, it’s just ”sort this list using this algorithm” or something like it. So the thing is, I feel like I would like programming a lot more if I didn’t constantly have to do it under pressure and above my own capacity. So are there any small projects I can do to find it more fun and not just something that I have to do? We use Java btw.EDIT: I’m not planning on becoming a developer/programmer. But since I will have to do programming for at least four years I would like to enjoy it more, that’s all.",

Other than that, either I don’t attend or the lectures don’t happen because the professors don’t take them.The problem is that I feel I waste a lot of time with my friends. After the first lecture, we spend most of our time playing online games like BGMI or FF. They don’t seem very interested in coding, but I already have a little background. I am doing web development and planning to start DSA. I have also done some reverse engineering in apps and a little bit of app development and cybersecurity.Spending an hour with them is fine, but when I waste 2–3 hours doing nothing and then go home, I feel like I’ve wasted my day. I have a PC at home, but I feel exhausted by the time I reach home. I always think, why not utilize college time instead of wasting it? But I also feel like my friends should do something productive too.One semester has already passed, and now I’m confused about what I should do.",

        "content": "I’m tutoring an A-Level Computer Science student who’s learning C#. She *says* she understands the theory, but when it comes to practical coding questions, she really struggles — even with very basic tasks we’ve gone over multiple times.We’ve reviewed the theory again and again, and I’ve taught her all the GCSE-level fundamentals she’d need to get started. The issue is that she has **no prior Computer Science background** at all, yet she’s now doing A-Level.She also never asks questions. I’ve noticed she zones out quite a lot, but when I gently address it, she denies it. I try to engage her with prompts, guided questions, and encouragement, but I don’t get much back.At this point I’m wondering:* Is this a confidence issue, a foundational gap, or just passive learning?* Am I expecting too much too quickly?* Would it help to switch to **Python first**, build problem-solving skills and logic, then come back to C#?* Or should I slow C# down even more and focus purely on micro-tasks and repetition?I genuinely want to help her succeed, but I’m feeling stuck and unsure if my approach is right. Any advice from CS teachers, tutors, or devs who’ve seen this before would be really appreciated.Thanks in advance :folded_hands: UPDATE: Thank you for the replies .

So you have no time to make architectural decisions or planning. The type of company where requirements are discussed in each daily and can change trillion of times then they question your skills when deadlines are missed. I cant leave though because I need the money and the market is just scary to be jobless. How can I improve in this environment. I started to use ai heavily to the point where I wait for claude code limits to reset so I can keep working. Even though I used to work without ai at all. I will changz companies if I find a better alternative but a better company will ask for a good developer who knows architecture and software design. Not a coder who survives using ai tools. I still ship, and im not against using ai. But when I try to work without it I struggle with the basics even. Any advice is much appreciated",

My usual approach is to first try to solve the problem on my own and then - even if I succeed - watch a YouTube video with deeper explanation to gain better understanding of the problem. Recently, I worked on [LeetCode 778: Swim in Rising Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/). It was a bit different from the problems I had solved before - I hadn't worked on this kid of problems yet. Although I managed to solve it successfully using a min-heap strucutre and a graph traversal algorithm. But it was something new for me, I had never used them two together. If you're an advanced programmer, when you hear a min-heap and graph traversal, you probably know what it means - but I didn't. Only when I was watching an explanatation of the optimal solution on YouTube, I realized that I had actually implemented a Dijkstra's algorithm - an algorithm invented by one of the greatest figures in computer science history. So even though this algorithm was created many decades ago, I was very excited that my analytical and problem-solving thinking process naturally led me to the same solution as Dijkstra's solution many decades ago. I'm sure that wouldn't happen if I was solving LeetCode blindly, learning only patterns. I wish every programmer feel this kind of moment from time to time to stay motivated on the path of learning!",

        "content": "I've been a floater so far. I've dabbled with a handful of different languages (python, ruby, java, c, c#, js) mostly because I was curious about what this programming thing was all about. My curiosity is growing significantly. I started solving basic problems with some scripting languages (sorting files with python, made some VERY BASIC selenium web automation scripts with java etc) and I really enjoyed it. I want to take it one billion steps further, however I don't know what direction to take it. In some ways, because I dont know what I don't know - as in there are a lot of programming professional domains that probably exist that I don't even know of. There are lots of languages and learning resources I probably don't know of. (I only know of the few big recommended ones like freecodecamp, odin, cs50 etc)With only a few exceptions, I'm pretty open minded to where I want to take this. I want to learn about data structures, algorithms and general design patterns and all the things professional developers eventually grow into. However to WHAT I apply these to? I have no idea. Here's what I know: I have no interest in traditional web development - especially front-end work. I tried to force myself to like it but I can't. (which is kind of a shame, because even traditional desktop applications are essentially getting deprecated in favor of cloud based web apps.) The biggest thing I think I'm mostly looking for is a language or technology stack that a) Has AMPLE resources to help someone go from beginner to contributor in a fairly streamlined fashion, b) interesting open source projects I could eventually try to contribute to and build experience working through the workflow of contributing to a team based project and c) something that has some kind of remote employment culture attached to it. (I live in a very remote part of the world and all current and future employment relies on remote work unless I want to climb an oil rig or hunt polar bears.). <--- stretch super longterm goal / bonus pointsThings I am curious about:* c# / windows desktop application development (whether this is even a thing in 2026 and beyond I have no idea)* c and systems / OS level programming (under the hood nuts n' bolts is incredibly interesting. Would love to learn how an OS works, whether it's windows or linux.)* MUD's / text based multiplayer games. See /r/mud for what I mean. I think these are interesting learning vehicles to get involved in. They stress OOP, classes, networking and efficiency while also working on what is probably a very legacy codebase. (some of these mud's have been online for 30 years!)* the ruby language in general - yeah I know I mentioned webdev as things I don't like, but ruby as a standalone scripting language is a beautiful thing. I would have strong interest in delving way deeper into it. (What are the odds rails devs can get by without giving a crap about the front-end? lol)I'm an older dude, so building dedicated desktop applications initially sounded interesting. (so probably c# .net windows apps in visual studio). I dont know if there's any professional demand for this stuff long term however these days. I'm from the Winamp/ICQ/Napster era so that's where my brain immediately went :D. I was looking at the TIOBE index for inspiration, but I think all it does is create FOMO so I stopped. Got overwhelming. Anyways, while I sit in this meeting listening to people blather on about quarterly financials, I thought I'd post this to solicit some ideas or feedback for where I could consider aiming my thirsty brain at. Thanks so much!",

I was thinking of using this to quickly check if two objects are the same in my app (since comparing two integers is faster than comparing two big objects with many fields). but then i realize something If a `hashCode` is just a 64-bit integer, and there are millions of possible objects, isnt it possible for two completely different objects to have the same hash code by accident? if two things have the same my logic would break.**My questions are:**1. If two objects have the same hashCode, can I be 100% sure they are the same?2. If not, why do we even have hash codes? Why not just use `==` for everything?3. How does a HashMap handle it if two different items accidentally get the same code? Does it just overwrite my data?",

Im a student and I’d like to get some up-to-date opinions on the state of Spring / Spring Boot in 2026 and looking forward, especially regarding job market demand, long-term viability, and industry trends.I have professional experience with TypeScript, mainly in the modern frontend/backend ecosystem but i felt that the lack of strong structure, the huge dependency ecosystem, and how fast tools and frameworks change can make it easy to feel “lost”, even on medium-sized projects. Because of that, I’m looking to move toward something I think is more serious, structured, and predictable in the long run.I narrowed my options down to C# (.NET) and Java (Spring / Spring Boot). At first, I was leaning toward C#, partly because several indexes (for example, TIOBE) show C# growing while Java appears stable or slightly declining. I also had the impression that the .NET community is larger and more “welcoming”.However, when I looked at the actual job market, the number of openings requiring Java + Spring (at least in my region and for remote positions) seemed significantly higher so i started learning it.i Would like to know the point of view of people that works with Spring/Spring boot, things such as:How do you see Spring/Spring Boot in 2026 and over the next 5–10 years?Is it still a solid choice for backend systems?Do you see it losing relevance compared to .NET, Node.js, Go, in the long run?From a career perspective, is Java + Spring still a good way to progress?I’d really appreciate your insights, thanks!",

        "content": "Hello! So I'm just working on a new game for fun, in VS code. I previously had a system where I basically separated a scenes class, containing what inanimate textures and sprites each scene needed, a map class, which cointains objects' positions, an animations class, with the bulk of sprite textures, and of course the main game class which runs in a loop. The other files were kinda interdependent, and in scenes I had key dictionaries that bound each texture to its position, so that Game would know where to draw it. Just now, I switched to a class-based version, where characters are just their own class, complete with position, animation, name, etc. So each one is a 'package' with more different types of data, but kinda usable as-is in the Game file.I did this because I got the impression the first way might become too fragmented, but actually I kinda liked the separate dictionary-version too. What do you think? Is the class-based one more standard, or is it better to separate by function like with my first version?Thanks!",

One of the biggest challenges that I continuously run into during the development phase is debugging. Currently the only way for me to debug code is manually step through it using the qemu console. It would save me a lot of time if I was able to set breakpoints.As a proof on concept, I want to be able to generate debugging information for my bootloader that can be read and processed by gdb. Unfortunately, this debugging info CANNOT be embedded as a part of the bootloader binary, and instead needs to be in a separate file. However, the assembler that I assembler that I am using, NASM, seems to provide no option for debugging symbols seperate of the binary that GDB can read.If anyone knows anything about how I could get this to work, it would be greatly appreciated!",

I’m currently strengthening areas like authorization (roles/ownership) and some of the “boring but important” parts such as error handling and pagination.At this point, I feel a bit stuck on what the next best step should be. Should I double down on backend by going deeper into more production-oriented concerns like security basics, deployment, logging, and performance? Or is it better to start adding a minimal frontend (for example, React) and build small full-stack projects just to exercise the backend end-to-end?Also, with all the AI hype around lately, it’s hard to tell what actually compounds long-term versus what’s just noise. From your experience, what would you prioritize focusing on next at this stage?Would really appreciate your perspective",

I do have a support blanket (moving in with family). But being a SWE was pretty much all I had as a redeeming quality, and now I have nothing. I moved to a new city, and now I pretty much have to leave the friends I made there. Now, when I introduce myself to people, what do I say I do for work? That I \\*used\\* to be a software engineer for half a year? My GPA was <3.5 on undergrad and I didn’t do any research (only internships), so I don’t know if grad school’s on the table. I feel really envious of people I knew at Amazon that got to actually establish longevity there over the course of 5+ years (hell, even 1-2 yrs), when I couldn’t even make it to 1. Most of the people that I see are software engineers well..still are. Either that or they’ve never gotten laid off. I’m really worried that I’ll end up having to career pivot or work minimum wage. Does anyone happen to have advice, by any chance?Edit: To clarify, the applications were sent starting mid-December in anticipation.",

In my own personal life, I don’t really get excited about tech or look forward to any of it. Great, new tech released, I’m not even gonna bother checking it out cause it’s either some sort of scam or will enshittify before I can really enjoy it. I’ll just stick with the 4 apps I use on my iPhone 13, and hope that they don’t deprecate my phone anytime soon cause I don’t want a new oneThe people I’ve worked with since about 2020 feel very different than before. It seems like everyone is more interested in business and finance than they are in tech and product. Many people working in tech seem like they don’t care about it. Tech companies have this very “Harvard MBA” feel to them that I can’t describe. Lots of ladder climbing, lots of clamoring for status and visibility. I’ve seen act in really unscrupulous ways to get ahead, despite the fact that it seems very toxicAlso, I’m level 1 autism. As time has gone on, I’ve noticed it’s been less and less tolerated. This doesn’t have to do with any changes in title, either, cause that’s stayed the same for years. Previously it seemed to be viewed as, at worst, a little quirky. Now at work people tell me that being able to read subtle social cues is more important than being able to do \\_any\\_ hard skill. I am still a senior engineerPart of me thinks I’m just getting old (I’m 35) and tired of this industry and maybe I’ve mentally checked out. The thing is, I’ve met at least a small handful of people who have expressed the same feelings to me: tech just isn’t \\_fun\\_ anymore. I also noticed that it even seems like people at these companies don’t even really believe in what they’re selling, really. Like I don’t get the feeling someone like Sam Altman \\_actually\\_ cares about OpenAI, it just feels like a griftLike when I think of growing up, I remember video games like world of Warcraft and newgrounds and MySpace. It felt like the attitude was more along the lines of “how do we get money so we can build what we want to build?” And not “what can we build that will make money?”Yes I know companies have to make money, but I suppose before it didn’t feel like they had to MAXIMIZE how much money they’d make at the expense of everything else they care aboutHas anyone else experienced this or have I just kinda started seeing the way it always was?

They aren't looking for the best candidates at minimum wage, yet their pipelines are dry or filled with irrelevant spam.The candidates can't find the good roles, and the (somewhat) good roles can't find the candidates. Does no one what to apply to smaller companies?My question to the community is: how can small businesses who want to hire a reasonable software engineer find you in the first place? Are you using niche boards? Slacks? Discords? Or have you given up on portals entirely in favor of networking?

I was already employed, so I was searching pretty casually and really only taking interviews for things that sounded interesting.I had a couple requirements in my search, so I generally rejected anything that didn't meet these.* Remote preferred, would have been willing to relocate, but would have have to be for a big tech like offer.* Needed to be a base of 180-190+.* Preferred public companies* Tech, or at least tech forward company* I generally reject any take home testsGeneral Info (This is all a bit rough number's wise, I didn't keep super exact metrics):* 30 cold applications -> \\~10 of which turned into initial HR interviews* Around 45 recruiter reachouts that I thought might be promising -> I rejected over half of those for various reasons.* Got Hiring Manager rejected from about 10, not sure on the exact ratio of cold applications to recruiter reachouts there.* Went to 15 tech screens, general mix of LC and more general coding tests.* I didn't do any prep at all, so I failed quite a few there and ended up taking 4 onsites.* Failed 2 onsites, got 1 offer frozen, and accepted the last offer which I just startedNotes:The general interview process/difficulty was about the same as I have experienced in the past. I had a general mix of leetcode like questions and more general coding questions. The offer I accepted asked mostly LC style questions, though there were more practical questions asked as well.HM's seem to be more picky and quick to reject. I've never really not gotten through to a tech screen from an HR screen, and I got HM rejected a few times over this process.I hope this might be helpful to anyone during their search.

I want to underscore that I was not actually under-performing; my teammates thought highly of me and my last manager gave me a reference to a different job and told me that I was welcome back on his team if I wanted to be there. (I don't think this is actually possible due to the nature of the separation). But, pretty much, I was rated poorly and I left because I was dejected by my experience with the culture. The entire thing was disgusting to me.Well, it's been 6 months and I still don't have a job. I could go to a startup. But, honestly, it feels like I took a step backwards in my career. It feels like I wasn't careful enough and now my entire life is on a bit of a detour.My leetcode skills are pretty good, but because of my YOE it's very difficult to get interviews at comparable places. I just feel so stupid right now. I'm considering doing a master's or maybe just going to a startup and trying to pivot back into big tech?I guess the thing that I'm mourning is the loss of progress.

Im right at the finish line, I can finally rest knowing i worked my ass off to get away from the shitty work situation i had previously and I can start working in a new domain, new interesting tech for more money. i feel like i did exactly what i set out to do.I’m not in interview form, haven’t touched systems design or DSA in months. I had the recruiter call, told them i have an active offer, and they said they’re accelerating the interview timeline cuz of that. Given all that, i’m probably gonna bomb this first round technical algorithms interview i just scheduled.But, when a tier 1 company calls like this i know you have to pick up the phone. i know this is a rare opportunity. i’ve never interviewed for a company with this much “prestige” either. Football analogy: I’ve been playing for West Ham, I got an offer to play for Liverpool, but now Real Madrid is calling.So: is it even worth interviewing ? even if i think im just gonna flop big time. Should i just let them know that id love to keep in contact and that this is unfortunate timing? Do i only get one shot at this ? why do i imagine that this is like life or death like im gonna get black listed at Databricks if i fail this right now. Or do i put my head down and grind my life out for these next couple weeks, potentially get an offer, and have to go through the messy rescinding and all that. I’m just lost on what I should do. I just feel like i deserve to just chill out. But i feel like i can’t catch a break.I’m painfully aware that this is an extremely privileged and amazing problem to have. i’m aware that the worst they can say is no, and i learn from the experience and i just have another job lined up anyway. But I just wanna know what others would do. Just given the context of being out of interview form and just needing a break from the countless weeks spent practicing studying and interviewing.Interview or don’t interview.**Edit**: straight up, this is lowkey one of those anxiety fueled posts where you just need validation lmao. at least myself 5 hours ago did. i’m ready for them to give me an NP hard problem and call it a day :face_with_bags_under_eyes::call_me_hand:",

I'm a pretty solid dev and have a good number of projects under my belt. I'm personable, though probably a bit rusty on interviewing and need to get my resume updated, but aside from that what do I need to know about interviewing? Is it still a \"kill yourself spending all your free time to grind, grind, grind\" sort of scenario?My bread and butter during my career has mostly been PHP. Obviously it has a reputation, though I'd like to think I've done a lot of \"real\" engineering with it—not just WordPress plugins and whatever small, hacky BS it's known for. I worry that will hold me back—not because of my skill level, but because of PHP's reputation. Is that a valid concern?I'm also far enough into my career to have a comfortable amount of savings and not all the energy of a 22 year-old, so I'm not willing to take an insanely demanding job with crazy hours and stress. No money is worth that to me anymore.So, where do I go from here? I'd been keen to hear from others who have moved from \"normal\" jobs toward these high-TC jobs after 10+ years in the field.",

        "content": "Man, I’m feeling cooked and shitting bricks and could use some real talk. I’ve never been so stressed until now. Been at a bank since Aug 2020 right out of college. Spent \\~4.5 years as a Data Warehouse Dev/Architect doing architecture, pipelines, ETL, querying, reporting — stuff I’m actually good at.In March 2025 I internally transferred into an Observability platform role to upskill and mainly cus I was underpaid on my old role. I was very upfront in interviews(with my manager, tech lead and architect) that I didn’t have deep experience in their tech stack, but they still hired me cus they liked me and gave me \\~30% base bump.Before applying I spoke to my skip and I was told I’d be doing architecture, data onboarding, detection/alerting, reporting, optimization. Reality: it’s a ton of platform admin + production fire-fighting. Constant ops, constant pressure, and not what I naturally thrive in.The team lives in reactive mode. Seniors help when I ask, but they’re overloaded, so real mentorship barely exists. I still get work done, but the environments are complex and full of dependencies outside my control, so some stories roll across sprints. I even took the training courses they recommended when I joined, and somehow that annoyed the scrum master because it slowed delivery.Year-end review came back Meets/Meets, but here’s the kicker: my current manager is retiring and the scrum master becomes my new manager. That’s what’s making me lose sleep. His feedback: deliver faster, work more independently, stop leaning on seniors, pick up “harder” tasks, no multi-sprint rollovers. He literally called some of my work “protective tasks” and said anyone should be able to pick up any story.Had a recent 1:1 two days ago where scrum master(new manager)he basically said, “Now that you’ll be reporting to me, I have expectations.” Faster output, constant upskilling, more ownership. None of that is crazy, but the tone felt like a spotlight got turned on me overnight. I’m the only junior internal hire on the team and I already feel the difference in how he treats contractors vs me. It feels less like coaching and more like evaluation.Honestly? It feels like the early stages of a PIP setup: watch closely, raise the bar, document gaps, then decide.The problem is also fit. Long term, I don’t want to be a platform admin or ops firefighter. I’m way better at architecture, data pipelines, analytics engineering, ETL, and strategy. This role is draining me mentally and killing my confidence.So now I feel like the clock started and I got 6 months until mid year.On one hand, I can grind, overdeliver, and try to survive under the new manager. On the other, I should probably start aggressively interviewing and pivot back into data engineering / warehouse roles before this turns ugly.The area of solace I have is I’ve got financial runway if shit hits the fan (have $710k NW) but I don’t want to waste months proving myself in a role I don’t even want.1)How do you tell if stricter expectations are normal vs quiet PIP prep?2)If you sense the clock started, do you grind harder or job hunt immediately?3)Anyone here move from platform/ops back into DE/warehouse successfully?4)What would you actually do if you were me?Appreciate any real answers.TL;DR: Internal transfer into observability platform role turned into ops/admin + firefighting. New manager coming in, raising expectations, feels like spotlight/PIP risk. Role mismatch + stress. Grind to survive or start interviewing now?YOE: 5.5Age: 27Salary: $145kNW: $710k",

He’s apparently a “AI leader” but he has no technical background, no relevant degrees or experience just years in leadership and now an AI thought leader. I get properly unclear expectations and vague asks. If I ask for further information, I’m being told “we’ve already discussed that” or shot down and acting as if I’m causing trouble. He has a vision of a business wide dashboard and has asked me to deliver it asap. He wants me to produce a power bi dashboard with all visuals without giving me access to any datasets or business reports. I’ve pushed back and said I can make a mockup using test data but it needs business information to be robust and viable. I might think of datasets the business doesn’t have access to etc. He refused and said I need to outline the datasets first. I need to list all the data I need, he will then go and ask for the data. But he’s the one who wants this data, I’m not the one driving this, it’s his vision. Whilst I’m used to driving projects and working with ambiguity, he wants essentially a super dashboard and is judging me on the outcome with giving no direction other than “business wide”. To me, it’s not the done thing to produce the visualisation before the data gathering and development phase. Anyone dealt with similar before? I’m just thinking there’s no way I could deliver something that meets his expectations.",

They don’t actually reflect skill levels, and hiring managers tend not to actually care about them once the interview process begins.* View B: They’re a measure of general competency and a candidate’s willingness to put in effort to learn. They’re a tiebreaker when other qualifications are roughly equivalent.For people who have experience hiring or interviewing software engineers:* Do AWS/Azure/GCP certifications actually factor into your hiring decisions at all?* What level of career progression do you think certifications become irrelevant to hiring or consideration, or do they remain relevant no matter what?* Have you seen any correlation between certification holders’ performance on the job?* If you had two candidates that were comparable in terms of experience, would a cert ever be the deciding factor?I’m not asking if certs are a good tool for learning.

My recommendation is to pick a general engineering one and a more niche technical one (e.g. SHPE + Robotics or NSBE + Cybersecurity)> **Note**: If you attend school online or your school does not have active clubs, you still need to network with people in person. Look for local tech meetups for your chosen programming language, tech stack, or the local makerspace. Pick 2 and show up often and be active* Pick 1 programming language and follow an in-depth tutorial or book such as Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, or a Learn GO with Tests* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Make a resume and a LinkedIn profile## Freshman -> Sophomore Summer* Get a part-time job, anything will do* Practice more for your chosen programming language## Sophomore Year* Be more active in the same 1 - 2 club(s). Join event committees, help setup at events and show up frequently to events. Aim for a leadership position when elections are next held* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile. By the end of sophomore year you should have on your resume: a part-time job, some relevant coursework, 1-3 programming languages and some technologies, and active participation in a student organization* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely (slacks, a dress shirt and dress shoes can be had at Walmart). Take 5 - 10 printed copies of your resume with you and make it your goal to hand out all of them to recruiters. The point is to get accustomed to talking to professionals## Sophomore -> Junior Summer* If you got an internship, congratulations you are ahead of the curve. If not get a part-time job, anything will do* Fill in gaps as necessary (Git, SQL, basic cloud stuff, HTML & CSS, Unix CLI, basic networking)* By now you should have taken a Data Structures and Algorithms class. Time to start LeetCode. You don't have to go too crazy if you are consistent. Pick 2 days a week for ~1 hr: * **Day 1**: Watch an instructional video, attempt a problem, watch the solution video, then write the code for the solution * **Day 2**: Attempt a problem (30 mins for Easy, 45 mins for Medium, 1 hr for Hard). If you can't solve it in time, watch the solution video, then write the code for the solution. If you have more time, attempt another problem * **Repeat**: Continue with Day 2 until you run out of problems on a topic. Then start again on the next topic from Day 1 Check out NeetCode 250 for a list of problems organized by type, ordered from least to most difficult, with solutions## Junior Year* Be active in the same 1 - 2 club(s), hopefully this time in a leadership position. Try to get a leadership position during officer elections* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects. Take resumes and be dressed decently (clean shirt and pants with no holes). Recruiters sometimes do interviews* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile. Make sure to have a professional headshot. Obtain 500 connections by the end of the year. Add folks in you classes, in your student orgs, and at hackathons* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely. Take 10 - 30 printed copies of your resume with you and make it your goal to hand out all of them to recruiters. You NEED an internship this upcoming summer* If you have the money, go to a national conference so you can try to get an internship (e.g. SHPE, NSBE, Grace Hopper, WICSE, IEEE, etc). Dress nicely, take resumes, add people on LinkedIn* Start looking for internships in August. The goal is to get out 2+ applications out EVERY day. Don't just apply in your city, apply nationally## Junior -> Senior Summer* Do your internship and do it well. Dress nicely, ask questions, do your best work, add folks on LinkedIn. You are trying to get a return offer## Senior Year * Be active in the same 1 - 2 club(s). If you already had 1+ leadership positions feel free to take a break this year if you like. If you have not gotten a leadership position and you have not had 1+ internships you NEED to have a leadership position senior year* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects.

They hired me as a solo developer to manage 4 different projects. There is no other technical person in the company. One of the projects specifically is a mess. The way it was built wasn't very robust. The previous developer used a bunch of technologies that they were not familiar with, and it's very messy. I was not aware of the state of this project when they hired me. It took me about a month to get set up because there was no one to onboard me; I basically had to figure everything out on my own, and there were some really niche things about the system that weren't documented properly. Actually, their entire documentation is a mess and not very helpful. It also took like 3 weeks for them to give me access to everything I needed.I've been stuck on a few issues for months, and it's driving me insane. These issues are direct symptoms of how the system was built. Initially, the system worked fine, but the way it was built is now causing a bunch of long-term problems to arise. I'm trying my best, but as soon as I fix one thing, another issue pops up. My boss and our clients don't really understand this, and they basically blame me for everything. I feel so overwhelmed right now. I've been trying my best, but I feel like it's not good enough. I've been working through nights and on weekends to try to resolve these issues, but it's like an endless cycle because more issues keep popping up. They also want me to do a full QA assessment every time I test, and that takes time.I've tried to explain to my boss that I'm just one person and that there is only so much I can do, but he doesn't care. They basically want me to do the job of an entire team while paying me below average for what a developer makes. I also mentioned to my boss that we should hire another developer or a consultant to help with the workload, and he told me that in order to do that, they would have to cut my salary by at least 45%. By their logic, they hired me to do a job, and if I need extra help to do that job, then it's going to have to come out of my pay. I'm trying my very best, but they make me feel like I'm incompetent and that I'm not even trying at all. They told me that I should be able to do this and more. I am actually questioning my skills right now. I don't know if I'm just a bad developer or if I'm being gaslighted by them.",

It means that you need either a git worktree or having multiple directories for the same repo, each with code for a different feature. Needless to say, that's very hard to manage! I tried it with two directories and I got lost, forgot which directory had what, push it all on the same branch and had to fix is later. It only made me slower and tired. Yet leadership expectations is that each engineers runs TEN! agents at once.At the stand up today I was expected to work and finish three tasks at the same time and I just can't do it. My brain doesn't work like that. I forget about the first agent when I start interacting with the second one.It's sad really, that they're taking an amazing thing that has so much potential and it should be fun to learn, and ruining by this greedy, ruthless mindset. And it's a \"do it or leave\" kind of situation.In the meantime everybody else is pushing branch after branch with four parallels agents like it's nothing.

        "content": "So, I graduated about a year and a half ago, coming up on 2 years now. Trying to break into the CS job market has felt like a complete anomaly to me. For the first while I was putting out applications left and right, though I have admittedly slowed down and tried making fewer but more tailored applications. This strategy has at least lead to a few interviews, even making it to second stage interviews. Alas though, still ending in rejection.In the meantime I have managed to get a job at a local place with benefits and worked my way up in the past few years. While the pay isn't great and doesn't pay nearly enough to move out of my parents house, its enough income that I can afford car bills and paying chunks off of my (relatively small) student loans. Thank god for scholarships.The root of my problem though is that I'm losing motivation in the job hunt, I feel like I didn't truly understand what I was getting into going in CS. Originally I started college for Phys/Astro which was something I was extremely passionate about. Unfortunately I faced serious burnout in my courses and dealt with a pretty rough episode of depression coming fresh out of the COVID era. While I was able to keep up a nice GPA I was absolutely miserable. Then I discovered programming for the first time through some of my courses!I finally found a new thing that I was passionate about and enjoyed doing, I love math, I love applying concepts learned in tangible ways and programming felt like that to me. Sadly though I didn't really understand the scope of what I was getting into, I just saw the fun new things I was learning because learning has always been one of my favorite things to do. Now I'm sat here just having turned 25 last week with absolutely no idea what to do next. I've had to move a bit over an hour from my girlfriend and friends because I can't afford to live in the area I consider home anymore. I've considered pivoting to something new but attending \\*more\\* school really just isn't in the cards for me at the moment besides potentially some night classes at my local community college. Even then I'm not sure what I'd pivot too and I don't want to do the blind rush into something like I did last time since that's what got me into this mess. Many of my favorite things that I believe I would enjoy as a career don't pay nearly enough to live comfortably with the economy (US) being what it is right now and things don't appear to be changing positively.I guess my question then is just, where do I even go from here? I feel like there are both 100 directions and absolutely none. I'm sitting in a dead end hole that I dug in the middle of an open field with no clear way out.",

Wanted to hear anyones thoughts on if I should do anything or just leave it.Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions - sent a nice note to the recruiter, figured I don't have much to lose, really only gain if he can sympathize but likely won't change anything.

I want to try and get into a senior role is there any hope of this?What can I do to get myself to a level where I can get a job to match the amount of years I have spent?I am feeling very lost and would like some guidance.",

Did you feel like or know that the product you were building was unique/special early on?If not - did you just suck up a toxic work environment or an unclear future path and essentially hope for/not care for the best?I say this as an engineer inside a small startup where the prevailing work culture is toxic, management nonexistent and I just don’t see the vision for the product we are building. Well the ambition is there but the execution is not. Politically it’s not a battle I want to take on as the levels of kool aid drinking and groupthink are astounding. Others have privately expressed their concerns but nobody wants to speak out due to the cult like atmosphere. This however makes me sometimes feel like I’m just being negative and not visionary enough.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "To not make it extremely long yet also consice enough...I'm a recent CS major graduate, and I managed to land a role very shortly after graduation (aka. zero actual work experience) as a \"game dev intern\" at a software company (they're not a game studio, they're mainly vehicle-oriented), basically making them a simulation for cars.The internship is 6 months, and during these months, I'd been working on my own in this project, with the only additional help is just insight from my supervisor, but other than that, I built everything myself from the ground up.Now I'm mainly a game developer, just regular Unity/Unreal stuff, with some knowledge with graphics APIs like OpenGL and DirectX, but that's pretty much it. On the job however, the actual \"game dev\" part is like 40%, maybe 35% of the project. The rest is system configurations on platforms, bash scripting, networking and front-end, and recently robotics too. All of that was not only way outside my main working field, but also no one else in the team is able to help me with the project.About two months ago, deadlines started approaching, and with them, much more pressure and extremely long days, especially since I, as an intern, was responsible for this project that should be presented at some big \"conferences\". And of course, wouldn't you expect it (even though I'd have loved achieving it and being proud of it), I failed every single deadline. Too many moving parts of it and with the typical managers' requests, made me even more burnt out. The \"internship\" is 5 days/40 hours a week, full on site, with no options for days off. And more than once, I had to (not by my choice, but it did sort of help once) go on weekends to catch up.Eventually, about a month ago, I reached a state of burnout where I'm simply not even doing the bare minimum of a job to not get fired anymore, I couldn't be bothered. Even though the job pays so well at this level, the pressure made me terrified of staying any longer at the company.Am I right to feel that way or do I need to \"toughen up\"?Edit: I forgot to mention, we have paid access to AI agents so they handle all the heavy duty I barely write code myself anymore. But still, even with them, it's become quite exhausting working like a senior yet being an intern.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, just wanted to get a feel for the current job market for cleared SWE roles.A little background: I have a BSCS from a state school and a MSCS from Georgia Tech (OMSCS program). I’ve got about \\~3 years of experience, and I’ve been working as a full stack developer on a DoD project, so I do have an active security clearance (secret level).I started as a campus hire making $65k for this big defense consulting company, and after a few raises I’m at $79k now. No bonus though (my company doesn’t pay bonuses at my current level, which is some BS...). Also no promotion so far as they keep saying the market is bad, even though the company used to promote campus hires within 2 years just a few years before. I’ve been basically fully remote the whole time, which has been the best part about this job honestly.But yeah… things are getting worse. They’ve been slowly cutting people, and now they just eliminated our entire team (the project is going to end some time in February), so we’re basically being told we need to find other projects internally. I’m definitely not quitting without something lined up, and I’ve already started sending my internal resume to other teams inside the company. But at the same time, I feel like I should start looking outside too since i feel i can get paid more if i switch jobs...So I’m curious, how’s the cleared job market right now? I’m currently living in a MCOL city, and I’m willing to relocate if the company offers relocation assistance. I know the job market overall is pretty rough right now. Any advice would be appreciated.",

A week or so and occasionally long weekends. But the effects are just temporary and then I get back to same place.What do I do? How did you deal with such situation if you faced in the past?",

        "content": "For context, I finally got an offer from a company that’s a bit smaller, but the compensation is decent and the work is solid for learning a lot at the beginning of my career. That said though, I have to give an answer to them within the next day two days. I’m also in the running for another company that’s relatively larger, would teach me a lot, and most importantly would start me at about 15-20k more base than the first company. The issue is I’ve done 3 interviews with them but would still need to do another in-person and I’m almost certain they won’t give me offer before the deadline for the other offer. With how the economy is right now, declining the first offer and hoping the other one comes through is simply off the table, I have to take the guaranteed offer right now no matter what. That said though, if the other company does come through say a week down the line, I would hate to have to decline the materially better offer due to some unfortunate timing. My question is, would it be acceptable to accept my first offer and then potentially rescind my acceptance a week or two later if I do get a better offer from the second company? I would ideally like to not burn any bridges, but the company is smaller so I’m sure it would impact them a little more. Of course, that would also mean it wouldn’t be the end of the world if I can’t work with them anymore since it’s not a big company with a lot of potential job openings anyways. I’m just not familiar with this area, and I’m not sure if this is like unheard of or potentially career-threatening later down the line. I do understand this is all assuming I get the job for the other company which may not happen anyways, but I wanted to be prepared just in case. This is all unfamiliar territory for me, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

Or is there something else I should be preparing that people don't talk about as much?Also, with AI becoming such a huge thing in our industry, I'm curious:* How do you think hiring processes will change in the next few years?* Are there any additional skills or areas we should be focusing on now?* Is the traditional interview prep still going to be relevant, or should we be adapting?I'm asking not just for myself but hoping this discussion can help others in the community too.

For someone without professional ML experience, what realistically qualifies a candidate for AI/ML-focused roles? Is targeting ML-adjacent backend roles (data pipelines, model serving, infra) a more practical first step than pure ML roles?2. Are there beginner-friendly learning paths that hiring managers actually respect? In particular, are Google’s free AI/ML courses ([https://grow.google/ai/](https://grow.google/ai/)) useful as a foundation, or are they generally too high-level to matter in interviews?3. What types of side projects best demonstrate readiness for applied ML or GenAI roles? For example, end-to-end ML systems, LLM integration (RAG, evaluation, fine-tuning), or ML infrastructure work.I’m looking for a realistic path that builds on a backend background.

I don't see how this can be finished in 5 weeks but the business teams are saying if it's not done, the angular PRD app will have to go down due to it no longer being compatible with a require update. The reason we were told last minute is because there was a list of affected apps for a change and this app originally was on it but it got removing during some handover and they only realised now it's affected.I'm feeling really overwhelmed with the deadline and stressed that it will reflect poorly on me as I just joined the team recently.",

I have:\\- Placement on a 4-year part-time Comp Sci & Ai Degree at Birkbeck University starting in October, attending 2 x 6-9pm classes a week from Mon - Fri **(Shows my long-term commitment and dedication to the field)**\\- CompTIA A+ I am studying for and expect to be finished by the end of March **(Shows basic aptitudes and foundations of IT)**\\- Home labs and projects to be uploaded to GitHub, as I am doing some independent learning on KodeKloud by end of April **(Shows independent drive and examples of self-study)**\\- 8 years working in hospitality management, 9 months as an account exec. in an advertising agency, and 2.5 years working as a freelance graphic and web designer creating assets for small clients, independents and hospitality venues **(Strong soft skills and proof of continuous working attitude)**I have always had a love of technical problem-solving because of my strong sense of step-by-step analytical thinking (which I sometimes attribute to my heavy OCD). I've always tried to create a strong sense of structure and organisation within systems in whatever role I've been working in, regardless of the industry, and found myself being drawn to IT/Tech because of the way my brain works and enjoys the nature of work.Eventually, I'd love to move into Cloud/DevOps and be responsible for the stability of networks within an organisation, and after my degree, I'd like to pursue an Integrated Machine Learning Systems Master's at UCL to expand my knowledge and skills to move into MLOps at some point in the future. Hoping to make a meaningful contribution to an industry where my mind seems to be suited for possibly becoming an innovator in the field, or assisting teams with making major advancements in Machine Learning in an Engineering role, possibly even with embodied Ai when robotics begins to become more prevalent in society from 2030 onwards.I possess a strong sense of emotional intelligence, the ability to present and communicate with stakeholders in non-technical terms, and a proven ability to work with and effectively manage teams of others. These traits are proven in my previous work experience as a freelance designer and my years in hospitality management, working in some of the top venues in London.Some questions:What should I avoid doing? What can I highlight from my candidate profile? Is there anything else I should do to strengthen my profile? Is this enough for me to apply for entry-level IT jobs in help desk or other role? What kind of salary can I expect to receive in my first role? I had a minimum bar of 26k, but would ideally like to get 28k+ How would progression look over the next 3 years as I self-study and study for my part-time degree",

Basically to sum it up, I just graduated with a bachelors in CS with a focus on video games, but my curriculum was very disappointing and barely actually focused on game development. I didn’t get a single internship throughout my entire experience in university because the vast majority of them were for cybersecurity students and none of them were related to what I wanted to be doing. My classes also burned me out on coding and made me lose my passion for it. Now I’m at a point where I’m still burnt out and I’m lost on what I should do for a career. I’m hesitant to try to break into the game industry right now because I know it’s competitive and very underpaid, so I’m considering working on my own indie game on the side while doing something else as my main job.The problem is I don’t know what to do as a main job now that satisfies my creativity, doesn’t hurt my brain, and pays enough to make a living off of. I’m thinking about something like web development or UI/UX design but I’m not sure if those fields are too competitive (or being too easily replaced) to be worth it. I’m someone with an eye for visual design and I also have skills in digital art, but I feel like I’m not at a point with my art where I think it’s professional enough and I don’t have any kind of professional portfolio yet.And yes I know I probably should have been working on side projects to build a portfolio while still in university, but I was burnt out constantly by my classes and didn’t recover from that burnout even during breaks. Maybe that’s a sign of a bigger issue, I don’t know. I do know I suffer from perfectionism that prevents me from starting things, even things I want to do.Any advice, tips, or insight would be appreciated. I want to move forward and get “unstuck” so I can properly start my adult life.I’m in the U.S. by the way if that’s relevant, in a very rural area, not a big city.",

However, lately I've been interested in learning full stack development (I have always been a backend dev at big tech / unicorn, never did front-end or built e2e apps), so I would love to learn some front-end and start building out my own projects. At the same time there is a big push for understanding AI / ML (not just deployment MLOps but actually understanding model architecture). RAG and all that stuff I can conceptually understand but I feel its more valuable to build projects with RAG, vector databases, running local models on limited hardware, etc. I know that Google/Meta/Anthropic/JS/etc is my primary goal so I feel that I need to focus on LC / Sys Design first before worrying about anything else. But I haven't shaken the feeling the more time I spend on that, the more behind I am on actual skills - Full stack, AI, etc. and frankly I have more interest in full stack dev AI stuff than I do on LC, but I know LC is needed to get the job I want.",

        "content": "To give a background of my career, I have a bachelors in computer engineering and worked as a web developer at a consulting firm for 10 years. I later completed a masters in information management so I was exposed to governance, project management, IS systems and so on.I worked mainly in dotnet, have scratched the surface of DevOps and Azure at work, I've done a bit of hybrid developer/product owner at my last company.However, even with some interviews for product owner, I haven't gotten an offer. I only get offers for web dev, basically.I feel like my window of opportunity for a career change is passing buy, and I still haven't explored that many areas that I can say with confidence \"I love this thing and I'd do it forever!\". I also feel due to not loving web dev, I haven't became as proficient as I should be, and so the offers I get are lacking salary wise.I am totally open to emigrating. That being said, I don't know if I should keep trying for product owner, solutions architect, try do a cybersecurity course, if I should go all in on DevOps and Cloud.I anyone could help me, maybe with the right questions, figure out what would be a good carrer path for me, that would be great.My ambition is to actually do something that I'll want to improve at every day and eventually get a good salary.I'm based in southern europe, btw.Thank you",

Am i hopeless? is my best case scenario working for minimum wage in the middle of nowhere creating websites for pet groomers? i am truly passionate about programming and digital infrastructure, since i was a child, but it kinda feels like the bridge to the life i want is crumbling. im fully willing to put work in on my own time over my time in college, if thats what it takes to actually DO something instead of pretending i can just get a job once i have a degree, but how much time do i even have to improve my skills?? all my life to others i've been \"the computer guy\" but i want that to ACTUALLY be my thing, something i can be vastly knowledgeable in and have no time for anything else. not just being above average",

        "author": "Princess-Nene",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm doing an internship right now at a small start-up doing full-stack web development. I didn't realize this when I applied but I'm really the only dev there. There's one senior dev who meets with me once a week for about half an hour and reviews my PRs. I appreciate all his help, but other than him answering any questions I have during the weekly meeting, I don't really get much guidance or direction because everyone else there is in business roles. Sometimes I don't know how to meet their expectations because they expect something to be done in a week but with my inexperience both in general and with their codebase, it takes me much longer, especially because I'm also given other tasks like editing videos or writing reports for clients. I've been working here for 5 months now and for the past month I've been tackling performance issues with our company's software. The overseas team uses the software to produce the actual product each day and since before I joined the company it's been really slow and sometimes unresponsive. It took me some time to even learn how to approach the problem but I've been trying to optimize queries to improve the performance but even if one aspect improves, a new issue pops up somehow. The overseas team seems to think the new issues are due to the code I wrote breaking something, and don't seem to really believe me when I try to explain that it's due to resource limits. Today I was told to make a presentation for this weeks' board meeting on what I've done so far in the past few months because apparently the overseas team has been saying I \"haven't really done anything\". I'm worried that I'll be criticized when I present because I've only finished one feature and a few bug fixes, and the past few weeks I've been working on the MongoDB stuff which hasn't really shown results, so my presentation is going to be kind of unimpressive. I'm not sure what to think because this is my first job and I have nothing to compare to. Is this amount normal for an intern or should I have been achieving more?",

        "title": "Web dev freelancers, your tech stack doesn’t matter at the start",
        "author": "OkMetal220",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "When I started as a freelance web developer, I thought the language or framework I used would make or break my chances of landing clients. I quickly learned that none of that matters at the beginning. Clients don’t care if you’re using Django, React, WordPress, or a page builder, they care if your work actually solves THEIR problem. And that mindset shift changed everything for me.Most beginners focus on tech... “Which framework should I learn?” “What looks more professional?” “What will make my portfolio shine?” But the reality is that your clients are thinking in pain points, not code. They notice when their website doesn’t bring leads, when people leave too fast, or when it looks unprofessional. If you approach your projects solving problems first, the tech becomes secondary. That’s exactly where your focus should be.There’s so much more to learn early on than programming itself. Understanding website structure, UI and usability, conversion principles, performance, and even SEO matters far more than writing perfect code. A simple example is the navbar. It doesn’t matter if you build it from scratch or use a drag-and-drop tool. What matters is knowing what its goal is, why elements go where they go, and how it influences user behavior. That’s what actually delivers value to clients.Many new developers feel like using WP or another simpler platform is “lesser work.” That’s only true if you forget your goal. Freelance web development is about outcomes, not code. Clients want results, and if a WP site or a simple landing page solves their problem faster, cheaper, and more reliably than a custom stack, they’ll be happier. Your job is to focus on real solutions, not trends.As your freelance career grows, you’ll eventually take on bigger, more complex projects that require custom code or advanced frameworks. But starting simple accelerates your growth. You ship faster, gain experience solving client problems, build confidence, and gather references without being bogged down in unnecessary complexity. Personally, I built over 20 WP sites across different niches before moving to Django, then layered React later. Starting small didn’t hold me back, it gave me a foundation.At the start of your freelance journey, the tech stack is never the bottleneck. Understanding the client’s problem is. Choose tools that let you ship quickly, learn continuously, and deliver real value. Stacks/trends will change but the ability to solve real problems is what will carry your freelance career forward.",
