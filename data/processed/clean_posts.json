What I can’t get from blogs or job postings is real, current, hands-on experience, so I’d love to hear from people who are currently working (or have recently worked) in either role: how has your job actually changed over the last 1–2 years, do the expectations match how the role is advertised, which role feels more stable and valued inside companies, and if you were starting today, would you choose the same path again?

We've got way more servers than we need and we're keeping data for 30 days when most of it gets used in the first few hours, basically everything is over provisioned.I've tried to bring up optimizing this like 5 times and everyone just says \"what if we need that capacity later\" or \"what if something breaks when we change it\". Meanwhile, we're losing money on servers that barely do anything most of the time. I finally convinced them to add gravitee to at least get visibility into what we're actually using and it confirmed what I suspected, we're wasting so much capacity. The funniest part of it is we started using kafka for pretty simple stuff like sending notifications between services and now it's this massive thing nobody wants to touchAnyone else dealing with this? Big kafka setup is such an overkill for what a lot of teams need but once you have it you're stuck with it",

May be I can do an MBA which opens wide variety of domain and opportunities for me and may be I can do more of a consulting role ?2. Or may be learn more new technologies and skills to add in my CV and move to a lead data engineer role . But again this still means I will have to do a coding. Don't think this will give me exposure to business side of things. Could you please suggest what should I consider as my next steps so that I can achieve a career transition effectively?",

After a couple of years of self-teaching (programming, SQL, data fundamentals) and some freelancing, I landed a role about a year ago in a large company (hundreds of millions in revenue).When I joined, there was zero data culture. No team, no processes, just a lot of manual work and fragmented info. My official title is \"Data Manager\", but since I’m building the function from scratch, I’ve been doing a bit of everything:* Automation & ETL: Writing Python scripts and using Power Automate to kill manual tasks.* Infrastructure: Designing and building business-oriented databases from the ground up.* BI/Visualization: Creating the first actual dashboards.* Optimization: Cleaning up the \"Excel Wild West\" and setting common data policies.My question: Imposter syndrome aside, I’m struggling to map this experience to the actual market. I love the \"ideation\" and architecture part—designing the pipelines, thinking through the data flows, and making things work automatically. But I sometimes worry I’m doing a lot of useful things, but not building a clean and recognizable profile.\\- What term would you use to describe this type of role? I'm not sure if I'm closer to data engineering or analytics...\\- Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?\\- What would you discover next if you were in my shoes? I want to switch from band-aid solutions to more reliable, scalable procedures. At this point, what would you learn first: DBT, cloud architecture, orchestration tools like Airflow, or something else?My current stack is Python, SQL, Power BI, Power Automate, and some legacy VBA.I genuinely love this job—it's a world away from my previous life in humanities—but I want to make sure I’m steering the ship in the right direction. And again, thanks for waste your time reading me.",

It's like simply asking the question puts the responsibility back on the business and if we don't ask they can just point fingers. They're the only ones interfacing with management so of course they spin everything as the engineers fault when things go wrong. This is what bothers me the most, if anyone bothered to actually look the failure is painfully obvious. Now I simply push shit out with a smile and no one questions it. The one time they did question something I tried to recreate their total and came up with a different number, they dropped it instead of having the conversation. Knowing that this is how most metrics are created makes me wonder what the hell is keeping things on track? Is this why we just have to print and print at the government level and inflate the wealth gap? Because we're too scared to ask the tough questions?",

I wonder if we are too vested into Snowflake and would like to understand pros/cons from the community. The majority of the processing and transformations are done in Snowflake. I anticipate we deal with 5TB of data when we add up all the raw sources we pull today.Quick overview of inputs/outputs:EL with minor transformations like appending a timestamp or converting from csv to json. This is done with AWS Fargate running a batch job daily and pulling from the raw sources. Data is written to raw tables within a schema in Snowflake, dedicated to be the 'stage'. But we aren't using internal or external stages.When it hits the raw tables, we call it Bronze. We use Snowflake streams and tasks to ingest and process data into Silver tables. Task has logic to do transformations.From there, we generate Snowflake views scoped to our customers. Generally views are created to meet usecases or limit the access.Majority of our customers are BI users that use either tableau or power bi. We have some app teams that pull from us but not as common as BI teams.I have seen teams not use any snowflake features and just handle all transformations outside of snowflake. But idk if I can truly do a medallion architecture model if not all stages of data sit in Snowflake. Cost is probably an obvious concern. Wonder if alternatives will generate more savings.Thanks in advance and curious to see responses.",

I thought this would allow me to keep the main DB disconnected at all times and instead, attach the working as a reading and auditing platform. Then, any data that needed to re-integrate with main, I'd run a promote script between the two. This all sounded good in theory until I realized that I can't attach either while there's a lock on it.I'd love any suggestions for DuckDB integrations that may solve this problem, features I'm not privy to, or alternatives to DuckDB that I can easily migrate my database over to.Thanks in advance!",

        "author": "Groove-Theory",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Long ass post sorry. Skip to the bottom for the TL;DR questions if you don't want the backstory.**# Backstory:Howdy... not entirely sure this is the right subreddit for this (between here and the BI sub) but figured I'd start here.Ok so... I'm a tech lead for our engineers working on our core product in a startup. I am NOT on the data engineering or BI side of things, but my involvement in BI matters is growing, and this is me sanity-checking what I see.Our data stack is I think ok for a startup. We source our data, which is mostly our main Postgres DB plus with a few other third party tracking sources, with 5X into our staging tables in BigQuery. Then we use dbt to bucket our data into dimensions, fact tables, and what are called \"reporting tables\" which are the highest 1-to-1 tables that are used in whatever presentation layer we use (which is Looker). Our ingestion/bootstrap logic all exists in a GitHub repo.This entire system was originally designed and put together by a very experienced senior data engineer when we were in a scaling phase. Unfortunately, they were laid-off some time ago cuz of runway issues before they could completely finish everything. Since that time, our management has continually pushed for additional and additional reporting, but we haven’t replaced that position. And it's getting worse.Today, we have ONE business analyst (not on the eng team) with no tech skills, having learned SQL basics from ChatGPT. They create reports as best as they can, but idk how correct they are in querying stuff from the BI layer (frankly I don't care tbh, not the eng team's concern)Anyway, the business comes to us with a regular set of new reporting requirements for tables, but many of these do not make sense. At all.For example: *\"I’d like a list of all cars, but also like a column for how much spaghetti people eat per day, and then a column of every fish in the sea, and we need a dashboard for the fish-spaghetti-car metric per month \"*. That kind of bullshitSince we still have a reduced team post-layoffs, product management has started working on sprint stories for any product improvement we do such as *“Create a reporting table for the spaghetti bullshit above\"* despite the underlying data structure being ambiguous or incorrect (and not being a spaghetti company). Which I think is pretty fucking weird that they're telling us what the actual implementation should be.We, as software engineers, are comfortable designing application schemas and writing database queries against Postgres (and the PG layer is well formed imo). We, however, are not professionals in business intelligence, and we are facing more and more questions about dimensional design, report structure, which are questions we feel uncomfortable answering.The most aggravating part of this process is the business will attempt almost anything rather than considering adding another senior BI or data engineering person to the staff. They have attempted to draw general engineering talent into doing business intelligence tasks when that isn’t their technical niche. They have attempted to use short-term or lower-quality consultants. Many times, they have simply pressed onward with what we understand to be an iffy model.Increasingly I spend my time fighting off requests against our team or explaining to others why some of those requests are simply nonsensical (in a polite manner of course) but I feel I'm slowly losing that fight over time, and my head of Product/Eng is not helping me here.I always knew the business was crazy when just dealing with product AC, but I've realized they really go fucking bonkers when you talk to them about anything related to a dashboard.# My questions to ya'll*(skip to here if you didn't want to read my sob story above)*My questions are about whether we have a common concept of \"good\" data modeling and who really is responsible. The engineering department is picking up all of this slack, and BI isn’t really our expertise. So...* When is the time for the BI/data modeling necessarily a full-time endeavor and not something that should be accomplished as part of the product engineering team, if at all? Are there any heuristics that you have observed for smaller startups?* Is there ever value in planning or building \"bad\" or ugly reporting tables to meet current business requirements, or is it almost always harmful?* If leadership wants speed and they do not have data modeling knowledge, what data governance patterns work well for you?* How do you communicate concepts of dimensional modeling to non-technical business audiences in a way that leads to lasting behavior change? (If at all lol)* Finally, if leadership is flatly unwilling to engage experienced BI/DE talent, then what is the least worst alternative you've encountered?I'm way outside my lane here as a non-DE so any advice is greatly appreciated.

The area I feel most out of date on is **system design/data architecture rounds**.For those who’ve gone through recent DE rounds in the last year or two:* In system design rounds, are they expecting a **tool-specific design** (Snowflake, BigQuery, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, etc.), or is it better to start with a **vendor-agnostic architecture** and layer tools later?* How deep do you usually go? High-level flow + tradeoffs, or do they expect concrete decisions around storage formats, orchestration patterns, SLAs, backfills, data quality, cost controls, etc.?* Do they prefer to lean more toward “design a data platform” or “design a specific pipeline/use case” in your experience?I’m trying to calibrate how much time to spend refreshing specific tools vs practicing generalized design thinking and tradeoff discussions.

        "content": "Hi everyone,I am a data analyst currently tasked with building a data warehouse for my company. I would say I have a basic understanding of data warehousing and my python and SQL skills are beginner to mid level. I will mainly be learning on the job, but seeing as my company provide free coursera licenses, I figured I could use it and get some structured learning as well to complement my on-the-job learning. Currently I am deciding between IBM’s data engineering specialization and Joe Reis’s Deeplearning Ai data engineering 4-course series. I have heard negative things about IBM’s course but also that it could be good as an overview if you’re a beginner. Seeing as I would have no mentor (I am the only analyst there and the only person there to even know what data warehousing and dimensional modeling is), what I ideally want is a course that will inform me on best practices and any tradeoffs and edge cases I should consider. My organization is pretty cost sensitive and not very mature analytics wise, so in general, I really wanna avoid just following trends (e.g. using expensive tools that my org doesn’t necessarily need at this stage) and doing anything that would add technical debt. Any advice is welcome, thank you!",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I've been building [SevenDB](https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB), for most of this year and I wanted to share what we’re working on and get genuine feedback from people who are interested in databases and distributed systems.*Sevendb is a distributed cache with pub/sub capabilities and configurable fsync.*# What problem we’re trying to solveA lot of modern applications need \\*\\*live data\\*\\*:* dashboards that should update instantly* tickers and feeds* systems reacting to rapidly changing stateToday, most systems handle this by **polling-** clients repeatedly asking the database “*has**this changed yet?*”. That wastes CPU, bandwidth, and introduces latency and complexity.Triggers do help a lot here , but as soon as multiple machine and low latency applications enter , they get diceyscaling databases horizontally introduces another set of problems:* nondeterministic behavior under failures* subtle bugs during retries, reconnects, crashes, and leader changes* difficulty reasoning about correctnessSevenDB is our attempt to tackle both of these issues together.# What SevenDB doesAt a high level, SevenDB is:**1. Reactive by design**Instead of clients polling, clients can \\*subscribe\\* to values or queries.When the underlying data changes, updates are pushed automatically.Think:\\* “Tell me whenever this value changes” instead of \"polling every few milliseconds\"This reduces wasted work(compute , network and even latency) and makes real-time systems simpler and cheaper to run.**2. Deterministic execution**The same sequence of logical operations always produces the same state.Why this matters:* crash recovery becomes predictable* retries don’t cause weird edge cases* multi-replica behavior stays consistent* bugs become reproducible instead of probabilistic nightmaresWe explicitly test determinism by running randomized workloads hundreds of times across scenarios like:* crash before send / after send* reconnects (OK, stale, invalid)* WAL rotation and pruning\\* 3-node replica symmetry with electionsIf behavior diverges, that’s a bug.\\*\\*3. Raft-based replication\\*\\*We use Raft for consensus and replication, but layer deterministic execution on top so that replicas don’t just \\*agree\\*—they behave identically.The goal is to make distributed behavior boring and predictable.# Interesting partWe're an in-memory KV store , One of the fun challenges in SevenDB was making emissions fully deterministic. We do that by pushing them into the state machine itself. No async “surprises,” no node deciding to emit something on its own. If the Raft log commits the command, the state machine produces the exact same emission on every node. Determinism by construction.But this compromises speed significantly , so what we do to get the best of both worlds is:On the durability side: a SET is considered successful only after the Raft cluster commits it—meaning it’s replicated into the in-memory WAL buffers of a quorum. Not necessarily flushed to disk when the client sees “OK.”Why keep it like this? Because we’re taking a deliberate bet that plays extremely well in practice:• **Redundancy buys durability** In Raft mode, our real durability is replication. Once a command is in the memory of a majority, you can lose a minority of nodes and the data is still intact. The chance of most of your cluster dying before a disk flush happens is tiny in realistic deployments.• **Fsync is the throughput killer** Physical disk syncs (fsync) are orders slower than memory or network replication. Forcing the leader to fsync every write would tank performance. I prototyped batching and timed windows, and they helped—but not enough to justify making fsync part of the hot path. (There is a durable flag planned: if a client appends durable to a SET, it will wait for disk flush. Still experimental.)• **Disk issues shouldn’t stall a cluster** If one node's storage is slow or semi-dying, synchronous fsyncs would make the whole system crawl. By relying on quorum-memory replication, the cluster stays healthy as long as most nodes are healthy.So the tradeoff is small: yes, there’s a narrow window where a simultaneous majority crash could lose in-flight commands. But the payoff is huge: predictable performance, high availability, and a deterministic state machine where emissions behave exactly the same on every node.In distributed systems, you often bet on the failure mode you’re willing to accept.

Then have a secondary glue job that reads new parquet files and writes them to Iceberg tables. This can be done every 2 mins? Can I setup something like a microbatch glue job approach here for this? What I don't like about this is there are two components here and there is a batch/polling approach to check for changes and write to Iceberg. Glue streaming - Glue streaming job that reads the kafka topics then directly writes to Iceberg. A lot more boilerplate code compared to the configuration code above. Also not near real time, job needs to be scheduled. Need to see how to handle failures more visibly. While near real time would be ideal, 2-3 mins delay is ok for landing in bronze. Ordering is important. The same data also will need to be cleaned for insertion in silver tables, transformed and loaded via rest apis to another service (hopefully in another 2-3 mins). Also thinking to handle idempotency in the silver layer or does that need to be handled in bronze?One thing to consider also is compaction optimizations. Our data lands in parquet in \\~100 kb size with many small files per hour (\\~100-200 files in each hourly partition dir). Should I be setting my partition differently?

This seemed like a perfect use case for Iceberg. Iceberg does let you evolve the table schema, including adding a column. BUT you can only add a column with a default value. If I want to fill in that column with annotations, ICEBERG MAKES ME REWRITE EVERY ROW. So despite being based on parquet, a column-oriented format, I need to re-write the entire source text data (gigabytes of data) just to add \\~1mb of annotations. This feels wildly inefficient.I considered just storing the column in its own table and then joining them. This does work but the joins are annoying to work with, and I suspect query engines do not optimize well a \"join on row\\_number\" operation.I've been exploring using little-known features of parquet like the file\\_path field to store column data in external files. But literally zero parquet clients support this.I'm running out of ideas for how to work with this data efficiently.

Using my experience and lessons learned from manually flatten countless dataframes I have created this package. It works pretty well in my situation but I would love to hear some feedback from others (lonely warrior at work).

Working for FAANG has always been a dream for me, to get that exposure and I like working in fast-paced projects. My current project is very slow paced and the work culture is becoming so toxic. I really spent a lot of time learning new things outside of my 9-5 to stay relevant in the current era like building AI applications (RAG, MCP servers, etc ). Implemented the same in my current role, making other engineers life easy and simple. All my energy currrently goes into explaining things I've learnt outside to my peers and my bosses with minimal to zero recognition. I want to change jobs and move to any new company that would challenge me and pays well. With all my life being a Data engineer ( well versed with Python and SQL languages very minimal exposure to DSA in my work), What opportunities I should be exploring and how should I go about it ? I am a tech lead in my current role and if for FAANG companies what should I be applying? I dont have any mentors in my professional life, hence posting here. Thanks in-advance",

For one example we are very dependant on running a nightly batch process involving a bit of transactional type of data (10\\~20k datasets) that get transfered between systems over a tunnel. The batch process is basically a C# ConsoleApplication that gets scheduled by windows task scheduler. We are working on the customers environment so we don't have much of a choice here. There were multiple times where the process simply did not run for no apparent reason. What I would like to do is to use the task schedulers function of \"retrying\" the task in case of a failure for multiple times. The issues are most often resolved by just restarting the application. However task scheduler does not seem to be able to really \"read\" a task as failed even if I am returning error codes other than 0x0. Does anyone know how to fix this or are there alternatives which can handle these type of problems much better? The main issue is that this process needs to run and in any case of problems we often had to monitor it really early in the morning and restart it by hand which is stupidly annoying.",

I have some previous experience with Python and plan on quickly up-skilling and implementing as much as I can within my current role through automation, using AWS SDK etc as well as making projects in my own time. My current role now involves managing Aurora as part of it, there’s also ‘ownership of data’ and everything that brings amongst our AWS deployments.I guess my current role is transitioning away from standard DBA things though I want to make more deliberate movements towards data engineering largely for financial reasons. I’m currently on about £75k, I have no plans to move at the moment but with the job market things can change and tomorrow my company could decide I am no longer needed. I’d like to do what I can to be in a position where I could pivot if needed without taking too much of a hit salary wise.Obviously I’ve not given too much information, but can you give an idea of the skills I ought to prioritise, things to focus on etc based on the above and if possible given an idea as to how well versed I need to be with them. e.g. with AWS is it a case of simply using EKS, MKS and being able to write functional python code or does it need to be super performant. Also is it realistic and achievable to pivot from DBA to Data Engineer on a salary of around £75k without too much of a reduction or am I being unrealistic?",

The idea is that some of our operators should be able to check things like how much revenue they’ve generated this month, how many clients they’ve converted, etc.As you can imagine, we’re currently discussing the best way to bring Data Warehouse data back into the app. So far, for our first use case, we’ve built a data microservice that queries tables containing the KPIs. In this setup, the Data Warehouse almost acts like an API, providing the data that the dev team can then display on the frontend with full control over colors, layout, and whatever custom UX our designers come up with.However, looking ahead, we plan to add many more charts to the product. This made me wonder whether there are already solid embedded analytics tools that allow a high level of customization so the look and feel can match our app’s design patterns. On top of that, it seems much easier for a data team to develop and test a dashboard and then embed or share it inside the app, rather than producing multiple KPI tables and wiring all of that through the app’s backend.I’d be interested to hear how others have approached this and what tools or architectures have worked well for you.",

        "content": "I developed the python app named TidyBit. It is a File Organizer app. Few weeks ago i posted about it and received good feedback. I made improvements to the app and released new version. The app is now available to download from Microsoft store and Linux Snap store.**What My Project Does:**TidyBit is a File Organizer app. It helps organize messy collection of files in folders such as Downloads, Desktop or from External drives. The app identifies each file type and assigns a category. It groups files with same category and total file count in each category then displays that information in main UI. It creates category folders in desired location and moves files to their category folders.*The best part is: The File Organization is Fully Customizable.*This is one of the important feedback that i got. The previous version didn't have this feature. In this latest version, in app settings, there are file organization rules.The app comes with commonly used file types and file categories as rules. These rules define what files to identify and how to organize them. The predefined rules are fully customizable.Add new rules, modify or delete existing rules. Customize the rules how you want. In case you want to reset the rules to defaults, an option is available in settings.**Target Audience:**The app is intended to be used by everyone. TidyBit is a desktop utility tool.**Comparison:**Most other file organizer apps are not user-friendly. Most of them are decorated scripts or paid apps. TidyBit is a cross-platform open-source app. The source code is available on GitHub. For people who worry about security, TidyBit app is available on Microsoft Store and Linux Snap store. The app is also available to download as an executable file for windows and portable Linux App Image format on GitHub releases.Check the app: [TidyBit Github Repository](https://github.com/Veda-Swaroop/TidyBit)",

Academically, I’m not smart. I was generally a B-student back in CS college. But I did enjoy SWE mods like networks, distributed systems, or even learning algorithms. Over the past 3 years, my job has been rather chill and I don’t read outside of work. I didn’t learn much while doing frontend for 2 years - my code looks more or less the same because frontend frameworks are very abstracted at my company.Now that I’m in my 3rd year without promotion, I’ve been looking for jobs. I’m terrible at Leetcode, not good at systems design, my problem-solving skills aren’t great either so I’ve been failing interviews here and there. Sometimes I get frontend interviews, which will test JavaScript or React or even HTML/CSS, where each language/framework has a lot of concepts to learn about. I feel that there’s endless to study for and I’m fighting against a bar that is high but I can’t even see where it is.It’s been demoralising. I’ve moved into a backend team and I’m struggling hard. I have a difficult time grasping backend concepts, navigating backend code and understanding architectural designs. I’m lost 70% of the time during my team’s discussions. Everyone else is more senior than me, but they seem to know way more - it feels like that probably knew more than me when they were at 3 YOE. I have a difficult time visualising architectures or technical things when they’re discussing. I learn better when I dive into the code to build something. But it is inherently poor practise to dive into coding without understanding the requirements or the architecture or code itself, which causes me issues down the road. I think my lack of knowledge shows when I implement without understanding the full picture, but I have a difficult time following discussions.As an engineer, I only like to code. I like it when requirements are clear. I don’t like the ambiguity of having to dig around and define the requirements or scoping problems. I only like to build stuff and see my product coming to life and working.I think I should be studying harder for Leetcode, Systems design, and read more on whatever frameworks I’m using. But now I feel so exhausted just by the thought of studying. It feels endless. I feel that I’m a terrible engineer and that I’m paying the price of not working hard for the past few years.",

The most recent one that happened was react and javascript (I'm doing Software Engineering). I understand why it wouldn't be taught in a Software Engineering degree, but every programmer out there seems to understand it regardless.So I'm now just wondering how much will I actually learn in college and how much do I actually need to learn myself to be competent at least.",

I’d be targeting internal roles like QA/test automation, internal tools, ops, data/reporting, or technical support engineer, & not junior SWE or webdev as a starting point.Given age, AI, and market saturation, is this still a realistic approach, or is the degree mostly a time sink at this point?

I search up the answer and it's another dead end like restart ur whole computer or something. kms. Like why is the barrier of entry so high? Am I supposed to reverse engineer the whole program just to make a cube bounce? I've been programming since I was 11 years old, I can't even make a functional game at this point.

        "content": "I have been in that place, scrolling infinitely looking for the best (if that even exist) project to learn/upskill/get hired/whatever, but today I have finally understood why people advice: \"Find something that interest you\". I understand the pressure of been unemployed, undergrad or still learning and wanting to build something that becomes the key to getting out of that situation.I’m fortunate to have a job that combines IT support and some backend work. While it’s not as difficult as other situations, I still want to keep improving to reach better roles. And I’ve been there too. Day after day trying to figure out what to build to improve, and even so I believe the previous advice still applies.So, what is that project that interest me so much and made me change my mind? Just a self-hosting e-book library. Sorry if I disappointed someone (I'm not). I got a Kindle a few weeks ago and since I also like home-labs and self-hosting I looked for an app, but every one feels like artificial and not personal, and as a book lover, I want my library to feel personal, something that I truly own, so I decided to build one.You may think, what can an e-book library teach? Well, is not about the specific case of my app, but more of the concept/problem itself that needs to be implemented or solved that can be applied for many contexts. For example: what if an user have 5000 books? How should I store the covers vs basic metadata (cache vs database)? How can I process all that books in seconds (concurrency & parallelism to improve performance)? How can I avoid the rate limits of an external api? How do I keep the database in sync if the user manually deletes a file? What if I implement an internal ddbb back up tool? Can I pass all the books from kindle to the library directly?And even if I knew about some of that questions before, applying it yourself will always teach you more that just theory.Some people will think that thinking about all that stuff early in the project may be over-engineering, but who cares, is your project you can do whatever you can with it according to your objectives, not someone else ideas. So thanks to everyone who has always given that advice, and for those who are in the situation I mentioned, it’s better to build a project that seems simple on the surface, but where you really dive deep than creating something that looks good on paper but you’re not invested in.",

But about six months ago, I gave it another shot and started grinding through the exercises.I recently finished the first three chapters, and it honestly blew my mind. It gave me a whole new perspective on programming. But here's the catch: before the book, I wrote spaghetti code that \"just worked.\" Now... I’m painfully aware that I’m writing garbage, but I don't know where to start fixing it. (Honestly, I want to fire myself after realizing how terrible my code is.)That's the problem. I feel like I've studied how to build the tools, but **in my current role**, I’m just expected to use them blindly.

Like I think I know the majority of \"basic\" html (things like h1 tags, sections, etc), but I want to get more into using frameworks and things like FlexBox, React etc to make a better website. However when I go to say a tutorial on FlexBox I feel like I am missing something from the basic section, but when I go to the basic section I feel like I am either skipping around a lot or switching off and not paying attention to the tutorial cause brain goes \"yup know that\"Does anyone have any suggestions?**Edit:** Coming back to this post after reading the comments, I will take them all in consideration (*minus \"Scrimbassador\" lmao*). I have also been dwelling a little on this post as well while reading the comments and I think another main issue is CSS/Design work, I have never been good at this since I started coding *(which was HTML and CSS in Highschool)* as, like most forms of creative expression, I always have an image in my head but unable to put it \"on paper\" so I think a lot of this might be tripping me up as well...",

Not impossible and I like the memory safety things.**- Use C#:** good documentation and toolchain but maybe I will feel I want something lower.Do you have any advice about what would give me the best experience? What about other paths? I don't want to rush and I will do it in my free time.**P.S.:** before telling me to do things, I've been doing little programs these days, mostly with rust and I made a webpage with react.**TLDR:** for someone with basic knowledge of programming that is interested in animations using libraries, simulations, gui apps, engines, etc., which of the languages do you think will bring me the best experience?

I want to choose C or C++ over python. What I've found looking at a lot C++ vs Python first questions on this reddit is that, Python makes it easier to pick up programming in general, but if you're willing to take the harder start then it's way more beneficial to your long term understanding of coding to learn C/C++ first because your brain solidifies good traits that are really hard to relearn from python.If any one has any comments on this specific parity that'd be cool. The formatting of Python also seems to be a cheat that isn't as healthy as having your base reference in C/C++'s symbolic referencing over indentation.My real question because it does seem C style is better for long term than python first and I intend to learn both, is it best to learn C or C++? It appears C and Python are around the same learning time and C++ is way longer than learning C. Should I do C first then Python to get the benefits of understanding C style code with Python's greater utility and universal usage, or should I tough it out and do C++ , which I guess is extended C, then Python? So essentially my perspective is C is much shorter and faster to learn, but C++ has much more use case, despite the fact they both equally prime you for more \"close to the metal\" thought than high abstract languages like python, what's more worth it first?Thank youTLDR; I think the first impression and perspective solidifying advantages of C and C++ beats the ease of introduction with Python for first language, thoughts?

        "author": "spunky_crunk",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm trying to understand why I can pass arrays into functions by declaring a pointer parameter. I've done this several times to pass arrays of different lengths into general purpose functions (along with their lengths) for software that I've written, but although I thought I had a grasp on the inner workings, I've found I'm unable to fully explain what's going on.Here's my understanding, using a simple example. #include using std::cout; float averageScores(float* scores, int length) {     float sum;         for (int i=0; i<length; i++)     {         sum = sum + scores[i];     }     float average = sum/length;     return average; } int main() {     float testScores [] = {81.2, 90, 91.8, 76.3, 78.4};     int numScores = sizeof(testScores)/sizeof(testScores[0]);     float classAverage = averageScores(testScores, numScores);     cout<<classAverage;     return 0; } Might not be the most efficient way to do this but you get the idea. What I've done is passed an array of test scores into a function that calculates their average. However, to my understanding, when I declare an array variable, it's actually interpreted as something like &testScores\\[0\\], or the memory location of the first float variable in testScores. First question: the entire array is stored at that memory location, correct? So if the memory location is something like 0x5ffe60, that's where the entire array is stored?Now, in my function I have declared the parameters float\\* scores and int length. float\\* scores is a pointer. So, this to me seems like creating a pointer to a memory address, similar to the classic example folks usually show when discussing pointers:int x = 6; int \\*pX = \\&x;Where pX is a pointer to the memory location at which the value of x is stored. So, similarly, it seems that float \\*scores = &testScores\\[0\\].Now, my ultimate question: given that C++ is particular about variable types matching, does this mean that &x and &testScores\\[0\\] are \"pointer types?\" Like, \\* and & are just inverses of the same variable type, and that's why I can write a function that expects a pointer and pass it a memory address.So both \\*scores and &testScores\\[0\\] are float\\* numbers? I think I'm missing something because my explanation feels inconsistent. If anyone could clarify what I have right and wrong about this, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

I’m looking for some serious advice on how to push myself forward when I feel like I’m stuck at a standstill. To give you some context: I’ve never considered myself a natural at tech. I didn’t do any advanced prep before starting my degree, and honestly, I struggled through my first year. I managed to pass, but looking back, I realize I was just surviving, not actually learning.This year, due to personal circumstances, I had to switch to online classes. It’s been a disaster for my learning style. My professor primarily uploads modules and assessments without live sessions, leaving me to teach myself through YouTube and documentation. Here is the predicament: In trying to teach myself, I realized I’ve forgotten a lot from my first year. Even the most basic concepts have slipped away. I’ve decided to \"start from scratch\" while still trying to keep up with my current 2nd year workload. I’m currently grinding through Java learning strings, characters, loops, and operators while simultaneously staring down a mountain of Networking and SQL coursework including C++ and other programming languages that we’ve studied in my first year that I have to run through again, I feel completely overwhelmed. My progress feels incredibly slow. I see others online who seem to grasp these concepts effortlessly, and I can’t help but feel a deep sense of envy and doubt. I’m questioning if I’m even making progress or if I’m just not cut out for this. I’m not planning on changing my course I genuinely want to be good at this but the anxiety that I’ll never \"get it\" is starting to take over. I know going back to face-to-face classes eventually will help, but I also know that won't fix the fact that I'm currently starting from zero.Has anyone else felt like they were \"starting over\" in the middle of their degree? How do you deal with the slow progress and the feeling that you'll never catch up?I’d really appreciate any advice on how to manage this workload or how to change my mindset so I can stop feeling like a failure.",

My main issue is how we learn stuff and the testing model. In classes like Calculus, electronics, or physics, you can add more, it feels like we just memorize algorithms to solve questions. I can learn the 'why' from external sources, for example books or Prof.Leonard for calculus but at uni, if you solve 100 past years questions or questions from books, you still can get a good grade, without truly knowing the material. This means that you cannot solve a different kind of problem that involves the integral that you learned 1 week ago and passed the exam, because you didn't understand what you doing, just memorize algorithm.I have many friends, even when they got a good grade, they still lack an understanding. I don't want to be same but what's point? Am I right to feel this way or I'm being ignorant? Sorry for long post and bad english.**TL;DR:** University exams feel like testing memorized solution patterns rather than deep conceptual understanding.

        "content": "Hello everyone! Been lurking around, haven't posted though.I've been wondering about my career and its direction for about a year at least and I felt that's it would be good to share and ask for advice and opinions.Some background.I'm a programmer with about ten years of experience. I come from a math background. Never completed my uni studies but I was fortunate enough to build somegood foundations that helped a ton in programming. Programming for me was also my only hobby for most of the last decade. Read many books, tried many tools and languages. Had tons of fun on many late nights home.Recent two years the excitement dropped off and I've been enjoying non programing stuff a lot. I've organically ended up doing team lead/tech lead stuff for the last five years and I've accustomed to that. My job is primarily reviewing, mentoring, planning and estimating effort.Due to the recent advancements in AI I've started feeling the heat. It seems to me that much of the toolset that used to make us competent as programmers is fading away. Now, as a team lead/tech lead I feel that I do a good job exactly because I've spent so many hours fiddling with stuff from many different angles. But in the age of AI I have much less consifidence in my ability to reasons about those genai system that I think we'll be dealing with in the upcoming years.I've tried to move to areas of game development and design, graphics programming but I gave up after a while. I did not feel the urge to pursue and do what it takes to jump to another field. Right now I'm asked to design systems based on AI which, I don't feel equipped to do.And even though I know that I'm through a burnout for about three years now, I appreciatey job. I appreciate how it has transformed my life and I've seen able to do and own things I never would have if I did not spend so much time studying cs and programming. This is why I decided to create a self made curriculum of data science, machine learning, deep learning and finally genai in order get myself familiarize with those concepts. This is something that's I evaluate to take at least a year. I think that if I am to continue managing development teams and since I seems to a place in our toolset, I think it makes sense. I feel it would boost my abilities and therefore my confidence in order to continue doing a good job.I don't feel like I'm going to definitely lose my job to AI. But I feel like that if I don't expand my knowledge in any way, I leave it to chance. I don't know if I'm maybe too pessimistic about this, but my gut call is saying that it's to re evaluate some things and it's time to be proactive again.Thought I'd share with you, I expect that many might have somewhat similar thoughts, with all this ai madness going around constantly. Would really like to read your experiences and point of view.",

I've tried pro sports, making music, running a photography business, content creation, landscaping, serving, along with a ton of other things to which I've had varying success in.But nothing really seems to give satisfaction like programming, now I'm new to programming, I only really have been \"doing\" it since like the last few months.Two main things I've coded.\\- A league of legends cool down app (it basically tracks when an enemy uses key spells in the game, the tracking is manual you have to tap the button to start it)\\- A program that trains a specific skill in League of Legends called kiting, which is basically clicking your mouse fast in a specific sequence.I think the fun part of programming is you can just make things, it's like Lego but you have no limits and growing up I always loved Lego.Another aspect I like is while I am very good at content creation, I've had close to 500 million views on social media from content I've made. Content creation doesn't really scratch the same itch.It's like with content creation you make things that people watch but how impactful is that? Half of the stuff we watch we don't even remember ....but with coding you make things that people USE.And that's what I think is so cool.Part of me worries that because I'm bad at math I'll never really \"get\" programming, I also worry I'm not smart enough for it...but I enjoy it.Anyway I don't know if this post is something that people will love, or not, but I just wanted to share it. It's late here, 4am and I've been really struggling last few days with figuring out what I enjoy.I've been trying to be a \"content creator\" for the last few weeks, and while I'm really good at it, I don't think I enjoy it. It feels really fake and tbh, a large portion of content out there is entirely fake anyway.I still don't really understand where I fit in with life, but I like the idea of making stuff people use and I see myself for the next while making programs or apps that solve simple problems in peoples lives.

My background isn't technical although I work for a software company where people are nice and usually happy to answer noob questions when they have the time. Over the years, I have learned some basics: Very basic Java and C++, what logic gates are, been messing around with Arduino, breadboards and chips, binary numbers, algebra and a bit of precalculus. But whatever information I have gathered seem pretty trivial and overall I feel like I don't \"get it\".Recently someone recommended that I start from the basics again and just focus on one gate per month before I go any further: write the truth table, the HDL description for that gate, and what the gate is made of (for example an OR gate is two NOT and one NAND gates) every day of the month and then do the same for the next gate the following month, until I have covered all the gates. The goal being that this becomes \"automatic\" for me.I am 38 and want to learn out of interest/hobby although part of me is secretly hoping to either make a bit of money with it in the future or even a new career. But I'm not in a rush and willing to take the time to make sure I understand what I'm doing.What's your take on the recommendation that was given to me? If you don't agree, what would be your strategy if you were me?Thanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to read and/or answer!",

Yet business leaders just don’t get it and still cling to that philosophy as “something that works”, so they can save a buck.It’s called hiring a night shift, people. If you’re going to take on customers with 24/7 operations, guess what that means for your overhead? Yup, you’re going to have to pay to staff your company to be able to handle 24/7 operations, not just expect your day shift people to handle it all at night and still come in and work a full shift the next day on fumes. Hire an IRC and set it up. Staff it with good technical people. Expecting day shift people to be machines and handle night shift stuff with barely any extra pay or using “duties as assigned” as your excuse not to pay extra for it, is the fastest way to lose staff and lose your company and end up drowning in lawsuits.If you’re gonna refuse to do that, then you better be prepared to pay out the nose to your day shift folks to expect them to wake up in the middle of the night or interrupt a family moment to fix someone’s stupidity. Stop cheaping out and expecting not to have to pay extra for it, then whining about turnover.",

I was hired as a mid-level React developer, and have seen the team grow and shrink. We got acquired last year and now I am the only person in my team with a couple of outsourced devs.Naturally, due to people leaving, I have been promoted to lead but I am hardly able to concentrate or produce any work. I am just cruising on the work of others and I feel like I have lost all interest, or forgotten everything I have learnt. My motivation is dead, every day I am on some calls, fix some small bugs and do some PR reviews which also I rarely read through.I thought it was burnout and took a 2 weeks break, but came back to the same empty feeling that I am just existing at this place, the joy I had when I first joined is dead.It's a nice remote job, they pay on time and given the market right now, I am in a pretty comfortable position. I have tried interviewing at other places in hopes that maybe a new environment will help me, but I rarely prepare for them either, which means I fail them constantly then just stop giving anything a shot. Add to the fact that coding agents are quickly catching on, some days I just use it to do my work, I feel like a fraud and don't know if I should continue down this path, or try to learn something new, maybe some other stack or completely distance myself from programming.Has anyone been in similar situations?

I know it is better career growth and I would learn more than if I was at Bloomberg which is why I am considering it, but would love any advice from people at Bloomberg or know in general about the company. Sage maker is pretty secure no one gets affected from lay offs but thats just in the present, BB is known for way better security. Also should I still do the meta interviews which seems to be a long process and I am pretty happy with aws/bb or google if it happens. Also heard meta isnt the most secure. Thanks a lot in advance!",

With it being only a year since I had gone through this whole thing I felt a lot more prepared and I think it shows in the numbers.A few clarifying points about my labels:* \"Reached out to my network\" was me reaching out to anybody I had interacted with previously including co-workers, recruiters I had worked with before, and actually the offer I turned down last year. The company that gave me the offer I turned down last year met with me but they didn't have anything open and it didn't go beyond that.* \"AI agent applied for me\": I used several AI services to find and apply for jobs on my behalf. These were Jobhire AI, Wobo AI, and Sonara. I didn't count all of the applications they sent out for me because the vast majority of them were ignored. I estimate that it was approximately 200 applications that got sent out by these. I could make another post on my thoughts on these, but to sum it up, Jobhire was absolute trash, Wobo wasn't much better, and Sonara was worth the price in my mind. Overall the AI agents got me interviews with 3 companies, 2 of which proceeded to the final round (1 rejected me and the other I withdrew after accepting another offer).* \"Withdrew after accepting other offer\": This means that I withdrew from interviews before getting an offer from the place I was interviewing with because I had already accepted a different offer. If a company made me an offer, that got counted with the \"Declined\" label after \"Offer\".I've got 13 years of experience with two FAANGs and a FAANG+ on my resume and my specialization for most of that has been in developer tools and infrastructure. System design questions are still my weakest point, and I'm hoping that this next role will help me with more practical hands-on experience that I can use in the future for those problems.My offers:Series A Startup | Series B Startup | Axon-------------------|--------------------|------accepted | declined | declined$205k base | $200k base | $188k baseno bonus | 15% bonus | 10% bonusOptions | Options | $160k RSUs over two years with 1 year cliff (+ refreshers)2-3 days hybrid | 2-3 days hybrid | 4 days mandatory in office Tue-FriSome quick stats from the Sankey:* Acceptance rate from manual applications: 11% (11/100)* Pass rate for initial rounds: 64% (9/14 - not counting ones I withdrew from)* Pass rate for final rounds: 60% (3/5 - not counting ones I withdrew from) - this is a personal best for me. I'm not sure if the 4 companies I withdrew from would have been a similar success rate, but I'm happy with it.* Nearly half the recruiters that messaged me first were for shitty contracting gigs even though I indicated on LinkedIn that I was not interested in those. Ironically at least 10 of those were third party recruiters that wanted to put me right back in at Meta doing almost exactly what I was doing before ... hmm ...* A huge percentage of companies I interviewed with (maybe 85%?) had \"AI\" in their name and almost every company I talked to emphasized how they were incorporating AI in their product or process. The startup I accepted an offer from is the type of company that is selling shovels during this AI gold rush.Overall this search only lasted two months. I hit the ground running as soon as I got laid off from Meta and I had accepted an offer before 60 days had passed. So much better than last year!",

I’ve thought about quitting but looking at the job market it seems very difficult right now. My old work friend quit and it’s been 6 months and he hasn’t found a job yet. Honestly I’ve just been waiting about getting laid off now. The only thing that is keeping me there is the lunch friends I made with others not on my team but the rest of the company has gone to shit. I keep thinking I’ll get fired tomorrow. I had an old work friend who got laid off and they just shut off his work laptop. They didn’t even tell him anything. I’ve just been checking my Workphone in case I got fired or not. Should I just quit or should I wait until I get laid off while applying to new companies? I haven’t gotten any new interviews lately so it’ll be difficult",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I'm soon to become one of those \"unemployed CS majors\" everyone keeps talking about once I graduate. I've been struggling to find meaningful employment, and don't have a job lined up. The way things are currently heading, after graduation I'm likely just heading back to my mom's house and maybe working some shitty retail job with 0 upward mobility. This is a future some people (including some friends) from my high school have achieved without attending college, and if that's my future, it means my mom will have wasted 4 years on an expensive degree that ended up being worthless.I'm well aware that it only gets harder and harder to find a full-time job the longer you wait after graduating. Which is why I'm frightened of being jobless or underemployed once that happens, and then having an awkward gap in my resume to have to explain, which only gets more and more awkward the longer I wait.The roles I've been applying to include SWE, data analysis, data engineer, and data science. While my undergraduate internship grinds have been very hit-or-miss, I have some \"roundabout\" experience (multiple unpaid internships + paid research) on my resume, some of it ongoing (and my performance there has been satisfactory), which I've been told is enough to land me interviews, which I have. It's just that I've been struggling to pass these interviews. I've known people who've managed to hand-wave themselves in through interviews just by talking a bit, but I've somehow failed even one of those when given one (though that was partially my fault since my reference waved me through without even giving me the JD).My clear metric for \"success\" is having enough money to *be able to* move away from home and afford a non-shitty apartment if I wanted to (and in the event I don't, it'll be because the job is in my metro area, aka NYC). If I don't achieve this, I'll have failed. I wouldn't say I'm asking for much, and I feel like this is a quite reasonably low bar to clear, and if I don't clear it, I'm a failure.Now that it's Christmas already and I still don't have any kind of post-college offer in hand, things are not looking up. I've barely applied to any positions between Thanksgiving and Christmas and have secured 0 new interviews therein. I barely even grind Leetcode anymore, since it just makes me disappointed whenever I fail questions that are supposedly \"Easy\" or \"Medium\". If you gave me a Leetcode-style interview or OA right now, I'd probably fail it. I've yet to actually receive such an *interview* (OAs I have, with mixed performance), but I'm well aware that many companies do ask them. A lot of what I've failed so far is behavioral, though I've passed a few.I've received mixed messaging on whether to consider grad school. My parents aren't going to pay for it and I'll have to take out expensive loans if I do go for it. And I know cheap online programs like OMSCS exist, but I don't know if they're right or if it'll be too challenging, and I'm not even sure if it's something I'm seriously invested in either. The whole field just seems like a sinking ship with AI and all, and people seem to be right about there being no need to hire any more juniors.I just want to know what to do, because things seem absolutely grim, and people who've been through 2008 keep calling me entitled and telling me that the job market now isn't nearly as bad as 2008. Keep doing what I'm doing and hope something lands? But if nothing lands, what then? Certmaxx and pivot to IT? Push boxes in some Amazon warehouse alongside people without college degrees, rendering the degree worthless?",

I do ask questions to Claude but just basic syntax questions that I could just google but I never ask it to actually write code for me and copy paste it.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m a first-year CS student, and honestly, the job market has been stressing me out. Between tech layoffs, market saturation, and the rapid rise of AI, it’s hard not to feel anxious about the future of this field.Luckily, I’m still a freshman, so if shifting to another degree would truly offer better job security and a more stable income, I wouldn’t hesitate to consider it.Don’t get me wrong: I genuinely love tech. I can see myself studying and working in this field long-term because of how vast and interesting it is. But we also can’t deny reality: the industry feels oversaturated, entry-level roles are extremely competitive, and the barrier to entry is relatively low. Anyone who self-studies can technically enter the field (even if they don’t have the same depth as someone who studied CS formally), and that definitely affects competition.So my question is this:If you were in college right now, still studying CS and not yet graduated, would you consider shifting to a traditional engineering degree instead?I’m talking about fields like:Electrical EngineeringElectronics EngineeringMechanical EngineeringCivil EngineeringDo these degrees actually offer better long-term job security compared to CS today? Or is the grass just greener on the other side?PS: I know some people will say, “If you’re doubting CS, then it’s not for you,” or that those who truly grind will succeed—or that this is just a way to reduce competition. That’s not my intent. I’m just trying to be realistic and pragmatic. I still see myself pursuing CS, but I want honest perspectives before it’s too late to pivot.Would really appreciate your thoughts.",

I have an education and basic proficiency in software engineering, but I’ve spent the last 10+ years working in transportation and diesel mechanic environments. In that space, a lot of workflows are still very manual, handling breakdowns over the phone, outdated desktop software, poor coordination between dispatch, mechanics, and drivers. From the outside, it feels like there are real opportunities for software to improve productivity in industries that aren’t “tech-native.”I have an app idea based on problems I’ve personally dealt with, but it’s too ambitious for me to realistically build alone. In theory, it seems like teaming up with a few other engineers (2–4 people) to build something useful could be a better use of time than waiting for interviews that may never come.What I’m trying to understand is why doesn’t this happen more often? Why do so many people, especially those trying to break into tech, stick to LeetCode, personal projects, and the job application grind instead of collaborating to build products that solve real problems and potentially create their own jobs?TL;DR:As someone trying to break into tech, I don’t understand why more people keep grinding interviews instead of teaming up to build software that solves real problems in non-tech industries and potentially creates their own jobs?",

My current role is on a product that is going through some changes next year, and I don't have much faith in the leadership or direction they're going with it. I'd like to find a new job but I can barely even get an interview.I had two interviews in the summer (which I got via one referral and one recruiter reaching out to me). Both went multiple rounds before I got a rejection notice. Apart from that I've been getting zero interest putting in between 5-20 apps a week, mostly for mid level SWE positions that are a close or exact match for the tech stack that I've been working in these last 5 years (Spring/React/AWS). All I ever get are rejection emails. Is the field really that saturated? I thought it would become easier to get my foot in the door and at least speak to real people about my experience once I hit the 5 year experience mark but it's not. I feel like I'm getting even less response than when I was applying for new grad jobs 5 years ago. My school isn't prestigious and neither are the companies I've worked for (a couple non-tech industry fortune 500s and some government contract work).Anyway I just needed to vent.... Anyone else having this experience? I'm not sure what else I can do to make myself stand out from the apparently massive crowd of software engineers that are also looking for a new job.",

But using total compensation numbers to hire, then removing a major component post-joining, is at best misleading and at worst a deliberate bait-and-switch.This has nothing to do with:Performance Role change Level changeIt’s purely a policy change that benefits the company at the expense of employees who already joined.Posting this for visibility because these “global alignment” narratives are increasingly being used to quietly roll back compensation after offers are accepted.Has anyone else at Walmart or other big tech seen RSUs removed after joining?Is this becoming the new normal in India under cost-control pushes?Any real leverage employees have in situations like this, or is the offer letter basically meaningless once you join?Sharing for awareness.

I would really like some advice on what to learn and I am really interested in game development but it doesn't have to be what I study since it's kind of like my end game goal and it would be okay for me to start somewhere a little bit shallow. Also, where would you recommend me to look for clients that are looking for c++ programmers just so I could check what they're currently looking for so that I could get some extra ideas.Thanks! TL:DR Any recommendations on what advanced c++ topics should I study to be employed and where to look for clients.",

Especially for the stack I have experience with (Node.js), everything in Houston seems to be .NET. From what I'm seeing on linkedIn, there are like 3x the job postings in Austin as Houston despite having a way smaller population and more jobs that have the tech stack I am familiar with.The only offers I seem to be able to get right now in Houston are typically remote jobs with some sort of significant catch like early-stage startups, or something weird like a company owned by private equity with really bad glass door reviews. Not really looking for that at the moment as I need a bit more stability... and health insurance. I know Austin has been going downhill for the past couple years and lots of jobs are leaving the city, but I'm not sure if it's gotten as bad as Houston yet. I also don't want to move to another city and if it's going downhill, end up somehow being worse than Houston 5 years from now. Thoughts?",

        "content": "I came across a detailed guide shared by people who have cleared ML Engineer interviews at different companies and found it helpful to share. The process varies by company, but the core skills are consistent across big tech and startups.About the ML Engineer Interview Process:ML Engineer interviews typically include 4 to 6 rounds a virtual screen which has coding + ML basics, followed by onsite or virtual loops with coding. Expect 45 to 60 min sessions, often with live coding in a shared doc or whiteboard for design. Companies like Meta and Google emphasize productionizing models, while others focus on specific domains.PREPARATION:● Python is the main language that I use for programming.● Additionally, I am very good at the most common Machine Learning libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Scikit learn, TensorFlow etc.● The basic machine learning concepts are that I know supervised and unsupervised learning methods.● I can evaluate models using several metrics.● I understand overfitting versus underfitting and the relationship between bias and variance.● I also understand the differences between regression and classification models.My preparation was based on these courses:1.) Coursera AI of Everyone/ Deeplearning AI: Machine Learning Engineering for Production by Andrew Ng Concentrates on turning ML systems into real world applications, covering data pipelines, deployment, monitoring, and scaling necessary for ML Engineer positions, putting an emphasis on the real-world systems.2.) Fast ai: Practical Deep Learning A Hands on, code first method to building state of the art models quickly, very good for gaining practical intuition and confidence in implementing deep learning solutions from scratch.3.) Stanford CS229/CS230: Gives rigorous, university level depth in machine learning theory and deep learning that is excellent for the understanding of derivations and advanced topics that may come up in technical discussions.4.) LogicMojo AI & ML Interview Preparation Course: Focused specifically on machine learning interview preparation, with practice problems, ML system design patterns, and commonly asked interview questions. It helps for project development for interviews.MOVING ONTO THE PRACTICE AFTER THEORY:Practice coding without an IDE use Google Docs or plain editor to simulate interviews. Focus on implementing ML algorithms from scratch or debugging production issues.Great platforms for practice:● LeetCode - ML tagged + general coding● Kaggle competitions for end to end projects● [Interviewing.io](http://Interviewing.io) or Pramp for mocksFAQs Asked:1. Basic machine learning2. Model evaluation & metrics3. Feature engineering & selection4. Recommendation systems.5. Convolutional neural networks for vision, normal language transformation transformers for NLP.6. Scaling ML distributed training, data parallelism7. Production issues8. ML system design9. Coding: Implement linear regression, k-means, decision trees from scratch; PyTorch or TF basicsThis GitHub repo on Machine Learning Interviews is a solid checklist covering fundamentals to production topics.DURING THE INTERVIEW ASK YOURSELF:1. Do you feel confident explaining ML concepts clearly?2. Can you clarify problem requirements and ask good questions?3. Are you capable of delineating the whole Machine Learning system by talking about data, features, models, evaluation, deployment, and trade-offs?4. Is your code neat, effective, and without any error?5. Have you thought about real world constraints?6. Can you draw from past projects and experiences effectively?All the best! ML roles are in high demand and consistent practice on projects, mocks, and designs will get you there. If you are targeting specific companies, tailor to their products. Good luck",

And honestly enjoyed all of them but AI the most although I had more of a natural aptitude to networking/security.So taking all that into account I would love some advice or thoughts towards which of these three would be best to work towards in terms of job opportunities, security and career growth, especially (this is a big thing for me) being able to eventually either work remotely or transition to more of a freelancer to have more freedom. Also higher pay wouldn’t hurt. And how best to go about doing this, for example i know that if going down the cybersecurity route I can get some certs such as sec+ or something to improve my chances at getting a job as well as having a deeper knowledge in that area. If you guys have any advice or dos or don’ts for when working towards any of these careers in your personal time, any help would be greatly appreciated.P.S.

        "content": "Hi everyone,I’m looking for some perspective and advice from people who have been in similar situations.I joined a small startup about three months ago as a *full-stack developer*, although in practice I’m doing almost entirely front-end work. The company has been around for about 7 years, ~20 people total, and only 3 developers:* One backend developer* One senior developer who is currently transitioning into a Customer Success role* And meBefore this job, I did a bootcamp and a lot of self-study, but I’m very aware that I’m still junior. I’m learning every day, but there’s a big gap between where I am technically and the level of responsibility and trust they’re giving me.That said, the company has been incredibly supportive so far:* I asked for Frontend Masters access and they approved it* I asked to understand more about the business beyond pure frontend, and they gave me a project building JavaScript automations in Airtable, touching operations, product, inventory, etc.* I asked for regular time with the senior dev to review things together, and that was also approvedFrom a support and trust point of view, I honestly couldn’t ask for more.The company is very product-focused and mainly B2B. They sell hardware and services to other businesses, but they also have a SaaS product. Around 80% of customers actively use it and pay for it, yet there’s no clear long-term SaaS strategy or roadmap. It feels more like “it exists and works” than “this is a core growth engine.”Here’s where my internal conflict starts:* On one hand, I know I’m still junior and should probably focus on fundamentals, shipping solid frontend work, and not overthinking things.* On the other hand, I see a real opportunity here to grow the SaaS side of the business, help shape a more structured software team, and eventually take on more responsibility if things go well.* I’m interested in full-stack and system complexity, not just UI work, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself or become “the guy with ideas but weak execution.”So my questions are mainly:* Is this a good environment for a junior dev to grow, or is the lack of senior technical leadership risky?* How would you balance learning deeply vs stepping up when the company clearly gives you room?* Should I focus narrowly on becoming a very solid frontend engineer first, or is it reasonable to also invest energy in understanding the business and SaaS side early on?* Any red flags or opportunities you see from the outside?I’m genuinely grateful for the chance I’ve been given, but I want to be intentional about how I grow and avoid making preventable mistakes.Thanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to read or respond.",

        "content": "I’m going to college next year and have been having multiple changes of heart regarding my future career prospects and my major. For context, I learned how to program when I was 8, and now I would consider myself a pretty well-accomplished programmer with many great projects to boast. I’m excellent at Rust, C++, C, and JavaScript, and proficient with Java, Python, and other C-like languages. Since ages 8–15 I built multiplayer games, full-stack websites, physics engines, and ECS frameworks, with some projects having thousands of GitHub stars.By 15, I discovered I really liked systems programming and learned theoretical CS topics like OS theory, compiler theory, networking, and embedded programming through open courseware. At 16, I made a dynamic memory allocator that rivals the speed of tcmalloc and jemalloc using a decentralized approach with journals, embedded metadata, and slabs. At 17, I built an ahead-of-time compiler for a Rust-like language with a complete frontend, a robust type checker handling traits and generics, a MIR system with monomorphization, and an LLVM backend generating cross-platform IR.Very recently, I’ve had an intense desire to learn math. I’ve already studied Calc 1–3, linear algebra (Axler is great btw), real analysis (baby rudin, abbott, fitzpatrick), abstract algebra (d&f, aluffi), and category theory, and this interest sharpened after reading Ahlfors' Complex Analysis starting in September, to the point that I'm now seriously considering majoring in it.My mind has been flipping between studying math, CS, double majoring, or minoring in one. Given my extensive programming experience and familiarity with upper-level CS, I feel I’d rather spend college learning something I’m less proficient in (math). Double majoring in Math&CS might make it difficult to take all the math courses I want due to CS requirements, and I dislike entry CS courses like DSA that I likely can’t test out of.I don’t currently have job prospects (they keep changing), but I want to keep SWE jobs as an option after graduation, and I will 100% continue programming and building projects throughout college. If it helps in your consideration, I've been admitted to MIT and will likely commit there, and I might pursue a PhD afterward. My main question is whether majoring in math without a CS major/minor would be bad for SWE jobs given my experience and projects.Edit: I'll be majoring in pure math, not applied math that's nonsense.",

        "author": "ThomasHawl",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I received a fully funded PhD scholarship in Mathematics. Originally, I applied for a PhD in Computer Science, but since the PI is affiliated with both departments, the scholarship was formally offered under Mathematics instead.My main motivation for pursuing a PhD has always been industry research, not academia. I’m particularly interested in roles at places like DeepMind, FAIR, or smaller, niche AI research labs. From what I can tell, these positions typically expect a PhD in CS / ML (or very closely related fields), and a PhD in Mathematics does not seem to be the standard, or even explicitly listed, in most cases.I am not interested in becoming a professor. I see the PhD primarily as a means to access research-oriented industry roles, not as an academic career path in itself.That said, there are several red flags that are making me hesitate:1. The PI is very new. I would be their second PhD student, and the first one is now a postdoc, still in academia.2. The PI has few publications, mostly in mathematics, and a very low h-index.3. The scholarship itself has some worrying conditions: * Internships are not allowed. * If I decide to leave the PhD early, they may require full reimbursement of the scholarship.The internship restriction is especially concerning, since I want to move into industry research and not stay in academia.At this point, the only reasons I still see for going forward are:1. Is it realistically possible to enter big tech / AI research labs without top-tier publications and without internships?2. Gaining research experience and living abroad.3. I genuinely find the research topic very interesting (I can share more details via DM; I’d prefer not to be too identifiable here).One more important piece of context: I am already working as a software engineer, although with a very old tech stack and in a sector I don’t enjoy (defense). Because of this, an alternative plan would be to decline this scholarship, keep working for now, and apply again next year, which realistically might be my last chance, since I’m already 28.Given all this: What would you do in my position? Any advice or perspectives are welcome.",

I’m comfortable with low-latency concepts (OS, architecture) as well (though still learning a lot I enjoy rust and recently enjoying C++ too), so I have a mixed skill set.I’m now reflecting on direction: I’m drawn to QR and QD roles, but QR often requires a PhD.

Can I reapply next year despite rejections this year? I’d appreciate on how to best position myself going forward.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm currently working with a manager who is very senior in our organization, very experienced, intelligent, etc., but he has a few traits that can be challenging. I'd like try o figure out ways to deal with these / overcome rather than give up / leave, for now.I myself am a senior, experienced engineer, we both have decades of experience, relatively successful careers.The challenge with working with him, though, is that its like \\_he\\_ has a difficult time working autonomously. As examples... he'll write a library for some good in principle idea of his, generally with an ambitious and elaborate implementation, a few ok unit tests, etc... then ask me to integrate some applications with that library. Fair enough. After I do that, he'll look at the integrated application+library combo, say it's not working as expected... and that its basically my job to diagnose/troubleshoot the whole combination. If I ask, well, has this library functionality been tested, has it \\_ever worked\\_, generally the answer is no. Now, sure, it is \\_possible\\_ for me to take over and figure out what's wrong with his library, but it's kind of inefficient, since its all fresh in his head, and I'm coming at it from it uninitiated, so maybe it's a few days work just to figure out how it's \\_supposed\\_ to work., etc.Other examples are, there are tasks assigned to me, I do them, send a PR, he approves the PR, I put the PR in a weekly status update, the ticket gets updated and closed... then a few weeks later, he'll be like \"what happened with ticket 1234? did that get ever get done? was it lost, i don't see it when running the app\". I do some basic looking around... turns out the app has been rolled back to an older version by someone else in the team. It's frustrating, though, because that would be pretty trivial for him to look into via either email, the ticket system, looking at the app version, asking other people in the team, etc etc... but he chats straight to me like drop everything, work got lost, etc.. which can be disruptive.Overall, I feel like, if I had junior-ish developer reporting to me that started out like this, that would be ok, but I'd be focusing strongly on getting them up to speed, self-sufficient, and past this stage over the first year or two, and if they didn't, I'd consider that to be a problem. Along the way, I'd be asking questions like \"What have you tried so far to diagnose this?\", \"Do you have everything you need to solve this kind of issue yourself in future, etc.\".Overall, it just feels like he is intelligent, but also kind of \"needy\", lacking in attention to detail, and ultimately that's going to stop us both from being able to do our best work, but it's kind of difficult dealing with this as the report rather than the manager in this situation.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I have struggled figuring out how to manage this since high school.Because the software engineering industry was changing so fast, I wanted a full understanding of the fundamentals of program design and computer science.I had done clone-tutorials and courses to learn how to build projects that came to mind such as 2d game engines in SDL2 or an app clone, but I would always forget the code I learnt because I was \"studying\" a bunch of programming libraries and the program design of the tutorial by trying to copy line by line, after I see the working project I try to google each part of the code in the documentation, get lost googling more concepts without understanding the big picture, then I had to go back to my schoolwork and would forget everything I \"learnt\". It was as though there was a big valley between: (intro to/ intermediate /advanced xyz programming language + intro to object oriented programming course structure then getting into a specific software programming discipline such as \"intro to app development\" and being overwhelmed with the sheer amount of libraries and how exactly these tools are designed in order to implement anything. I had no idea how to reach the point to even just read the documentation and code from scratch without having to read half of the entire class attributes while still confused.) I felt insecure about this learning style and decided I would focus more on trying to study mathematics and computer science topics before college, an effort that just amounted to doing a bunch of practice problems and khan academy constantly as per my math teachers instruction.I wanted to be able to design programs and dissect pre-existing designs, to be able to understand research on algorithms if not to design my own, to explore future applications of CS research or at least to be a software engineer that could make something without relying on a tutorial with code to copy. In college I had to split my focus between biology, chemistry, anatomy, anthropology, discrete math, calculus, linear algebra, bioanthropology.. as you can see, a lot of topics required by my CS degree before I could even think about programming, yet pre-existing programming knowledge was expected and in our CS classes our assignments would consist of fairly complicated 'real world projects' to implement the concepts we were learning but we never talked about any code in class. Most professors were laissez faire in defining how students should learn to program. \"Just code\" which made it hard to see why I was doing so poorly compared to other students.My cohort consisted of: people who had parents who were in STEM/programmers or very STEM oriented schools so they had learnt programming & CS a structured environment for so long they couldn't really define their curriculum beyond \"I just learnt it\" compared to me who just struggled on youtube & stackoverflow without any help.people who were using GPT & friends for all assignments and somehow getting away with it, but I didn't want to risk it and I had no friends either way. People who seemed to make \"just think of things you'd like to make, watch tutorials and ask questions\" work, but I still don't understand the specifics of how they learnt to dissect program design from tutorials without flailing around in the documentation taking notes on a dozen functions and variables that still don't tie together conceptually, especially while dealing with schoolwork at the same time.As professionals, how are students supposed to manage learning software engineering and computer science + other coursework independently?",

Most deliverables are business/regulatory related and not much technological innovation or otherwise. For that reason, and to avoid stagnation, I've been doing OMSCS and have maintained a 4.0 so far. My question is, since I am doing a master's anyway, and I feel like my technical skills could improve by working in big tech, would it be worthwhile to apply for internships? My undergrad was in physics so I didn't have any CS internships in undergrad and jumped more or less straight into the field. I don't mind quitting this job if it means I can transition into more technical companies and positions where I can learn a lot more.I know all levels of the SE field are super competitive but think that going the internship route may be the best option right now.Thoughts?

Will my current experience be any useful for getting interviews or should I just try to start anew?

It's always the same story, open job boards, tweak my resume again, rewrite another cover letter, hit submit, and then get absolutely nothing back. Half the time I can’t even find internships that are actually suited for what I do. Everything is either looking for ML research, data science, or experience I realistically don’t have yet, and the roles that should fit me either don’t exist or never respond.What makes this hurt more is that I’m not new to this. I’ve been coding for years. I might not be the best in what I do, but I know my way around it. I work with Python, JavaScript, Java, backend frameworks like Node.js, Express, Flask, and Django. I’ve built APIs, worked with MongoDB and PostgreSQL, dealt with OAuth, HTTPS, deployment, all of it. Ive developed several Discord bots from 2018-2024 and served thousands of users across multiple communities. I even built a full-stack open-source application on my own that generates playable games using an AI API, with real-time code generation, live editing, and a working game canvas. A few months ago I went to a hackathon hoping it would motivate me again, but it honestly made things worse. Almost everyone built some kind of AI model or flashy ML demo, and I built a small application with backend logic, API integration, and AI usage in a product. It felt like none of that mattered. If you didn’t train a model, your work was dismissed as just another “GPT fork,” The whole time my teams project was the only one in which no judge was even remotely interested, all of them just gave us \"pity\" remarlsI’m honestly just burnt out. People keep telling me to build more projects, contribute to open source, or network more, but I’m already doing those to the best of my knowledge, and I’m exhausted. Applying feels pointless. Even coding, which I genuinely love, feels heavy now. I keep wondering if backend and API work is just invisible unless it’s wrapped in machine learning buzzwords, or if I’m just not good enough and no one wants to say it.I don’t even know what I’m asking for here. I guess I just want to know if anyone else felt this broken this early and still made it through. Because right now it feels like I’m putting in everything I have and it still isn’t enough, and I’m honestly running out of energy to keep pretending I’m okay.",
