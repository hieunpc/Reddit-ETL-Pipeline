The one thing this subreddit does tell me is that the Databricks marketing has earned their yearend bonus. The number of people using the name medallion architecture and the associated colors is off the hook. These design patterns have been used and well documented for over 30 years. Giving them a new name and a Databricks coat of paint doesn't change that. It does however cause confusion because there are people out there that think this is new.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I wanted to share my situation and get some honest perspective from this community.I’m a data engineer with 5 years of hands-on experience building and maintaining production pipelines. Most of my work has been around Spark (batch + streaming), Kafka, Airflow, cloud platforms (AWS and GCP), and large-scale data systems used by real business teams. I’ve worked on real-time event processing, data migrations, and high-volume pipelines, not just toy projects.Despite that, the current job hunt has been brutal.I’ve been applying consistently for months. I do get callbacks, recruiter screens, and even technical rounds. But I keep getting rejected late in the process or after hiring manager rounds. Sometimes the feedback is vague. Sometimes there’s no feedback at all. Roles get paused. Headcount disappears. Or they suddenly want an exact internal tech match even though the JD said otherwise.What’s making this harder is the pressure outside work. I’m managing rent, education costs, and visa timelines, so the uncertainty is mentally exhausting. I know I’m capable, I know I’ve delivered in real production environments, but this market makes you question everything.I’m trying to understand a few things:•Is this level of rejection normal right now even for experienced data engineers?•Are companies strongly preferring very narrow stack matches over fundamentals?•Is the market simply oversaturated, or am I missing something obvious in how I’m interviewing or positioning myself?•For those who recently landed roles, what actually made the difference?I’m not looking for sympathy. I genuinely want to improve and adapt. If the answer is “wait it out,” I can accept that. If the answer is “your approach is wrong,” I want to fix it.Appreciate any real advice, especially from people actively hiring or who recently went through the same thing.Thanks for reading.",

        "content": "I am a senior engineer, and although this has been discussed before, I experienced it again recently. I was asked to prepare a presentation for a panel with only two days’ notice. I spent the weekend preparing the slides, attended the final meeting, and presented to six people. The presentation went very well. However, a month later, I was informed by the recruiter that the hiring process had been paused. After that experience, I decided not to accept take-home assignments again.Unfortunately, I made the same mistake again recently. After a phone screening with fairly basic questions, I was given a take-home assignment. It was described as a prototype, expected to take only a few hours, with up to a week to complete. They also said it didn’t need to be fully finished, as long as I explained what I would do with more time.I was genuinely interested in the company, so I spent two full days working on it and submitted what I had. The feedback came back saying it wasn’t at the level they expected and that more work was needed, so they decided not to move forward. From the comments, it was clearly not a “few hours” task, it was closer to a full week of work and would require paid cloud resources. What is your opinion?",

Is it implemented separately outside of the tools provided by the large scale platforms (such as Snowflake, AWS, Databricks) and if so how is it done ?Asking because I see Joh descriptions explicitly mention Kafka as a experience requirement while also mentioning Snowflake as required experience . What exactly are they looking at and how is it different to know Snowflake streams and separately Kafka.If Kafka is deployed separately to Snowflake / AWS / Databricks, how is it done? I have seen even large organisations put this as a requirement.Trying to understand what exactly to learn in Kafka, because there are so many courses and implementations - so what is a typical requirement in a mid to large organization ? \\*Edit\\* - to clarify - I have asked about streaming, but I meant to also add Snowpipe.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I was reading through Kimballs warehouse toolkit, and it gives this beautiful picture of a central collection of conformed dimensional models that represent the company as a whole. I love it, but it also feels so central that I can't imagine a modern ML practice surviving with it.I'm a data scientist, and when I think about a question like \"how could I incorporate the weather into my forecast?\" my gut is to schedule daily api requests and dump those as tables in some warehouse, followed by pushing a change to a dbt project to model the weather measurements with the rest of my features. The idea of needing to connect with a central team of architects to make sure we 'conform along the dimensional warehouse bus' just so I can study the weather feels ridiculous. Dataset curation and feature engineering would likely just die. On the flip side, once the platform needs to display both the dataset and the inferences to the client as a finished product, then of course the model would have to get conformed with the other data and be secure in production.On the other end of the extreme from Kimballs central design, I've seen mentions of companies opening up dbt models for all analysts to push using the staged datasets as sources. This looks like an equally big nightmare, with a hundred under-skilled math people pushing thousands of expensive models, many of which would achieve relatively the same thing with minor differences and numerous unchecked data quality problems, different interpretations of data, confusion on different representations from the different datasets, I can't imagine this being a good idea.In the middle, I've heard people mention the Mesh design of having different groups manages their warehouses. So analytics could set up its own warehouse for building ML features and a maybe a central team helps coordinate the different teams data models to be coherent. One difficulty that comes to mind is if a healthy fact table in one teams warehouse is desired for modeling and analysis by another team, spinning up a job to extract and load a healthy model from one warehouse to another is silly, and it also makes one groups operation quietly dependent on the other groups maintenance of that table.There seems to be a tug-of-war on the spectrum between agility and coherent governance. I truly don't know what the ideal state should look like for a company. To some extent, it could even be company specific. If you're too small to have a central data platform team, then could you even conceive of Kimballs design? I would really love to hear thoughts and experiences.",

At some point , my boss decides he wants to “centralize the company data” and hires some agency out of the blue. They drafted up an outline of their plan, which involved setting up a separate database with a medallion architecture. They then requested that I show them how the APIs we’re pulling data from work, and a week later, they request that I help them pull the analytics from the existing db. they never acknowledged any of the solutions i provided for either of those things nor did they explain the Point of those 2 conflicting ideas. So I ask my boss about and he says that the plan is to “replace the entire existing database with the one they’re working on“. And the next time I hop on a call with them, what we discussed instead was just mirroring the analytics and any relevant data to the bronze layer. so I begin helping them set this up, and when they asked for a progress update and I show them what I’ve worked on, they tell me that no, we’re not mirroring the analytics, we need to replace the entire db, including non analytical data. at this point. at this point, I tell them we need to take a step back and discuss this all together (me, then, and my boss). we’ve yet to meet again, (we are a remote company for context) , but I have literally no idea what to say to him, because it very much seems like whatever he’s trying to achieve, and whatever proposals they pitched him don’t align at all (he has no technical knowledge , and they don’t seem to fully understand what the platform does, and there were obviously several meetings I was left out of)",

        "author": "paxmlank",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "tl;dr: no point stands out to me as the obvious place to use it, but I feel that every project uses it so I feel like I'm missing something.I'm working on a private hobby project that's primarily just for learning new things, some that I never really got to work on in my 5 YOE. One of these things I've learned is to \"make the MVP first and ask questions later\", so I'm mainly trying to do just that for this latest version, but I'm still stirring up some questions within myself as I read on various things.One of these other questions is when/how to implement Pydantic/dataclasses. Admittedly, I don't know a lot about it, just thought it was a \"better\" Typing module (which I also don't know much about, just am familiar with type hints).I know that people use Pydantic to validate user input, but I know that its author says it's not a validation library, but a parsing one. One issue I have is that the data I collect largely are from undocumented APIs or are scraped from the web. They all fit what is conceptually the same thing, but sources will provide a different subset of \"essential fields\".My current workflow is to collect the data from the sources and save it in an object with extraction metadata, preserving the response *exactly* was it was provided. Because the data come in various shapes, I coerce everything into JSONL format. Then I use a config-based approach where I coerce different field names into a \"canonical field name\" (e.g., `{\"firstname\", \"first_name\", \"1stname\", etc.} -> \"C_FIRST_NAME\"`). Lastly, some data are missing (rows and fields), but the data are consistent so I build out all that I'm expecting for my application/analyses; this is done partly in Python before loading into the database then partly in SQL/dbt after loading.Initially, I thought of using Pydantic for the data as it's ingested, but I just want to preserve whatever I get as it's the source of truth. Then I thought about parsing the response into objects and using it for that (for example, I extract data about a Pokemon team so I make a Team class with a list of Pokemon, where each Pokemon has a Move/etc.), but I don't really need that much? I feel like I can just keep the data in the database with the schema that I coerce it to and the application currently just runs by running calculations in the database. Maybe I'd use it for defining a later ML model?I then figured I'd somehow use it to define the various getters in my extraction library so that I can codify how they will behave (e.g., expects a Source of either an Endpoint or a Connection, outputs a JSON with X outer keys, etc.), but figured I don't really have a good grasp of Pydantic here.After reading on it some more, I figured I could use it *after* I flatten everything into JSONL and use it while I try to add semantics to the values I see, but as I'm using Claude Code at points, it's guiding me toward using it *before/during* flattening, and that just seems forced. Tbf, it's shit at times.To reiterate, all of my sources are undocumented APIs or from webscraping. I have some control over the output from the extraction step, but I feel that I shouldn't do that in extracting. Any validation comes from having the data in a dataframe while massaging it or after loading it into the database to build it out for the desired data product.I'd appreciate any further direction.",

There’s often a push to “fix” historical data so it can be analyzed alongside newer, cleaner data, but at some point the effort starts to outweigh the value. Schema drift, missing context, inconsistent definitions… it adds up fast. How do you decide when to keep investing in cleaning and backfilling old data versus archiving it and moving on? Is the decision driven by regulatory requirements, analytical value, storage cost, or just gut feel? I’m especially curious how teams draw that line in practice, and whether you’ve ever regretted cleaning too much or archiving too early. This feels like one of those judgment calls that never gets written down but has long-term consequences.",

        "content": "Hey y'all, over the holidays I wrote Tessera (https://github.com/ashita-ai/tessera)It's like Kafka Schema Registry but for data warehouses. If you're using dbt, OpenAPI, GraphQL, or Kafka, it helps coordinate schema changes between producers and consumers.The problem it solves: data teams break each other's stuff all the time because there's no good way to track who depends on what. You change a column, someone's dashboard breaks, nobody knows until it's too late. The same happens with APIs as well. Tessera sits in the middle and makes producers acknowledge breaking changes before they publish. Consumers register their dependencies, get notifications when things change, and can block breaking changes until they're ready.It's open source, MIT licensed, built with Python/FastAPI. If you're dealing with data contracts, schema evolution, or just tired of breaking changes causing incidents, have a look: https://github.com/ashita-ai/tesseraFeedback is encouraged. Contributors are especially encouraged. I would love to hear if this resonates with problems you're seeing!",

The proyect I'm developing is a data architecture applying medallion. So I created 3 docker containers:1. Pyspark and Jupiter lab2. MinIo (I don't want to pay for Amazon s3 storage so I'm simulating it using minio. I have 3 buckets landing, bronze and silver)3. Apache airflow (its monitoring the landing bucket and when a file is uploaded it calls diferent scripts if the name of the script starts with tc it start the pipeline for data catalog file if it start with atus it calls the pipeline for processing the data files with the accidents records any other name just move it to bronze bucket.On the silver quality I implemented a delta lake 4 dimension tables and 1 for the facts.My question is how con I improve this proyect so it stand out more for the recruiter and also that I can learn more. I know that maybe I did overkill for som parts of the proyect but I did it to practice what I'm learning. I was thinking to develop an api that reads the csvs and create a Kafka container so I can learn about streaming processing. Thank for any advice",

Please be aware of:* merge() is not implemented in this version* DuckDB doesn’t allow mixed types like Pandas does, so you may need to clean messy CSVs before using them.* Currently optimized for reading and analyzing. Writing back to Parquet/CSV works by converting to Pandas first.* Advanced methods (rolling, ewm) will fall back to standard Pandas, which may defeat the memory savings. Stick to groupby, filter, and agg for now.Any feedback on handling more complex operations like merge() efficiently without breaking the lazy evaluation chain is appreciated.**Links:*** PyPI: pip install pdboost* GitHub: [https://github.com/ashish-002/pdboost](https://github.com/ashish-002/pdboost)It’s still early (v0.1.2), so I’m open to suggestions.

GraphQLite is an SQLite extension that brings graph database functionality to SQLite using the Cypher query language.The idea came from wanting graph queries without the operational overhead of running Neo4j for smaller projects. Sometimes you just want to model relationships and traverse them without spinning up a separate database server. SQLite already gives you a single-file, zero-config database—GraphQLite adds Cypher's expressive pattern matching on top.You can create nodes and relationships, run traversals, and execute graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and shortest paths. It handles graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes comfortably, with sub-millisecond traversal times. There are bindings for Python and Rust, or you can use it directly from SQL.I hope some of y'all find it useful.GitHub: [https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite)",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I’d really appreciate your feedback and advice regarding my current career situation.I’m a bioinformatics engineer with a biology background and about 2.5 years of professional experience. Most of my work so far has been very technical: pipeline development, data handling, tool testing, Docker/Apptainer images, Git, etc. I’ve rarely worked on actual data analysis.I recently changed jobs (about 6 months ago), and this experience made me realize a few things: I don’t really enjoy coding, working on other people’s code often gives me anxiety, and I’d like to move toward a related role that offers better compensation than what’s usually available in public research.Given my background, I’ve been considering a transition into data engineering. I’ve started learning Airflow, ETL/ELT concepts, Spark, and the basics of GCP and AWS. However, I feel like I’m missing structure, mentorship, and especially a community to help me stay motivated and make real progress.At the moment, I don’t enjoy my current tasks, I don’t feel like I’m developing professionally, and the salary isn’t motivating. I still have about 15 months left on my contract, and I’d really like to use this time wisely to prepare a solid transition.If you have experience with a similar transition, or if you work in data engineering, I’d love to hear:* how you made the switch (or would recommend making it),* what helped you most in terms of learning and positioning yourself,* how to connect with people already working in the field.Thanks a lot in advance for your insights.",

The only type of cleaning being done is some deduplication logic (very manual) and some type casting. This means a lot of the data that goes into reports and downstream products aren’t uniform and must be fixed/transformed at the report level.All these tiny problems are handled in scripts when new tables are created in silver or gold layers. So the scripts can get very long, complex, and contain duplicate logic.So..\\- at what point do you see it necessary to actually do data cleaning? In my opinion it should already be implemented but I want to hear other perspectives.\\- what kind of “cleaning” do you deem absolutely necessary/bare minimum for most use cases?\\- i understand and completely onboard with the thought of “don’t fix it if it’s not broken” but when does it reach a breaking point?\\- in your opinion, what part of this is up to the data engineer to decide vs. analysts?We are using spark and delta lake to store data.Edit: clarified question 3",

        "author": "iamspoilt",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "First of all, Happy New Year 2026!Hi folks, I'm a long time lurker on this subreddit and a fellow Data Infrastructure Engineer. I have been working as a Software Engineer for 8+ years now and have been entirely focused on the data infra side of the world for the past few years with a fair share of working with Apache Spark.I have realized that it's very difficult to manage Spark infrastructure on your own using commodity cloud hardware and Kubernetes, and this is one of the prime reasons why users opt-in for offerings such as EMR and Databricks. However, I have personally seen that as companies grow larger, these offerings start to show their limitations (at least in the case of EMR from my personal experience). Besides that, these offerings also charge a premium on compute on top of the charges for using commodity cloud.For a quick comparison, here is the difference in pricing for AWS c8g.24xlarge and c8g.48xlarge instances if you were to run these for an entire month, showing the 25% EMR premium on your total EC2 bill.**Table 1: Single Instance (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$2,794.79|$3,493.49|$698.70||c8g.48xlarge|$5,589.58|$6,986.98|$1,397.40|**Table 2: 50 Instances (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$139,740|$174,675|$34,935||c8g.48xlarge|$279,479|$349,349|$69,870|In light of this, I started working on a platform that allows you to orchestrate Spark clusters on Kubernetes in your own AWS account - with no additional compute markup. The platform is geared towards Data Engineers (Product Data Engineers as I like to call them) who mainly write and maintain ETL and ELT workloads, not manage the Data Infrastcructure needed to support these workloads.Today, I am finally able to share what I have been building: [Orchestera Platform](https://orchestera.com/)Here are some of the salient features of the platform:* Setup and teardown an entire EKS-based Spark cluster in your own AWS account with absolutely no upfront expertise required in Kubernetes* Cluster is configured for reactive auto-scaling based on your workloads: * Automatically scales up to the right number of EC2 instances based on your Spark driver and executor configuration * Automatically scales down to 0 once your workloads complete* Simple integration with AWS services such as S3 and RDS* Simple integration with Iceberg tables on S3. AWS Glue Catalog integration coming soon.* Full support for iterating on Spark pipelines using Jupyter notebooks* Currently only supports AWS Cloud and the us-east-1 regionYou can see some demo examples here:* [Developing Spark applications using Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/jupyter-notebooks/)* [Using Iceberg tables with Spark](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/iceberg-hello-world/)If you are an AWS user or considering using it for Spark, I would request you to please try this out. No credit card required for using the personal workspace. Also offering 6 months of premium access for serious users in this subreddit.Also very interested to hear from this community and looking for some early feedback.I have aslo written [documentation](https://docs.orchestera.com/) (under active development) to give users a head start in setting up their accounts, orchesterating a new Spark cluster and writing data pipelines.If you want to chat more about this new platform, please come and join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9TXybZcd).",

The Snowflake connector for ADF requires staging in Blob storage first.Now, why is it so underwhelmingly slow to write into Azure SQL? This first ETL step ingestion takes nearly 3 hours overnight, just writing it all into SQL bronze tables.Snowflake-Blob step takes about 10% of the runtime, ignoring the queue time, the copy activity from staged Blob to SQL is the killer.I've played around with parallel copies, DIUs, concurrency on the ForEach loop - virtually zero improvement.On the other hand, it's easily writing +10mil rows in a few minutes from Parquet, but this Blob to SQL bit is killing my ETL schedule and makes me feel like a boiling frog, seeing the runtime creep up each day without a plan to fix.Any ideas from you good folks on how to check where the bottleneck lies? Is it just a matter of giving the DB more beans (v-cores, etc) before ETL - would it help with writing into it?No indexes on bronze tables on write, the tables are dropped & indexes re-created after write.",

        "content": "Greetings. I am trying to train an OCR system on huge datasets, namely:* [OCR Cyrillic Printed 1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DonkeySmall/OCR-Cyrillic-Printed-1)* [Synthetic Cyrillic Large](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pumb-ai/synthetic-cyrillic-large)* [Cyrillic Handwriting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/constantinwerner/cyrillic-handwriting-dataset)They contain millions of images, and are all in different formats - `WebDataset`, `zip` with folders, etc. I will be experimenting with different hyperparameters locally on my M2 Mac, and then training on a [Vast.ai](http://Vast.ai) server. The thing is, I don't have enough space to fit even one of these datasets at a time on my personal laptop, and I don't want to use permanent storage on the server. The reason is that I want to rent the server for as short of a time as possible. If I have to instantiate server instances multiple times (e.g. in case of starting all over), I will waste several hours every time to download the datasets. Therefore, I think that streaming the datasets is a flexible option that would solve my problems both locally on my laptop, and on the server. However, two of the datasets are available on Hugging Face, and one - only on Kaggle, where I can't stream it from. Furthermore, I expect to hit rate limits when streaming the datasets from Hugging Face. Having said all of this, I consider just uploading the data to Google Cloud Buckets, and use the `Google Cloud Connector for PyTorch` to efficiently stream the datasets. This way I get a dataset-agnostic way of streaming the data. The interface directly inherits from PyTorch `Dataset`: from dataflux_pytorch import dataflux_iterable_dataset PREFIX = \"simple-demo-dataset\" iterable_dataset = dataflux_iterable_dataset.DataFluxIterableDataset( project_name=PROJECT_ID, bucket_name=BUCKET_NAME, config=dataflux_mapstyle_dataset.Config(prefix=PREFIX) )>The `iterable_dataset` now represents an iterable over data samples.I have two questions: 1. Are my assumptions correct and is it worth uploading everything to Google Cloud Buckets (assuming I pick locations close to my working location and my server location, enable hierarchical storage, use prefixes, etc.). Or I should just stream the Hugging Face datasets, download the Kaggle dataset, and call it a day? 2. If uploading everything to Google Cloud Buckets is worth it, how do I store the datasets to GCP Buckets in the first place? [This](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcs-connector-for-pytorch/blob/main/demo/simple-walkthrough/Getting%20Started%20with%20Dataflux%20Dataset%20for%20PyTorch%20with%20Google%20Cloud%20Storage.ipynb) and [this](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcs-connector-for-pytorch/blob/main/demo/image_segmentation/README.md) tutorials only work with images, not with image-string pairs.",

There are many pdf files that will be vectorized into the S3 Vector index. \\- Each customer must have access only to their pdf files \\- In many cases the same pdf file can be relevant to many customers**Question:**Should I just have one s3 vector index and vectorize/ingest all pdf files into that index once? I could search the vectors using filterable metadata. In postgres db, I maintain the mapping of which pdf files are relevant to which companies.Or should I create separate vector index for every company to ingest only relevant pdfs for that company.

        "content": "I've pursued this line of research for years now, often coming to resources that don't fit what I'm looking for (like TagSpaces didn't handle terabytes of media files well). I'm a data hoarder/enthusiast looking for a system to tag a variety of file types and directories in Windows (I'm not opposed to learning a different OS). The default \"Properties\" (for the NTFS ?) are easiest to search, but you can't tag all file types or directories.I use XYPlorer as my file explorer and I like it as a general file browser. I liked the flexibility of the tags, but didn't like how running a script in Command Line to bulk rename hundreds of image files would break the tag link since the tags are all recorded in a tag.dat file (which I'm not opposed to writing something to also change it in there, but I also didn't think it was a very flexible tag data storage method. I'm gathering people's experiences in hopes of finding something I can invest time into when it comes to tagging my media and being able to access it. Things I'm looking for:1. Ease of access (I figure I can write a script to handle the tag hierarchy and categories as needed)2. Tag flexibility (like bulk renaming a tag)3. Ease of tag-ability (while I liked Adobe Bridge to edit tags, it didn't flow the best for me)4. Data versatility (if I can access the data for different visuals at some point or export it into an Excel format)5. Kind of an extra would be doing the opposite of point 4 (adding tags from an Excel spreadsheet)Questions I have:1. Is it more efficient for my uses for tags to be in one main file (like how XYPlorer stores it's tags) or sidecar files (which I liked the concept, but not how TagSpaces did it, and I'm worried about a search function scouring all the sidecar files)?2. Are there other solutions that exist now that I haven't experienced?My solution that stands now is to figure out the way XYPlorer can natively batch rename files and just go with all tags being in the plain text file. I would love to know if anyone has encountered other options. Thank you! EDIT: Or maybe a SQL situation.",

I’ve already applied to several companies for DE positions, but I’m unsure whether my current profile aligns well with what companies typically expect at the entry or junior level.I have hands-on experience using Python, SQL, Qdrant, Dataiku, LangChain, LangGraph.I’ve participated in launching a production-level chatbot service, where I worked on data pipelines and automation around AI workflows. One of my main concerns is that while I understand PySpark, Hadoop, and big data concepts at a theoretical level, I haven’t yet used them extensively in a real production environment. I’m actively studying and practicing them on my own, but I’m unsure how realistic it is to land a DE role in Germany without prior professional experience using these tools.# Additionally, I’m not sure how relevant this is in Germany, but, I graduated top of my class from a top university in my home country and I previously worked as an AI problem solver intern (3 months) at an MBB consulting firm.Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.

I build production-level automation systems using Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Prefect, and LangChain. Think long-running workflows, orchestration, state, retries, idempotency, failure recovery, data pipelines, ETL-ish stuff, and AI steps inside real backend systems. (what people call \"AI Automation\" & \"AI Agents\")The problem is: whenever I search for AI Automation Engineer, I mostly find people doing no-code / low-code stuff with Make, n8n, Zapier...etc. That’s not bad work, but it’s not what I do or want to be associated with. I’m not selling automations to small businesses; I’m trying to work on enterprise / production-grade systems.When I search for Data Engineer, I mostly see analytics, SQL-heavy roles, or content about dashboards and warehouses. When I search for Automation Engineer, I get QA and testing people. When I search for workflow orchestration, ETL, data pipelines, or even agentic AI, I still end up in the same no-code hype circle somehow.I know people like me exist, because I see them in GitHub issues, Prefect/Airflow discussions. But on X and LinkedIn, I can’t figure out how to consistently find and follow them, or how to get into the same conversations they’re having.So my question is:\\- What do people in this space actually call themselves online?\\- What keywords do you use to find high-code, production-level automation/orchestration /workflow engineers, not no-code creators or AI hype accounts?\\- Where do these people actually hang out (X, LinkedIn, GitHub)?\\- How exactly can I find them on X and LI?Right now it feels like my work sits between “data engineering”, “backend engineering”, and “AI”, but none of those labels cleanly point to the same crowd I’m trying to learn from and engage with.If you’re doing similar work, how did you find your circle?P.S: I came from a background where I was creating AI Automation systems using those no-code/low-code tools, then I shifted to do more complex things with \"high-code\", but still the same concepts apply",

        "content": "I’ve been programming for almost two years, completely self taught, and for a long time I was convinced the “aha” moment people talk about just wasn’t going to happen for me. Coding anything felt like nonstop friction. Forgetting syntax, confused about how to use a given framework, not knowing why something works even when I'm able to get it working, and constantly needing help just to move forward, it felt like this every step for a long time.Recently, something finally clicked. I can sit down, think through a problem, and actually build the solution without feeling like I’m fighting the language or tools the entire time. One of the biggest changes is how I use documentation now. What used to feel unreadable suddenly makes sense, and I almost always prefer reading docs over asking GPT because it’s faster and clearer.I’m still very much a beginner at the end of the day, but programming is finally fun. I can move past small toy programs that are under a thousand lines of code and start building things that feel real and challenging in a good way. Posting this for anyone who’s been stuck wondering if things ever start to feel natural, they do, even if it takes longer than you expect.",

        "content": "Most of us growing up in school have learned everything in a sequence. Heck, even everything in life almost follows a sequence. A year starts with day 1 until it hits day 365; a book starts with chapter 1 until it reaches the ending chapter. Almost everything has a sequence. Programming does not have that; you have to have the ability to learn things out of sequence. You can't wait until you have the entirety of JS learned before you move on to something like React. Heck, you will probably never get there in a lifetime, as there will be new additions to the language and deprecations. I have a degree, I have been self-studying, and I am still unemployed. When I start learning a library, it is hard to sort of know what to pick up and then move on and hit the library only when you need it again.This is a barrier, or at least one of the barriers that makes programming a high-paying job. We need to have a different kind of approach to learning to code. I have been trying to adapt my brain's wiring so that I only learn what is important and move on. But from my question to senior programmers here, how do I overcome this? I am 29 years old; for reference, I have never been employed.",

I sat in my office in August and like clockwork one by one my coworkers were being let go. It was surreal. Eventually the guillotine came for me. I wasn’t surprised but god did it hurt when they pulled me into the office and I hear “Due to restructuring…”. So I’ve been at home since mid August in a stress graver dream trying to survive. I’ve been applying for so many jobs not just in computer science but retail, fast food etc. no call backs or anything. When I did get a call back I’d be two interviews in and just be dropped. I assumed by fate was sealed until I finally applied for a job that I was pretty sure I didn’t have the skills for. The only difference is this time I took command during my interview. I didn’t sit there any let them run it I simply said hey I know this is weird but instead of telling you my skills and answering all the typical questions can I just show you? They just kinda looked around and said sure. Before I officially applied I did deep research on the company. Looked into trends and markets and made a sample project. Long story short I made a backend and front end for a billing systems. I saw that they had recently acquired a billing company. After my presentation and showing off my project they smiled and said we will call you. Not even 30 minutes later they called and said that I would not be doing the other two interviews and sent me an offer letter. I was honestly so confused and happy?I was always told that projects were never the way to go and to just do the interviews and meet and greets. I guess I’m not sure exactly where this post is going but for all the people out there that do better by showing your skills I say go for it.",

So, I decided that I wanted to take a break from the hostile environment and work with other stuff (and enjoy some of my life after uni). The thing is, job market wasn’t so lucky to me. It was (and it still is) hard to even get an interview. So I ended up doing some freelance and gigs all around. But one stuff that was all over my head ever since I finished uni was the famous “imposter syndrome”. And, I got the realisation that I was, in fact, very lucky to land my positions. I always relied on AI to deliver something, didn’t know how to start a project from scratch. So, in November I decided to “start again”. Focusing on getting the basics well and enjoying coding again. And it has been a quite fun journey! In fact, I’m liking studying and trying some stuff. I got a membership on Frontend Masters (mostly because of the algorithm course) and gifted myself with some books for Christmas. I’m relearning (or learning in fact) Javascript, algorithms, some cloud computing (aiming for AWS SAA-CO3) and eager to learn DBs and Golang. Challenges are getting fun again, struggling is getting fun again and, more importantly, learning is getting fun again. I’m still doing some gigs (mostly because I really need the money), but I’m planning on diving deep in interviews at June. But, until then, I’ll enjoy the ride :)",

I’ve been in a database developer role where I use SQL and PL/SQL for about 6 years, and I’ve noticed with PL/SQL there are some similarities when it comes to programming fundamentals (variables, data types, loops, etc.). I’ve always been interested in doing Software Engineering (either Full-stack, Backend, or Data Engineering). I graduated in 2018 with a major in Management Information Systems (MIS). I wonder if to get into a Software Engineering career, would it be better or worth it to go back to school and get a major or master’s in Computer Science? Or would it be better to learn programming online and do some projects to add to a portfolio? Any other advice would also be appreciated!",

        "content": "This year I spent a lot of time trying to get into programming and IT from scratch.Not at 18, but at 30.Around 2 months with Swift and iOS, 2 months with Flutter, and about 2 months with Go and some Android.I feel like I finally started to understand mobile development as a whole, how things are connected and how real projects work, not just tutorials.At the same time, I’m tired.Tired of making projects that don’t really end anywhere.It feels like there is a lot of work around, but not for me. Most junior roles seem to be for fresh IT graduates, and starting from zero at my age feels almost impossible.The hardest part is that there *is* progress, but it doesn’t feel real.Half a year of work, more knowledge, more understanding — but no visible or material result yet.AI and the current state of IT make things even more confusing.Does it still make sense to learn coding?Are junior positions still real?There are tons of job postings, but almost no replies.Even in my previous field, things don’t look great.I honestly don’t know if the world is going in the wrong direction or if I’m doing something wrong.With the new year starting, I want to reset mentally.Find at least some kind of job to stabilize things, and continue programming more as a hobby for now.I want to try to finish a project and publish it to the App Store, even though it’s not easy right now.I also have a Raspberry Pi lying around, so maybe I’ll build something simple with hardware and AI vision.At least to see if this can move me closer to the kind of work I want to do, without a degree and years of experience in a field I didn’t start in earlier.Wishing everyone in the new year some progress on their path.Not necessarily big achievements, but at least small and real ones.",

I can already see why people recommend this approach.Before this, I was mostly watching lessons and reading examples, and everything made sense in theory. But once I tried to build something on my own, I started noticing all the small details you only run into when you actually try to make things work. Having a small project that solves a real problem for me makes it easier to stay focused and keep going. Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who suggested learning this way.

I've made a basic hangman, I've coded many sorting algs like bubble, selection, insertion on my own. I recently learnt about Gauss Seidel Iteration Method and I'm trying to code that in C. It solves simultaneous equations in 3 variables. I also want to learn file handling in C. But many people have told me that C is not a language with good career opportunities and that I'll have to learn a high level language for jobs. Is this true? Is there no job market for C? If no, what should I learn now? If yes, how can take my C skills to the level of an employable programmer?",

So I’ve started doing just that, learning the very basics, and I’ve been able to write a few programs with the help og tutorials and basic understanding of if-statements, while loops etc. I did this following an easy tutorial on youtube. Thing is, that tutorial is finished, and I have no idea where to go next. I’ve searched around and found a lot of resources for learning. I have books, pages, youtube tutorials and much more, but I still don’t have an «end-goal» with those. What should I work toward learning? I got interested in OpenGL, and started there. It went alright, but it is some steps ahead of my very basic knowledge and it ends with me just copying code without *really* understanding most of it. So let’s say I want to start making very basic apps. Say a to-do list, a calculator or something like that (with some sort of graphics library so I can make something else than just prompt programs :face_with_tears_of_joy:), but I’m still very fresh, what should I do?",

        "content": "Hello! New poster here. I just started to practice some C# and learn its style with a couple simple projects. I guess I have some questions on it as a whole, firstly: for most cases where you need a data-holding object, do you just use a class? Coming from python I keep defaulting to a dictionary, but there it's extremely simple to initialize one with whatever key value pairs I need, whereas in c# the statement is so complex I wonder if it's because objects with more than just a string-number or string-string pairs are meant to be classes. Also, I read that classes are faster in execution.Secondly, I guess I've been struggling to explain the need for all the explicit type declarations and other things that to a beginner seem more complicated than they need to be. Like, it was very complicated in VS to just figure out how to run the script I created, having to choose a debugger and running console commands to get there. What do you do if you want to test a snippet of one script in isolation? Also, I had a class script in the same namespace as the main one, but its class wasn't being recognized. Eventually I noticed the class script was in a different subfolder of the project, so I moved it and it worked fine. But what's the point of a namespace if the file still needs to be in the same directory... I imagine all these details are for good reasons, so wanted to ask some experts haha",

I know that I have a long way ahead of me but I want to start anyway.

I have seen suggestions regarding the app that I can use the HTML/CSS/JS + Electron + python but I have no clue if this is a good idea or not. Any comments would be greatly appreciated. Edit: I realized that I didn't add enough information for the app idea I have. I am adding the details I have now to help be more clear: It is an app for writing, but it is tailored first to Arab Writers, and I intend to add features to it along the way. I am not comfortable with the idea that I need different apps or resources to work on one novel or story. So, I want to make my own, an app that I can write in, export docs, it also can spellcheck, provide ambience (background and music), do grammatical checks suggestions, have some widgets inside the app that helps the writer move forward in the form of questions and answers that help with roadblocks in plot, characters, story, idea...etc.I hope this is a bit more helpful.",

The problem is… I’ve slowly realized that I really don’t enjoy frontend work.I don’t like dealing with UI, layout, styling, or making things “look nice.” I find it frustrating and draining. What I do enjoy is logic, problem-solving, data handling, and figuring out how things work behind the scenes. Deep down, I feel more drawn to backend development.Now I’m stuck mentally because: I’ve already invested around a year in TOP I don’t want to feel like I “wasted” that time I’m thinking of shifting toward backend-focused learning (maybe Python, APIs, databases, etc.)So my questions are:Is this a normal realization?Is my frontend knowledge from TOP still useful if I move to backend?Would switching to backend now be a mistake, or is it better than forcing myself to continue frontend?If you were in my position, what would you do?I’d really appreciate honest advice, especially from people who disliked frontend but found their place elsewhere.Thanks!TL;DR: 1 year into TOP, realized I hate frontend and prefer backend logic.

        "content": "Hi All, I built this thing called K8sQuest because I was tired of paying for cloud sandboxes and wanted to practice debugging broken clusters. \\## What it is It's basically a game that breaks things in your local kind cluster and makes you fix them. 50 levels total, going from \"why is this pod crashing\" to \"here's 9 broken things in a production scenario, good luck.\" Runs entirely on Docker Desktop with kind. No cloud costs. \\## How it works 1. Run \\`./play.sh\\` - game starts, breaks something in k8s 2. Open another terminal and debug with kubectl 3. Fix it however you want 4. Run \\`validate\\` in the game to check 5. Get a debrief explaining what was wrong and why The UI is retro terminal style (kinda like those old NES games). Has hints, progress tracking, and step-by-step guides if you get stuck. \\## What you'll debug \\- World 1: CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, pending pods, labels, ports \\- World 2: Deployments, HPA, liveness/readiness probes, rollbacks \\- World 3: Services, DNS, Ingress, NetworkPolicies \\- World 4: PVs, PVCs, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets \\- World 5: RBAC, SecurityContext, node scheduling, resource quotas \\## Install \\`\\`\\`bash git clone [https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git](https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git) cd k8squest ./install.sh ./play.sh \\`\\`\\` Needs: Docker Desktop, kubectl, kind, python3 \\## Why I made this Reading docs didn't really stick for me. I learn better when things are broken and I have to figure out why. This simulates the actual debugging you do in prod, but locally and with hints. Also has safety guards so you can't accidentally nuke your whole cluster. Feedback welcome. If it helps you learn, cool. If you find bugs or have ideas for more levels, let me know.

I found that the six xaml files of a MAUI project to be such a confusing mess, and the widget child (and children) feature of Flutter to be inconvenient for me to get used to. I am used to creating new objects in OOP programming. Then after consulting with AI I realized that React Native is probably the best choice of framework for mobile android development. In around mid December I decided that in 2026 I am going to start learning it. However I found that even the configuration (or setup) for React Native is super complicated. For example the JDK has to be between 17 and 20, and installing something on Android Studio SDK manager. Fortunately I sorted it all out with the help of AI's assistance in a few hours struggling attempts and managed to install React Native apps on my phone. React Native's code structure reminds of HTML at first glance. Hopefully in this year I will be able to independently write code for android apps through React Native. This is just my experience to note down, and a topic closely related to programming.",

        "author": "ByteMender",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "From a \"mechanical\" perspective, it seems like anything you can do with inheritance, you can do with composition.Any shared behavior placed in a base class and reused via `extends` can instead be moved into a separate class and reused via delegation. In practice, an inheritance hierarchy can often be transformed into composition by:* Keeping the classes that represent the varying behavior,* Removing `extends`,* Injecting those classes into what used to be the base class,* Delegating calls instead of relying on overridden methods.From this perspective, inheritance looks like **composition + a relationship**.With inheritance:* The base class provides shared behavior,* Subclasses provide variation,* The `is-a` relationship wires them together implicitly at compile time.With composition:* The same variation classes exist,* The same behavior is reused,* But the wiring is explicit and often runtime-configurable.This makes it seem like inheritance adds only:* A fixed, compile-time relationship,* Rather than fundamentally new expressive power.If \"factoring out what varies\" is the justification for the extra classes, then those classes are justified independently of inheritance. That leaves the inheritance *relationship itself* as the only thing left to justify.So the core question becomes:**What does the inheritance relationship actually buy us?**To be clear, I'm not asking \"*when is inheritance convenient?\"* or \"*which one should I prefer?\"*I’m asking:**In what cases is the inheritance relationship itself semantically justified—not just mechanically possible?** In other words, when is the relationship doing real conceptual work, rather than just wiring behavior together?",

This summer, I got interested in software development and started self-studying Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I really enjoyed it and decided to pursue a tech career.I got admitted to UNT for a traditional Computer Science degree, but financially it’s not feasible for me. Collin College offers a Bachelor of Applied Technology in Software Development, which is more workforce-focused than a CS degree. The program covers software development fundamentals, includes a capstone project, and has lighter math requirements. Essentially, it gives the skills needed for a software development career.My main concern is if employers will view this degree the same as a traditional CS degree? I’ve read that a CS degree is considered the “gold standard,” but I’ve also heard otherwise. I’m lucky to be able to pursue school debt-free with VA benefits and family support, so I’m trying to make the most practical choice.Would appreciate feedback or advice. Do you think this degree will open the same doors as a CS degree?",

        "content": "So, I'm working on a project specifically with Neo4J, and my project uses the synchronous driver for the moment (looking forward to switch to async with the upcoming functions). After the database connection is established I need to \"migrate\" the constraints and index configurations to the database. For this, I have added a individual \\`execute\\_query\\` call for each constraint/index query (20 constraint/index queries == 20 execution calls). The reason behind this is I want to make sure each query is run perfectly, and log fails. After running the profiler and seeing it eats time for this migration, I feel like \"this feels dumb\". Instead of directly going to a LLM, I just thought of asking the experts for their ideas first.I got the idea of running them asynchronously, so each call doesn't wait till another finishes. Apart from that, how would you do this?",

In my company, they actively encourage us to use AI tools like Cursor, Windsurf, etc. While I understand their value, I’ve personally been hesitant to rely on AI because I want to learn coding the traditional way and build a strong foundation.This has led me to a bigger question:Do I really need to learn JavaScript in depth anymore?A lot of people around me keep saying that AI can now build almost anything in minutes, and models are improving rapidly. Because of that, I’m wondering whether deeply learning JavaScript and full-stack development is still worth it in the long run.On top of that, one of my relatives suggested a different path. They believe that learning Python and moving into areas like GenAI, machine learning, or understanding how models and agents work (even at a high level) could make it easier to get a job compared to being “just another full-stack developer,” since the market seems saturated.So now I’m confused about a few things:* Should I continue focusing on full-stack development and deeply learn JavaScript?* Should I start learning Python and pivot toward GenAI / ML?* Is it realistic to rely on AI tools without understanding the fundamentals deeply?* As a fresher, which path is more future-proof?I’d really appreciate advice from people who’ve been through this or are already working in the industry. What would you do if you were starting out today?Thanks in advance!",

This vscode-settings-bootstrap is likely hosted by the malware creators as this is the website hosting the actual malware stuff primarily. npoint is sort of just a general service.Notice how the env.js file downloads the malware script containing json from npoint, extracts the obfuscated js from the cookie field and runs it.I have not managed to gather more information about the malware script itself. I know it reads a bunch of system information, reads credentials from filesystem (e.g ssh private keys) and tries to upload them to some domain. I sorta gave up figuring out what domain it is since the script does A LOT of useless work to waste cpu cycles and my virtualbox was simply taking too long to get to the meaty part.I have reported the linked in profile and bitbucket repo.",

Took 1000s of resumes to get a job. I offered to work 80 hours/week to get my first job and did. Since the economy blew up right when I was starting out in tech. I am in the DC area so government contracting saved me.I don't think bootcamp will work today. I went back to school at night and got a Masters in Software Engineering while I was working.Glad I saved my money. I get crippling back pain there are few remote jobs. I have issues with my feet and will need another surgery on both of my feet. Using screens this long has caused really dry eye. I use eye drops all day long. So glad I saved my money. My dad got laid off about my age in the early 2000s and he was out of work for over 3 years. Its tough as you get older. He was in telecom and it was more dead in the 2000s than tech is today.Not sure what I am going to do. Travel is a problem for medical issues. I don't want to discuss my medical issues. Trying to start a diet. Increase my walking ,but that is tough to do in the cold. I live in Northern Virginia. Going to read more. Might see if there are any lonely housewives around I can keep busy.

The LLMs understood parts of the project we've never seen before and were able to fix the issues with more holistic approaches.Much less skill is needed for solving problems that used to involve years of study. I'm worried the main three areas (coding, domain knowledge, system design) that made skilled workers more desirable will no longer matter. Now, workers can simply add the domain knowledge to the context window, use well-established system designs, and generate code adhering to standards with existing prompt templates.The knowledge barrier once attracted me to this profession because of the differentation from low skilled labor. I'm considering switching into a different career with more human judgement involved but it feels pointless. Now anyone, including unskilled workers, can automate their tasks well enough without manual coding.I would like guidance on what paths I should considering switching into, or topics of upskilling, if any, that aren't easily replaceable by unskilled laborers overseeing the work of AI.",

Probably not because they're so focused on doing every, single problem on the face of planet earth just to get rejected and out-competed by a random guy located in fuck knows where because he did 1 more LeetCode problem than you and that was the one both of them got asked and he did it in some time 0.00000000000000000000000000001ms better than the person that got rejected. What a joke this industry has become.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I (31m) am the tech lead of a small \"sub team\". We have 3 different groups reporting to the same manager. This manager is not a software engineer. I work at a FAANG company.My coworker (25m) is incredibly toxic. They have had multiple blow ups at others and myself. They won't use jira, they won't make merge requests, and every meeting with them is like walking on eggshells. They are late with all their code and it's very buggy. In order to not go through the MR process this coworker created their own repo and pushes directly to main. When we asked them to combine repos they get very agitated. We asked them to start making MRs for review and they flat out refuse and it causes the meetings to become very tense. My manager doesn't understand why merge requests are important and sees no issue with the coworker's behavior. We recently hired 2 new senior engineers. Within 1 month, both engineers have had issues with this person. They are both actively involved in the behavioral coaching of this person. One new hire told me \"this guy is the single worst behaved engineer I've ever worked with.\" He expects me, as tech lead, to deal with this situation. I think that's understandable but I have strict instructions to not get involved.I asked my manager to affirm my position as tech lead so I can get this coworker to make MRs and document their designs. My manager said \"No, if I do that then [coworker] will lose their shit and this is a really delicate situation right now.\"This young coworker hates me in particular. Probably because I am in charge? My manager has asked me to stay out of it so he can coach this guy himself. My manager told me \"I've never met someone like this in my entire career. I am completely flummoxed and I have no idea what to do.\"During one very public blow up, my manager was slacking me privately saying \"I'm confused why he's mad\" and \"just drop [this requirement]. You're right but we need him to feel like he's saving face\".The approach that we're taking is to let this coworker fail on his own. We aren't supposed to save their code when we find bugs, we aren't supposed to push for improvements. We are supposed to let them fail so they realize they need help. Our project is off track.One of the new engineers told me they are having a \"very hard time\" on the team because of this person. I feel a responsibility to respond to that but I have strict instructions to stay out of it. ***Okay. So here's my question.I'm being positioned to become the manager of this team. I said No a year ago because this engineer would have been my only report. My manager thinks I have the wrong attitude and \"[I] need to work with [coworker] because we can't just give up on everyone under the age of 30\". I think this person probably needs to be PIPed and let go. At my previous company (also faang) this would have resulted in a pip a long time ago, both for the attitude but also the sheer lack of deliverables.I can stay on the IC ladder and climb this way, but then a new manager will be hired. This hurts my chances of moving into management later. It also annoys my boss who wants me to just deal with the engineer by coaching instead of a PIP.* Should I take the manager position and have this person as my report, knowing my hands are tied when dealing with them? Or should I try to stay as an engineer?* Do I have an obligation to work with this person, like my boss is telling me? Or is this situation already beyond what is acceptable in the workplace?",

I'm 38 now so I'm not young anymore but I still have to work since I can't retire.I've always considered myself as average intelligence for a software engineer with a very strong work ethic. This often got me noticed and promoted at the companies I've worked for. Technically, there are usually a few engineers on the team that are better than me.Interviews were never easy back then for me but I always felt like the jobs were given to me since my experience was great. I would typically talk about my projects and then do some whiteboarding problem where it felt like I was working alongside the interviewer. I think I've had probably 8 interviews in my entire life and got a no offer on 3 of them until recently.Ever since my layoffs, I've failed probably 5 interviews in the first or second round. The furthest I got was 5 rounds(they wanted a few more rounds and I could tell they were not super enthusiastic about me). The interviews seem a lot more toxic recently with interviewers asking me questions like \"what value can you bring if AI can do those things?\" With all these things, I stopped looking for a tech job completely and found a part-time retail job.I'm fortunate enough to have a small savings and the part-time retail job is slowing down my burn. I'm trying to break away from tech right now and find any career worth getting into where I can afford a family in the future ($20/hr in retail is very hard to make work for a single person). I have a year or two to figure something out.I spend some of my free time at the library just reading to get ideas on where I can go but I feel so lost. Here are some options I'm thinking about:**1. Grind leetcode, study AI/design, work on interview skills and keep interviewing until I find a tech job.***Pros:* *- Clear objectives* *- Good pay* *- Job is interesting for the most part**Cons:* *- Layoffs still on the table* *- Extremely difficult to get an offer (I dont even know what to study since questions are so random)* *- I really do not want to grind leetcode anymore***2. Change careers***Pros:* *- Fresh start and something that aligns better with my values* *- Maybe better work-life balance than eng (tradeoff with lower pay is fine)**Cons:* *- Have to do some soul-searching to find next career* *- Probably difficult to switch careers* *- Most jobs are probably slower and less mentally stimulating***3. Start a business***Pros:* *- Be your own boss (kinda not really)* *- No leetcode**Cons:* *- Hard grind that requires all your focus and dedication* *- I prefer more stability*With those 3 options, I'm leaning towards changing careers. The starting a business is something I think about a lot but it's not something I can just pull out of nowhere. The thought of going back into tech gives me anxiety through the roof. Unfortunately, I dont know what careers I can change into. The general field people around reddit have been proposing are the HVAC/therapist/nursing variety.I'm feeling lost right now and just wanted to air some thoughts out. Thanks for reading. Would love any thoughts or stories/experiences on how people are navigating this.",

But the trade offs just seem to get larger each year and the difference between living in a tech hub / not seems to lessen too, opportunity wise.If we look at the primary reason for moving to a tech hub (I.e. Seattle, SF, NYC) it comes down to:- more job opportunities- ability to grow a larger networkWith the advent of online applications & speaking to recruiters virtually, many roles aren’t relegated to those living in a specific city anymore. There may be some preference from certain companies to choose locally, but that’s about it.Networking is a big one, but if you were really dedicated to building a solid network, you could do lots of cold outreach on LinkedIn and attend virtual conferences in the industry. Not saying it would be as effective, but the tradeoff of uprooting your whole life and paying a premium (higher COL) just to network a little more efficiently doesn’t seem to weigh in evenly.From people who have moved for these reasons, curious to hear your opinion.",

        "content": "So I work for a FAANG company as a SWE, 3 YOE, got promoted to mid-level 7 months ago and then switched to a chill team. The work is more boring than I expected coming from a fast-paced, cutting-edge team building brand new services leveraging AI agents to now maintaining legacy services written over a decade ago - very simple services but with high scale (millions of transactions per second).The path to senior engineer here is slim, maybe even non-existent because we already have one on the team and there isn't any real scope in terms of next-level projects for promo. My teammates are also great but not amazingly talented in the sense that there's not a lot for me to learn from them. The pace is slow and the work is quite mundane and nothing to do with AI - it feels like I'm missing the AI wave. So there's minimal career growth here.But apart from that... it's just really good compared to all my previous teams - really nice and fun teammates and manager, love just hanging out with them, we have lunch together everyday, go for outings once or twice a month, play games, talk about a lot of things outside work, the on-call load is very low, no pressure due to relaxed deadlines, excellent work-life balance, minimal meetings, flexible timings, the pay is great, almost guaranteed to be safe from layoffs.... it sometimes feels too good to be true after grinding for the past 3 years on multiple other teams. There's only like 2-4hrs of actual work a day..... and I even look forward to Mondays now (?!)But yet, after many months of relaxing after promo doing not much impactful/interesting work, the itch to do more and grow is back again, especially being young and single with a lot of time to dedicate to work, but I'm not sure if I want to leave something so good in every other aspect... it's hard to come across such gigs over the span of a career and maybe I should just enjoy the chill life while it lasts - but it feels like it'll last forever for this team :) this is like the true definition of rest and vest but maybe I'm too young for that already.So I'm planning to stay at least for a few more months, but not sure after that. I'm also interested in maybe going to a startup, but perhaps that's best to do once I have 5 YOE and can apply for senior instead of chasing promo here which is quite difficult irrespective of team. I could also try switching internally to a team with better work and better promo prospects but not sure if it's worth giving up all the good things here for career growth - vs. just rest and vest... what would you do in this situation ?",

        "content": "My entire team is filled with senior developers and I am the only recent entry hire. When I was interning, there was another entry developer that stayed on for around two years but left due to no promotion (they said he kinda sucked delivery wise).I am told I do good work and meet expectations, I expect a promotion this year after a year of work post grad. But our team is a little dysfunctional in the sense that it isn't a team and individuals are siloed on specific applications. We have little to no documentation. So anytime I am introduced to new tech or systems, my seniors really do hand hold me, to which I am appreciative of. I am not the type that asks the same questions over and over, I just need to see it once throughly and I can replicate what they've taught me.The problem is, after a year of this siloed style of work, I am getting burnt out. I can not stand coding. There have been multiple occasions for multiple projects where I have stayed at work alone and extremely late, staying until 8-10pm, just typing away at my computer. Recently I have been tasked with developing an entire web app alone. It's functionality seems simple but no application meant for production is ever simple. We are understaffed, so there is nobody else to divy up project tasks with. I've asked if we have any plans to get more entry hires on the team and it is always met with a soft no, the company is on a hiring freeze, economy yada yada.I talk with my friends from uni who are all working. Their teams practice agile and scrum philosophies, and their coding tasks are divided up for multipe team members. They love their jobs. Their eyes bulge when I tell them about my work load and my work effort. I always feel unfortunate when I hear about how lucky they have been, but really, it sounds like those types of tech teams are the standard and I am the unlucky one to have landed in an underdeveloped team. Senior developers can afford to ignore a team dynamic like this and still be successful in it.In my eyes, saying that this is too much work is basically telling them I am not up for the job and I might as well quit honestly. I know I can handle it, I mean I am meeting their latest expectation for an entire web application on my own, but I do not want to handle this anymore. It used to make me so happy to run an application and see the results of my hard work in action, but I genuinely can't even stand opening visual studio anymore.With how bad the job market is, I am scared to walk away. But I know if I continue to eat my feelings about this, I might turn impulsive and quit without any plan for my career or cut ties in a bad way. I don't want to fall into a slump.",

I generally love my job—I own features from backend to frontend, write my own Terraform, manage GCP resources, the works. It feels fulfilling to ship stuff that people actually see and use.The problem I’m experiencing is trying to get an internal promotion. I’ve been acting at a Senior level for a while. My manager pushed for my promotion last year, but the Director blocked it because they haven’t heard enough about me to deserve it and my manager cited \"people outside the team don't know me\" (I'm fully remote and introverted, don’t get a lot of opportunities to network). Now my manager wants me to rotate to another team for a quarter just to \"prove visibility\" before they consider the promo again. It feels like moving goalposts and political hoop-jumping, and hasn't been sitting well with me since.Recently, a recruiter reached out to me about a job at a late stage health tech startup, I went through the whole interview process not expecting to get it, but I did receive an offer. I negotiated it up and signed, but now I’m having intense buyer's remorse.* **Positives:** Senior title, good pay bump. Marketable tech stack.* **Negatives:** The work sounds like it could be pretty dry, mostly data processing and generating reports. No Greenfield development and I’d be working in a monorepo. I’m worried I’ll lose that spark I get from building new features for the website.* **Some weirdness:** I’d be reporting to a “manager” who is also an IC on the team. He’s never managed before and is new to interviewing. I’m worried he won’t have the clout to advocate for me or help me grow.Has anyone made a jump like this? Is reporting to a fellow IC on my team a massive red flag?I’m afraid I’m leaving a job I enjoy (mostly) for a place where I’ll be bored and stuck, just for money and to chase a title my current company is gatekeeping.",

However, my team’s scope of work has become smaller recently, supporting UX Design Systems for our product. I did this type of work earlier in my career and I’m not that excited about it. I’m also fighting for scope with a peer manager. My product area is pretty high pressure with 50-60 hour work weeks, but it’s predictable and stable. It’s highly unlikely I’ll be promoted any time soon.Given this situation I’m thinking about changing teams and moving into a more exploratory team that works on AI applied to concept product features and tries to get AI features into production. This seems more interesting, but I’d have to give up my manager role and go back to being an IC. I know several people on this new team, including the new manager and they all seem great. However, concept product features seem risky in a time when companies are trying to monetize as much as possible. There’s also no guarantee that I’ll be able to be a manager again on this new team.More context, I’m 46 and hope to stay working in tech until I’m 55. Getting direct AI experience seems useful to stay relevant for the next few years. My pay will stay the same regardless if I’m a manager or IC.",

Preferably BC, AB or Ottawa. Any advice on timing, salary expectations, or companies to look at?**TL;DR:** Mid-20s, **5.5 YOE** (mostly .NET), making 95k CAD TC in a LCOL prairie city. Job is stable, good team, good projects but salary/title likely stagnant. Feeling lonely due to lack of cultural community. Thinking of moving to **BC, Alberta, Ottawa, or GTA** for better pay + diversity. Prefer mid-to-large companies for stability (banks, insurance, or legacy company). Planning to apply early/mid 2026.**Question:** Do I have a good shot at landing something in those cities? What are realistic salaries and companies to target?",

        "content": "Hi everyone!I'm 30, from Portugal, did a cs licence and master's and started working last year in a big 4, so I only have 1 year of experience doing data engineering. My goal has always been to be a versatile software engineer, I've always wanted to work with data, cloud, machine learning, devops (later in my career), qa and so on. But lately, my mind has been plagued with insecurities and I feel worried about my future. I'll try to provide as much context as possible.For starters, I have no idea where AI will take us and I'm starting to feel dependant on it after going through 4+ years without using it in college. The fun part of this field, for me, has always been to think and develop a solution to a problem, but I'm not a fast learner or fast thinker, and by the time I think of something, Copilot is giving me a much better answer in less than a minute. I don't know when and where to draw the line, when do I start to think \"Maybe I'm using too much AI now\" or \"I'm an engineer, I shouldn't be asking AI to help me solve this\"?Second, I feel like this field is starting to become a bit of everything, everywhere, all at once. There's constantly a new tech or stack to learn, then there's AI that you either embrace or refuse (with no clear winner here), then you also have to learn stuff from other subfields because they lay off people and you have to do the job of two, and the list goes on. I get home tired from +8h of work, I don't want to look at a screen and think \"Oh let's build a fun project or learn a new stack!\". I do try to get as much cloud certificates (aws, gc etc) as possible, since our company provides us the vouchers, but that's as far as I can motivate me to go.Then, I also feel like I'm trapped in this job because it's a project lottery and the market isn't looking fun for juniors. I'm working on building agents for our company and while this feels very up to date, I'm afraid it's only another hype that will fade with time and not get much use in the future. Somehow, due to the fact that I'm not coding much, I feel like I'll unlearn everything I've worked on for the past few years (and I did forget most of the stuff from college already) and then I won't have the required skills for better jobs in the future.I also really dislike the country I live in because of our extremely high rent prices and very low salaries (a 1bedroom apt is 50% of my salary right now). This makes me want to move to another country, but I don't know if it might be a good fit, if the market is also terrible there or if I even have a shot with all the competition.Bottom line of all of this is: **I never know if what I'm doing will help me grow and prepare me for a better future, and I don't know what's the right path to follow because I'm in constant doubt and uncertainty. I can't get motivated to work because I don't know if what I'm doing is meaningful to my future and I can't focus on one thing at a time.**Have any of you felt like this or have any advice to help me address this?",

I spoke with them because I am also interested in a cybersecurity career as well. While I enjoy writing software more, I feel cybersecurity will be a more secure career in the long term.The truth is that I will take any tech job I can get, for any salary above minimum wage. But I understand that I need to have more specific goals and a plan. So I’m leaning towards committing to cybersecurity, creating a 5 year plans. As for what area in cybersecurity, I don’t know, but I’m thinking DevSecOps or other software security roles.My understanding is that cybersecurity is not an intro role and I need to work on personal project + certifications -> help desk role -> IT role -> more cyber security focused role.There’s so many certifications out there, I was recommend ISC2 to start with by the person I spoke to. I’m a little nervous about how expensive most certifications are, and ISC2 has an annual fee. What have I done so far:I have a portfolio with 3 demos for apps I made , some using ML. For example I made a custom pipeline that predicts if someone will be approved a bank loan based on historical data. This portfolio probably won’t help if I pivot to cybersecurity.Any advice on creating a plan in general, or choosing a career path, or what certifications to go for with the path I described would be greatly appreciated.",

I'm looking to change that, and create strong projects that I can be proud to show off to others.I'm considering doing the following projects for my portfolio:- A game engine (or something that involves graphics programming)- A full stack app- Some sort of specialized app (I was thinking something to do with OS stuff) - If I have time, maybe a mobile appI'm passionate about a lot of things which I struggle with because it's harder for me to finish projects as I usually move onto the next one (or learning something new) before completing the current one.Anyhow I guess I was wondering if the projects I listed above would look good on a portfolio from a hiring manager's perspective? I still don't know which area within software development that I wanna work in, but I'm the most passionate about embedded systems, web dev, and game dev.This post I suppose can serve as both a question and discussion. How many projects should a portfolio have and what types look good?",

Yet, I would like to know what is the market like for freelancing.I have read that for Java Spring Boot developing it is one of the least requested since it is a lot of work that requires a lot of budget and time to develop and deploy applications. I am also not interested in something like Javascript nor frontend developing.My skills are in python and C++ but never done a project nor worked with a framework. Can you give me advice on which technologies are on demand and well paid when it comes to programming languages?I forgot to mention that in my current work almost all days, in reality, I am working up to 3 hours because the job is so relaxed from my side of microservices. So even if I don't end up able to switch to developing Java microservices in spring boot full time at least I want to use that dead time actually working on stuff and earning money from it.",

After dabbling in various areas that tech has to offer through internships and projects, I became interested in building the systems/infrastructure behind the AI/ML models that are in use nowadays. However, I couldn't find much information online on what this role even does because it seems relatively new and highly specialized. I am hoping to gather insight from industry professionals on things like:1. Is AI/ML Infrastructure basically just DevOps/MLOps? Or is it more involved (i.e. coding-wise, distributed systems, etc.)? 2. Could you explain what the day-to-day looks like? If you could also describe what a typical sprint (something like a new project task) looks like, that'd be great too. 3. Is a Master's/PhD necessary for this type of engineering? Personally, I am planning on attending my school's +1 Master's program, which (hopefully) will complement my knowledge/skills in this speciality. 4. On a related note... Is this role entry-level friendly? I.e. is it something that will be extremely difficult to break into as a new grad? If so, what would the career progression look like to eventually end here? 5. What type of courseload is most important? I'll be taking Distributed Systems next semester, Operating Systems in my senior year... It's admittedly quite \"late\" in my college career since I took a while trying to figure out what I wanted to do. These are recommendations that ChatGPT recommended to me but am seeking some further details from real experts and professionals.

There was a rumor that existing employees would be given equity. What ended up actually happening was that silently, about 1/3 of the employees were actually given c-shares/equity in the company. It wasn't just by title (ie, managers and above). It seemed to be almost arbitrary, perhaps based on some hidden merit or perceived importance to the company. I only found out about it because of work I do with our legal team, so clearly this wasn't made public to the entire company.I am not sure how to feel about this. Obviously, a privately held company can operate and do whatever they feel is best. However, when one of the core values of the company is transparency and honesty, I find it disappointing and troubling that they would handle things in this way, creating two tiers of \"value\" amongst the employees.",

        "content": "am about to start applying to new jobs again after being at my first job out of school for 4 years. My question is this, if you apply for multiple SWE positions at a company and one recruiter gets back to you first and you start the process but fail at say the 2nd round, if another recruiter for the other position you applied to at the same place reaches out could you just start the process again and hope you get a better problem that you can solve. I am asking this because a few years ago I did this scenario where I went through one cycle and got to the 2nd round but did not pass, then that same week another recruiter for the other position I applied to reached out to start. Being the naive new grad I was, I thought I was being a good boy by being honest and telling the recruiter I had already gone through the process recently and if I could still proceed with his cycle. Obviously he did not let me lol. Looking back I am wondering if I should just keep my mouth shut and not said anything. I know this might vary per company depending on how generic early round interviews and if they keep you in a general pool and then narrowing the team at the end vs a place where each job posting going down separate cycles. I know companies have a cooldown period when you can apply again but I’m wondering if you fail early enough in the cycle could you test your chances again in this scenario.I would appreciate hearing peoples’ experiences on this, thanks!",

Initially started as a IC analyst, later promoted to senior/engineer. I spent the majority of my time at that company in a hybrid technical/leadership role (5 years). Moved to a government department in 2021 as a data scientist, quickly promoted to leading the DS team and worked in senior DS leadership positions since, mostly management responsibilities with some technical data science work. At the moment I wear a lot of hats and am good at everything, but not a specialist in anything. Basically anything remotely linked to data becomes my remit. Plus, a lot of my time gets soaked up in HR issues & firefighting. so I can’t focus as much with being a technical specialist as I am spread thin although I’ve always wanted to progress as a data engineer. I have had a good career with executive level responsibilities and I am wondering if I should just fully pivot into pure leadership now, and maybe make it a goal to get a “head of” or director position in the next few years. I’m hesitant because I still feel fairly young and that I have more to give when it comes to engineering but I’m not sure what the best path is for me. It’s just becoming abundantly clear that I can’t do it all and I probably should narrow my focus. Interested to hear from anyone who made a similar decision and what swayed you.",

        "content": "This story might be all too familiar. Context I am a 5th year student about to graduate thankful to have a full time job lined up. I am 70% excited 30% scared. I went into CS because I genuinely enjoyed coding from a young age, might I say even good at it. I was able to spend hours at my desk working on personal coding projects, or overengineering assignments simply for the joy of it. I was so good in fact I remember in first year for our introductory coding course I rolled out of bed 2 min before my exam (covid times so online) finished the exam in 15 minutes went back to sleep and got a high 90 on it.My Data Structures course was the final time I coded without the help of AI. it was taught in C and I was able to comfortably implement various Data Structures, like trees, linked lists, etc in C with a full conceptual understanding but since AI came out I have fallen into the hell hole that is vibe coding, and I feel embarrassed and scared. during my internships it first began with using AI to ask for help to make a component look good, or refractor some code, or debug something. then at one point asking it to implement entire components. and during my final internship basically vibe coding my entire project. Although i still would dive in and make sure the code made sense and that I could explain it. Everything I vibe coded impressed managers and my team who went on to actually implement my project into production. However I still fell like a fraud. All my uni courses I have more or less AI'd my way through with a few exceptions. I even remember one time I promised myself not to use AI for an assignment. so I used vs code instead of Cursor. In the file i remember adding a comment like:`################` `# Course Code` `# Assignment X` `################` `# Question 1: Pascal Triangle.`Based of just that that copilot provided a tab that was the entire assignment done, I of course accepted the tab and it passed all test cases without a hitch. I was initially excited about how much more productive AI made me, but as of late I have begun despising my dependence on AI to product. I act as a high-level manager just prompting it what to do. I no longer have the ability to understand the code. so if it breaks it's just me asking it to fix it again. and with me starting my full-time position in the new year I'm worried that this hole I have dug myself into is gonna be my demise. It has affected my confidence greatly because I simply do not understand what is being written anymore. it's more or less a foreign language. I do not know what best practices are anymore.I see my peers that did not rely on AI the same way, have a much deeper understanding of their work, and review code at a much more intricate level. They also build much better looking projects than me and are quicker as well, as they use AI more as a helping hand than doing their entire jobI feel it is too late to brush off my JavaScript book and go through all the concepts again. I just need some advice on what to do at this point. I'm joining a fast-moving team and am expected to start producing results very quickly. I dont want to rely on vibe-coding, because I know it wont be outputting the best code. but at the same time I cannot rely on myself as I barely know anything. I guess I'm trying to tackle the fundamental problem that I have no real valuable skillset at this point that is of benefit to anyone.I did not use AI to write or proofread this post so forgive any grammar mistakes please!",

I started in August 2025 and was placed on a team that primarily works with MUMPS (old database language) and a very small amount of SQL. Unfortunately, my day-to-day work has little to no exposure to more modern stacks.Some teams/ apps at Epic do work with more modern technologies (C#, TypeScript, React, etc.), but:* You need at least 1 year of tenure before you can apply for a team change* You need to be in good standing with your TL* There’s no guarantee you’ll be able to transfer, or get the specific team/stack you want* Even when modern languages are used (C#, TypeScript, React), Epic tends to use them in fairly weird or non-traditional ways for frontend and middleware, which doesn’t translate cleanly to industry-standard experience eitherMy main concern is losing competitiveness in the broader SWE job market by spending too much time working with a dated tech stack.I’m trying to decide when it makes the most sense to apply for a SWE role at another company, and I’m stuck between two options (or any alternatives if those make more sense):**Option 1: Apply after \\~1 YOE (new grad / early career roles)** Pros:* New grad roles tend to have less strict requirements* Having \\~1 YOE might make me more competitive than fresh gradsCons:* Job market is rough right now* Competing with a very large pool of new grads**Option 2: Apply after \\~2 YOE (junior roles)** Pros:* Presumably fewer applicants than new grad rolesCons:* Likely won’t meet job requirements due to lack of real-world experience with modern languages/frameworks* Concerned I’ll have “wasted” 2 years learning skills that don’t transfer well outside of EpicI do have experience working with modern programming languages/ frameworks in college, and do plan on making some more personal projects to increase my competitiveness, but it's hard to find the time with a full-time job. Personal projects also can't compare to real production experience.For those who’ve worked at Epic or similar companies with niche or legacy stacks, transitioned from older tech to modern stacks, or hired/interviewed junior engineers: When would you start applying, and how risky is staying longer? Is the Epic name plus general SWE experience enough to offset the tech stack issue?Thanks in advance!",
