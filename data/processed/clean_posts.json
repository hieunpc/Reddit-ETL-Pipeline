Even when it’s like 5 “easy” things, I freeze and can’t decide what to start with.\\- I ask for validation way too much. Like I’ll finish something and still feel the urge to ask “is this right?” even when nothing is on fire. Feels kinda toddler-ish. \\- If I stop using a tool for even a week, I forget it. Then I’m digging through old PRs and docs like I never learned it in the first place.\\- Switching context messes me up hard. One interruption and it takes forever to get my mental picture back.I’m not posting this to be dramatic, I just want to know if this is common and what people do about it.If you’re a data engineer (or similar) with ADHD, what do you struggle with the most? Any coping systems that actually worked for you? Or do you also feel like you’re constantly re-learning the same tools?Would love to hear how other people handle it.",

        "content": "Hi DEs,And the people using Fivetran..We are experiencing a huge spike (more than double) in monthly costs following the March 2025 changes, and now with the January 2026 pricing updates.Previously, Fivetran calculated the cost per million Monthly Active Rows (MAR) at the account level. Now, it has shifted to the connector (or connection) level. This means costs increase significantly — often exponentially — for any connector handling no more than one million MAR per month. If a customer has multiple connectors below that threshold, the overall pricing shoots up dramatically.What is Fivetran trying to achieve with this change?Fivetran's official explanation (from their 2025 Pricing FAQ and documentation) is that moving tiered discounts (lower per-MAR rates for higher volumes) from account-wide to per-connector aligns pricing more closely with their actual infrastructure and operational costs. Low-volume connectors still require setup, ongoing maintenance, monitoring, support, and compute resources — the old model let them \"benefit\" from bulk discounts driven by larger connectors, effectively subsidizing them.Will Fivetran survive this one? My customer is already thinking about alternatives.. what is your opinion?",

Do I need to learn all this stuff before I can get a job that’s “equivalent”? Or does having solid experience with ETL, pipelines, orchestration, DBs etc still count for a lot?

I write data science style procedural code and like to inspect and muck with stuff every step along the way otherwise I feel blind. It feels as I am in a live debugger. Even when I write an api, I have to take that function in a jupyter notebook and run it there and copy paste and go back and forth etc. I personally dislike functions as well unless neccesary and there's reuse required. I am not sure what to do but seems like in real ides there's tools like debuggers and interactive window which helps with this. But just wanted to learn from others how can I write clean software style code where I can still not lose visibility of the data. Thanks guys.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm pretty sure this isn't the norm, but I feel so exhausted with my job. The main problem is my team is not good and the company, while overall is very good/well regarded globally/competitive, is very pretentious. My job is not very challenging. In fact, it's the mundanity of it that exhausts me. Everything is the same over and over to process client data. There's almost 0 feedback/appreciation for it too, and I'm pretty sure the successor of the data basically passes off my work to others and pretends he did it. I of course could push myself more, learn new tech, and integrate it. But I just don't feel motivated. I still plan to do some online free courses about AI/ML soon.But longterm, I'm not sure this job will sustain me. I have a noticeably worse mindsets (become a bit egotistical and negative myself, snarky, etc.). I'm in my early 30s, but about 10 years ago I switched from pre-medicine to tech. I was heavily invested in the the med route and had already applied to medical school. Then I spent too much time around some people I shouldn't have, and changed paths. Looking back, I probably wish I stayed in healthcare, though it has its own challenges and of course worse lifestyle usually. That said, there's no way I would want to switch back now.All that to say, for so much of my life, I was looking at a career that directly helped people...so maybe that is part of my problem now. I could very well be in a 1/3 life crisis now, but overall okay (so dont worry :)). I'm debating a small to significant career change.I think at the least, to save my sanity, I absolutely need to change jobs in the next year or two, if even that. Otherwise, I fear what my mind and personality will become. Things I've considered:- online courses (for sure will do in the interim)- a second masters (in tech related or business related field - my undergrad was economics, which I enjoyed)- no further education (besides online stuff), but just change jobs- stay at current job and do bare minimum BUT try to create a startup on the side (one big goal of mine is to be an entrepreneur some day).Anyways, I digress. One reason for this post is because (1) I want to know if others feel this way in DE and (2) I am wondering if there are more rewarding industries out there. Something I've always been interested in is sustainability or in general, somehow making the world a better place. As cliche as it sounds, it'd be awesome to use my skills to improve the planet/humanity. I'm still looking at jobs and applying, but wanted to see if anyone here has recommendations. My fear is that whatever company I transition to will just be more of the same. I've been at a number of companies and in different job roles over the years, but there has not been a single one that I just loved (or even half loved). Everything felt like a cog in the wheel, like it doesn't help humanity, and just puts money in someone else's pocket.Curious to hear if others feel this and if this is just the way of life. Or if there is something more out there that just needs to be found.",

How much can I reasonably expect to be paid if I were to move to a different position?3. What should I seek out opportunity wise? Is it worth staying in DE? Should I continue to also search for SWE positions? Is there any other option that's substantially better than what I am doing right now? Thank you for any appropriate answers in advance",

AND, right to the notebook there is AI (LLM, I don't know. You name it.) I took the requirements, give it to AI and asked to write a promt. You see, I even didn't have to write the prompt. Now, next step is give the promt to the AI and ask him wirte python code. Now, it amaizing that the python code is correct. So, all I had to do is click 'Run', and that is it. I sucessfully submitted the project and earned some points. Done. Now, the question that bothers me is 'what is the future for dataengineering jobs?' Isn't it bothering you guys?

        "content": "1 year on from a disastrous tech assessment ended up landing me the job, a recruiter reached out and offered me a chat for what is basically my dream roll. AWS Data Engineer to develop an ingestion and analytics pipelines from IoT devices. Pretty much owning the provisioning and pipeline process from the ground up supporting a team of data scientists and analysts. Every other chat I've been to in my past 3 jobs has been me battling with imposter syndrome. But today, I got this, I know this shiz. I've been shoehorning AWS into my workflow wherever I can, I built a simulated corporate VPC and production ML workloads, learned the CDK syntax, built an S3 lake house.But I go to the chat and its really light on actual AWS stuff. They are more interested in my thought process and problem solving. Very refreshing, enjoyable even. So why am I falling over on the world's simplest pipelines. 10 million customer dataset, approx 10k product catalogue, product data in one table, transaction data captured from a streaming source daily. One of the bullet points is \"The marketing team are interested in tracking the number of times an item is bought for the first time each day\" explain how you would build this pipeline.Already covered flattening the nested JSON data into a columner silver layer. I read how many times an item is bought the first time each day as \"how do you track first occurance of an item bought that day\"The other person in the chat had to correct my thinking and say no, what they mean is how do you track when the customer first purchased an item overall. But then Im reeling from the screw up. I talk about creating a staging table with the 1st occurance each day and then adding the output of this to a final table in the gold layer. She says so where would the intermediate table live, I say it wouldn't be a real table its an in memory transformation step (meaning Id use filter pushdown and schema inference of the parquet in silver to pull the distinct customerid, productid, min(timestamp) and merge into gold where customerid productid doesn't exist. she said that would be unworkable with data of this size to have an in memory table, and rather than explain I didnt mean that I would dump 100 million rows into EC2 RAM, I kind of just said ah yeah, it makes sense to realise this in its own bucket. But im already in a twist by this point. Then on the drive home I'm thinking that was so dumb, if I had read the question properly its so obvious that I should have just explained that I'd create a look up table with the pertinent columns, customerid, productid, firstpurchase date. the pipeline is new data, first purchase per customer of that days data, merge into where not exists (maybe a overwrite if new firstpurchasedate < current firstpurchasedate to handle late arrival). So this is eating away at me and I think screw it, im just going to email the other chat person and explain what I meant or how I would actually approach it. So i did. it was a long boring email (similar to this post). But rather than make me feel better about the screw up Im now just in full cringe mode about emailing the chatter. its not the done thing. Recruiter didn't even call for a debrief. fml chat = view of the int",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I work at a company with a fairly mature data stack, but we still struggle with environment management and upstream dependency changes.Our data engineering team builds foundational warehouse tables from upstream business systems using a standard dev/test/prod setup. That part works as expected: they iterate in dev, validate in test with stakeholders, and deploy to prod.My team sits downstream as analytics engineers. We build data marts and models for reporting, and we also have our own dev/test/prod environments. The problem is that our environments point directly at the upstream teams’ dev/test/prod assets. In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing. That is expected behavior, but it makes downstream development painful.As a result:* We rarely see “reality” until we deploy to prod.* People often develop against prod data just to get stability (which goes against CI/CD)* Dev ends up running on full datasets, which is slow and expensive.* Issues only fully surface in prod.I’m considering proposing the following:* **Dev:** Use a small, representative slice of upstream data (e.g., ≤10k rows per table) that we own as stable dev views/tables.* **Test:** A direct copy of prod to validate that everything truly works, including edge cases.* **Prod:** Point to upstream prod as usual.Does this approach make sense? How do teams typically handle downstream dev/test when upstream data is constantly changing?Related question: schema changes. Upstream tables aren’t versioned, and schema changes aren’t always communicated. When that happens, our pipelines either silently miss new fields or break outright. Is this common? What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?",

        "author": "IGDev",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Most of you work with Python and SQL exclusively, but that’s okay your feedback is still important. Almost 10 years ago I started working for a .NET embedded BI reporting tool. This kind of tool typically sits after ETL process, however a lot of businesses don’t follow that and simply want ETL with their dashboards all in one. The problem with that is there’s a huge gap in .NET for that functionality. Since that wasn’t the product direction, 5 years ago I started letting out that frustration by starting to code a framework that was extendable with connectors, sinks, and at the center of it was an in-memory analytical database.Over the years I continued to work on it off and on, finally to the point where I am now. I have several connectors, an in-memory analytical database (DataBlock), my own columnar file format and engine that I nicknamed Velocity (VelocityDataBlock), ML (VectorBlock), and other various libraries for UI (UIBlock). The last two haven’t been publicly exposed yet. Here’s some code snippets of how the code looks.### DataBlock var processed = await DataBlock.Connector.LoadCsvAsync(\"raw_data.csv\") .Select(\"id\", \"name\", \"value\", \"category\") .Where(\"value\", 0, ComparisonOperator.GreaterThan) .Compute(\"processed_value\", \"value * 1.1\") .Sort(SortDirection.Descending, \"processed_value\") .Head(1000);### VelocityDataBlockThe snippet below materializes a DataBlock after Execute() is called. var topCategories = velocityBlock .Where(\"Year\", 2024) .Pivot(\"Category\", \"Region\", \"Sales\", AggregationType.Sum) .Sort(SortDirection.Descending, \"East_Sales\") .Head(5) .Execute();It’s also possible to do something similar to what Polars does by using AsResult(). var result = velocityBlock .Where(\"OrderDate\", DateTime.Today.AddYears(-1), ComparisonOperator.GreaterThan) .AsResult(); // Stream result rows long totalRevenue = 0; foreach (var row in result.EnumerateRows()) { totalRevenue += row.GetValue(\"Revenue\"); } // Materialize the result var data = result.ToDataBlock();### SinksPDF export of a DataBlock. var pdfSink = new PdfSink { Title = \"Data Export Report\", Author = \"Datafication System\", Description = \"Automated data extraction from web sources\", RowLimit = 1000, LandscapeOrientation = true }; using var pdfStream = await pdfSink.Transform(dataBlock); using var fileStream = File.Create(\"report.pdf\"); await pdfStream.CopyToAsync(fileStream);Many of the connectors also have their sink output too, for example CSV. using Datafication.Sinks.Connectors.CsvConnector; var csvOutput = dataBlock.CsvStringSink();There’s honestly too much I could write about, but before I ask the feedback questions, I’ll throw in that the VelocityDataBlock can typically achieve 60M rows/sec on my 2020 iMac. However, I’ve learned that .NET isn’t optimized the best on MacOS and if you try on Windows (which I’ve verified) you can easily get 100M rows a second. At some point I’ll put up a benchmark and the results. If you’re curious to test on your end, try the QueryPerformance sample from the Datafication.Storage.Velocity repo. Use “dotnet run -c Release sf50” for testing with 50M rows of data.### Feedback Questions1. In a data world predominantly using Python and tools like dbt is there a place for an SDK like this?2. Was the syntax easy to understand based on the tools you’ve used?3. Was there any functionality that you frequently use that wasn’t available?If you have any other thoughts or questions, let me know.## GitHub Organization[https://github.com/DataficationSDK](https://github.com/DataficationSDK)",

        "content": "Afternoon folks, long time lurker, first time poster. I have spent some time recently getting up to speed with different ways to work with data in/out of Apache Iceberg and exploring different analytics tools / visualisation options. I use Cloudflare a lot for my side projects, and have recently seen the 'Beta' data platform products incl. the idea of https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/. So, I decided to give it a go and see if I can build a real end to end data pipeline (the example is product analytics in this case but you could use it for other purposes of course). I hope the link to my own project is OK, but it's MIT / open source: https://github.com/cliftonc/icelight.My reflections / how it works:\\- Its definitely a beta, as I had to re-create the pipelines once or twice to get it all to actually sync through to R2 ... but it really works! \\- There is a bit of work to get it all wired up, hence why I created the above project to try and automate it. \\- You can run analytics tools (in this example DuckDB - https://duckdb.org/) in containers now and use these to analyse data on R2. \\- Workers are what you use to bind it all together, and they work great. \\- I think (given zero egress fees in R2) you could run this at very low cost overall (perhaps even inside the free tier if you don't have a lot of data or workload). No infrastructure at all to manage, just 2 workers and a container (if you want DuckDB). \\- I ran into quite a few issues with DuckDB as I didn't fully appreciate that its single process constraints - I had always assumed it was actually a real server - but actually it seems to now work very well with a bit of tweaking, and the fact it is near Postgres capable but running on parquet files on R2 is nothing short of amazing. \\- I have it flushing every minute at the moment to R2, not sure what this means longer term but will send a lot more data at it over coming weeks and see how it goes. Happy to talk more about it if anyone is interested in this, esp. given Cloudflare is very early into the data engineering world. I am in no way affiliated with Cloudflare, though if anyone from Cloudflare is listening I would be more than happy to chat about my experiences :D",

Still, you’d like to extract as much structured information as possible about the data being processed, e.g.:•data types (scalar, array, table, dataframe, tensor, …)•shapes / dimensions (where inferable)•constraints (ranges, required fields, checks in code)•formats (CSV, JSON, NetCDF, pandas, etc.)•input vs output rolesA rough mental model is something like the RStudio environment pane (showing object types, dimensions, ranges), but inferred statically from code only.I’m aware this will always be partial and heuristic, the goal is best-effort structured metadata (e.g. JSON), not perfect reconstruction.My question:Have you seen frameworks, pipelines, or research/tools that tackle this kind of problem?(e.g. static analysis, AST-based approaches, schema inference, type systems, code-to-metadata, etc.)I have worked so far asking code authors to annotate their interface functions using the python typing.annotated framework, but I want to start taking as much documentation work of them as possible.I know it’s mostly a crystal sphere task.For deduktive reasoning, llms are also possible as parts of the pipeline.Language-agnostic answers welcome (Python/R/Julia/C++/…), as are pointers to papers, tools, or even “this is a bad idea because X” takes.",

        "content": "Hey hey fellow data engineers,i just started a new job some months ago for a company which has a pretty wild 'organically grown' data landscape to put it mildly. The two main data storages are Filemaker applications built by non-IT consultants a while ago. They got their tweaks but for the most part serve the purpose. I was hired to kind of consolidate the data into future structure, to connect it and prepare the introduction of more serious data analysis aside of crappy excel exports.As Filemaker JDBC routine and possibilities are rather limited and slow i wish to pull together both databases into respective schemes in one postgres db via python as this is my most convenient set-up. Therefore i got my own server with a bit of space. I've written some first scripts and tests and for the smaller one of the two databases this works pretty good and im quite satisfied with the result.The problems start to occur with scaling as the other database is significantly larger and my (admittedly not very storage efficient) code would take way too long and consume way to much storage in the target structure, but as a one man DE team i just don't have sufficient time to plan a highly efficient, totally aligning target structure for the existing dbs.So my question is if anybody has some best practises, ideas, experience, tips on how to tackle this problem. I am not fixed to the idea of that postgres db. The main goal would be to be able to systematically analyse that Filemaker DBs via SQL like queries (Joins, CTEs, Views, sophisticated reportings) and also to be able to connect the data of the two DBs. Right now i can satisfy basic analysis requirements via customly built python scripts which connect to both db's via JDBC but this is rather time consuming and far from the ideal state in my head. Thanks for your ideas! tl;dr: I need to systematically connect and analyse two rather big Filemaker DBs with the goal of unifying them at some point in the future, ideally via python into a postgres db and im in need for tips, best practises, hints.",

After \\~5 years of professional experience, I think there are two main areas where my background is weaker than what a lot of current data engineering roles expect:1. Cloud – I have some foundational certs in Snowflake and Azure, but no real hands on professional cloud experience. My previous roles were mostly on-prem.2. Common industry standard tools – Things like Spark, Airflow, and dbt, which show up constantly in job descriptions.I’m looking at a couple of learning paths that would be pretty time-intensive, so I’m trying to pick what will give me the most ROI. Right now I’m debating between:1. Going deeper on cloud with a data engineering focused cert (leaning toward the AWS Data Engineer cert to diversify beyond Azure/Snowflake).2. Spending time learning Spark and Airflow (or similar other tools) and building a realistic ETL pipeline I can put in a public repo—possibly even deploying it in the cloud with a real cluster as second step.For a bit more context: I’m targeting mid level IC roles. I’m confident in my Python and SQL and feel good on data fundamentals (currently reading *Fundamentals of Data Engineering* as a refresh/gap fill). I’ve been getting some interviews, but mostly with companies that don’t yet have data engineers or don’t fully understand the role. Ideally, I’m trying to land somewhere with an established data team and the chance to learn from more senior engineers.Which would you prioritize first? Or is there something else you’d recommend focusing on instead?",

I was previously leading a team as an aws solution architect but felt I was leaning too much on star schema design and got the idea the leadership wanted pipelines. I made it work but constantly questioned how such an unconnected reporting layer could keep metrics consistent across company reporting. Because of this I took this job because they were planning to migrate to the cloud and my background would have helped. unfortunately shortly after I started my manager started butting heads with the consultant who was helping us reshare into a more current architecture. Because of that we were rebadged without getting any cloud training and I'm screwed. I'm working on the AWS data engineer certification, done with a class and working through the practice exams. I also feel like I'm under skilled when it comes to databricks and was going to be my next certification target. Do I have to get officially certified before I can start advertising these skills? any other general advice?

So... conceptually, I feel solid in DE fundamentals.I've read quite a few posts on reddit, about legacy-heavy backgrounds (SAS) beign a disadvantage, which doesn't inspire optimism. I'm struggling to get interviews for DE roles - even at the Junior level, so I'm trying to understand what I'm missing.Questions: \\- is the DE market in EU just very tight now? \\- How is SAS exp actually perceived for modern DE roles? \\- How would you position this background on a CV/interviews? \\- Which stack should I realistically double down on for the EU market - should I go allin on one setup (eg. GCP + Databricks), or keep a broader skill set across multiple tools, and are certifications worth it at this stage?Any feedback is appreciated, especially from people who moved from legacy/enterprise stacks into modern data platforms.",

I often feel like it would be easier to just listen and understand the problem, propose a solution with a mockup or simplified prototype, and go from there.The 'higher ups' like VPs and C-suite tend to be the ones who send us very complex requirements that look pretty AI-generated.

I am working in DE as my work as afforded me the flexibility to learn some new skills. I am onboarding 25 tables from a system into snowflake. Everything is working as intended but I am confused about how to truncate and insert daily loads. I have a schema for the 25 tables and how they fit together but I'm unsure how to read it from an ingestion standpoint. It works by the main tables loading 45 past dates and 45 future dates every day. So I can remove that time chunk in the truncate task and then reinsert it with the merge task using streams for each. The other tables \"fork\" out from here with extra details to do with those events.What I'm unsure of is how to interact with data that is removed from the system, since this doesn't show up in the streams. Ie, a staff time sheet from 2 weeks ago gets changed to +30 minutes or something. In the extremity tables, there is no dates held within.If I run a merge task using the stream from that days ingestion, what do I use as the target for truncate tasks?What is the general thought process when trying to understand how the schema fits together in regards to inserting and streaming the data rather than just making models?Thanks for the help!",

I’ve focused heavily on data quality: DQ flags, quarantine patterns for bad rows, repeatable tests, and monitoring tables (including late-arrival tracking).I also wired in CI on PRs and automated docs publishing on merge, so changes are reviewable and the project stays easy to navigate.This week I’m extending the pipeline “upstream”: pulling from Kobo servers to S3, then using SNS + SQS to trigger Snowpipe so RAW loads happen event-based.Thanks in advance for any feedback and genuinely, thank you to everyone who’s helped me along the way so far.

And you don't have to search around trying to find repos or youtube videos giving you personal project ideas. There is already is massive library of built ideas you can look at, the chrome extension web store!! For example:* Security (input sanitation, rate limiting, actual useful cache management). * Cloudflare, which can be useful for several of the above (they have many great COMPLETELY FREE products available).* Performance and the value of keeping your bundle size small.* Also non-tech skills like competitive research, marketing, consistent branding, etc.* Bonus points if you use a framework like [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) to make your extension available on Firefox.* Setting clear acceptance criteria / deliverables and completing them within a timeline. * Added bonus: chrome/cloudflare give you a bunch of data/analytics about usage for free, which can be extremely gratifying to see real people logging in and using your tool.I've been there, building personal projects to bolster your resume can be a hard and sometimes exhausting task. So if you're looking for something more bite-sized, give building an extension a shot. Good luck!",

        "content": "I only code as a hobby and have no professional experience but I noticed that many coders try to put as little comments into their code as possible.I've got a personal commenting guideline that a comment should be added if it significantly speeds up comprehension rate. E.g a comment to summarise the next 10 lines of code. This of course clashes against the principle of \"comments should explain why something is there and not what it's doing\".Many open source projects I see, from my perspective, have little to no code comments where I think they would help. I understand the point of self-documenting code but if a few comments would have sped up comprehension rate by 3x then what would be the harm?The only strong counter-agument I could think of against lots of comments is that it could be used as a crutch to write bad code but I'm not sure.I guess the most extreme form of my question would be \"what would be the harm for a project to have many useless comments if we can just quickly skip over them?\"",

The issue I ran into was that the \"docs\" if you can even call them that are so confusing and the code just doesn't work with my stack, cause my stack is react, typescript, nextjs and I chose the setup for nextjs and it was all code in js so in my mind I was thinking I could just easily fix the type issues and that was going to be it but it didn't work like that, there were no type issues it was other errors that there docs had no help with. So how am I supposed to fix this when with API's its not like other problems with crud where its usually just giving the issue to you, like every website I look at to setup stripe its completely different code across all those websites. So what I'm trying to ask is how do you learn API's cause googling has done nothing for me, and I've used AI to try to help me and gotten nowhere cause I've heard that somehow stripe is one of the easiest API's for beginners to work with. I've also heard that all API's have the same structure so getting over that initial learning hurdle is the hardest but how true is that?",

        "author": "Positive_Invite_5665",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Before you read this is just my experience from using Codecademy as a $200 a year paying user (https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/penguingnop). I probably will get flamed for this.. and it's fine. My view is probably shared with like 10 people or whatever.So I subscribed to Codecademy's $200 a year Pro plan in September of 2025, I excited to learn React and backend technologies. And before subscribing a few days later, I did some free courses and thought they were decent. But when I finished the Lua course, I realized I didn't learn loops.. Like who the hell teaches Lua without loops? (Maybe when you're reading this there was a new update)But I brushed it off thinking, \"Hey, it's probably because it's a free coursee\", though I was disappointed.After subscribing, I started taking their React course and felt completely lost. Like why this scaffold/file system? Why was I suddenly dropped into a dir with files that aren't even jsx? But I did spend a few more hours on it.. and I gave up. The biggest problem I have with this is that the course teaches React v18 to people **NEW to coding**, but why would a new dev want to learn outdated React? Another big issue is that they don't use modern standards like Vite. Like they use some custom project structure, how is that supposed to benefit learners? It also doesn’t use Vite, or even explain how `index.html`, `app.jsx`.. I mean, `app.js` work. New learners are dropped into a dated custom structure with near zero context. And if it wasn't clear what the issue was:- Teaching React v18, which is 4 years outdated- Not explaining the files or file system- (Personally) Not using modern build tools like Vite, and scaffold like create@viteI then tried the Frontend Career Path, hoping it would make me much better at frontend. I stopped at 29%. The teaching style felt like multiple concepts crammed into single lessons, and outdated YouTube videos from like 4+ years ago. Like, at least use a good camera, mic, and lighting for tutorials, and keep them updated. Most, if not all videos I saw were low quality laptop recordings with crap audio, spoken from heart, crap webcam, and an unconvincing tone. The tone feels like they're at gunpoint forced to sound happy. It's just so depressing.After quitting the frontend path, I tried the backend path. It was slightly better since the JavaScript was ES6+.. sometimes because they still use `require()`. It shouldn't matter though since it's just JavaScript... except they teach backend tools that've evolved a lot since they made the course. if anyone completed the course, it'll be like a kid who traveled back in time to learn what was \"modern\" in that time, NodeJS 17 and whatever ExpressJS they had, by the time the kid comes back to the present day, he'll see that tons of things has changed. And paying $200 a year for outdated content feels terrible. And that money matters to me, 200 is a lot even if it's just yearly.I've sent a few emails to support, but the replies are all the same generic response from Colleen:```Thank you so much for sharing your feedback! We're constantly working to improve our curriculum based on the feedback that we receive from our customers. I'll be sure to pass along your note to the curriculum team for review.```I'm not sure if Colleen is coping and pasting emails or actually doing anything. When I get responses like this, I feel like they don't give a damn. It feels like the engineers and people over at Codecademy are either lazy or barely working.I regret the purchase, worst of all I have to go through support to get a refund, but after multiple identical replies from Colleen about 'passing feedback along,' I have absolutely NO confidence in getting a refundThis whole experience has demotivated me. When I subscribed, I had light and excitement in my eyes. Now I'm so demotivated that I'm starting to think about others who might feel the same.So.. to end this, here's my advice to Codecademy: Keep courses updated, invest in engineers wellbeing, get a proper studio for tutorials, and make coding fun again. People who come to you rely on you, so it is your responsibility to make sure what they learn is updated, well paced and not cramming 10 topics in a lesson, and not \"AI INTERVIEW!!!\"I'm probably the first to say this, and probably one of the very few who feel this way..And to anyone reading this, please share your story. I'd love to hear from you and I'll try my best to comment on your experience or just \"comments\"",

She had this idea with me that we build a new POS system specialized for restaurants and cafes. The good thing is that we can test it out in her cafe, she also has contacts to other cafe and restaurant owners which means we have a good playfield and can constantly improve the system we build with real feedback. I know from my research that building a system like that is not easy, theres a lot of regulations etc. which is fine and it will also be something that I will work on longterm along side my job and studies, but I just wanna ask you guys if some of u have any experience regards POS systems or the potential of this project, just wanted to get different perspectives :)",

Specifically things like Side Projects like building apps (i love it and used to do it). Certifications, like rhcsa, been thinking about it a lot lately for a career boost. And also building a social media presence, like on X, and youtube etcThe problem is that when I think about this, I get completely overwhelmed. I end up paralyzed by the mental load, doing nothing at all, and then feeling like I’m stagnating.Does anyone else struggle with this \"off-the-clock\" guilt?

Developers update endpoints and forget to update swagger, add new required fields without documenting them, deprecate stuff without marking it in the docs.Even if I make the docs part of the pr review process, reviewers just approve them anyway. I tried automated tests that validate openapi specs against endpoints but that broke constantly when people changed response formats. One team even hired a technical writer specifically for api docs and she quit after 6 months because keeping up was impossible.The worst is when external partners email saying your docs say this endpoint returns X but it actually returns Y and I have to admit yeah sorry our docs are wrong, or when new devs join and spend days confused because the docs describe an api that hasn't existed in that form for 8 months.Some companies seem to have this figured out, like stripe's docs are always perfect. How do they do it? Is it just throwing money at the problem or is there some system that actually works for keeping API docs synced with reality?",

My first one I got 42% and the second one I'm still waiting for my grade but I know I more than likely failed it considering my mind immediately blanked after sitting down for it and I couldn't even complete it.Here's the breakdown of my marks over the year:Best 4 of 5 MCQs worth 7.5% eachFirst 2 practicals worth 10% and last 2 are worth 20%Micro assessment once a week for rest of the year at 10%It's like I think I understand the concepts and the theory of it all but actually applying it in an exam is where I struggle either because I panic or something I'm not sure.I try and do the sample questions our lecturer puts up for us and believe I understand it, even though the first 2 exams were basically exactly the same thing as the sample questions uploaded.Would anyone have any sort of advice?",

The project is in it's infancy and theres not much to it right now but I'm working on implementing a sql parser from scratch. Currently in Rust I have a working version for this but struggling to translate that to Java. The main reason is the fact that I now have to think about writing it in a OOP style which doesn't come intuitively as Rust does. I not only have think about what I'm writing but how I'm writing it. I have read the crafting interperters book and tbh the implementation of creating files on the go doesn't really look that appealing (might just be me tho). Are there any tips or books that I could get to help me solve this or is it purely just not knowing the language enough?

Now before this I was fine learning Python and honestly it was kind of fun making basic scripts and mini-games. But now, the past two weeks I have basically been bashing my head against the wall with web development. The barrier to entry level is very high for a beginner like me. I usually approach youtube tutorials to always get ahead, to 'dissect' them and break them down whenever I don't understand it to the fundamentals. What I wasn't prepared for was the huge amount of studying, like web architecture, learning other languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, full stack development, APIs, Databases, Flask, Bootstrap and all of this Web Dev jargon I never knew about before I stepped into this. The point is, I've spent 80% of my time basically studying on paper everything, and 20% actually coding anything for like the past 2 weeks.I expected a level of frustration but these days it's been a test of will and patience. It's become suffocating having to sit on my desk for two to three hours everyday for the past two weeks, and not feel a sense of progress towards my goal. I'm constantly learning without a way to practice or test the limits of that knowledge. And when things go wrong in a way I don't understand (like a bug), in a language I have no control or little knowledge over, it's very difficult to fix without feeling angry or lost.So my question is, did I overestimate myself here and skipped a few too many steps approaching web dev? I still want to at least make a basic CRUD web app, this is one of my primary goals. What do I do now?",

I originally did this to support LeetCode practice. I've recently decided that I want to do backend engineering .Right now, I'm trying to maximize my chances of getting a job postgrad. With Python, I can start backend development immediately using a framework like FastAPI or Django and focus on learning backend concepts rather than spending time learning a new language and its syntax.My main question is whether Python plus a backend stack is still a solid path to a backend engineering role without significantly limiting opportunities. If Python meaningfully limits backend roles, I'm open to switching now to something like Java. However, if Python is still viable, sticking with it would let me make faster progress since I wouldn't need to relearn syntax and tooling. I'd appreciate any advice on whether sticking with Python or switching languages would be the best move given my situation.",

It was also my first time filming content like this at all. A lot went wrong. I lost footage, got stuck constantly, struggled with design, and felt so like... stressed most of the time. I still pushed through and finished it, and the project actually ended up working.. although not the best.What’s confusing me is how I feel now. Instead of feeling proud or excited, I just feel empty, kind of sad, and completely exhausted. My brain keeps telling me I’m bad at coding and bad at filming, and that this was way harder than it should’ve been. It honestly left me feeling demotivated, like damn this was hard and now I’m wondering how I’m ever supposed to get good enough to have a future in this.I thought finishing would feel better than this. Does anyone know why this happens or has anyone experienced something similar after finally committing to something big for the first time?",

It was for about two years, then it's almost 4 years where I haven't been programming because I was burned out, but now I want to start again, maybe create something little but useful but mainly for fun. It started at front-end, but later moved to back-end and CLI applications. That's where I feel in love with that type of programming - not focusing on look (even though I'm capable of something simple and good looking) but mainly function. For example 3D rendering using JavaScript, many NeoVim plugins using Lua and some simpler using GoLang. It has been one of my most favorite language I have ever tried, but I haven't used it that much for personal projects. I have done couple CLI games, tool but it wasn't something long term or \"big\".I want to get back to programming, but I don't have any project ideas which would interest me and could take some time to finish (like month or more). Preferably GoLang, but I wouldn't mind using, or mixing another languages. So my question is what would you recommend me to do, to get back into programming again or something. Thank you.My favorites projects I have enjoyed so far were \\- 3D .obj parsing -> rendering -> rotating website from scratch, with textures \\- VIM inspired TypeScript CLI text editor \\- NVim RegExp explaining plugin, from scratch and more, mainly focused on \"technical\" part.",

I am currently building a text-based RPG in C# just to learn the language and get accustomed to the syntax. However, my next goal is to start using C# for backend. I am familiar with asynchronous programming from Javascript but from my understanding, C# has more advanced features when it comes to that. What resources do you guys recommend to learn multithreaded programming? And would you recommend another language such as C (which I have worked with a bit) to understand multithreaded programming on a lower level?",

I'm in my senior year, my friends keep saying I am in a good situation (they’re focused on frontend and UI/UX, so I’m not in the same boat as them), that I am in a better state than they are, but I don't know what to do in the internship or OJT phase of uni, I tried to apply once for voluntary internship, but there was an assessment, within 2 weeks we need to learn a framework as an assessment we need to finish a 2 full stack web application, first one I passed I used a REST architecture which I am familiar with so it was easy, then the second one we need to learn Vue js as-well as graphql in ruby on rails, ruby on rails was the easy part, but the time constraint on finishing the assessment was the problem, had trouble in balancing uni and that assessment, so I was removed, and I haven't tried to apply to an internship again after that. The main problem I have right now is that I overly relied on AI in my later projects. I know how to code (OOP concepts, SOLID and DRY), some DSA, but on coding interviews, I didn't do well. I overthink the solution, and so I failed some test cases. I'm trying to relearn what I knew before AI affected me. Any advice in general, I'm taking a Java NC III class right now, as well, to rebuild my Java familiarity. I'm in my senior year, and I don't know what internship I want.

My initial design treats `Tournament` as the aggregate root: it owns all `Team` and `Player` instances, while `Team` stores only a set of `PlayerId`s rather than `Player` objects, so that `Tournament` remains the single source of truth.This avoids duplicated player state, but introduces a design issue: when `Team` needs to perform logic that depends on player data (for example calculating average player rating), it must access the `Tournament`’s player collection. That implies either:1. Injecting `Tournament` into `Team`, creating an upward dependency, or2. Introducing a mediator/service layer to resolve players from IDs.I am hesitant to introduce a bi-directional dependency (`Team -> Tournament`) since `Tournament` already owns `Team`, and this feels like faulty design, or perhaps even an anti-pattern. At the same time, relying exclusively on IDs pushes significant domain logic outside the entities themselves.So, that brings me to my questions:1. Is avoiding bidirectional relationships between domain entities generally considered best practice in this case?2. Is it more idiomatic to allow `Team` to hold direct `Player` references and rely on invariants to maintain consistency, or to keep entities decoupled and move cross-entity logic into a service/manager layer?3. How would this typically be modeled in a professional Java codebase (both with/without ORM concerns)?As this is a project I am using to learn and teach myself good OOP code solutions, I am specifically interested in design trade-offs and conventions, not just solutions that technically \"work.\"",

It’s cross-platform via Tauri (macOS / Windows / Linux), supports extensible “skills” for real workflows (docs, PDFs, spreadsheets), and has MCP built in for tool integration. No hosted inference, no proxying — everything runs on your machine.It’s still early and pretty rough in places, so I’m mostly sharing this to get feedback. Does this approach to local agent workspaces make sense? Are skills / MCP the right abstraction, or is this over-engineered? Any obvious security or UX red flags?

The question I have in my mind is - people that started with FCC managed to get somewhere? Do you really need to go for a bachelor to be able to work as a dev?I'm enjoying the journey, and am aware that I have a lot to learn, but the curiosity thrives in me and wanted to know from people who are expert, who already went through this beginning journey at FCC, or even that can provide any insight on how it can look like, to understand if I need more to actually get a job, or if by developing my experience by myself together with FCC would be enough to get lucky with nowadays market.

Obviously in such a field I'd have more job security as well, which is another plus. Also C was my first language and I could really enjoy lower level or more niche stuff, I'm pretty down for anything.",

The grueling part is when I can’t find the solution for my exact problem in the program. And another issue is I cannot for the life of me figure it out on my own unless I find an article or forum online hinting at what I must do to solve it once and for all.What do you all do in this situation? It would really help me if you recommend some habits I should get into to fix this. It’s really bad for me since it takes like a really long time before it clicks to me what to do.

I’ll keep details anonymized.- Junior software engineer- one year of experience- currently at a 60 people cybersecurity startup- in a team of just me and intern and ceo who manages us but is absent for the most of the time. (there is no technical mananger who checks our work.)I accidentally ran a destructive command (rm -rf) on a live production server and it wiped the application/services. (I thought I was in a test directory, but it turns out I was in the root folder when I ran this command) This is a non-critical system (news aggregation site for enterprise customers which get 50 views) and thankfully there is no user/customer data involved and the core product is mostly unaffected by this. Here’s the situation:- No backups or snapshots (confirmed by IT/infra)- No practical recovery path (IT says restore is not possible)- Production drifted from git (repo is outdated vs what was actually running) Turns out people have been working on the live server without commiting anything on git- Access controls were weak (multiple people had access; no guardrails/approvals except ssh'in into the server)- Knowledge transfer/runbooks are incomplete, so “what exactly was on prod” is fuzzy. Current plan: rebuild using the outdated git repo as the baseline. That likely means we can get a working version back, it would be extremely outdated and all the work we did since then will be lost.My manager, who also happens to be the CEO of this company, is extremely upset and said he’s “never seen anything like this in his 20 years as an IT person,” and is threatening termination and potential legal action if it isn’t recovered. I know I made a serious mistake. I’m trying to focus on restoration for now (We are 50 percent complete)Most importantly, how do I cover myself legally? Any advice",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Yesterday, a major company reached out to me on LinkedIn asking if I'd be interested in having a chat about a role they were hiring for. We had a 20 minute screening call which went well, but I was on the fence about it due to the tech stack and the requirement to always work from their office (train journey for me while I'm fully WFH in my current job).At the end of the call, I was told to expect an email that would outline the next steps in the process. I opened the email and saw that I was required to complete two HackerRank assessments.I immediately decided just to withdraw myself from consideration for the role. I spend my time building software, developing games and properly improving my abilities and experience as an engineer and as an architect of high-quality software. I don't have time to grind HackerRank challenges, and why should I? It's a terrible indicator of someone's ability as an engineer, and I've reached a point in the job hunt where I just can't bring myself to sit through these pointless algorithm challenges (that'll never be used in the role) anymore. I also consider it to be a bit of a red flag - if they're evaluating candidates through their ability to memorize algorithm challenges, I don't think that bodes well for the quality of their engineering teams.I sent a message on LinkedIn saying:Hi [Redacted], I've decided to withdraw myself from consideration for the role. I feel that HackerRank assessments don't align with my approach to software engineering. As I build my career, I’m looking to join a team that evaluates talent through real-world tasks and the approach they take to solving problems. Thank you for your time, I hope you're able to find the right candidate for the role. Regards,[Redacted]Has anyone else reached this point? Anyone else just outright refusing to participate in such a hiring process? I'm not sure how much this will limit my options, and I may well be forced to swallow the pill and revoke my stance, but I felt it was the right thing to do. I told a couple of colleagues about it and the consensus was \"good for you\", and that they wouldn't complete them either - but they're further along in their career (senior level), while I've been in the industry for 3 years full-time (and 2 years part-time while at university).TLDR; Refusing to do HackerRank challenges during hiring process, can't bring myself to do them anymore. Is anyone else refusing this? What are your thoughts?",

My first reaction was “ok, new guy, new expectations fine” and I increased my output a bit. By our third meet, he informed me that I was on a ”90 day coaching plan” that was meant to bring me in line with expectations due to low output and not being proactive. I asked him what this meant because to me this is akin to a PIP. He denied it saying this was being done in good faith. Fast forward 60 days:i have doubled my output, being much more proactive and participated much more on team discussions and PR’s so I could make myself more visible. I write a report that details each task I did and PR I commented and approved. I wasn’t given feedback on it until almost a month after I gave him the report, 4 workdays before the plan was supposed to end. the feedback? That I still had communication gaps and my code lacked proper testing. I was able to prove that he lied in the examples he gave, but I was still sacked. in the end: I completed 32 tasks in 55 workdays.How did I get sacked? i was prepared with my rebuttal with his false claims to discuss the end of the plan on our 1-1.

        "author": "philosograppler",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I haven’t posted on this subreddit before, but I’m at a point where I really need some outside perspective on what to do next.I’m based in NYC and I’ve been working as a software engineer for about six years. I originally got into this field because I wanted to learn to code so I could build my own ideas and maybe start something one day, but I haven’t really acted on that goal the way I thought I would.For most of my career I was at a large Fortune 500 company. I was there for five years and then lost my job due to restructuring that turned into mass layoffs. Right after that I traveled a bit and then started job searching. It felt endless. Once I got interview-ready again it still took about six months to land another role.I thought I finally found the perfect fit. It was a hybrid role at a startup events company where I’d be a Senior SWE working across web and mobile. I joined a newly formed AI R&D team as the first hire. Since the team was brand new there was no PM, no designer, and no scrum master, so it was mostly just me working directly with my manager, who had also just been promoted into management.From the beginning things felt messy. Deadlines were vague and product goals kept shifting from sprint to sprint. Then the CEO fired the cofounder, suddenly changed the company from hybrid to mandatory five days a week in-office, and later fired one of the two engineering managers.Not long after that I was let go for “performance reasons,” despite never being put on a PIP. When I try to be honest with myself about what they might be referring to, I can only point to two things. One was the CEO being upset that I was late to an all-hands meeting, but I didn’t even know it was happening because my manager forgot to put it on my calendar when I first joined, so I arrived about 30 minutes late. The other was a deadline to switch our product over to a different API endpoint that supported local testing. My manager wrote the backend for it, but the environment I needed to test in was constantly tied up by other engineers, so I moved onto another priority and that pushed the API switch back.A big part of the frustration is that I was building on top of backend code my manager had basically stitched together quickly, and it didn’t follow basic REST principles. The delay on the API work wasn’t only about me moving slowly. There was technical debt and there were delays and blockers that were out of my control too. I’m not saying I did everything perfectly, but when they let me go and I asked what specifically was wrong, the only answer I got was “poor code quality.” I can’t shake the feeling that once our team started missing deadlines, my manager needed someone to blame, and I ended up being the easiest target for the CEO.I was only there for five months, and getting let go like that has really messed with my confidence and mental health. Now I don’t know what the right move is. Part of me wants to jump back into applying immediately. Another part of me wants to finally take this as a push to work on my own startup ideas. Right after this happened, I swore I’d do everything I could to make sure I could work for myself eventually, but I’m not fully confident I can actually bring one of my ideas to life.On top of that, I have ADHD, and I’ve always had this constant background feeling of underperforming or that I’ve forgotten something important. This whole situation has made that a lot worse, and it’s hard not to spiral into those thoughts.If you’ve been through something like this, how did you decide what to do next? Would you focus on getting back into a stable job first, or would you take a risk and try to build something for yourself?",

I use LLMs for almost all of my work and I somehow still have a job.The crazy part about this is that I think my job is quite secure at the moment because people keep quitting and my company seems to value my loyalty despite the fact that I contribute virtually nothing.I don’t enjoy my job at all and I can’t see myself going into another engineering job and feeling any different about it.I’ve been looking into getting into a more people facing technical job, but it seems to me that those jobs require somebody who has previous experience in a customer facing role, something which I do not have.Before I got this job, I quit my last job so that I could travel for seven months and I spent all of my savings on it. As much as I would love to do that again, I want to create a stable life for myself before doing anything drastic like that again. In the last year I’ve managed to save almost $30,000 and honestly I’m kicking myself because I could’ve saved more.I understand that I am probably among one of the most privileged people in the world, but ultimately, living my life like this \\*\\*not contributing anything to a product which is already a net negative to society \\*\\* is killing me.What would you do in my position?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I have 3.5 years of experience and a masters degree in CS. I currently work as an SDE for a big financial services firm. I’ve been one of their top performers but the pay growth has plateaued. I also have an annoying commute situation where it takes me a 1-1.5 hours to get to the office and I have to attend some meetings very early in the morning before that. They also make you pay the very expensive parking downtown. They also lay off 5% of their workforce every year and I’ve seen multiple people on my team let go. I would’ve been okay with everything but recently, one of the higher ups said that they’re tracking how many hours we work in the office, the time we come to the office, the time we leave the office, and there’ll be consequences for everything - which is kind of unreasonable considering that we attend meetings with other regions very early in the morning, work on releases very late at night and respond to incidents and downtimes during the weekends from home. We’ve made this job our life but they make it harder every day and don’t pay us much either.Anyways, I luckily got an interview call from Netflix. It’s a remote role, my pay is going up significantly and everything looks perfect on the surface. So, if someone worked/works over there, how is it really like working remotely as an SDE at Netflix? What’s the catch? Are remote workers more likely to get laid off or get plateaued on their salary growth compared to the ones who go to the office every day? How’s the pay growth like in general on the base salary every year as there’s no bonus? How well do they honor the unlimited paid time off policy? How many vacation days do y’all take every year? How’s the parental leave policy and do they honor it well (my partner and I are planning to have a baby next year)? What do you think about the health insurance they offer? Are there any signs of remote roles becoming fully in-person anytime soon?",

I’ve been encouraged and have already started to grow into this area by working closely with our senior retail strategy specialist to help implement, and I believe the company would support this kind of specialization with continued raises.Because the team is small, I work across a wide range of projects, which has accelerated my learning. I genuinely enjoy the people I work with they’re smart, supportive, and excellent communicators. On top of that, many employees have been with the company for a long time, which shows they are willing to keep people around.

        "content": "I’ve been working as a backend engineer for around 2 years now, and lately I’ve been feeling pretty disengaged.Most of the work feels like *gluing things together*: APIs, ORMs, queues, configs, cloud services, etc. Even when it’s “complex,” it often feels like complexity from coordination rather than depth. I don’t feel like I’m learning fundamental ideas anymore, just new tools and patterns.I tried branching into AppSec thinking it would be deeper, but honestly it felt even more shallow lots of checklists, scanners, and “best practices,” with limited opportunity to really understand systems at a fundamental level (at least in what I’ve seen so far).Now I’m questioning a few things:* Is this just what industry software engineering feels like after the initial learning curve?* Am I just not going deep enough in backend (databases, distributed systems, performance, internals)?* Or should I pivot and focus more on computer science–heavy areas (OS, compilers, networking, databases) either through a role change or serious self-study?I don’t hate programming, but I miss the feeling of wrestling with hard problems instead of wiring services together. Curious if others felt this around the 2–3 YOE mark and what paths helped:* going deeper in backend?* moving to infra / systems / performance?* Masters and Phd (Academia)* or just accepting that most jobs are like this?Would appreciate perspectives from people a few years ahead of me. I come from a third world country so it might be an issue too. I do not see much capable SWE and the problems we are solving is just bs or easy things. Also most SWE have no real depth no cs foundations just vibe coding.",

        "content": "As titled. Software engineer with 5 yoe at a unicorn, I've been with my current company for about 2 years now. I had a life-changing event that happened in my family before my graduated. As a result, during the initial couple years of my career, I was very ambitious and set for faang/unicorn level pay. I pushed and pushed and pushed myself, even though I did not want to. I felt like that was when I developed this chronic fatigue and burnout about work. Anyway, I did not stop, until I got into my current company, and I felt satisfied that I got what I wanted.Since then I felt like I got out of survival mode, and somehow without fear, I started hating my job more and more. About a year into my current job, my burnout was so bad, to the point that I couldn't bring myself to work more than 1 hour a day no matter how hard I tried. I sat in front of my laptop during nights and weekends but I could not get any work done, it felt like my brain shut down. I ended up taking a sabbatical for three months. I took the time and travelled to Europe and did not do anything but to spend time with my family for three months.After I came back, everything was so much better. I felt better about work, I was way more productive and I could function as normal. Sure I still didn't like working, but I didn't hate it and I could tell it was different than the period I was burnt out.Fastforward to today, a year from my last sabbatical, I feel like the burnout is slowly creeping back. It's been 2 weeks now and I've been extremely unproductive. I feel like I can't get things into my brain, I can feel that it is similar to the burnout I had last time, but fortunately a bit better. I seriously don't know what to do. My company has good wlb, great engineering culture, tc is a bit above faang level. I feel like I have nothing to complain, yet i hate my body for feeling this way. I think the root cause is that this place is a very fast-paced and high growth company. I don't work long hours by any means, but the work is very challenging and expectations are high. There are pros and cons to this, I feel like my work has meaning, i get rewarded, but sometimes it's very very draining. I feel like it's sucking the life out of me. I don't know what to do. I don't hate CS by any means, but this level of mental efforts does not seem like it's something I wanna do with my life. Maybe I want to coast. Maybe I'm ungrateful, maybe I want the pay but not do the work. i feel like I'm slipping and spiraling a bit downwards mentally.Any advice is appreciated.",

I lost my ambition and was basically a zombie, and I didn't really know what I was supposed to do with my degree anymore. This past year I've gradually gained back my confidence enough to get back to reality and reach acceptance. As a result my feelings of ambition came back. Since I've graduated I've been doing low intensity code annotation for a company but now I want more, i.e. I want to build and engineer things instead of just evaluating code. I wasn't paying attention to what the industry is like while I was working so I have no idea if this work is valuable to the software engineer market, and I'm afraid it's not as I didn't work in a dedicated frontend/backend structure. My internship experience also seems really obscure. Since I'm 2 years removed from graduation doing a non software engineering role, can someone tell me if I'm out of the game regarding software engineering?

To be honest, I spent my early 20s being reckless and immature with my money. I lived entirely in the moment and didn't save a dime. Now, with a wedding and housing goals coming up in 1-2 years, I’ve had a massive wake-up call. I just realized how much these things actually cost, and I feel like a fool for starting so late.I’m deeply regretful of my past negligence, and I’m determined to fix this. I’m ready to grind 20-30 hours a week outside of my main job to hit my savings goal as fast as possible.I’d love to hear from anyone who has successfully made significant money on the side:* Market Reality Check: For a backend dev with 7 YOE, is it realistic to aim for a consistent $2k-$5k/month through side gigs right now? Or is the market too saturated?* Where to look?: I’ve only worked in stable full-time roles, so I’m new to the freelance world. Where can I find high-quality, short-term gigs?* Efficiency: Given my stack (Node, Java, Python), what’s the most \"time-efficient\" way to generate immediate cash flow? Something else?* Life Lessons: What would you say to a 25-year-old who just woke up and realized he’s behind?I’m ready to work harder than ever to make up for lost time. I just want to make sure I’m running in the right direction. Any advice or harsh reality checks would mean a lot. Thanks!",

Most days have been at home recovering, and going down rabbit holes like tech news, trying new dev tools (Claude Code, Codex, etc.), tinkering, but nothing consistent I can show.Now reality is hitting. I need to land a job in the next few months. The gap is making me anxious, and that anxiety is making me freeze.**Target roles:** Data Engineer / Backend (Python) - most of my work was involved on GCP. **Stack I’ve worked with:** GCP (BigQuery, Dataflow, Pub/Sub, Vertex AI, Cloud Storage), MLflow, Python + SQL, streaming + batch pipelines, CI/CD.I know the default answer is “grind LeetCode + system design”, and I am doing some of that. But I feel like I’m missing something important about how to restart properly.I’d really appreciate advice on things like:* If you took a break or had a gap, what helped you come back and get hired?* Should I focus on DE roles again or pivot to backend/SWE? (I’m open, but I want the fastest path to employability.)* What’s a realistic plan for the next 8–12 weeks that actually improves interview outcomes?* What do recruiters/hiring managers in India care about most when they see a 6 month gap?* Any suggestions for 1–2 “resume-worthy” projects that are actually useful (not a toy) and can be finished quickly?If it helps: I’m not trying to make excuses. I messed up the structure of the break, and I own that. I just want a clean plan and honest feedback from people who have done it.Thanks in advance.",

        "content": "Hey, I’m joining Google as a new grad and wanted to get some perspective on how feasible it is to internally transfer to DeepMind down the line, ideally as an ML or Research Engineer.During my internship, I met some absolute outliers from GDM, but also plenty of solid, “normal” smart folks. Overall, the distribution of talent didn’t seem any different from my own team, which made me wonder whether an internal transfer might be more realistic than I initially thought.I’ll be starting on an AI-related (but non-research) team in a different product area. The office I’m joining has a fairly strong GDM presence.I did CS with Math in undergrad with a focus on probabilistic ML, and I have one publication in a top AI journal (not first author).For folks who’ve seen or gone through this process:* How rare are internal transfers to GDM? Do you need to be absolutely exceptional?* Beyond strong feedback in my current role, what tends to matter most? * Internal ML work (e.g., 20% project with GDM) * Being active in research communities again * Kaggle or other ML side projects * Internal networking and referralsAny advice & anecdotes would be really appreciated. Thanks!",

        "content": "hi all,I recently started a new job at a company with a poor reputation. As a May 2025 grad who was becoming increasingly desperate for a foothold, I intended to keep this job for a year or two before leaving for something better, but I am staying with family nearby and commuting (1-1.5hr one-way commute) for the time being.I am still in “training”, but I have been finding myself feeling increasingly isolated. The relatives I am staying with are distant and I miss home and my immediate family, but I don’t think that this is just homesickness (I attended college a similar distance from my hometown). I am spending 8 hours of the day in a windowless office doing training clearly intended for someone with less experience than me. It is becoming more clear to me that the work that I will be doing after training will not be at all engaging and there is very little collaboration between my teammates. I don’t believe that there is much opportunity for growth. Additionally, I am not only the only woman on my team, but I have not met a single other woman in my (admittedly short) time working here.Some of this is certainly just what you get in software, but normally when people talk about feeling lonely at work, it has to do with the WFH environment. I am on-site, and the demands of on-site and the particular location of the company (along with the below-standard pay) have made it hard for me to justify doing anything to shorten my commute as around half of my net pay would go to rent/utilities.I am heavily considering leaving this position and finding temporary employment in my hometown to fill the gap and have some money while I figure out what I want to do. I’m not really sure what I am looking for here. I guess I am just venting and looking for validation and advice. I know that I should be grateful to have a swe job in this market but if this is what swe jobs are I’m not sure that I want them.",

I thought some of you guys would find my experience so far interesting/informative:Company is mid-sized subsidiary based in non-tech hub, doing automation with AI agents for enterprise clients. I was hired after a single non-technical interview to a 25k a year contract. I was one of six people hired (all latin americans) that started on the same day in an existing work team, there seem to be many other teams in the company as well doing similar stuff.Every senior, mid level and junior engineer is LATAM based, or either Indian or Pinoy (though those get assigned to other teams, I guess they want time-zone uniformity within teams). I'm from a South American country where 25k a year is above average living but nothing spectacular. There's plenty of Central American engineers in my team, which I suspect are paid even less. Middle managent and higher positions are all US based, but seem experienced with dealing with offshored labor. They seem to hire in chunks of 6-8 people at a time, I guess they don't feel they are taking much risk in doing so because of how little they have to pay compared to have US-based engineers.Before I got hired I had several interviews with US based companies. I had a second-round technical interview with a somewhat known Silicon-Valley company, I did OK at it but not great, they ghosted me after. I think the job posting was for like 40k a year (mid-level Silicon Valley SWE obv would make like 200-300k/year)BTW some of the nearshoring, LATAM focused agencies you will see spamming LinkedIn will pay 1k a month to juniors (I interviewed for one a year ago or so, didn't sign with them after they lowballed me super hard)I've done OK so far at my job, many of the guys who got hired alongside me are OK at coding but not super fluent in english, most of them seem a bit lost with regards to AI Agents (very new tech obv). I get the feeling expectations are not super high, and they will be satisfied if you do an adequate job.From what I've heard is that my company (or I guess it's parent company) is running an offshoring mill in Asia that is 5-10x the size of its LATAM offshoring operation.So yeah, this is where many american engineering jobs are going. Not bragging obv, nothing against american devs, hopefully things turn around for you guys.",

The first job is about 25 miles away, a 35-55 min commute. I'm worried this will add miles on my new car quick, plus the commute during rush hour will be longer.If my interview with the second company goes well, I am considering asking for a time extension for the offer I received from the first company. However I know that even with a 2-3 day extension, say next week Wednesday, I probably wont have an offer with the second company even if I complete all the interviews by that time. I am wondering what my options are here. Can I do any of the following?1. Indicate to the second company that I have a pending job offer from another job, and if there is any flexibility on accelerating the next steps.2. Sign the agreement with the first company, and should the second company offer me a deal, rescind the offer with the first company and sign with the second company.The hiring team for the first company was really nice and supportive and I hope I'm not stabbing them in the back by rescinding my offer.",

This has led me to reconsider my major. I have months to decide, but should i still be going into CS and majoring in it and looking for a CS job in today’s world? Or is this a huge mistake?Thank you so much everyone, I’m just worried about my future.",

        "content": "I've worked in two companies so far and in both we made estimates for how long a task would take, and I've found that at least in my experience I never take that much to complete them 99% of the time. Overall I'd say that I spend like two, or perhaps three hours a day doing coding/debugging, even for some tasks that are planned to take a whole day (we do group estimates so the final estimate is the average of what we all say), and perhaps another hour doing some other things related to the task (asking my boss about business constraints, investigating other parts of the app, etc) I can't recall the last time that I really spent more than four hours working on a day. I've always been very efficient at work, minimizing distractions when thinking about a problem, focusing on one task at a time, and, I know this will be unpopular, but the integrated AI assistants have really sped up my productivity as well. I know there's the whole debate about \\_vibe coding\\_, but I use AI to generate code for parts of the app whose functionality I already know and giving it a prompt just makes the process faster, or if I don't know that part of the app, I ask it to do some research first. It makes mistakes most of the time, but even giving it prompts and then steering it to correct them or correcting them myself is faster than doing it all from scratch. So, are task estimates the same for you?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Recruiting sucks right now, but the most recent problems aren’t directly impacting the people searching for jobs. It has never been easier to automatically apply for positions with completely made-up resumes created by AI for a specific job. Hiring managers are pulling their hair out as they waste time interviewing people who made up their skills, interviewing people who try to use AI to answer interview questions and even completely different workers showing up for the first day of work than the one who was interviewed.&nbsp;This is an opportunity. &nbsp;Hiring managers do not want to go through this, and by far the easiest way to be sure a person who is applying for a job is real is to actually know this person. It has never been a better time to talk to people in real life rather than just hitting apply on an application that already had 50 people apply.&nbsp;Important note: The initial reaction to this may be fear that you are making people uncomfortable or imposing. 95% of the time this isn’t true. People like being helpful and if they can’t help they will forget about you the next day. &nbsp;Here are the three paths I would take in order of how serious you are in a job search. If you are unemployed do all three.&nbsp;* Go to industry events. Talk to everyone. One of the main points of presenting at industry events is to find talent. They exist so that they can find you. Ask everyone if they have anything open. This is especially true if you are early in your career. People with experience like helping people. It makes them feel powerful and important. Don’t stalk or pester anyone obviously, but you can ask if there are openings and if so what the best way is for people to see your resume to everyone.* Call up recruiters. Ask them about jobs they have open you are interested in. I want to emphasize that recruiters make money *by finding people jobs* calling them up is exciting! Not only are you a real person who has read the job description before applying, you also have another leg up in that you are showing you are proactive. Proactive is good. Proactive people are likely to be good at their job and thus make the recruiter the most money possible. My first job out of college was from this about 10 years ago. I asked specifically about a job, they said no you aren’t a good fit for that one, but how about this other one? Immediately was interviewed and hired.* Cold call/message/write to people who are managers for positions being advertised. This is the hardest one and potentially the scariest. It is going to be hard to figure out who you should be contacting and you could be completely wrong. There are two things you have going for you though: &nbsp;1. It’s pretty much impossible to annoy people from one polite message. If you are polite and there is nothing the person can do, they are probably just going to delete your message and move on with their day. They will forget you exist an hour later. If somehow your polite message offended them, they never ever were someone you wanted to work for anyways. Dodged a bullet.2. Managers absolutely cannot find anyone right now. I work with so many teams that have perpetual openings that just cannot be filled because everyone being interviewed is terrible. Any sort of lifeline is exciting. Maybe this will be the person that stops them from wasting hours every week in pointless interviews.&nbsp;Good luck out there. You got this.",

Most of the roles either require a significant amount of experience or are ghosting/rejecting me even when I have experience in the tech they use. I also did not go to a target CS school and do not live in a huge tech hub so I’m not really the prime audience to get reached out to by recruiters. There also aren’t really any networking events where I live either. Does anyone have tips for getting interviews at these kinds of companies? I can stick it out at my current company for another year or two but I am not a huge fan of the industry and want to switch to either a startup or big tech soon. Thanks!",

It also highlights which retakes give the biggest CGPA lift and catches common mistakes like wrong credit counts.To avoid manual entry it pulled grades by logging into the student portal and scraping the data, and it grew to about 3000 users. When the portal switched to heavier redirects I used Selenium to keep the login flow working. Later the university added CAPTCHA and warned against automated access, so I stopped the scraping and made the server down. Security wise, I tried to be strict: I didn’t store passwords, I used HTTPS, limited logs, and deleted any temporary transcript files immediately after parsing. I also kept the heavy “what if” calculations client side so the server didn’t keep sensitive data around or hammer the university systems.Should I talk about this in interviews or leave it off? If I mention it, how do I frame it without looking like someone who ignores security boundaries?",

Took me 7 months to find FTE after graduation and it was until I successfully got an offer last year with a decent modest six figure entry level wage in the bay area.But as time went on. This organization is messy, while flatter, it means my direct manager has lots and dozens of reports and oversees the infrastructure group comprised of 4-5 teams of 4-5 people that are almost siloed away from each other. The Python software architecture project work that I do doesn't even correlate with any of my coworkers' work because they manage VM/server infrastructure and windows administration/dev ops/click ops.My role got a little more defined when I was handed a Django application and 20 affiliated hardware servers and was told to fix it alone by myself. There is no cloud in this role. All the web servers, databases, and load balancers servers I had to setup, update, and reconfigure by myself. In 4 months, I shipped a working feature end to end using Copilot/Claude for documentation and architectural design reviews; boilerplating the code and then let me apply the specific automated workflow needed to make it work for our use case. I completely revamped the frontend UI with modern look as well and completely overhauled the original design to process requests quicker by creating a more efficient queuing system.Plus, in Q1 this month I am handed a new Django project to develop and test with (finally) 1 or 2 more developers which should be a better experience.Despite the mess and lack of structure, I own the first app now and it's my responsibility and I don't plan on leaving within the short term since I haven't yet met my 1 year mark, I am trying to at least make it to my 2nd or 3rd year to maximize learning and salary.The only other Django developers are on another team under my manager but I specifically have to reach out to them if I ever want help from them. But so far, AI is my savior for a lot of issues.I feel like I am growing a lot using the terminology like design patterns and microservices I learned in school/internships, and applying it to what I develop in my role even if it's essentially a bus factor I am making for the organization.My manager knows I am independent on this too and he knows I am going to be swamped this and next quarter. And he and I are trying our hardest to make sure I get the support I need when I need it.Though the performance review cycle ends really soon and I think I did a hell of a job but we'll see if I get that 5-6% raise.So far, I am enjoying the experience being employed and funding my travel goals this year.",

I'm 60 applications in with 12 rejections and only 3 OAs, and so I figured I'd need to work on my resume by way of projects. At the same time, I've been having trouble figuring out what projects to make. I had a list of ideas (first two were in progress and were originally on my resume):* interactive Rubik’s Cube in THREE.js (and possibly a solver)* 2D/3D graphing application with user system in Electron, React, and THREE.js* Geometry Dash “git” that allows for pushing/pulling of versions of levels multiple users create with between different devices* Ray Tracer, but experimenting with Linux-inspired scheduling strategies to potentially optimize performance in comparison with traditional implementation technique* GameBoy emulator iOS mobile app (using Swift, SwiftUI, Objective-C)* NYC subway map using MTA API for simulating impact of delays on other trains* AI solver with comparison amongst different optimization techniques for score / efficiency* something related to embedded systems and/or systems programming (not sure what yet)I got feedback that they either weren't complex enough to demonstrate technical skills, original enough to be distinguished from what people have already done, practical enough to solve actual problems that people might have and have an impact, or some combination of those. I genuinely couldn't come up with any ideas that actually accounted for all three of these and I couldn't come up with any problems in my life that could be solved with programming a project, so I tried leaning towards using them as learning opportunities that relate to my interests, and planned on switching them out on my resume to fit it for a bigger range job requirements/skills. At the same time as *that* though, I know that experience is a lot more important than projects to recruiters and I did feel like I was starting to get the hang of things with the help of my team at work. But of course, that might not be the case 6 days from now. If it is the case (hoping it is) I was wondering if I could get any advice from anyone for what to do.",

Would ask in a saas sub but they're mostly just marketing cesspools and somehow they're not desensitized to high CS salaries; mere new grad big tech pay would have everyone slamming the quit button without further thought.We're DINKs and I have 7 YoE. Bonuses are inconsistent so going with base only, $450k combined beteween me and spouse before starting this biz. I downsized to a far lower paying fully remote job that was much more chill (to start with) and now we're at more like $350K, with my slice being $150K. It's much less chill now and I'm being strained.Business has been up for a few months and pulls in 1MM, with \\~500K profit. Growth has been insane and I can only imagine how much faster it would be with me at the helm full time.In a regular economy it'd be a no brainer, $150K for $500K and way more growth potential.

I could be wrong, I'm not a market analyst. But for this decision, assume that this biz will never pull more than 10MM revenue. At that level, it's probably still sustainable with just myself + agentic coding full time and some cheap support staff.",

I have one non-SWE internship I got during last summer, but during Fall I spammed out maybe 1000 applications, got one interview, then rejected at the final stage. I'm not getting any OAs or interviews at all. I can barely sleep at night anymore, maybe 4-5 hours without some sort of anxiety attack or impending doom so I just really need some guidance right now if possible.",

        "content": "hey yall - posting for a bit of career advice. not really sure where to start so I'll give the rundown. I'm a mid-lvl fullstack SWE at a mid-sized, pre-ipo company - 5 yoe total. Went to a bootcamp back in 2019 and switched into SWE from non-technical role at same company, been there 7 years total now.my title and salary progression in that time:* non-technical role - 60k (with options, no bonus)* associate eng - 70k (more options, no bonus)* swe 1 - 105k (rsus, no bonus)* swe2 - 115k -> 128k -> 140k -> 155k (rsus, no bonus)as you can see, I've been stuck at mid-lvl for a few years now, despite my gunning for promotion to senior. over the course of the past 2 years, my day to day has become increasingly more technical (involving a lot more system design this past year or so - microservices, API work, etc.) with significantly more responsibility. I wasn't promoted last year like I thought I'd be, but I got rave reviews and have had very candid conversations with management (direct and director lvl) about my future. I'm currently the lead on a pretty significant, high vis project for my group which seems like was a very intentional choice to \"groom\" me into Senior, so to speak. all that to say, this feels like the year it finally happens for me but I really wouldn't know until the summer.I'm trying to weigh the opportunity cost of potentially sticking it out for the 6 or so months and seeing thru my goal of finally cracking senior vs. taking interviews with hopes of being hired as a senior (and ideally a higher salary as a result). given that I got into this field pretty deep into adulthood, I've always kinda felt like I'm trying to cover a lot of ground as quickly as possible (sometimes to my detriment).I interviewed extensively last year from feb-sep, the majority of which were for senior roles that I was turned down for due to not having good system design fundamentals. I'm thinking if I try again this year, given my recent practical system design experience maybe I'll get lucky and finally earn myself the promotion.how should I play my cards?",

I currently have publications (first author) in top tier venues, managed interns as well.1. Since I'm coming up on 2 yrs, what kind of positions/role should I be looking at in terms of FAANG (I'm thinking of in terns of roles, am I eligible for senior positions at places like Microsoft)? Even in this case, what are the things I need to stress during the interviews?2. What are key skills that I should be adding to my profile while I do this search? for example hosting interns and aspect like these which are soft skills.Any advice appreciated. Thank you",

        "content": "Hi all, I’m an Android developer with 3+ years of experience, and my current job has become unbearable. Management and HR are a mess, new hires are incompetent, and honestly just going to meetings or the office drains the life out of me.I know quitting without an offer is usually a bad idea, especially with how bad the market is right now, but I’m honestly at my limit. Looking for brutally honest opinions.Some context:* I work in a third-world country and the pay is far below market, even by local standards.* The company is below average technically and professionally.* I have a side project that brings in passive income multiple times my salary.* I freelance on Upwork occasionally and I’m Top Rated with solid ratings.* I have enough savings to live comfortably for years if needed.The main reason I’m still working for companies is for the resume, but lately I’m questioning if it’s even worth it anymore.That said, I also admit that looking for a new job while employed is simpler, it lets you negotiate on your terms and avoids having to justify gaps in interviews.I’m still getting interviews at a decent rate despite the terrible market, but most of them are full of red flags. When I ask for a fair salary, they reject me. I’m burned out from being underpaid and having to deal with constant mess and disrespect.So… would quitting without an offer be foolish, or reasonable given the situation? I’d really appreciate any feedback or people sharing similar experiences.",

I've got 6 years of experience.I'm currently making about 2.8k EUR/month (after tax) working remote for a FinTech company based in the UK and I want to make more.* My English is fluent as I've been speaking it all my life.* I'm really confident about the work I do (especially on the Front-end and UI/UX) as I'm one of the \"higher up\" developers in my team (Not saying this to praise myself but e.g. If the tech lead is off I'm in charge, colleagues come to me when they need an opinion, etc.).For some time I've been hustling after work trying things to make more money.* I've tried YouTube shorts for a bit (Didn't get far, after trying with multiple accounts and struggling with editing, etc. I've realised that I'd be better off doing something in my space (Web Development/Programming) so dropped that).* I have a fully built out an agency for web services, just need to get clients. I know cliche, but it's pretty niche so I'm hopeful. I've tried reaching out to people on Reddit but no luck yet, now want to switch to doing a full service for free for one project, make a recording of myself presenting why that was done, why that helps, why it's worth it, etc.* Just recently (2d ago) I've started reaching out to Real Estate agents regarding specific web services I can provide for them to increase their lead capture rate. Sent about 30 messages and will definitely be sending more.Now that I put it on \"paper\" I haven't really tried that many things for my age (23), and just as of recently I've started being more serious about \"biting\" into it. I want to have people alike around me, someone that's about grinding and working on owning something of his own that generates him revenue. I'm sure I'll meet them along the way once I have an actual model that works and I get into those people's space.The closest people I have to that is random guys I follow on Instagram to look up to, they're relatively young, making good money doing online business - but again those are not friends. I should find a way to meet them and make them friends/partners but I feel like I have nothing to show/prove yet to make me worthy.I've got 1 close friend that also works from home and likes to hustle but he's not that disciplined in working together and doing it all day every day (we've lived together before for a bit). He for example recently didn't want to go to a trip to Asia where we'd be with our girlfriends and work all day every day, hit the gym, etc. He's pushing his design business (cups, t-shirts, posters, etc), needs to stay in the country because of it, and is making an okay amount of money but unfortunately not someone I can look at as \"we're gonna push each other and make a crap ton of money while being in hot weather, this is going to be great\". I've tried pushing him, trust me.I personally think that my only option is some scalable side hustle that will one day become my main work. I could try and get over-employed/contact work but that isn't scalable so I'd be stuck at having 2 jobs and a max of 5-7k EUR/month.I'm honestly okay alone as well of course but thought I'd put this out there with the goal of meeting like-minded people, or people who have already made it.What I'll be doing for the next period is the same as of now, sit home and work as much as possible.**I'd be more than happy to get advice from you guys! I don't feel lost but it's difficult to tell with just my perspective.**Thank you if you read all this! Feel free to hit me up, I'd love to connect.",
