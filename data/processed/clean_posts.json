        "author": "Dense_Car_591",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,I made a post a while back agonizing whether or not to take a 175k DE II offer at an allegedly toxic company. Wanted to say thank you to everyone in this community for all the helpful advice, comments, and DMs. I ended up rejecting the 175k offer and opted to complete the final round with the second company mentioned in the previous post. Well, I just got the verbal offer! Culture and WLB is reportedly very strong but the biggest factor was that everyone I talked to from peers to potential manager all seemed like people I could enjoy working with 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. Offer Breakdown: fully remote, 145k base, 10% bonus, 14k stock over 4 years First year TC: 165.1k due to stock vesting structure To try to pay forward all the help from this sub, I wanted to share all the things that worked for me during this job hunt. 1. Targeting DE roles that had near 100% tech stack alignment. So for me: Python, SQL, AWS, Airflow, Databricks, Terraform. Nowadays, both recruiters and HMs seem to really try to find candidates with experience in most, if not all tools they use, especially when comparing to my previous job hunts. Drawback is smaller application shotgun blast radius into the void, esp if you are cold applying like I did. 2. Leetcode, unfortunately. I practiced medium-hard questions for SQL and did light prep for DSA (using Python). List, string, dict, stack and queue, 2-pointer easy-medium was enough to get by for the companies I interviewed at but ymmv. Setting a timer and verbalizing my thought process helped for the real thing. 3. Rereading Kimball’s Data Warehouse Toolkit. I read thru the first 4 chapters then cherry picked a few later chapters for scenario based data modeling topics. Once I finished reading and taking notes, I went to ChatGPT and asked it to simulate acting as an interviewer for a data modeling round. This helped me bounce ideas back and forth, especially for domains I had zero familiarity in. 4. Behavioral Prep. Each quarter at my job, I keep a note of all the projects of value I either led or completed and with details like design, stakeholders involved, stats whether it is cost saved or dataset % adoption within org etc, and business results. This helped me organize 5-6 stories that I would use to answer any behavioral question that came my way without too much hesitation or stuttering. For interviewers who dug deeply into the engineering aspect, reviewing topology diagrams and the codebase helped a lot for that aspect. 5. Last but not least, showing excitement over the role and company. I am not too keen on sucking up to strangers or act like a certain product got me geeking but I think it helps when you can show reasons why the role/company/product has some kind of professional or personal connection to you. That’s all I could think of. Shoutout again to all the nice people on this sub for the helpful comments and DMs from earlier!",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I need some advice on a big career shift that just landed on me.I’ve been working at the same company for almost 20 years. Started here at 20, small town, small company, great culture. I’m a traditional data-warehousing person — SQL, ETL, Informatica, DataStage, ODI, PL/SQL, that whole world. My role is Senior Data Engineer, but I talk directly to the CIO because it’s that kind of company. They trust me, I know everyone, and the work-life balance has always been great (never more than 8 hours a day).Recently we acquired another company whose entire data stack is modern cloud: Snowflake, AWS, Git, CI/CD, onboarding systems to the cloud, etc.While I was having lunch, the CIO came to me and basically said:“You’re leading the new cloud data engineering area. Snowflake, AWS, CI/CD. We trust you. You’ll do great. Here’s a 100% salary increase.”No negotiation. Just: This is yours now.He promised the workload won’t be crazy — maybe a few 9–10 hour days in the first six months, then stable again. And he genuinely believes I’m the best person to take this forward.I’m excited but also aware that the tech jump is huge. I want to prepare properly, and the CIO can’t really help with technical questions right now because it’s all new to him too.My plan so far:Learn Snowflake deeply (warehousing concepts + Snowflake specifics)Then study for AWS certifications — maybe Developer Associate or Solutions Architect Associate, so I have a structure to learn. Not necessarily do the certs.Learn modern practices: Git, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, etc.)My question:Is this the right approach?If you were in my shoes, how would you prepare for leading a modern cloud data engineering function?Any advice from people who moved from traditional ETL into cloud data engineering would be appreciated.",

Found duplicates constantly, maybe we configured wrong but after 3 weeks of trying we gave up. Said screw it and rebuilt everything simpler.Ditched kafka entirely, we went with nats for messaging, services pull at own pace so no backpressure disasters. Custom go services instead of spark because spark was 90% overhead for what we needed and cut airflow for most things, use scheduled messages. Some results after 4 months: latency 3-4 hours to 45 minutes, zero lost messages, infrastructure costs down 40%.I know kafka has its place. For us it was like using cargo ship to cross a river, way overkill and operational complexity made everything worse not better.

That way, if something goes wrong or the VM blows up, we can pick up where we left off* Processing is quick, most likely less than a second. But even 1s per file is like 20 days so I may need to process in parallel?1. Any criticism on the above plan?2. Any words of wisdom of those who have been there done that?Thanks!",

On the other hand, this direction is slightly easier and little more interesting to me and maybe business communication skills will be more valuable in the future than technical skills.The Data Engineer path, however, is more technically demanding, but the long-term benefits seem much greater - better pay, more opportunities, lower risk of being replaced by AI and more technical skill development.Please don’t reply with “just do what you like,” because I’ve spent several years in a dead-end job and at the end of the day, work is work.I’m just a junior with only a few days of experience who already has to make an important decision, so I'm sorry if these questions are stupid.",

Is it safe*** **?\"**. Lineage alone often isn't enough to quickly assess the risk especially in large projects. That's why I've extended my tool to be more **\"impact analysis\"** oriented. It uses the column lineage to generate a high-level, actionable view that clearly defines how and where the selected column is utilized in downstream assets, **without the need for navigating in the whole lineage graph** (which can be painful / error prone), it shows :* **Derived Transformations:** Columns that are transformed based on the selected column. These usually require a more extended review compared to a direct reference, and this is where the tool helps you quickly spot them (with the code of the transfo).* **Simple Projections:** Columns that are a direct, untransformed reference of the selected column.**Github Repo:** `Fszta/dbt-column-lineage` **Demo version:** I deployed a live test version -> You can find the link in the repository.I've currently only tested this with Snowflake, DuckDB, and MSSQL.

(.. although the explanation is not known to me yet). Why did Microsoft kill their Spark on Kubernetes (HDInsight on AKS)? I had once tested the preview and it seemed like a very exciting innovation. Now it is a year later and I'm waiting five mins for a sluggish \"custom Spark pool\" to be initialized on Fabric, and I can't help but think that Microsoft BI folks have really lost their way! I totally understand that Microsoft can get higher margins by pushing their \"Fabric\" SaaS at the expense of their PaaS services like HDI. However I think that building HDI on AKS was a great opportunity to innovate with containerized Spark. Once finished, it may have been an even more compelling and cost-effective than Spark on Databricks! And eventually they could have shared the technology with their downstream SaaS products like Fabric, for the sake of their lower-code users as well!Does anyone understand this? Was it just a cost-cutting measure because they didn't see a path to profitability?",

Imagine something like:movie → version → presentation → external\\_idsBut none of the child tables store the movie\\_id. Everything is connected through these relationship tables, and you have to hop 3–4 tables to get anything meaningful.Here’s a small example:* movies(movie\\_id)* versions(version\\_id)* presentations(pres\\_id)* external\\_ids(ext\\_id)  Relationship goesMovie → version → presentation → external\\_idI am trying to achieve a denormalised version of this table, like smaller data marts, which makes my life easier for sharing the data downstream. This is just one of the examples; my goal is to create smaller such data marts, so it is easier for me to join on this ID later to get the data I need for downstream consumersA normal full query is fine — Example SELECT  m.movie_id, v.version_id,  p.pres_id,  e.value FROM movies m JOIN movie_to_version mv ON m.movie_id = mv.movie_id JOIN versions v ON mv.version_id = v.version_id JOIN version_to_pres vp ON v.version_id = vp.version_id JOIN presentations p ON vp.pres_id = p.pres_id JOIN pres_to_external pe ON p.pres_id = pe.pres_id JOIN external_ids e ON pe.ext_id = e.ext_id; The actual pain is incremental loading. Like, let’s say something small changes in external\\_ids. The row with ext\\_id = 999 has been updated.I’d have to basically walk backwards:ext → pres → version → movieThis is just a sample example, in reality, I have more complex cascading joins, I am currently looking at in future around 100 tables to join, not all together, just in all, to create smaller denormalised tables, which I can later use as an intermediate silver layer to create my final gold layer.Also, I need to send incremental changes updated to the downstream database as well, that's another pain in the ass.I’ve thought about:– just doing the reverse join logic inside every dimension (sounds nasty) – maintaining some lineage table like child\\_id → movie\\_id – or prebuilding a flattened table that basically stores all the hops, so the downstream tables don’t have to deal with the graphBut honestly, I don’t know if I’m overcomplicating it or missing some obvious pattern. We’re on Spark + S3 + Glue Iceberg.Anyway, has anyone dealt with really normalised, multi-hop relationship models in Spark and managed to make incremental ETL sane?",

I’m burnt out on the \"people\" side of the job - the constant stakeholder management, team management, the meetings, and the subjective decision-making... so on. I realized (and over the years ignored) that the only time I’m truly happy at work is when I’m digging into data or doing something technical. I miss doing quiet work where there is a clear right or wrong answer (more or less).I'm thinking about pivoting to an individual contributor role and one of the roles I'm considering is data engineering/analytics.My study plan is to double down on advanced SQL, pick up Python and learn PowerBI for the \"product\" side. I already know basic to intermediate SQL (used it for my own work), I know basic programming.I’d love a reality check on two things: First, is data engineering actually a \"safer\" environment for someone who wants to code but is anxious about the \"people\" side?Second, given my age and background, does it make sense to move in this direction in this economy?Thanks for the help",

        "content": "Hi All,I was discussing with a colleague on optimizing strategies of code on oyspark. They mentioned that repartitioning decreased the run time drastically by 60% for joins. And it made me wonder, why that would be because:1. Without explocit repartitioning, Spark would still do shuffle exchange to bring the date on executor, the same operation which a repartition would have triggered, so moving it up the chain shouldn't make much difference to speed?2. Though, I can see the value where after repartitioning we cache the data and use it in more joins ( in seperate action), as Spark native engine wouldn't cache or persist repartitioning, is this right assumption?So, I am trying to understand in which scenarios doing repartitioning would beat Sparks catalyst native repartitioning?",

        "author": "Hefty-Citron2066",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Been doing data engineering for a while now and wanted to share some thoughts on a pattern I've been seeing more of.**TL;DR:** Instead of trying to consolidate all your data into one platform (which never actually works), there's a growing movement to federate metadata instead. The \"metadata lake\" concept. After being skeptical, I'm starting to think this is the right approach for most orgs.## The pattern that keeps repeatingEvery company I've worked at has gone through the same cycle:1. Start with one data platform (Hadoop, Snowflake, Databricks, whatever)2. A different team needs something the main platform doesn't do well3. They spin up their own thing (separate warehouse, different catalog, etc.)4. Now you have two data platforms5. Leadership says \"we need to consolidate\"6. Migration project starts, takes forever, never finishes7. Meanwhile a third platform gets added for ML or streaming8. RepeatSound familiar? I've seen this at three different companies now. The consolidation never actually happens because:- Migrations are expensive and risky- Different tools really are better for different workloads- Teams have opinions and organizational capital to protect their choices- By the time you finish migrating, something new has come along## The alternative: federate the metadataI've been reading about and experimenting with the \"metadata lake\" approach. The idea is:- Accept that you'll have multiple data platforms- Don't try to move the data- Instead, create a unified layer that federates the metadata- Apply governance and discovery at that layerThe key insight is that data is expensive to move but metadata is cheap. You can't easily migrate petabytes of data from Snowflake to Databricks, but you can absolutely sync the schema information, ownership, lineage, and access policies.## Tools in this spaceThe main open source option I've found is Apache Gravitino (https://github.com/apache/gravitino). It's an Apache TLP that does catalog federation. You point it at your existing catalogs (Hive, Iceberg, Kafka schema registry, JDBC sources) and it presents them through unified APIs.What I like about it:- Doesn't require migration, works with what you have- Supports both tabular and non-tabular data (filesets, message topics)- Governance policies apply across all federated catalogs- Vendor neutral, Apache licensed- The team behind it has serious credentials (Apache Spark, Hadoop committers)GitHub: https://github.com/apache/gravitino (2.3k stars)There's also a good article explaining the philosophy: https://medium.com/datastrato/if-youre-not-all-in-on-databricks-why-metadata-freedom-matters-35cc5b15b24e## My POC experienceRan a quick POC federating our Hive metastore, an Iceberg catalog, and Kafka schema registry. Took about 3 hours to set up. The unified view is genuinely useful. I can see tables, topics, and schemas all in one place with consistent APIs.The cross-catalog queries work but I'd still recommend keeping hot path queries within single systems. The value is more in discovery, governance, and breaking down silos than in making cross-system joins performant.## When this makes sense- You have data spread across multiple platforms (most enterprises)- Consolidation has failed or isn't realistic- You need unified governance but can't force everyone onto one tool- You're multi-cloud and want to avoid vendor lock-in- You have both batch and streaming data that need to be discoverable## When it might not- You're a startup that can actually standardize on one platform- Your data volumes are small enough that migration is feasible- You don't have governance or discovery problems yet## Questions for the community1. Has anyone else moved toward this federated metadata approach? What's your experience?2. Are there other tools in this space I should be looking at? I know DataHub and Atlan exist but they feel more like discovery tools than unified metadata layers.3. For those who successfully consolidated onto one platform, how did you actually do it? Genuinely curious if there's a playbook I'm missing.",

        "author": "Jaded_Bar_9951",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi,I'm 26 and I just graduated in Data Science. Two months ago I started working in a small but growing company as a mix Data Engineer/Data Scientist. Basically, now I'm making order in their data, writing different pipelines to do stuff (I know it's super generic, but it's not the point of the post). To schedule the pipelines, I decided to use Airflow. I'm not a pro, but I'm trying to read stuff and watch as many videos as I can about best practices and so on to do things well. The thing is that my company outsourced the management of the IT infrastructure to another and even smaller company, which made sense in the past because my company was small and they didn't need the control, nor did they have IT figures in the company. Now things are changing, and they have started to build a small IT department to do different stuff. To install Airflow on our servers, I had to pass through this company, which I mean, I understand and it was ok. The IT company knew nothing about Airflow, it was the first time for them and they needed a looooot of time to read everything they could and install it \"safely\". The problem is that now they don't let me do the most basic stuff without passing through them, like make a little change in the config file (lfor example, adding the SMTP server for the emails) or install python packages, not even restart Airflow. Every time I need to open a ticket and wait, wait, wait. It happened in the past that airflow had some problems and I had to tell them how to fix them, because they didn't let me do it. I asked many times the permission to do these basic operations, and they told me that they don't want to allow me to do it because they have the responsibility of the correct functioning of the software, and if I touch it they cant guarantee it. I told them that I know what i'm doing, and there is no risk at all. Furthermore, most of the things that I do are BI stuff, so it's just querying operational databases and make some transformations on the data, the worst thing that can happen is that one day I don't deliver a dataset or a dashboard because airflow blocks, but nothing worse can happen. This situation is very frustrating for me because I feel stuck many times, and it annoys me a lot to wait for the most basic and stupid operations. A colleague of mine told me that I have a lot to do, and in the meantime I can work on other tasks. It made me even angrier because, ok I have a lot of stuff to do, but why I have to wait for nothing?? It's super inefficent. My question is, how does it work in normal/structured companies? who has the responsibility of the configuration/packages/restart of airflow? the data engineers or the \"infrastructure\" team?

I’ve been jobless for over a year, and I’m desperate at this point.**My concern/dilemma:**Given that my end goal is DE, should I really stick to the DA/PA → AE → DE route, or should I bypass DA entirely and aim for AE → DE? If I do land a DA job, I’ll have to go through another full transition again, whereas AE → DE is almost a direct pipeline.A lot of this dilemma comes from the fact that I’m not even getting any calls for DA roles because the market is congested and full of scams/fake hiring. If I were getting traction, I would’ve followed the original plan.But since I’m getting nowhere, should I aim directly for AE instead? I genuinely like the AE toolset- dbt, Snowflake, data modeling, that’s the direction I want to go.I’m just unsure whether hiring managers would consider me for an AE role purely based on my projects and skills, given that I don’t yet have production experience. What if I face same issue in AE and be back to square one after spending 3-4 month learning and applying. Should I just stick to DA/PA and keep applying. Please help!",

        "content": "**Built an ADBC driver for Exasol in Rust with Apache Arrow support**I've been learning Rust for a while now, and after building a few CLI tools, I wanted to tackle something meatier. So I built `exarrow-rs` \\- an ADBC-compatible database driver for Exasol that uses Apache Arrow's columnar format.**What is it?**It's essentially a bridge between Exasol databases and the Arrow ecosystem. Instead of row-by-row data transfer (which is slow for analytical queries), it uses Arrow's columnar format to move data efficiently. The driver implements the ADBC (Arrow Database Connectivity) standard, which is like ODBC/JDBC but designed around Arrow from the ground up.**The interesting bits:*** Built entirely async on Tokio - the driver communicates with Exasol over WebSockets (using their native WebSocket API)* Type-safe parameter binding using Rust's type system* Comprehensive type mapping between Exasol's SQL types and Arrow types (including fun edge cases like `DECIMAL(p)` → `Decimal256`)* C FFI layer so it works with the ADBC driver manager, meaning you can load it dynamically from other languages**Caveat:**It uses the latest WebSockets API of Exasol since Exasol does not support Arrow natively, yet. So currently, it is converting Json responses into Arrow batches. See [exasol/websocket-api](https://github.com/exasol/websocket-api) for more details on Exasol WebSockets.**The learning experience:**The hardest part was honestly getting the async WebSocket communication right while maintaining ADBC's synchronous-looking API. Also, Arrow's type system is... extensive. Mapping SQL types to Arrow types taught me a lot about both ecosystems.**What is Exasol?**Exasol Analytics Engine is a high-performance, in-memory engine designed for near real-time analytics, data warehousing, and AI/ML workloads.Exasol is obviously an enterprise product, BUT it has a free Docker version which is pretty fast. And they offer a free personal edition for deployment in the Cloud in case you hit the limits of your laptop.**The project**It's MIT licensed and community-maintained. It is not officially maintained by Exasol! Would love feedback, especially from folks who've worked with Arrow or built database drivers before.What gotchas should I watch out for? Any ADBC quirks I should know about?Also happy to answer questions about Rust async patterns, Arrow integration, or Exasol in general!",

However, dbt loads the seed CSV directly into the SQLite database without my prior transformations taking effect. I want to transform first and then load.Setup:\\* Data source: 22 DataFrames extracted from PDF tables\\* Database: SQLite (for prototype only)\\* ETL/ELT tool: preferably dbt, but not mandatory\\* Language: Python Problem: How can I set up an ETL workflow where DataFrames are processed and transformed directly without having to load them into dbt as CSV (seeds) beforehand?Is there a way to integrate DataFrames directly into a dbt model process? If not, what alternative tools are suitable (e.g., Airflow, Dagster, Prefect, pandas-based ETL pipelines, etc.)?Previous attempts:\\* dbt seed: loads CSV directly into the database → transformations don't work\\* dbt models: only work if the data is already in the database, which I want to avoid\\* Currently: manual type conversions in Python (float, int, string, datetime)Looking for: Best practices or tool recommendations for directly transforming DataFrames and then loading them into SQLite – with or without dbt.

So I've started my data engineering studies this year and I'm having a lot of doubts on what should I do on some projects regarding ingestion and storage.I'll list two examples that I'm currently facing below and I'd like some tips, so thanks in advance!! **Project 1:****- The source:** An ERP's API (REST) where I extract 6 dim tables and 2 fact tables + 2 other google sheets that are manually input. Until now all sources are structured data**- Size:** <10MB for everything and about 10-12K (maybe 15k 'til end of the year) lines summing all tables**- Current Approach:** gather everything on Power BI, making ingestion (full load), \"storage\", schemas and else there.**- Main bottleneck:** it takes 1+ hour to refresh both fact tables**- Desired Outcome:** to use a data ingestion tool for the API calls (at least twice a month), to use a transformation tool, a proper storage (Postgre SQL for example) and then display the info on PBIWhat would you recommend? I'm considering a data ingestion tool (erathos) + databricks for this project, but I'm afraid it may be too much for few data and also somewhat costly in the long term. **Project 2:****- The source:** An ERP's API (REST) where I extract 4/5 dim tables and 1 fact table + 2 other PDF sources (requiring RAG). So both structured and unstructured data**- Size:** data size is unknown yet but I suppose that there'll be 100k+ lines summing all tables, considering their current excel sheets**- Current Approach:** there is no approach yet, but I'd do the same as project 1 with what I know so far**- Desired Outcome:** same as project 1What would you recommend? I'm considering the same idea for project 1. Sorry if it's a little confusing... if it needs more context let me know.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi!So I am finally getting around to reading the Data Warehouse Toolkit by Ralph Kimball and I'm confused. I have reached Chapter 4: Inventory, which includes the following ERD for an example on periodic snapshot facts. https://preview.redd.it/tfxpmlj27o4g1.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=115f322cd498649895da55f8b01f69e3212b80c1In this section, he describes all facts in this table except for 'Quantity on Hand' as fully additive:>Notice that quantity on hand is semi-additive, but the other measures in the enhanced periodic snapshot are all fully additive. The quantity sold amount has been rolled up to the snapshot’s daily granularity. The valuation columns are extended, additive amounts. In some periodic snapshot inventory schemas, it is useful to store the beginning balance, the inventory change or delta, along with the ending balance. In this scenario, the balances are again semi-additive, whereas the deltas are fully additive across all the dimensionsHowever, this seems incorrect? 'Inventory Dollar Value at Cost' and 'Inventory Value at Latest Selling Price' sound like balances to me, which are not additive across time and therefore they would be semi-additive facts. For further context here is Kimball's exact wording on the differences: >The numeric measures in a fact table fall into three categories. The most flexible and useful facts are *fully additive*; additive measures can be summed across any of the dimensions associated with the fact table. *Semi-additive* measures can be summed across some dimensions, but not all; balance amounts are common semi-additive facts because they are additive across all dimensions **except time**. The only way this seems to make sense is that these are supposed to be deltas, where the first record in the table has a 'starting value' that reflects the initial balance and then each day the snapshot would capture the change in each of those balances, but that seems like an odd design choice to me, and if so the naming of the columns doesn't do a good job of describing that. Am I missing something or is Kimball contradicting himself here?",

Sessions spanning multiple days now start to conspire and ruin our pipelines.A single session can look different depending on the day we process it. Example:* On Day X, a session might touch marketing channels A and B;* After crossing midnight, on Day X+1 it hits channel C;* On day X+1 we won’t know the full list of channels touched previously, unless we reach back to day X’s data first.Same with devices: Day X sees A + B; Day X+1 sees C. Each batch only sees its own slice, so no run has the full picture. Looking back an extra day just shifts the problem, since sessions can always start the day before.Looking back at prior days feels like a backfill nightmare come true, yet every discussion keeps circling back to the same question: how do you handle sessions that span multiple days?I feel like I’m missing a clean, practical approach.

        "author": "Decent-Goose-5799",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering! A few weeks ago I shared Rigatoni, my CDC framework in Rust. I just published comprehensive benchmarks and the results are interesting! TL;DR Performance: \\- \\~780ns per event for core processing (linear scaling up to 10K events) \\- \\~1.2μs per event for JSON serialization \\- 7.65ms to write 1,000 events to S3 with ZSTD compression \\- Production throughput: 10K-100K events/sec \\- \\~2ns per event for operation filtering (essentially free) Most Interesting Findings: 1. ZSTD wins across the board: 14% faster than GZIP and 33% faster than uncompressed JSON for S3 writes 2. Batch size is forgiving: Minimal latency differences between 100-2000 event batches (<10% variance) 3. Concurrency sweet spot: 2 concurrent S3 writes = 99% efficiency, 4 = 61%, 8+ = diminishing returns 4. Filtering is free: Operation type filtering costs \\~2ns per event - use it liberally! 5. Deduplication overhead: Only +30% overhead for exactly-once semantics, consistent across batch sizes Benchmark Setup: \\- Built with [Criterion.rs](http://Criterion.rs) for statistical analysis \\- LocalStack for S3 testing (eliminates network variance) \\- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions \\- Detailed HTML reports with regression detection The benchmarks helped me identify optimal production configurations: Pipeline::builder().batch\\_size(500) // Sweet spot.batch\\_timeout(50) // ms.max\\_concurrent\\_writes(3) // Optimal S3 concurrency.build() Architecture: Rigatoni is built on Tokio with async/await, supports MongoDB change streams → S3 (JSON/Parquet/Avro), Redis state store for distributed deployments, and Prometheus metrics. What I Tested: \\- Batch processing across different sizes (10-10K events) \\- Serialization formats (JSON, Parquet, Avro) \\- Compression methods (ZSTD, GZIP, none) \\- Concurrent S3 writes and throughput scaling \\- State management and memory patterns \\- Advanced patterns (filtering, deduplication, grouping) :bar_chart: Full benchmark report: [https://valeriouberti.github.io/rigatoni/performance](https://valeriouberti.github.io/rigatoni/performance) :crab: Source code: [https://github.com/valeriouberti/rigatoni](https://github.com/valeriouberti/rigatoni)Happy to discuss the methodology, trade-offs, or answer questions about CDC architectures in Rust!For those who missed the original post: Rigatoni is a framework for streaming MongoDB change events to S3 with configurable batching, multiple serialization formats, and compression.

BI tools like Quicksight query Redshift, and for the GenAI side, user prompts get converted to SQL and run against the warehouse, with Bedrock returning the response. I’m also maintaining Glue schemas so Athena can query directly.While doing all this, I realized I actually love the data side. I’ve provisioned DBs, clusters, HA/DR before, but I’ve never been hands-on with things like data modeling, indexing, or deeper DB/app-level concepts.Since everything in this work revolves around databases, I’m now really eager to learn core database internals, components, and fundamentals so I can master the data side.My question:Is this a good direction for learning data engineering, or should I modify my approach?

First of all, it looks ugly, and my PyCharm isn't the best at formatting or analyzing them. Second, I think they are super hard to debug, as they are very complex. Usually, I need to copy them out of the code and to the duckdb CLI or the duckdb GUI to analyze them individually. Right now, I am very unhappy about this workflow.

I've decided to stop worrying about the gap and finally get back into the saddle to break my impostor syndrome.My goal is to build a portfolio of 2–3 solid projects to prove (to myself and employers) that I can still write code. I’m looking for some feedback and/or suggestions on a learning path.As it stands, I have familiarity with the following programming languages and will list my strength/capability with said languages:Python: 8/10 - I can confidently write most things in Python and I think the only thing that I would need to re-visit are some OOP concepts and other small nuances given that most OOP I did during my undergraduate years were done in Java. I've tinkered with (but could never really finish or grasp) Pythonic frameworks like Flask and Django, and that's as far as I've ever went project-wise with the language. Can say without a doubt it's my strongest language. I have some books like *Fluent Python 2nd Edition, Django 4 By Example 4th Edition,* that I bought a year or so ago; was wondering if they're still relevant or have become outdated. What other books or resources would you recommend?Java: 5/10 - It's been a *whileeeeeee* since I wrote anything in Java, but a lot of job descriptions I've seen for listings in my area have things like Java Spring and Spring Boot which have roots in the language, therefore piquing my interest to re-visiting Java. The problem? I can hardly remember the syntax let alone know if it's worth re-learning. Is it worth re-visiting Java just for the job market, or should I double down on Python to get \"job ready\" faster? If I do go the Java route, what is the best \"refresher\" resource for someone who already understands the theory but forgot the syntax?C++: 5/10 - Roughly the same description as above, but will say it was my favorite to play around with and was a bit simpler to understand vs. Java. Was told there was still demand with the language, particularly in Finance and Embedded Systems. ... and other languages that I can say I have \"familiarity\" with, but have hardly done things in: C#, Bash, and JavaScript.Thus, what would you guys recommend I start with topic-wise, anything-wise? Also, I like physical media such as books so I can take notes and physically get involved with the learning. Any recommendations would be much appreciated!

        "content": "Hey, I’ve been building my REST API and recently stumbled upon a design problem. I’m working on an app for managing a car repair shop. I currently have a few routes, such as:* `/api/clients`* `/api/cars`* `/api/car`* `/api/jobs-histories` (where we store each car’s repair history)Recently, my frontend developer asked me to create an endpoint that would allow him to **send a client and a car in a single request**, and also to **fetch a client and their car in a single request**. Now I’m wondering how to handle this in a RESTful way.I’ve considered several options, but none of them seem ideal:1. Allow passing a car object to the `/clients` route so that both objects are created together. But this feels wrong because the operation is supposed to create only a client, not a client and a car.2. Introduce a new route like `/api/registration`. But the name feels misleading, and creating a new representation for every such scenario seems odd.3. Add some kind of action endpoint like `/api/client/with-car`, but this looks like an anti-pattern since verbs should not appear in REST endpoints.4. Create a generic actions/transactions endpoint like `/api/actions` or `/api/transactions` and put things like `/api/actions/client-with-car` under it. But this also feels like an anti-pattern.Do you have any tips on which approach I should take? What is the correct way to solve this in a RESTful manner? UPDATE:Hey guys, I think I’ve found a way to address this. Thanks for all the answers.The frontend needed this additional query mostly for convenience and to reduce latency in the app plus to make operation easier for frontend. After thinking about it, I realized that the first solution isn’t as bad as I initially thought. It’s actually quite reasonable: the **Client** is an aggregate root and it owns the **Car**, so creating both in a single request is acceptable(car as optional param)I can also later support an `include` query parameter that allows the caller to decide whether they want the client returned with the car or not. This makes the route much more flexible and makes the entire API more expressive, because we’re not creating artificial endpoints for every possible data representation.I think that API should describe **business entities**, not implementation details (like different representations of the same thing). So I’ll go with the first solution.Thanks for all the answers!",

We are part of a Commerce faculty, and most of our students do not come from a strong mathematics background.Currently, we teach programming, databases, and web development in first and second year, and then run a final industry project in third year.Some colleagues feel we should start with C# in first year to teach programming fundamentals, then cover HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React in second year, followed by the industry project in third year. Others prefer a “Project Odin” style approach: starting with HTML, then introducing JavaScript within HTML, and later moving to JavaScript in a Node environment. O yes, there are some tooling, deployment, cloud etc. scattered across the different courses. What is the view of this community?",

        "content": "Programming has always caught my attention. I've made small games on apps like Scratch in the past just for fun, and also decided to learn some Python. I wanted to study a career that I both enjoyed and could get good money from, so I decided to go for Systems Engineering (in a University that focuses on Software Development and ICT).At first it was really fun, I learned pseudocode and at the end of the semester I made an over 2000 line program that contained 10 minigames, each one more complex than the other. Everything was fine, until I got to the second semester and started learning basic programming. I found out they focused only on teaching java, and in the future we'll learn other languages like C++ and CSS, and while I stayed on track for most of the time, everything collapsed when we got to OPP and GUIs. Our teacher only taught us the basics, and said we had to learn the rest by ourselves. I couldn't find the time to do it because of homework from other subjects, and even when I did, I forgot everything faster than usual. Then he taught us UML diagrams, and same story, even when I watched a lot of tutorials, I could never understand how to do it properly.My grades dropped a lot at this point, we had to construct small business applications that stored data on arraylists. I always got stuck at points where I tried to compile but got errors everywhere, and from that moment on, even if I wanted to learn so hard I just couldn't get myself to do it. Programming now feels overwhelming and boring, even if I get excited when thinking of project ideas, everything starts to feel too big for me at some point, and I drop it.I'm really nervous because my final exam will be tomorrow and I have no idea how things will turn out for me, and after that I'll be on vacation. I want to improve my coding during that time, but I don't know if I'll have the motivation to do it. Does anyone have any tips for me? How can I recover my motivation again, how can I get myself to learn and actually understand?",

It’s disheartening when I look at threads on this reddit or hear programmers speak about things I literally don’t now a tad about. Because I wanna get to that level and have the drive to do so but not the direction or the patience.I have a ton of motivation and everyday I wake up and try to understand the concepts in OOP (also my next assessment for another topic is due soon which is data structures and algorithms and I’m quite behind because I’ve been focused on this).This just feels like a lost cause I feel like throwing the towel in, I get it’s hard and it’s only going to get harder that’s the point. Sometimes it’s either a syntax issue I’m having, or struggling with ArrayLists and using classes as types it’s all been piled on me quite fast it’s hard to juggle all of these.But even with the basics of using a PC just interacting with files on a PC sometimes deciding where to save something or what to name it makes me overthink to an unhealthy degree.I don’t want to give up and I likely won’t but I’m barely hanging on, I have aspirations to be in this field especially game development one day and to see me struggle at stuff that is presumably so basic is like a punch to the gut.",

In February I’ll start studying at a university where I’ll be surrounded by people who really know software engineering and are happy to help me, so I’ll have good support in real life as well.I have a big long-term project in mind and I’d love your advice on the best technical foundation so I don’t have to switch stacks later.What I want to buildI want to create my own “personal operating system” for ultra high performance, with:A fully custom calendar (not Google Calendar) where I can plan my days, weeks, and months.Project and task management (similar to a mix of Notion / Asana) with goals, priorities, and deadlines.Meditation module with different practices and routines that I can schedule, track, and reflect on.Fitness and sleep integrations using APIs like WHOOP and Oura to pull in data on recovery, strain, sleep quality, etc.A system for goal setting, tracking, and reflection (short-, mid-, and long-term goals).An AI “specialist agent team” for different domains (energy management, focus, planning, reflection, learning, etc.).A main AI “orchestrator” that:Has access to my data (calendar, tasks, biometrics, notes, habits, etc.).Tracks my patterns over time.Gives me suggestions on how to structure my days/weeks, improve performance, and recover better.Dashboards that combine:My current energy / recovery state.Upcoming tasks and projects.Sleep and training history.AI-generated insights and recommendations.On top of that, I have a strong interest in beliefs, mindset, identity, and habits of highly successful people. I want a feature where I can:Store detailed notes about successful people (beliefs, identity, habits, principles, etc.).Have these notes automatically processed into a meta-dashboard that shows common patterns across many people (like an evolving “success blueprint” for myself).Store lots of notes in a flexible way (somewhat Notion-like), with tagging, search, and later analysis by AI.Design requirementsDesign is very important to me:It should look and feel premium, very smooth and beautiful.I want full theming, especially light, dark, and maybe a “galaxy / universe” style theme (I like the look of tools like Comet).I care a lot about micro-interactions, animations, and the general “feel” of the app, not just functionality.Other notes:I don’t want to constantly change programming languages later if I can avoid it. I know migrations are possible, but I’d like to pick a stack that can scale with me from “learning projects” to something potentially serious.I’m okay with starting web-first (desktop browser), and maybe adding mobile later once the core works.Of course I am sure I will have more ideas on what to add in the future so I want the possibility to do so and not be limited by my stack.What I’m currently thinkingRight now, I’m leaning towards:Frontend: React (with something like Tailwind + a modern UI library such as shadcn/ui / MUI / similar for beautiful, customizable components and theming).Backend: Node.js with Express (or maybe NestJS later) for APIs.Database / backend-as-a-service: something like Supabase or Firebase for auth, database, and possibly real-time features.AI layer: calling external APIs (OpenAI / Claude etc.), possibly adding a separate Python microservice later for heavier analysis / agents if needed.My questions to you:What do you think about React + Node.js as the core stack for this kind of project, given that I’m a beginner but will use AI coding assistance and have access to knowledgeable students at university?Are there any major reasons I should consider a different stack (for example, Python + Django, Next.js fullstack, something else) for this type of long-term personal system?From a long-term perspective (maybe turning this into a real product if it gets good), is React + Node + Postgres a solid foundation, or would you pick something else today?Thank you for any advice, architecture ideas, or “don’t do this, you’ll regret it later” warnings.",

        "content": "I really just wanted to get a CS degree at a local college but my study coach is basically telling me to go screw myself because I have mental health issues and trouble working in groups with strangers. I know this sounds weird but my situation is complicated, if I were to explain it this post would be way too long. I'm getting treatment for it and maybe I'll be able to resume college next academic year. I really wish I could just continue instead of wasting my time bc my coach is underestimating me but I need a decent alternative that doesn't cost me a fortune and maybe helps me get through college faster later on if possible. I just want that degree ASAP really.I'm mainly interested in learning programming so I can have a career related to it later and can maybe develop an indie game or two in my off time, before I started with college I had basically zero programming experience, now I have a little but it's not enough really. I thought \"I'll just go through college and when I have my degree I'll be all set\"I learned from boot.dev from a few sponsorships and bought a subscription once but I barely felt like using it bc the opinions on it were mixed and I refunded it. Now there's a pretty good deal for it from Black Friday. I often have trouble with motivating myself to study and getting enjoyment out of it so maybe this helps. Seems like a good fit for an introvert like me I guess? It says you can get hired after 12 or so months of using it but is that actually legit or is it just false advertising? I've also heard mixed opinions about whether the certificates you can get from it, or from anywhere really, are actually useful, or whether employers actually care for them. I know getting a degree is important and I want to get one at some point, this is just an alternative to pass the time until next academic year while I'm getting treatment. I'm not sure if this will actually shorten the time I have to wait before I can get that degree tho.Has anyone here actually taken courses from boot.dev and what are your opinions on it? Were the certificates actually useful? How long will it take me to go through it if I try to use it as a substitue for college and spend like say 40 hrs a week on it? So is this actually useful enough to me or should I go argue with my study coach?EDIT: Just wanted to point out that while I do want to make indie games, I know I most likely won't be able to do it for a living so I do want to get a career that's adjacent to something like that and put programming experience and other CS-related things to use. I'm also consdering university instead of college but idk if that'll actually work better for me. So I guess boot.dev isn't a great way to self study?",

I was also told that CS50x is more of a pure compsci class that helps you understand what goes on under the hood and that I need not necessarily know all of that in order to be a successful programmer. Especially for roles that I am eyeing (devops, cloud, etc...). But on the otherhand it is one of the most recommended courses for beginners. So I am conflicted.Keep in mind I haven't studied anything for 10 years and I don't want to overwhelm myself.I want to be job ready in 1 year or so. So help me decide on an efficient path towards that goal. So CS50x or Helsinki python MOOC(+the python crash course book).Thanks in advance to any suggestions.Edit: I am not saying I'll be job ready with just these courses btw. This is just to get myself started. I'll do other courses down the line.",

        "author": "MoAd340",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I posted here before saying that I’m a Software Engineering graduate who feels completely lost, and many people told me to either try getting an internship or start building small projects to figure out if I even enjoy programming. The problem is that during university I mostly studied just to pass exams, not to really learn, so even though I worked with front-end, Java, C++, and a few other things, I honestly forgot most of it because I never practiced. I also feel like there are a lot of basic concepts I should already know but don’t.Another thing that’s been holding me back is applying to companies. Most places ask for a CV, and I honestly don’t feel confident putting mine out there. It’s not that the things I list are “wrong”—I really did study them—but I don’t master them and barely remember anything. That makes me hesitate to apply for internships or entry-level positions because I feel like I don’t truly deserve the skills I say I have.At the same time, I always felt like things like HTML or even C++ are “easy” and that anyone can learn them, so I’m not sure if I should learn completely different languages like Java or Python, or if I should just stick to one clear track and build from there.Right now I want to restart properly from zero, but I don’t know where to begin. I see a lot of people recommending The Odin Project—would that be a good starting point? I can study around 4–6 hours a day, but I don’t want to waste time on something too basic or something that won’t help me get anywhere. I’m also not sure whether to focus on front-end, back-end, or try both at the same time. And I’m confused about how people even start building small projects—do you follow certain websites for ideas, or specific courses?What’s also discouraging me is AI. It feels like AI can now build a full website in minutes while a beginner needs days. Is this actually true, or am I overthinking it? Should I look into mobile development instead, or try something that fits the market better?Any advice or a clear roadmap for restarting would really mean a lot. Thanks :folded_hands: .",

I don’t know why. I feel like my knowledge of all the languages and frameworks that I learned had vanished (maybe it did?).I just stare at a blank project in VS Code, frozen, and don’t know what to do. I tried watching programming tutorials again to refresh my knowledge on a language but I find it boring and I can barely focus. I also tried a different approach. I tried creating a project instead of watching a youtube tutorial. But it’s the same.This has been going on for about 2 years now. I honestly don’t know what to do. Hoping some of you can give an advice as to what I do. I want to learn programming really. I can still see the same vision on my head about creating cool and helpful projects that help people.

This makes me anxious and I start doubting myself, thinking maybe I’m not cut out for this, that it’s too difficult, or that it’s meant for people smarter than me.On top of that, I rely heavily on AI assistance right now, and honestly, I feel like I wouldn’t be able to write much code without it.I wanted to reach out and ask: are there any QA professionals here who successfully transitioned to development? If so, could you share some words of encouragement or advice? I’d really appreciate hearing about your experience.Thanks in advance!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Edit: I forgot to mention - my company will actually provide me with a .NET project within the next month or so, and they’re giving me the opportunity to contribute to development work while still being in my QA role.

The framework utilizes features such as:* template concepts* NTTP lambdas* monadic types such as std::expectedIn the article, I start with a basic \"vanilla\" C-style bang-bang control algorithm, and work up to a safer, more performant framework. The flexibility and safety of the interface is demonstrated via examples and even a few fully simulated control laws. The final code is also distributed as a freely available single-header library. I'm posting in this community because its both informative, and includes exercises you can do to practice working with these concepts. I'd say this is more intermediate-advanced difficulty than beginner, but it is still really useful for learning more about programming in C++![https://www.volatileint.dev/posts/feedback-controller/](https://www.volatileint.dev/posts/feedback-controller/)",

I would like some feedback on my work if possible.For a little context, I decided to do a 3-reel game in C#. I generaterate a random number between 1 and 116 and print out a line from my reel set files corresponding to that number (I have 3 files each for one reel set and there's one symbol/emoji on each line). Then I compare the emojis printed out to see if it's a matchMy biggest concern is that for every 100 spins, I win 1-2 times. Is it too low? I fear it is, do I fix it by editing my reel sets?As for my reel sets, my approach isn't traditional (from what I've seen). I decided not to include empty/blank spaces on my reel sets, I rather just made a 116 rows long reel sets with symbols on each row.https://preview.redd.it/n7s0ymdvb04g1.png?width=170&format=png&auto=webp&s=61006f7c1aaa160f50d091513d8d63e04be49780https://preview.redd.it/xnr6yesxb04g1.png?width=145&format=png&auto=webp&s=f326f1a01a621345546203c1cdd571c4e6fe46a6https://preview.redd.it/75whbnlzb04g1.png?width=173&format=png&auto=webp&s=4427fb131a39d777da727102bbeb9d3fcdcd2be1What are y'alls thoughts?PS: I study mathematical engineering and I'm thinking of pursuing a path of math in gambling",

        "content": "This might seem like a very trivial question, but I have always been an abysmal learner. So I wanted to listen to some opinions who cracked this thing before me. I took some time off from work and would like to dedicate it to solidifying knowledge in some technologies as well as learning others. I had an idea on how to go about it, but while talking with one colleague his words discouraged me from this initial idea.So, one of us thinks that I should pick up a project, design it in broad terms, do some research on what technologies make sense for it, then learn them as I work on the project. The other thinks that I should make a list of topics (design patterns etc) and technologies I would like to learn, find some solid resources, follow them. As I follow the concepts I also do exercises or make up examples to apply the knowledge / tinker with the different info. As knowledge accumulates, I revisit these exercises and see if there are better ways to do those things and why. By the time I have covered a significant amount of the material, I think of a project that would be fitting for the topics and technologies I am studying and work on it. In case the answer to my question is \"whatever works for you\", I don't know what works for me. I have a couple of years of experience, but I always learn things as I go in a very half baked way. That has made me professionally insecure, because my knowledge does not match my hard work or years of experience.My goals are, 3 months of studying. I should learn design patterns and architecture, solidify my python, airflow, spark and postgresql knowledge. Learn kafka and some kubernetes and aws services. In the end, definitely create at least one project (although I would prefer several smaller projects) that intertwine the different things I learned. Other studying (as well as living ..) I don't have any other commitments Thanks a lot for your time and input.",

Considering how structured the Java standard library is, I expected someone to have built a viewer that maps it all out graphically.But what I keep finding are tools that generate UML from **your** code (IntelliJ UML, Visual Paradigm, etc.), not something that visualizes the hierarchy of `java.*`, `javax.*`, etc. out of the box.So I’m wondering:* Is there a technical reason why no one has made this?* Is it just too large/complex to visualize?* Is it considered not useful enough in practice?* Or does it exist and I’m just missing it?If anyone knows of a project or website that gives a graphical view of the standard Java type hierarchy, I’d love to see it.",

        "author": "Environmental_Emu830",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone. I’m currently in my 5th semester of Computer Engineering and I’m trying to figure out which path to follow professionally. Until recently I was leaning toward software development, but after reading a public-sector job exam syllabus from my city (it had a ton of infrastructure topics), I got really interested in infra/cloud and started considering security too.The problem is: I feel kind of lost about where to start studying infrastructure properly. My initial idea was to use that exam syllabus as a structured study guide, then later go for cloud certs (AWS/Azure/GCP). But someone told me that using a government exam syllabus as a learning roadmap isn’t a great idea, and that infrastructure can be a tough field in terms of pay and quality of life early on (lots of on-call, lower salaries in some places, etc.).They suggested a more “traditional base” first, like:* strong Linux fundamentals (LPIC-1/2)* Windows basics* virtualization (VMware)* storage fundamentals* DB administration* containers (Docker → Kubernetes later)* IaC (Terraform)* configuration management (Ansible)* maybe CompTIA certs (A+, Network+, etc.)They also said DevOps/DevSecOps usually come later in a career, after you’ve had solid experience in infra + dev (and security for DevSecOps).On top of that, I’m planning long-term to work abroad. I have Italian citizenship and I’ve lived in Spain before, so Europe is a realistic option for me. My English is decent (not perfect yet, but improving). I’m also saving money monthly so I can move if needed. That said, if I found a good remote job paying in EUR/USD, I might even stay in Brazil.So my questions are:1. For someone still in college, does it make sense to start with infrastructure as a base and move into cloud later? Or is it better to go straight into cloud studies early on?2. Between infrastructure/cloud and security, which one is smarter to focus on first if I genuinely like both? I’m thinking: build a strong infra foundation first, then if I end up enjoying security more, transition over time since they overlap a lot.3. For people who’ve worked in Europe (or hired there): is it true that with 2–3 years of solid experience you can become competitive there pretty fast? What skills/certs/projects actually matter most for entry-level roles?4. Since I’m still in university, would it be worth trying to transfer to a European university (Erasmus / full transfer / master later), or is it better to finish here and move with experience?I’d really appreciate any advice, especially from people in infra/cloud/security or who’ve made a similar move abroad. Thanks!",

The only way the face became clear enough was by setting the zoom level to less than 50%, which unfortunately made the surrounding conversational text extremely difficult to read.

In November alone, Verizon announced plans to cut more than 13,000 employees, while HP disclosed it may eliminate between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs by 2028. Apple trimmed sales positions managing business, education, and government accounts, and Amazon cut approximately 14,000 corporate workers in October, including more than 1,800 engineers.This doesn't mean AI will take over jobs, I just means AI will more jobs that require physical human interaction in fields like agriculture, plumbing, welding, waste collection etc which will be a goldmine.",

We have issues on the backend and db that are causing scaling issues. We made plans to rewrite critical parts of the code, but my company is terrible at allocating resources and everyone has been working on other things (we’re supposed to be on a code freeze but people are getting massive PRs up to both Fe and be repos).So the CEO and CTO have gotten frustrated with lack of progress and made an insane decision that the CTO will vibe code the frontend and backend alone. He does have the most business context and the original product was poorly written, but this has been worked on for two years and has a lot of custom config that will likely be overlooked in the rewrite and will cause tons of issues for existing customers.My CEO was bragging about how our CTO stays up all night vibe coding and I later found out that they are not even reviewing their frontend code. He expects my team to maintain his code - literally said, “I don’t want to maintain that.” He said it appears to work because his endpoints work (who cares about user interaction). I feel like his failure to manage his team has led to him deciding that it is easier to do it himself than do his job. This is insane right? Do I jump ship? How do I express how ruinous this is as a business decision when both the CEO and CTO are on board?",

I even implemented a solid architecture and proper design patterns, but everything is expected so fast.Because of that, I kept applying to different companies and recently got an interview, and I ended up failing a pretty simple DSA round. I realized today that AI has eaten away all my problem-solving muscles. I’m just conflicted, man. Everywhere I look, companies want developers to integrate more AI into their workflow, and here I am losing my ability to solve DSA, just to get into companies that will eventually ask me to use AI as well.I mean, I’m absolutely all for having good problem-solving skills, but it feels like they aren’t valued the same way they used to be, because every new startup popping up now emphasizes AI to solve problems but requires DSA to pass interviews, which I have no energy to practice all my life with family and kids, especially after a hectic day of an AI-crammed workload.

        "content": "*^(Note: I didn't run any of this thru AI.)***Here's my job and interview experience in 2025. 14yoe.** To not bloat the main thread, some topics will be in comments below.I was working at a fintech company and they did huge layoffs after acquiring 2 companies, nearly every engineer from our division was cut. it frikin sucks but it is what it is.350 applications -> 18 recruiter calls -> 12 tech screens -> 3 final rounds -> 1 offer;i applied to practically every single front end position in existence.Sankey diagram here [https://i.imgur.com/pwHagNt.png](https://i.imgur.com/pwHagNt.png)Time elapsed: 3 months.I landed an incredible offer with Marvell Semiconductor as Staff UI Architect!This position is unique- hybrid of Front End Engineering + UI/UX Design. I was tested on designing UI's for semiconductor (switches, data center etc) data visualization, as well as javascript fundamentals. I initially asked, wouldn't you want a graphic designer since bulk of the work is UI/UX design? but they said no, they could never understand the technicals of FE dev nor EE. they wanted someone who knew UI/UX design, FE, AND EE. So i was a unique fit for the role.**Stats:**\\-TC: Years 1-4: 248k -> 276k -> 303k -> 330k (Includes estimate of guaranteed refreshers)\\-High level role with mostly design + telling other devs what to create, less coding\\-4 days a week, 30mi commute 10AM-2:30PM, avoids traffic, 45mins. On call for overseas folks 8-10PM. + Occasional travel overseas to india.\\-highly rated on glassdoor, low layoffs compared to peers\\-incredibly smart EE folks with buncha guys PhD from MIT in Physics\\-I studied EE in college but pivoted to FE dev and now this is almost going back to my roots.Interview:\\-I didn't even expect a call back, the position seemed out of my league, but behold, i did. Told recruiter my background in FE dev, not a pro UIUX designer but i know the concepts and i work with them. Said he'll get back to me and the next week they want me for a GIGA HARDCORE FINAL ROUND with 6 directors/vps/staff engineers. 6 1:1's PLUS a presentation to all 6.Oh my god I’ve never got grilled on UX design this hard in my life. One of the directors (PhD from MIT) asked me: Say aliens are invading earth. You need to design a control panel for a missile defense system that is user friendly to the operators. Button? Console; command line etc? What’s the design like, how about communication? How do u communicate to others, alarm system? Should there be a mute button? If the operator is in a hurry and needs split second decision how do u ensure the cleanest UI design? Security?Another director (ex-AWS) asked: Say u have a data center with servers and switches that transmit data, but data can be failed / low quality / bad transmission, design a gui for this.VP asked me: Say there’s a bar graph. X axis is quality and Y is number of items. Title of graph is “amount of items of various qualities over the past 24 hours”. Now, we don’t like this presentation and instead want the X axis to be time. But we still want to show the data for quality/# , so we’re adding another data point. How do we display the graph now?Staff FE dev grilled me on js fundamentals such as closures and promises. I fumbled on a few questions but managed to get most, explaining thought process.Crazy interviews, hiring manager told me as a closing thought \"This position is challenging to fill\" and i had that thought RACING in my head 24/7. what could it mean? Did he like me and i'm a contender? Or did it mean \"this is a tough role to pass\"; i asked chatGPT and it said \"THIS IS A HUGE GREEN SIGNAL\" i was like lolwut really? ok then!Week later recruiter emails me \"I wanted to connect with you regarding feedback and next steps\" im like NEXT STEPS?? GG? lets fkin goooooooooo. and boom offer.Craziest part is i couldn't prepare for these UI questions, came leftfield, i just winged it and somehow i had enough intuition to pass them. Recruiter told me many candidates were able to pass coding, but struggled/froze on the Design Mission Control System design question. I guess i have some semblance of talent in UI design?\\----Some FE coding questions I had this year:**Discord -** tech screen - failedCreate a UI for a formula parser that has fields a, b, c. You can type numbers in the field and the output of the fields would be those numbers, but you can also type letters in the fields and they would add up the numbers stored. For example in field A if you type 3 the output of field A is 3. Then if you type A in field B the output of B is 3. In field C if you type in AB you get 6 (3+3) the reqs were so ambiguous so it took me awhile to understand the problem. NO AI, write on own IDE with screenshare.**Crunchyroll** \\- tech screen - passedCreate a react app that renders a collection of anime titles and its image, from json data;for(var i=0; i<5; i++) setTimeOut console.log(i) \"trick\" question whats the output and why?**Crunchyroll -** final coding round - failedPolyfill the \"getElementsByClassName\" function. Aced system design though, the interviewer was impressed.**Walmart -** tech screen - ghostedWrite a \"deepclone\" function that copies an object with variable depth and contains anything, including other objects, arrays etc.**Oracle -** tech screen - failed (passed question but they chose another candidate with more backend exp)Create a react app that displays a credit card, with buttons to switch which cc to view, cc data comes from json. Clicking on cc will replace the text with X's- X's correspond to how many words there are, so FIRST LASTNAME will be XXXX XXXX.**Anduril -** tech screen - failed You know in your IDE the directory structure, with folders and files? Given a pic/mock of that, Build it.**Amazon -** https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1iudddy/rainforest_loop_experience_frontend_l5_12_yoe/\\---Closing thought: It's rough out there for Front End devs. There are fewer positions than before, but way more AI/ML positions. However, FE dev compensation is still competitive, u just needa know so much.I'm not incredibly smart or talented, most other engineers are more brilliant than I. The biggest source of my success is the resilience to failure. The amount of rejections and failures is so high but every time, i write down what went wrong, study it, and gain knowledge, so over time every failure builds up to more and more knowledge.",

Despite all the talk of ethics and codes of conduct, corruption runs deep in IT – from C-suite kickbacks on mega-contracts to freebies for devs. ​**Recent examples I came across** * A few months back, an internal audit flagged a conflict: the eCommerce vendor for our marketing team was owned by the eCom director’s husband. We scrambled to switch vendors and migrate services overnight.* In another case, the country IT head got fired after auditors discovered his wife was a key partner in the firm building our new data centre.**How It Plays Out at Every Level*** **Top Brass**: Execs skim a “small percentage” from huge outsourcing deals with ISVs and preferred partners. Kickbacks may hit spouse accounts as “consulting fees,” or come as all-expenses-paid Vegas/Hawaii retreats, plus holiday hampers and gift cards. * **Middle Management (VPs/Directors)**: They steer SOWs and contracts to “preferred vendors” – think brother-in-law’s startup – for their cut. * **Lower Levels (Managers/Devs)**: Free conference passes with airfare, SWAG-stuffed goodie bags, vendor open bars, and hackathon gift cards are routine “*appreciation*.”This stuff feels like par for the course in IT, even as companies preach zero tolerance.

        "content": "Hi guys. I see a lot of questions from juniors and graduates about growing their skills, but I would like to know if anyone has screwed up by spending too much time in a job which didn’t grow your skills that much. I worked for almost 8 years at a company where a lot of the work involved knowledge of the internal systems and maintaining them, not really building new stuff. I ended up touching so many parts - old monolith application, data pipelines for etl workloads, cloud application, and heaps of languages: C++, C#, Perl, node, python, golang and more… yet I don’t feel like I’m good enough in any of them. Between the stress of immigration and family problems, I haven’t been putting enough effort to grow my skills and knowledge in the past. This resulted in me being promoted to a senior and performing like one in that company using my knowledge of their software - but having no particular in-demand skills to land another job. In the past few years I have been realising that I do not want this to be my reality. I started learning more about AWS, working on small personal projects, reading books like DDIA and, yes, grinding leetcode to prepare for the interviews. However, my CV remains unimpressive. It was always my dream to get into a FAANG company. I wanted to work with smart people on cool stuff and feel like I’m actually using my brain instead of changing simple queries on a dashboard. Is this something that is still possible for someone who wasted so much time? Has anyone done this? What could I do to strive towards this goal?",

Whenever a tool automates a skill, the neural circuitry behind that skill weakens over time. We’ve seen this with GPS and navigation ability, calculators and mental arithmetic, spell check and spelling. AI is now scaling that effect across almost every domain.The next generation of workers will grow up in a radically different cognitive environment. A huge part of what we call \"skill\" is repeated cognitive strain, and AI removes that strain.Critical thinking follows the same rule as physical training: stop working the muscle and it atrophies. If you skip the gym for 6 months, your body changes; skip mental effort for 6 months, your mind changes.Problem solving won’t decline because people are getting “dumber,” but because the incentives to think deeply are disappearing. When an answer is always one prompt away, the cognitive machinery for generating answers naturally weakens.It creates a double bind:1. Use AI heavily and you outsource your thinking. 2. Avoid AI and you risk falling behind everyone who does.We’ve never faced a technological shift that directly competes with our core cognitive processes. As experienced workers with decades of intuition retire, we may end up with a workforce whose baseline thinking is increasingly shaped and limited by the tools they rely on.If this trajectory continues, we’re heading toward a society where AI performs most of the critical thinking, and humans gradually lose the habit and even the ability to do it themselves.",

        "content": "I keep seeing people say that \"new fintechs mostly use Go,\" but when I look at real companies, the picture seems very different.Some claim that the modern fintech stack = Golang. But if you check well established fintech companies like Revolut, Wise, N26, Adyen, etc., they all use Java heavily in their backend systems. In fact, most of them built their core services on Java from day one and continue to scale with it.From what I've seen, only a smaller set of newer or niche fintechs actually use Go as their main language for example, Monzo is the standout case here with a Go-based microservices architecture.Go does have strengths: simplicity, concurrency model, and speed for distributed systems. But Java still dominates in fintech due to ecosystem maturity, hiring pool, JVM performance, reliability, and the fact that so many financial institutions already have huge Java ecosystems.So I'm curious:Is Go really the \"future fintech language,\" or is Java still the backbone of the industry and will remain so?If you work in fintech, what language does your company use and why?",

Ended up technically entry-level but with a relatively high TC (250-280k) and good expectations for WLB. I was happy enough with it so I didn't bother trying to match the others.Toughest part for me was just finding time to do all these remote onsite interview days while still employed.Note: I am a US citizen",

I studied a lot and broke into an ML job in big tech but now I really feel like I have no idea how to actually code. I can solve a leetcode problem and explain on a high level what different parts(front end, backend, etc.) of software does but have no idea how to actually build anything. (ask me to build a working scalable MVP of anything I doubt I could do it) I feel like I can’t keep up without using AI but then I have an over dependence on AI.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've been pretty active on both sides of the hiring/interviewing gauntlet for the last few months, and just wanted to share the following thoughts on what I believe are some huge misconceptions around compensation (that candidates, recruiters, companies, and other have).1. Engineers are not commodities. We are non-fungible and there are HUGE differences in the amount of value we can bring, even when you try to classify us into strata like junior, middle, senior, staff, etc. Engineers are more like real estate. There can be huge differences in pricing for a 1500 sqft abode, depending on factors like location, build, amenities, etc.2. Not every company can make the same use of a talented engineer. Just because you are worth $500k at Citadel does not mean Walgreens can realistically get as much value out of you.These 2 realities result in interesting dynamics, where one company may pay their junior engineers more than another company on the same street pays their principal engineers. Both may be acting rationally. It also results in some interesting dynamics where a junior engineer may thumb their nose at opportunities that may be a huge step up in title and responsibilities, and they are acting rationally too.3. The above should make you question the concept of \"market pay\". It is not a meaningful measure. However, if you want to use it, do not use job posting data to figure out \"market pay\". A job posting is an \\*unfilled\\* role. There are 2 good sources of \"market pay\". 1. Current pay of employed engineers in a similar role and setting. and 2. Recent offers that are accepted by engineers for a similar role and setting. The latter is a better/more effective measure for evaluating a new role as a candidate / determining how to budget for a role you are trying to hire for.",

I don't think I performed as well as I could have, due to a different environment (all my prior internships were at large tech companies) and soft skills that I'm still working on. Near the end of the internship, I asked my manager and recruiter for feedback, but the responses I got were pretty vague.When I asked my manager whether my performance met expectations, he said something along the lines of “I think you can do a few more internships,” but in the official evaluation he marked me as “met expectations” (third-highest rating, with “exceeded expectations” being the highest). When I later asked my recruiter about return offers and the evaluation process, she mentioned that my manager already discussed my evaluation with me, and that feedback is shared across teams (I was potentially interested in switching teams if I returned). I know it's my fault for not clarifying, but I didn't want to probe further, as it felt like I was only getting vague answers. It's been a few months since I finished the internship and I reached out to my recruiter again to follow-up on head count and potential to interview for new grad roles, but haven't heard back since I reached out about a month ago. I’m still actively applying elsewhere, but I'm concerned if a mediocre internship performance blacklists me from working at the company again?

That was not the job I wanted but I accepted the offer as they offered me a really good salary so that I could finally leave my mother who struggled with addiction. 3 months after that my country (Russia) started the war in Ukraine. My company offered everyone relocation to the UK with a relocation agreement so that one will have to work for them for 2 years. I thought that this would be my last chance to get out of the country and decided to go for it. So, it’s been 4 years since I’ve been working for them doing mostly SAS and R programming. With the recent change of rules in the UK I will not be able to get the residency here and, therefore, right to work. No one in my company has been promoted in the past 3 years and so I am still Junior Programmer and can’t meet the salary threshold requirement. In other European countries I will also need a visa. Unfortunately, during these years I dragged behind the market massively. I have been mostly producing outputs (datasets, tables, listing and a little bit of graphs) using SAS and R (fortunately mostly R in the past 2 years). We also finally stated to use Git/gitlab 2 years ago. I really want to get out of this job and switch to something more in demand. I will probably not be able to secure any visa in Europe and will have to leave but I am open to moving temporary anywhere other than my home country. I know Python (did most things with it in Uni), I have a maths degree and have a good theoretical knowledge of statistics and familiar with AB testing. What is the most realistic position for me would be and which tools should I focus on to upskill myself? I would really want to do data/product analyst as I dreamed when graduating from uni and program in python. Please help me as I am really scared and I regret my current career path",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I was coming from a tech leadership role for a handful of years before sort of burning out and deciding to jump at a startup. Same industry that I know, cool new hook and angle, a \"Head of Product\" title and good investors. This company demanded 10-12 hours daily and would rush projects out and I'm just completely allergic to this way of \"working\". Because they're in pacific time and I'm in central, I was working past dinner time and not eating or spending time with my family. So, after 4 months of being here, something I've never done, I decided to look for something better already.I've always been \"good\" at getting new offers if I wanted them, via by networking or other means. I was sort of slapped to reality and humbled when I saw how awful this market actually is. The pain at work, coupled with two early phone screen rejections made me realize I had to change how I was doing this. The tech job market from 2017-2022 was long gone.Here are the tips that ultimately worked for me:1. Reached out to my network and let them know my situation. I received 4 referrals and a handful of informational interviews with folks. I did this via group chats, messaging connections on LinkedIn, college alumni groups I'm a part of.2. I used LinkedIn Premium. Why use this overpriced service? As soon as I have it and I mark myself as actively looking (oh and hide the damn Premium icon from your profile or your employer will find it odd that you have it) - I start getting tons of recruiters hitting me up. 2 of these led to an initial screen.3. Adjusted my title appropriately. I de-leveled my title for certain Senior Product Manager roles. One question I kept getting was why go from leadership/management to a role like this. The real reason was because my current environment is toxic, my title is inflated there, and the money isn't great, and these \"lower title\" roles were paying on par or sometimes higher for significantly less responsibility. A buddy of mine who was a VP had to practice a similar thing in de-leveling his title when he was laid off. You can play around with your title a bit, but I DO NOT recommend leveling up your title when that isn't factual. It'll come out.4. Apply daily to the latest openings, I'll show you how to best do this below.5. Had a single thread with ChatGPT where it knew my resume, my work history, my specific projects, my answers to previous interview and job application questions. This made answering bespoke custom questions on ATSs very quick.6. A benefit/luxury/advantage - I do have a variety of experience as a software engineer, product manager, tech leadership etc. I'm aware that this greatly expedited this whole process and if I was more junior I likely would have struggled significantly more.**Best Places to Apply.** I would open up my computer and had a browser with the following tabs open:1. LinkedIn job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)2. Indeed job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)3. [Hiring.Cafe](http://hiring.cafe/) search (an AI aggregator that links you directly to company careers postings)4. [Wellfound.com](http://wellfound.com/) search (specifically for start-up hiring)5. Google search with the following:site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com (\"Group Product Manager\" OR \"Principal Product Manager\" OR \"Senior Product Manager\" OR \"Director of Product\" OR \"VP of Product\" OR \"Head of Product\") AND \"remote\"This will list ALL job postings that match the description of those job titles I was looking for (and remote!) directly against the ATS without having to rely on crappy job aggregators. Now open up a tab and do the same thing but replace site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com with the following ATSs I could find: \\- site:jobs.lever.co \\- site:boards.greenhouse.io \\- site:ashbyhq.comThen on the google results, go to Tools and select last 24 hours.This means I would have 10'ish tabs open each day and do the search at 9am and later around 2-3pm and then apply right away. This search almost always takes you to a new posting, rather than those annoying ghost openings or jobs that get reposted for months. This also takes you directly to the employer's site.**High-level stats:** \\- Total Applications - 350+ \\- Referrals made on my behalf - 4 (only one led to a phone screen lol) \\- Duration - \\~2 months \\- Companies scheduling phone screen - 9 (2 ghosted, 2 wanted very niche experience) \\- Companies moving to hiring manager round - 5 \\- Companies moving to second/third+ round - 5 \\- Offer - 1, I cancelled the remaining 4 live opportunities upon accepting offerThe offer came from the place I least expected (Wellfound). An application for a hybrid role in NYC (I'm not in NYC, or close to it) led to the CEO directly reaching out to me. I took his call not thinking much of the opportunity since the description didn't have much to go off of. We both had a ton of fun talking and getting a feel for each other. The rest of the interviewing process with that team felt like talking to friends, it was an easy offer to accept.I could go way more in detail about how I prep for interviews, not sure how helpful that would be for people. I just wanted to share my process of applying, hoping it's of any use to anyone!",

Like, the situation is *really* bad.For my graduation project, I *tried* making a mobile application for the university but I failed miserably. I still got a good grade, because I managed to turn it around by making it a \"case study\" instead of an outright project. No idea how that worked, but it did.In terms of portfolio, I don't actually have anything. I think I only have like 2 or 3 **very** scuffed projects back when I was a 2nd year but they're clearly very unoptimized and generally bad. I didn't upload my Graduation project either because it doesn't work as intended, so I'm a bit embarrassed regarding it.I'm graduating in about 2 months. I have no idea if I'm ready for the job market. I'm somewhat confident in my own skills, but I just don't have anything under my belt. My CGPA is still \"decent\" at 3.33 (B+) though.Yada yada, imposter syndrome, or whatever, but I'm really feeling hopeless right now.Basically, I think what I want to ask is, what can I do in such a short amount of time to add to my portfolio and still have it be good enough?",

        "content": "So I worked three excessively shitty jobs in a rowFirst was (Forest in Brazil). I found my manager nearly impossible to communicate with, we just did things so differently. My mentor was excessively aggressive, I legit thought he had some sort of personality disorder. I remember in my first week, I asked maybe 3 questions, common ones like where to find certain resources. Each time my mentor would simply send me a link, and on the third one, he made a remark about how I’m asking too many questions. So, I took the hint and didn’t ask questions unless it was absolutely necessary. Then they started complaining I wasn’t asking _enough_ questions. I was so lost. Then I was assigned a job with another new hire and she faced the same problem, told she asks too much questions then when she stopped. They said that she “just went off and did her own thing”. I kinda felt like I was missing something — isn’t the obvious reaction to “you’re asking too many questions” to… ask fewer questions? Obviously it was more than just this, but it’s an example of how communication was very hostile. I just kept a low profile as much as possible. I ended up quitting, but I definitely think something lingered hereNext job was a weirdly incompetent AI company. Management expected ~30 tickets to be completed per week, and those tickets were usually big ones. For context, they expected something similar to ChatGPT to be built in 2 weeks by 2 engineers with 0 bugs. I was let go from here. I asked why, and they seemed to say I should be available 24/7 and I wasn’t (I explicitly said I can’t be contacted 6-8pm because I help at a Muay Thai gym and you can’t have a computer/phone on you while holding pads obviously)Next job started great. I was cautiously optimistic. Around 6 months in, I started to relax and take a deep breath. Then… they hired a new manager. I could not understand for the life of me what this manager was talking about. I thought I was losing my mind a little, honestly. She would constantly say these bromides like “act more like a senior engineer”. If I asked where I was falling short of being a “senior engineer” or what goals I should have, she said it’s not her job to tell me that, nor is it her job to give me work to do. I’d have to fight for hours to figure out what I should be working on. She was just an odd person. I remember she had an exercise where she _insisted_ that everyone eats peanut butter sandwiches. I don’t and never have. I thought this was some sort of weird test, because she was so insistent that everyone does this. I could tell I was being intentionally sabotaged by her, as she would block PRs with frankly obviously stupid and unproductive commentsNow I’m starting a new job and I feel extremely intense anxiety about… everything. Although I’m a frontend engineer, this job has asked me to get up to date on ruby. I’ve never written ruby before. It’s not that I can’t learn it, but it causes me such deep anxiety to feel like I’m asking “stupid” questions. I asked one stupid question and I lost a whole night of sleep over the anxiety of thinking that I’m gonna get fired and start this cycle againIs there anything I can do? I’ve hired a therapist and everything but she mostly says “you should take it easy and be in the present” but that’s easier said than done. I have some fear that the “new manager” thing happening again. Yeah, the job is good _now_, but what if I get a new manager who just decides to fire me?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This post may be long, but I want to be completely honest so I can get real guidance.I completed my BCA in 2021 and started my career at Cognizant as a Programmer Trainee. I worked there for about 1.1 years, but I left because the project felt dull and I thought I could do better. Looking back now, resigning without a backup was probably one of the biggest mistakes I made.After that, I joined Amazon as an SPS Associate. The work was mostly repetitive support tasks - more like a BPO setup. There was no real growth, and I thought I should get back into a proper IT role while I was still young. So I left Amazon too.To rebuild myself, I joined a 9-month Data Analyst bootcamp. I genuinely put effort into it - completed all modules, built projects, created a portfolio website, made proper LinkedIn project presentation, customized my resume as per each JD, and applied mainly through official career sites. My ATS score was almost always above 95%.Despite all that, I wasn’t able to secure even a single interview. Not one. I applied to more than 2000 jobs. Each rejection hit me harder, and eventually I completely burned out. I stopped studying, started escaping into video games and alcohol, and mentally I was in a very dark place. Every day felt heavier than the last.It’s been around 5-6 months since I stopped my job search. Now I’m sitting with:an almost 1.8-year career gap, no savings, no sense of direction and a lot of self-doubt.My parents are supportive and even willing to invest in further studies if needed. But at this point, I don’t have the courage to spend more money on courses that may or may not lead to anything. The job market feels extremely dry, and I’m scared of making another wrong move.The only safe option I can think of is going back to the BPO world - but then I wonder why I even left a good WFH Amazon job if I have to end up in the same place again. It makes me feel like I’ve messed everything up.Right now, I’m not even fixated on IT. I just want a career with real growth, not something where even after 10-15 years the salary barely crosses 50k. I’m willing to put in 3-5 months of focused effort to learn something valuable but I don’t want to end up in another dead-end situation.If anyone has been in a similar situation, or has genuine advice on what direction I should take next, I would be truly grateful. I’m not looking for motivation, I just need clarity and a practical path forward.",

I won't share my personal details on this post, but here are the highlights: \\- Have a bachelor's and a Master's in Computer Science (consciously opted to not do a PhD)\\- Started out as a Software Engineer in Testing at a Big Tech firm\\- Made a lateral move to a \"traditional\" Software Engineer role\\- Made a lateral move to ML Research, all in premier research labs you've definitely heard about. A few promotions along the way\\- Founded a startup in the AI space, did fundraising, hiring, sales calls, etc.\\- Been an IC, TL, manager, founder, etc.What I think I can help with:\\- General mentorship: I currently (and have in the past) mentor early-career folks, topics range from \"how do I talk to my manager about this issue\" to \"How do I know what to work on?\"\\- Technical mentorship: General technical brainstorming/AI model review/code review, etc., in the past I did this with folks who didn't have a senior technical leader to learn from (e.g. they were the founding engineer in a small startup).\\- Mock interviews: Prepping for interviews at a tech company? I've done quite a few of those for engineering roles (and a few for product), I can do mock interviews and give you feedback.\\- Resume review\\- You just want to vent and need someone to listen :) What I can't help with:\\- Referrals for job openings: I get these requests semi-regularly on LinkedIn, and unfortunately, I'm unable to refer anyone I don't know personally or have worked with (literally one of the first questions in any referral is: \"how do you know this person?\").If there's interest, I was planning on setting up a Google Form or something to coordinate -- please let me know if this is something that people here would want!",

I'm not laboring in the UAE or some other contemporary slavery situation. but I'm just so angry at how much this project has impacted my personal life.. had to forsake many personal goals for the end of the year, my wife has basically been running the house alone. the stress caused me to lose sleep, which caused me to get sick, which caused me to stop exercising for the last few weeks. I'm trying to be grateful but I'm so bitter right now.I want to leave this company but i have a feeling everywhere is like this now - trying to squeeze every drop out of its employees (leadership: \"AI will improve efficiency!\")if there's any silver lining (trying to talk myself up into positivity). the last time I posted in this sub was [2+ years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18ksydi/struggling_with_transition_to_senior/), and I don't struggle with those issues now.is anyone actually happy at their jobs right now?does anyone have a paid interview prep service that's actually decent? i feel like i have to pay for something to force me to do it at this pointhas anyone felt this way and left the industry for something else they like?

Recently we started working with a new team who was supposed to be providing this whole suite if new tools for us to take and \"wrap\". Except their product is absolute shit. They gave us a pip package that makes the most insane assumptions. It assumes that the package is being a run on a machine with a mount to the company wide NFS. This NFS is the most dogshit piece of bullshit to ever exist. It works. It works great. And what that means is that you have thousands of devs just throwing files and scripts in places, and assuming that other scripts exist. And the dependencies chain down, so every thing is tied to everything else. And their pip package needs to be run there. Even worse, one of their scripts that they call from inside their package starts with \" #!/usr/bin/python3.7\" (we are using python 3.13) and assumes that there are certain packages installed in that environment. Now we have been trying to unplug from all this bullshit, but the amount of crappy design and dev culture is just driving me insane. We tried to dockerize and run our stuff cleanly in a cluster, but the amount of leaky dependencies that we are finding is just soul crushing.Thankfully at least my managers are very understanding and basically want to go to war with these nonces for providing such ass backwards tooling.

        "content": "Hi all, I was recently accepted to UPenn's online part-time MSE-DS program. I graduated from college this past May from a top 5 CS school with a degree in data science. To be honest, I originally applied to this program because I was having a tremendous amount of trouble landing a job in the data science industry (makes sense, since data scientist isn't an entry level role). However, I lucked out and eventually received an offer for a junior data scientist position after 1000+ applications.I like my current job, but the location isn't ideal. I'm a lot farther away from my family, and I'm only seeing them once or twice a year, and that has been very hard for me to deal with on top of adjusting to a much colder northeastern city. I was hoping a master's will help me job hop back to california in a year or two, and that's also a reason why I have decided to not take a break from school. With the deadline to deposit coming, I am having a really hard time deciding whether this program is for me. I have listed some pros and cons below:Pros:1. employer reimbursement - I will only have to pay around 20k for the entire program2. UPenn name and prestige3. asynchronous lectures, which is actually a plus for me because I tend to zone out during synchronous lecturesCons:1. After talking to some people who attended my undergrad school and this program, it seems like there's a lot of overlap in terms of course content. So, i'd be learning a lot of the same things all over again2. I want to become a data scientist, so maybe a CS program would improve my coding skills more. I've heard GT omscs is good, but I also heard it's hard, and I don't know if I'll be able to handle work with omscs.3. Penn name doesn't matter as much since I have already broken into the DS industryAny advice would be greatly appreciated!!",
