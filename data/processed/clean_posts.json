I used to overbuild: Kafka, Spark, 12 moving parts, and then spend my life debugging glue. Now I follow a boring checklist to decide what to use and what to skip.If you’re building a pipeline and you’re not sure if you need all the distributed toys, here’s the decision framework I wish I had earlier.1. Start with the SLA, not the techAsk:* How fresh does the data need to be (minutes, hours, daily)?* What’s the cost of being late/wrong?* Who is the consumer (dashboards, ML training, finance reporting)?If it’s daily reporting, you probably don’t need streaming anything.2. Prefer one “source of truth” storage layerPick one place where curated data lives and is readable by everything:* warehouse/lakehouse/object storage, whatever you have Then make everything downstream read from that, not from each other.3. Batch first, streaming only when it pays rentStreaming has a permanent complexity tax:* ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills. If your business doesn’t care about real-time, don’t buy that tax.4. Idempotency is the difference between reliable and hauntedEvery job should be safe to rerun.* partitioned outputs* overwrite-by-partition or merge strategy* deterministic keys If you can’t rerun without fear, you don’t have a pipeline, you have a ritual.5. Backfills are the real workloadDesign the pipeline so backfilling a week/month is normal:* parameterized date ranges* clear versioning of transforms* separate “raw” vs “modeled” layers6. Observability: do the minimum that prevents silent failureAt least:* row counts or volume checks* freshness checks* schema drift alerts* job duration tracking You don’t need perfect observability, you need “it broke and I noticed.”7. Don’t treat orchestration as optionalEven for small pipelines, a scheduler/orchestrator avoids “cron spaghetti.” Airflow/Dagster/Prefect/etc. is fine, but the point is:* retries* dependencies* visibility* parameterized runs8. Optimize lastMost pipelines are slow because of bad joins, bad file layout, or moving too much data, not because you didn’t use Spark. Fix the basics first:* partitioning* columnar formats* pushing filters down* avoiding accidental cartesian joinsMy rule of thumbIf you can meet your SLA with:* a scheduler* Python/SQL transforms* object storage/warehouse and a couple checksthen adding a distributed stack is usually just extra failure modes.Curious what other people use as their “don’t overbuild” guardrails. What’s your personal line where you say “ok, now we actually need streaming/Spark/Kafka”?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering, Feeling a bit demoralized today and wondering if anyone else has come to a similar realization and how they dealt with it. Approximately 6 months ago I left a Sr. DE job on a team of 5 to join a startup as their sole data engineer. The last job I was at for 4.5 years and helped them create reliable pipelines for \\~15 sources and build out a full QC process that all DEs followed, created code standards + CI/CD that linted our code and also handled most of the infrastructure for our pipelines. During this time I was promoted multiple times and always had positive feedback. Cut to my current job where I have been told that I am not providing enough detail in my updates and that I am not specific enough about what went wrong when fixing bugs or encountering technical challenges. And - the real crux of the issue - I failed to deliver on a project after 6 months and they have of course wanted to discuss why the project failed. For context the project was to create a real time analytics pipeline that would update client reporting tables. I spent a lot of time on the infrastructure to capture the changes and started running into major challenges when trying to reliably consume the data and backfill data.We talked through all of the challenges that I encountered and they said that the main theme of the project they picked up on was that I wasn't really \"engineering\" in that they felt I was just picking an approach and then discovering the challenges later. Circling back to why I feel like maybe I'm just a mid-level engineer, in every other role I've been in I've always had someone more senior than me that understood the role. I'm wondering if I'm not actually senior material and can't actually do this role solo. Anyways, thanks for reading my ramble and let me know if you've found yourself in a similar position.",

We are experimenting with a builder instead of rolling everything from scratch, partly to avoid becoming a full-time CRUD developer.UI Bakery is one of the tools we are trying at the moment because it can sit on-prem, talk to our DB and some OpenAPI-described services, and still give non-technical users a UI with roles/permissions. Too early to call it perfect, but it feels less scary than handing out SQL editors.Curious what the rest of you are doing:* Do you let business users touch warehouse data at all, or is everything ticket-driven?* If you built a portal / upload tool / internal UI, did you go custom code or something like Retool / Appsmith / UI Bakery / similar?* Any “we thought this would be fine, then someone updated 50k rows by mistake” stories you are willing to share?Trying to find a balance between safety, governance and not spending my whole week building yet another admin panel.",

I will be working with 4 data engineers (2 senior) and a team lead - Medium responsibility role as there are other data engineers in the team My main back ground is close to offer 2 and 3, but I have no experience in databricks (The company ofc knows about this).

        "content": "Just sharing my story here, not a successful one. I was trying to switch from legacy backend dev at a government organization to a DE role. Did relevant projects, learned a lot, but no luck. I was comfortable working with python, docker, a few frameworks like Airflow, Spark, Dagster, DBT etc. and of course git and Java + a few tools that nobody uses in DE from the job that I was doing.Did about 100 applications, spending a fair bit of time tweaking applications to match every job that I applied to. Did not apply for stuff that I wasn't interested in. Got pretty much nothing.I did however also applied to a few software dev roles too. Ended up landing one and got incredibly lowballed but I was so tired of my previous job, I had to take it like an idiot.Well, started the new job and the work was pretty fun. But colour me surprised, the thing that pushed me out from the previous job wasn't the culture or the work just being boring, it was the cycle. I'm only 26 and honestly, I can't imagine working 9-5 until I turn 50 or 60. I'm drafting up some ideas, learning and researching what's required to create products on my own. Once I'm confident enough in an idea and the progress, I'll probably quit. Or get fired because I'm distracted. Staying for a few for months because of financial constraints.Anybody else have similar experiences? I find it so weird that I was so interested in DE just a year ago, still confident that I can perform well in it, but completely lost interest to put in the effort because in the end I know I'll just get paid peanuts for the actual amount of work I'll do (pay in my country is garbage). The only thing that might change this would be life changing compensation, but obviously that requires much more prep that I don't know if I have the time for (or the ability for that matter). Even that wouldn't be a sustainable way out of this dumb rotten week cycle we humans invented for ourselves. Work like a mchine for 5 days and be tired for the rest of the day after work? Recover from that shit for 2 days and then get back to it again? Fuck. That.Thanks for listening to my rant, please share your own thoughts, because obviously there's lots of people who enjoy what they do and have much more \"work endurance\" than me. Also curious to see if there's more people who feel the same way as me too.",

They complain about distribution keys and the trouble with parsing of json logs. They are struggling with Redshift's SUPER data type. They claim it’s \"weak for aggregations\" and requires awkward casting hacks. They want snowflake because it works no frills (especially VARIANT and dot notation) and they can query semi structured data.The big argument is that savings on Redshift RIs will be eaten up by the salary cost of engineers having to constantly tune WLM queues and fix skew.What needs to be picked here?

        "content": "First of all: Hi everyone and thanks for taking the time to read my post.I completely changed careers and now I’m trying to understand where to “aim” long term.My background: I’m a humanities major who took a hard pivot. After a couple of years of self-teaching (programming, SQL, data fundamentals) and some freelancing, I landed a role about a year ago in a large company (hundreds of millions in revenue).When I joined, there was zero data culture. No team, no processes, just a lot of manual work and fragmented info. My official title is \"Data Manager\", but since I’m building the function from scratch, I’ve been doing a bit of everything:* Automation & ETL: Writing Python scripts and using Power Automate to kill manual tasks.* Infrastructure: Designing and building business-oriented databases from the ground up.* BI/Visualization: Creating the first actual dashboards.* Optimization: Cleaning up the \"Excel Wild West\" and setting common data policies.My question: Imposter syndrome aside, I’m struggling to map this experience to the actual market. I love the \"ideation\" and architecture part—designing the pipelines, thinking through the data flows, and making things work automatically. But I sometimes worry I’m doing a lot of useful things, but not building a clean and recognizable profile.\\- What term would you use to describe this type of role? I'm not sure if I'm closer to data engineering or analytics...\\- Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?\\- What would you discover next if you were in my shoes? I want to switch from band-aid solutions to more reliable, scalable procedures. At this point, what would you learn first: DBT, cloud architecture, orchestration tools like Airflow, or something else?My current stack is Python, SQL, Power BI, Power Automate, and some legacy VBA.I genuinely love this job—it's a world away from my previous life in humanities—but I want to make sure I’m steering the ship in the right direction.

        "content": "I am currently involved in a database migration discussion at my company. The proposal is to migrate our dbt models from PostgreSQL to BigQuery in order to take advantage of BigQuery’s OLAP capabilities for analytical workloads. However, since I am quite fond of PostgreSQL, and value having a stable, open-source database as our data warehouse, I am wondering whether there are extensions or architectural approaches that could extend PostgreSQL’s behavior from a primarily OLTP system to one better suited for OLAP workloads.So far, I have the impression that this might be achievable using DuckDB. One option would be to add the DuckDB extension to PostgreSQL; another would be to use DuckDB as an analytical engine interfacing with PostgreSQL, keeping PostgreSQL as the primary database while layering DuckDB on top for OLAP queries. However, I am unsure whether this solution is mature and stable enough for production use, and whether such an approach is truly recommended or widely adopted in practice.",

        "content": "Just wanted to share my experience with Snowflake Openflow. The client i work for relies heavily on CDC replication for their data ingestion to snowflake. We mainly bring in data from SQL server and oracle database to our snowflake data lake.Our client is using many different ETL tools mainly Firvetran's HVR, IICS and AWS DMS and in some cases snowpipe when they want to ingest data from s3 to snowflake. When snowflake announced openflow which supports CDC replication we were excited. Out of the box it was supporting SQL Server CDC replication and Oracle connector was soon to be released. We were very excited as our client wanted to move away from IICS and HVR due to licensing costs. We immediately started working on a POC when the openflow was available in private preview.POC Area: - CDC based replication from SQL Server to snowflake. Its fairly very easy to setup the connectors and start using it. We were able to configure the connectors and start ingesting the data within couple of hours and mind you none of us had used apache nifi before. Pros: - 1. easy to setup and use.2. Replication latency is pretty low. Plus it can be configured as well to fit your use case. Cons: - 1. Cannot configure target snowflake schema : - biggest downside we have found out yet. We were using the default workflow for SQL server CDC and there is no option to ingest the data into desired snowflake schema. By default Openflow is creating a schema in snowflake database with the source SQL Server schema name. We were pulling the data from SQL server schema \"DBO\" and Openflow was creating the same schema inside our snowflake database.We updated almost all the processors inside the workflow to use the custom schema name, for most part it worked. we were able to create tables and journal tables etc inside our custom schema in snowflake. But there is one processor which merges journal tables to permanent table which was not supporting to use custom schema name. Somehow it was still using \".DBO\". DB name is configurable in this processor but not the schema name. We connected with the snowflake internal team regarding the same and the guy said they working on it after receiving complaints from lots of other clients. Later he suggested us to not configure/updated the workflow which comes with database connectors. If we do update it, it's gonna be considered as a custom workflow and it will be locked out of future updates.So, customizing the pipeline is out of the picture.2. Environment variables and JVM variables: - there is no one stop UI to manage all these variables inside the workflow. You need to navigate to each processor to manage these variables. 3. Error logs: - not a fan of how openflow manages error logs, its very janky to navigate and use. these were the stuff we found out in the last couple of weeks. We have stopped our POC midway due to con 1. And we and the client are totally dissappointed with how openflow is working as of now.",

        "content": "I’ve written about my job on this sub before but I really am at a loss at times and come here to vent frequently. I am fine with hearing it’s a me problem, I really am. But I don’t know how to work faster when everything feels so chaotic upstream of me. I am not eating well, working 8+ hours and finding myself really sleepy (taking 2 naps a day these days) that are signs of burnout I’ve been experiencing especially over the last few months. I’ve been given feedback about not being as fast as the team anticipates on projects. Currently, I’ve been focusing on migrating old projects to a new architecture we plan to use by early next year. I really started being 100% dedicated to this work as of October/November of this year, which gives me 2-3 months to migrate my old projects to this new architecture. In theory it sounds easy to my higher up: all I have to do is copy + paste and tweak my old code to new architecture and that’s it. Except it’s not that easy:1. In current architecture, I built several views that depend on each other. When deploying on this architecture, nobody made me aware (bc nobody seems to know) that changing things in upstream views causes deployment failures until I started working on this and my only workaround is to delete downstream views -> push -> confirm deployment successful -> make changes to upstream views-> push -> confirm deployment -> bring back deleted views -> push -> confirm deployment. This has caused a lot of delays and plenty failures that made me have to go to SWE team to fix that sometimes took the whole day to resolve 2. Naming conventions and the way the data is stored have changed in new architecture with no documentation about this, leaving me to figure out using “eyeball” technique to see where new data is stored and changing my code accordingly 3. Data in old architecture is not always coming through new architecture and I have to just figure this out by checking discrepancies and opening tickets for missing data that doesn’t get resolved no matter how much I ping people to look into it or fix it (I also don’t blame them because I feel other people are inundated too)4. Validation is a nightmare, I’ll have 30+ discrepancies and after checking code and data is there, I have to go through these records one by one to see why it’s not there by comparing tables. It turns out that some records are not meant to be in the new architecture, which I was not told until later when I did validation and had to compare what info from our schema tables was missing between the two. I have to look for specific clues between the old and new dataset for indication whether something is valid or not so I can document there is a reason for discrepancy 5. Documenting all of this and more is a task of its own 6. Ongoing enhancements are expected to be added to some projects I have one project that is comprised of 10 SQL views. The expectation was this would take 2 weeks but it took me a month: 1. creating the views and aligning them to new data model 2. dealing with random/unanticipated failures because of how these views are connected that I can only ask the SWE team to because they can tell me what things in my code that used to be compatible with this new architecture aren’t anymore 3. Validating data and having discrepancies no matter how many times I’ve fixed any errors because some things are “discrepancy by nature” of this new model which I either document and write an explanation of why it’s valid or a something I have to open a ticket for 4. The new way we’re modelling data sometimes doesn’t work for existing projects and I have to add more lines of code to work around that This is not new of the culture of my team. They give me several projects at a time thinking it will take 2 weeks. It takes longer for me and I have been told I have a consistent issue with slowness that makes me feel it’s a me issue. I explain to management my process, I started documenting all issues way more, but nobody gives me constructive advice on what I can do differently to work “faster” and it makes me feel like a failure. One of the advices I was given was “ask for help” but whenever I do, nobody is able to help. When there were holidays, I asked overseas employees to help me investigate a discrepancy an came back to see nobody was able to do it no matter how many people I pinged and explained the issue in detail. As a side note, some of the code I’m migrating now was a nightmare to develop in the first place - it was projects I inherited with no documentation, no idea what the project outcome should look like or what “acceptance criteria” deems the project complete or not. The code was 1000 lines and took several minutes to run with poor performance issues. Like a million full joins, sub queries within subqueries. I was once asked to add something to a where clause in this query and unknowingly broke something that I didn’t realize was a break bc I have no idea what the end result is supposed to look like. I was told to reverse it immediately and asked the SWE team who told me we can’t simply reverse our daily pipeline. The colleague who asked me to made the change became furious and this is where negative feedback about me started. I later worked hard to re-develop this whole project, breaking down the code into separate parts in order to join these separate views together at the end to make cleaner, optimized code. The team did like that work, but even then, issues would arise - upstream pipeline would fail, I have to interrupt my 10 projects to manually get a dataset, upload it through our transformation tool, export and manually put back into S3 that takes 30+ minutes. Later, it turns out that simple joins to create the end table aren’t enough per requirements because of unanticipated quirks with the data that requires a full join and 2 additional CTEs to get right. Basically, I’m just really tired. The business requirements are really ambiguous and a work in progress, our data is in different constantly changing formats and we have failures or changes of me upstream of I have to keep track of while working through other projects and stop everything to fix it. Of note, most of my team members are not strong technically but do have domain knowledge, yet I feel domain knowledge is not enough because the way we do things technically feels very poor as well. Sorry to make everybody read all this, I don’t have any other friends who work in data who I can vent to about this.",

That latency includes from the moment the Kafka message was published to the moment when my business logic could consume the sliding window result made by Rising Wave. My application requires the results before proceeding.I tested Apache Flink a little and it seems like in order to get it to return the latest sliding window results in real time I need to build on top of standard Flink and I fear that if I implement that, it might just end up being even slower than Rising Wave.So I would like to ask you if you know what other tools I could try.

We handle healthcare data so first of all, we want to keep everything on prem, so it limits some of our options right off the bat.Currently, we are using a Makefile to call a massive list of SQL files and run them with psql. Dependencies are maintained by hand.I've just started seeing what it might take to move to DBT to handle the build, and while it looks very promising, the initial tests are still creating some hassles. We have a LOT large datasets. So DBT has been struggling to run some of the seeds because it seems to get memory intensive and it looks like maybe psql was the better option for atleast those portions. I am also still struggling a bit with the naming conventions for selectors vs schema/table names vs folder/file names. We have a number of schemas that handle data identically across different applications, so table names that match seem to be an issue, even if they're in different schemas. I am also having a hard time with the premise that seeds are 1 to 1 for the csv to table. We have for example a LOT of historical data that has changed systems over time, but we don't want to lose that historic data, so we've used psql copy in the past to solve this issue very easily. This looks against the dbt rules.So this has me wanting to ask, are there better tools out there that I should be looking at? My goal is to consolidate services so that managing our containers doesn't become a full time gig in and of itself. Part of the goal of modernization is to attach a semantic layer, which psql alone doesn't facilitate. Unit testing across the data in an easier to run and monitor environment, field level lineage, and even eventually pointing things like langchain are some of our goals. The fact is, our process is extremely old and dated, and modernizing will simply give us better options. What is your advice? I fully recognize I may not know DBT enough yet and all my problems are very solveable. I'm trying to avoid work arounds as much as possible because I'd hate to spend all of my time fitting a square peg into a round hole.",

        "author": "ukmurmuk",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Some principles I have been thinking about productive modern data engineering culture, sharing this here to see different perspectives about my outlook.First, I want to begin by making an assertion that in this AI age, code production is a very cheap commodity. The expensive part is in reviewing & testing the code. But, as long as the pipelines are batch, the processing is not in a regulated environment, and the output is not directly affecting the core business, cost of mistakes are REALLY low. In most cases you can simply rerun the pipeline and replace the bad data, and if you design the pipeline well, processing cost should be very low.So, here are my principles:•⁠Unit tests and component-specific tests are worthless. It slows down development, and it doesn’t really check the true output (product of complex interactions of functions and input data). It adds friction when expanding/optimizing the pipeline. It’s better to do WAP (Write-Audit-Publish) patterns to catch issues in production and block the pipeline if the output is not within expectations rather than trying to catch them locally with tests. (edit: write your e2e tests, DQ checks, and schema contracts. Unit test coverage shouldn’t give you any excuse to not have the other three, and if having the other three nullifies the value of unit tests, then the unit tests are worthless) •⁠Dependencies has to be explicit. If table A is dependent on table B, this dependency has to be explicitly defined in orchestration layer to ensure that issue in table A blocks the pipeline and doesn’t propagate to table B. It might be alluring to separate the DAGs to avoid alerts or other human conveniences, but it’s not a reliable design. •⁠With defensive pipelines (comprehensive data quality check suites, defensive DAGs, etc), teams can churn out codes faster and ship features faster rather than wasting time adjusting unit tests/waiting for human reviews. Really, nowadays you can build something in 1 hour and wait 2-3 days for review. •⁠the biggest bottleneck in data engineering is not the labor of producing code, but the frictions of design/convention disagreements, arguments in code reviews, bad data modeling, and inefficient use of tables/pipelines. This phenomenon is inevitable when you have a big team, hence I argue in most cases, it’s more sensible to have a very lean data engineering team. I would even go further to the point that it makes more sense to have a single REALLY GOOD data engineer (that can communicate well with business, solid data modeling skills, deep technical expertise to design efficient storage/compute, etc) rather than hiring 5 “okay” data engineers. Even if this really good one costs 5x than the average one, it’s more worth the money: allowing faster shipping volume and better ROI.So, what do you think? Are these principles BS?",

Sometimes dabbling a bit in azure but no data pipeline work. I have been in this role for 1,5y and before this for 3 years I worked part time in more technical roles which included c#, git, azure devops, ssis, ssrs, qlik sense.I have been offered a position to move to our central analytics & bi team, they basically serve all the smaller units in our org (like the one I am in) and help with BI stuff. Not sure how many units there are but this is a large company with very regulated industries (like nuclear power). This role would introduce fabric to my daily tools and sql and python based on the conversation I had with the manager. The role listing also mentions that knowledge of etl/elt and ci/cd processes is required. But it also mentions on-prem gateways and fabric tenant admin. In addition to this, I have been offered a position at a very good consulting company. It’s a data engineer position but it starts with a 4 week bootcamp to get me going in the DE skills (they mention tools like dbt, databricks, snowflake, fabric, python, sql etc) and then I start with customer projects. The caveat is that I get a \\~10% net pay cut. But they offer a ton of possibilities for growth, internal academies and they pay for certifications etc. I currently have none. I have to do my decision next week and I’m not sure what to choose. I know DE can open architect roles in the future but I have no idea what in-house fabric can do for me if I want to progress. From what I have read this subreddit I have gathered that Fabric isn’t that liked but I’m hoping if someone can give neutral opinions. Right now the situation is that I’m really bored with my job. I dislike the dashboard building, it’s boring. And talking with business why my numbers dont match their excel is well… also boring. I like the modelling part and the back end side but I also enjoy optimizing and trying different solutions and understanding how much our reporting costs us (computationally).

        "author": "AuditMind",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Teams meetings with transcription enabled. One hour of discussion quickly turns into 10k+ words of unstructured text.Extracting decisions, action items, and open questions manually doesn’t scale. The common approach is to push the full transcript into a large cloud model and hope for a usable summary.That approach breaks down for a few reasons.Large transcripts often exceed context windows. Even when they fit, you’re dependent on external infrastructure, which can be problematic for sensitive meetings. Most importantly, you lose determinism: the same input can produce different outputs.I ended up treating the transcript like any other batch-processing problem.Instead of processing the full text in one go, the transcript is handled incrementally:- split into manageable chunks- each chunk summarized independently using a stable structure- clean intermediate results written out- a final aggregation pass over those intermediates to produce the high-level summaryIn practical terms:- the model never sees the full transcript at once- context is controlled explicitly by the pipeline, not by a prompt window- intermediate structure is preserved instead of flattened- the final output is based on accumulated, cleaned data rather than raw textThis reframing changes the requirements completely.One interesting side effect of this approach was realizing that model size stopped being a deciding factor altogether. Once the task is constrained and the workflow is explicit, even relatively small models perform reliably enough for this kind of summarization.Once handled this way, transcript size stops being a concern. A small local model is sufficient, because it’s just one interchangeable component in a controlled pipeline. The value comes from explicit inputs, deterministic steps, and reproducible outputs, not from model size.This runs entirely locally on a modest machine, no GPU, no cloud services.I’m curious how others here approach large meeting transcripts or similar unstructured text when the goal is a clean, deterministic result rather than maximal model capability.",

Never had to deal with more than 1 GB of data to process. Also dealing a lot with data modelling.That means I was lacking a lot of Spark knowledge. Moving to my current job I am getting hands on experience a bit with Spark, airflow and CDK but I don't think is enough. Especially after I went through Netflix interviw , passed the coding but failed the HM round cause they said that based on my projects it did not seem to have a deep knowledge of Spark and complex data modelling. I know in my current job I won't deal a lot with building a complex spark processing job so i am trying to find a way to get ahead and improve myself on the big data technologies.Have you ever had similar experience?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks - looking for some architecture feedback from people doing this in production.We sit between structured data sources and AI agents, and we’re trying to be very deliberate about how agents touch internal data. Our data mainly lives in product DBs (Postgres), BigQuery, and our CRM (SFDC). We want agents for lightweight automation and reporting. Current approach: Instead of giving agents any kind of direct warehouse access, we’re planning to run them against an isolated sandboxed environment with pre-joined, pre-sanitized views pulled from our DW and other sources. Agents never see the warehouse directly.On top of those sandboxed views (not direct DW tables), we’d build and expose custom MCP tools. Each of these MCP tools will have a broader sql query- with required parameters and a real-time policy layer between views and these tools- enforcing row/column limits, query rules, and guardrails (rate limits, max scan size, etc.).The goal is to minimize blast radius if/when an LLM does something dumb: no lateral access, no schema exploration, no accidental PII leakage, and predictable cost.Does this approach feel sane? Are there obvious attack vectors or failure modes we’re underestimating with LLMs querying structured data? Curious how others are thinking about isolation vs. flexibility when agents touch real customer data.Would love feedback - especially from teams already running agents against internal databases.",

        "content": "Hello, I would like to learn how does people ingest SCD2 Dimensions from OLTP to OLAP. For e.g. my OLTP system is CloudSQL PostgreSQL on GCP and OLAP system is BigQuery. I have some big table(having 200GB of data) and some very small tables in MB but I want to track every change happening in their columns. I have done it previously using incremental load from source table using BigQuery scheduled queries using a specific date time column but that makes lots of duplication in target table. for small tables it can be ok. Now I can do logical replication on PostgreSQL and GCP provides data stream and I can capture those changes on BigQuery. Challenge is I can't setup logical replication on read replicas, Datastream will replicate changes from Master Instance but that can be deal breaker as it is operational instance and can suffer some performance issue due to sharing it with analytical workload. Another challenge is number of replication slots and managing them. If I have many tables on one PostgreSql server then I am limited by setting up this replication to Analytical Store. It would be great to understand how are people managing this ingestion in general at scale ?",

        "author": "Data-Panda",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Working on one of my first bigger data projects as a junior and I’m a bit stuck.The source system stores timestamps in CST (no DST); the target tables must be UTC.I extract data using a rolling 7–14 day window, filtered by a business date (midnight-to-midnight in CST) as these are essentially log tables. This is necessary because there’s no last-modified field in the source tables and yet records can be updated up to 7–14 days after creation.The target tables are partitioned by the business date, and I overwrite partitions on each run. This works in theory when extracting full days, but timezone conversion complicates things. When converting CST to UTC, some records shift into the next day, meaning a “full day” CST extract can become partial days in UTC, potentially overwriting partitions with incomplete data.I’m avoiding MERGE because there’s no reliable primary key and analysts want to keep duplicates (some are valid), so partition overwrites seem like the best option. Essentially I just want to clone the source tables into BigQuery.One idea is to extract data as UTC midnight-to-midnight, but the only apparent option in the source is extracting as GMT Monrovia (which I think maps to UTC). This is what I’m edging towards, but not sure if extracting data in a different timezone to what it’s natively stored as is a recommended approach?Can someone please sanity check my approach and let me know if it’s a bad idea, or if I’m missing anything?",

I googled a little bit and saw a possible solution that involved setting up an EC2 instance with Trino as the query engine to run all queries, but also unsure on the feasibility and how much cost that would rack upalso, I'm really not sure how the front end would look like.

        "content": "Hi everyone,## Our current situationI am working at a small software company, and we have successfully switched to Clickhouse in order to store all of our customers' telemetry, which is at the heart of our activity.We are super satisfied with it and want to move on.So far everything was stored in PostgreSQL.Currently, we're relying on a legacy format to define our aggregations (which calculations we need to perform for which customer).These definitions are stored as JSON objects in the db, they are written by hand and are quite messy and very unclear.They define which calculations (avg, min, max, sum, etc, but also more complex ones wih CTES...) should be made on which input column, and which filters and pre/post treatments should be made on it.They define both what aggregations should be made daily, and what should be calculated on top of it when a user asks for a wider range. For instance we calculate durations daily and we sum these daily durations to get the weekly resultThe goal is ultimately to feed custom-made user dashboards and reports.A very spaghettish code of mine translates these aggregation definitions into templated Clickhouse SQL queries that we store in PGSQL.At night an Airflow DAG runs these queries and stores the results in the db.It is very painful to understand and to maintain.## What we want to achieveWe would like to simplify all this and to enable our project managers (non technical), and maybe even later our customers, to create/update them, ideally based on a GUI.I have tried doing some mockups with Redash, Metabase or Superset but none of them really fit, mostly because some of our aggregations use intricate CTEs, have post-treatments, or use data stored in Maps etc..I felt they were more suited for already-clean business data and not big telemetry tables with hundreds of columns, and also for simple BI cases.## Why am I humbly asking for your generous and wise advicesWhat would your approach be on this?I was thinking about maybe a simpler/sleeker yaml format that could be easily generated by our PHP backend for the definition.Then for the conversion into Clickhouse queries,I was wondering if you guys think that a tool like DBT could be of any use in order to template our functions and generate the SQL queries, and even maybe to trigger them.I am rather new in Data Engineering so I am really curious about the recommended approaches, or if there might even be some standard or frameworks for this.We're not the first ones to face this problematic for sure!I just want to precise we'll go fully opensource and are open to developing stuff ourselvesThank you very much for your feedbacks!",

Whereas with S3 tables, you use a native AWS catalog, and maintenance is automatically handled. When would someone choose one over the other? Is there anything fundamentally wrong with the self-managed route? My plan was to ingest data using SQS+ Glue Catalog + PyIceberg + PyArrow in ECS tasks, and handle maintenance through scheduled Athena-based compaction jobs.",

        "content": "Hello all,I recently started using snowflake in my new company.I'm trying to build a metadata driven ingestion pipeline because we have hundreds of files to ingest into the plateform.Snowflake advisors are pushing the snowpipe for cost and efficiency reasons.I'm leaning more towards parametrized copy into.Reasoning why I prefer copy into : Copy into is easy to refactor and reuse, I can put it in a Stored procedure and call it using different parameters to populate different tables.Ability to adapt to schema change using the metadata tableRequires no extra setup outside of snowflake (if we already set the stage/integration with S3 etc).Why I struggle with Snowpipe :For each table, we need to have a snowpipe.Schema change in the table requires recreating the snowpipe (unless the table is on auto schema evolution)Requires setting up on aws to be able to trigger the snowpipe if we want the triggering automatically on file arrival.Basically, I'd love to use snowpipe, but I need to handle schema evolution easily and be able to ingest everything on varchar on my bronze layer to avoid any data rejection. Any feedback about this ?One last question : Snowflake advisor keep is telling us cost wise, snowpipe is WAY cheaper than copy into, and my biggest concern is management that would kill any copy into initiative because of this argument. Any info on this matter is highly appreciated Thanks all !",

I have some previous experience with Python and plan on quickly up-skilling and implementing as much as I can within my current role through automation, using AWS SDK etc as well as making projects in my own time. My current role now involves managing Aurora as part of it, there’s also ‘ownership of data’ and everything that brings amongst our AWS deployments.I guess my current role is transitioning away from standard DBA things though I want to make more deliberate movements towards data engineering largely for financial reasons. I’m currently on about £75k, I have no plans to move at the moment but with the job market things can change and tomorrow my company could decide I am no longer needed. I’d like to do what I can to be in a position where I could pivot if needed without taking too much of a hit salary wise.Obviously I’ve not given too much information, but can you give an idea of the skills I ought to prioritise, things to focus on etc based on the above and if possible given an idea as to how well versed I need to be with them. e.g. with AWS is it a case of simply using EKS, MKS and being able to write functional python code or does it need to be super performant. Also is it realistic and achievable to pivot from DBA to Data Engineer on a salary of around £75k without too much of a reduction or am I being unrealistic?",

But linters, tests, and checks are all there.It also plays nice natively with PyArrow data. Right now, I'm prepping a test repo with examples using Dagster + ConnectorX + iceberg-loader.

Currently, we're being billed around $550/month for RDS MySQL, and I want to know if switching to Snowflake will help reduce costs and overcome bottlenecks like slow queries and concurrency issues.Alternatively, I’ve been thinking about using Lambda functions to move data to S3 and then pull it into Snowflake for analysis and Power BI reports.

Our data \"team\" is basically just me, plus my manager and coworker - both of whom are mostly comfortable just with data visualization in Tableau. Our data comes in from various vendors (20+) in the form of flat files in SFTPs or API endpoints. Nothing overly crazy, no streaming, no more than 1-2 GB over the course of a day.While Alteryx has been \"good enough\" the last 10 years, their rapidly rising costs has led us to research various options at how we can modernize our data stack and keep costs low. My manager has given me free reign to research various options and come up with a plan that we can execute over 2026, just with the understanding that our company has a footprint in Azure, so I shouldn't branch out to AWS or GCP for example.Proposal:+ Azure Blob Storage to ingest and store all our vendors' files and data on a daily/hourly basis+ Dagster+ (hybrid) for orchestration+ Deltalake tables created/updated in blob storage for staging, warehouse, and marts layers using delta-rs and polars for transformations+ For serving to BI tools, use external tables in a Databricks SQL warehouse pointed to delta tables+ Keep Tableau as is, reduce our need for Alteryx over time to just last mile transformations/adhoc analysis for my other team membersOther considerations:+ DBT: I did some of their courses and tried to recreate an existing pipeline using dbt-core orchestrated by Dagster and it seemed overkill for my purposes. Everything I liked in it was already covered by Dagster, such as data lineage, testing, and the features that might be nice require cloud. I'm also more comfortable writing transformations in Python rather than SQL.+ Table maintenance: I'm aware that external tables are not managed by DBX and it's on me to manage the tables manually (optimize/vacuum). I figure I can set up a script that runs once a month or something to automatically do it.+ Why delta-rs? Again, we don't have overly complex data needs or sizes that require Spark computing costs. Our machines are perfectly capable of handling the compute requirements that we need. If we get to ML models down the road, then I'd probably run those in DBX notebooks and rely on their computing power.Has anyone else ran a similar design before?

        "content": "I’m running into a Snowflake permissions issue that I can’t quite reason through, and I’m hoping someone can tell me if this is expected or if I’m missing something obvious.Context: we’re on Snowflake, tables are built with dbt and orchestrated by Dagster. Tables are materialized using DBT (so the compiled dbt code is usingcreate-or-replace semantics). This has been the case for a long time and hasn’t changed recently.We effectively have two roles involved:* a read-only reporting role (SELECT access)* a write-capable role that exists mainly so Terraform can create/provision tables (INSERT / TRUNCATE, etc.)Important detail: Terraform is *not* managing grants yet. It’s only being explored. No Snowflake grants are being applied via Terraform at this point.Historically, the reporting role had database-level grants:* usage on the database* usage on all schemas and future schemas* select on all tables* select on future tables* select on all views* select on future viewsThis worked fine. The assumption was that when dbt recreates a table, Snowflake re-applies SELECT via future grants.The only change made recently was adding schema-level future grants for the write-capable role (insert/truncate on future tables in the schema). No pipeline code changed. No dbt config changed. No materialization logic changed.Immediately after that, we started seeing this behavior:* when dbt/Dagster recreates a table, the write role’s privileges come back* the reporting role’s SELECT does notThis was very obvious and repeatable.What’s strange is that the database-level future SELECT grants for the reporting role still exist. There are no revoke statements in query history. Ownership isn’t changing. Schemas are not managed access. Transient vs permanent tables doesn’t seem to matter.The only thing that fixes it is adding schema-level future SELECT for the reporting role. Once that’s in place, recreated tables keep SELECT access as expected.So now everything works, but I’m left scratching my head about why:* database-level future SELECT used to be sufficient* introducing schema-level future grants for another role caused this to surface* schema-level future SELECT is now required for reporting access to survive table recreationI’m fine standardizing on schema-level future grants everywhere, but I’d really like to understand what’s actually happening under the hood. Is Snowflake effectively applying future grants based on the most specific scope available? Are database-level future grants just not something people rely on in practice for dbt-heavy environments?Curious if anyone else has seen this or has a better mental model for how Snowflake applies future grants when tables are recreated.",

And I am very often rejected because of my lack of exposure on public cloud or Databricks.But after a lot of research : One company (Fortune 500 Insurance) offered me a position (still in the process but I think they wil take me) where I will be working on a pure Azure data stack. (they just migrated to azure) However, my current company (Major UE bank) offer me an oportunity to move to an other team and work on migrating informatica workflow to databricks on AWS. My 2) question is : What is the best carreer choice ? Pure Azure stack or Databricks ? Thanks in advance.",

        "content": "Folks, I’m working on a data VCS similar to Git but for databases and data lakes. At the moment, I have a headless API server and the code to handle PostgreSQL and S3 or MinIO data lakes with plans to support the other major databases and data lakes, but before I continue, I wanted community feedback on whether you’d find this useful.The project goal was to make a version of Git that could be used for data so that we data engineers wouldn’t have to learn a completely new terminology. It uses the same CLI for the most part, with init, add, commit, push, etc. The versioning control is operations-based instead of record- or table-based, so it simplifies a lot of the branch operations. I’ve included a dedicated ingestion branch so it can work with a live database where data is constantly ingested via some external process. I realize there are some products available that do something moderately similar, but they all either require learning a completely new syntax or are extremely limited in capability and speed. This allows you to directly branch on server from an existing database with approximately 10% overhead. The local client is written in Rust with PyO3 bindings to interact with the headless FastAPI server backend when deployed for an organization. Eventually, I want to distribute this to engineers and orgs, but this post is primarily to gauge interest and feasibility from my fellow engineers. Ask whatever questions come to mind, bash it as much as you want, tell me whatever comes to mind. I have benefited a ton from my fellow data and software engineers throughout my career, so this is one of the ways I want to give back.",

It felt like the industry was 90% CRUD apps and centered around the same few \"cliché\" frontend and backend frameworks.Recently, I started looking into Quant Finance, and it has been a total eye-opener. It is a completely different world where the problems aren't about HTTP requests or CSS; they are about high-frequency execution, mathematical modeling, and processing massive amounts of data in real-time. It made me realize how many deep technical niches we completely ignore because they aren't as \"loud\" as web development.I wanted to share this because if you are starting to feel a bit burnt out or bored with standard web stacks, I really encourage you to look at these non-obvious fields. Whether it is Quant, Embedded Systems, or Bio-informatics, there are rabbit holes out there that are way more technically challenging than the standard paths. I spent years thinking I had seen most of what the industry had to offer, but I am finding out I was barely scratching the surface of what we can actually do with code.",

Feel the satisfaction of simply pressing \"execute\" and watching your drone do all the hard work.Unlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression.Farming earns you resources which can be spent to unlock new technology.Programming is done in a simple language similar to Python. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts you will need by introducing them one at a time.While it introduces everything that is relevant, it won't hold your hand when it comes to solving the various tasks in the game. You will have to figure those out for yourself, and that can be very challenging if you have never programmed before.If you are an experienced programmer, you should be able to get through the early game very quickly and move on to the more complex tasks of the later game, which should still provide interesting challenges.Although the programming language isn't exactly Python, it's similar enough that Python IntelliSense works well with it. All code is stored in .py files and can optionally be edited using external code editors like VS Code. When the \"File Watcher\" setting is enabled, the game automatically detects external changes.Hope you like the coding game concept! :)You can find it here:  [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The\\_Farmer\\_Was\\_Replaced/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160?utm_source=RD)",

Code isn't the hard part. On this topic, here is myI reply that we programmers use languages as tools. We use those tools to create programs. We test those programs. We package those programs. We sell those packages, or publish them as open source, or deliver them to an employer, or whatever. We get bug reports from users. We fix (some of) those bugs. We repackage and republish. Code is only part of the trade of programming. Professional programmers understand what our users need. We have clear vision for what a finished software package is and does and looks like. We get our work tested, packaged, and across the finish line. Along the way we write some code. The thing is, if we can do the other things well, the code is (usually) pretty easy, comparatively. At the same time, pure code isn't finished and doesn't have any users. That gets very boring very fast.Wanna see some examples of software packages of a scale that one person -- you -- can make and publish and try to attract live people as users?* These are Javascript utility packages. https://www.npmleaderboard.org/* These are plugins for WordPress: https://wordpress.org/plugins/* ...for Python. https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Topic+%3A%3A+Artistic+Software * Indie games. https://itch.io/There are other lists and repositories of packages out there for the searching. Laying down lines of code is just a part of our trade. The programmers of many of those packages did the whole job: explanation, instructions, code, testing, packaging, publishing, and then bug fixing. Read through some of the package descriptions; they'll give you a feel for what a piece of finished software looks like.Don't be too intimidated by the packages that turn up on the first page of these lists. The best of them have been around for many years, and have been through a lot of changes to perfect them. But those packages started somewhere. Yours can too.Make good software and stay in touch.",

Recently, I’ve been rethinking how I use AI. I’ve been using it since the moment I decided I wanted to get into programming, but looking back, I feel like it has done more harm than good for me as a developer. Lately, I’ve been using it much more cautiously and with purpose, trying to solve most things by searching the internet, documentation, making mistakes, and asking meaningful questions to people with more experience, which boosted my learning by a lot. With that in mind, I’ve been wondering if I could have been at least a mid-level developer if I hadn’t relied on AI that much while learning, even though it’s a tricky topic because a big part of our job is learning constantly. I shouldn't be the only one that got hit by this thought.",

        "content": "This is a topic that I've been really wanting to talk about.The market for teaching people how to program is very lucrative (gold rush and selling shovels, all over again), so don't listen to just to whoever claims to be an authority.On instagram, I saw this video of a person (I won't mention who it is, but many of you probably already know him) talking about how if you want to impress people in a C++ tech interview, instead of doing \"for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {}\" the boring \"amateur\" way, you have to do \"for (auto i{0uz};)\" in order to look cool and experienced.Well, first off, you're not really impressing many people (except maybe for beginners) by applying these tricks. People who don't program won't know the difference, and experienced programmers genuinely won't give a shit (and might in fact think your code is inferior, since it's less readable now).But most importantly, memorizing lots of tricks won't make you a good programmer. You know what makes you a good programmer? Understanding fundamentals and learning creative problem solving, that's what you really need.Please, for the love of God, stop following pop-coding \"coaches\". Their advice is often useless, and can waste your time by making you focus on the wrong things. As far as they're concerned, they WANT you to waste your time on them because it gives them more watchtime. Spend your time by instead working on projects you're interested in and reading up on the fundamentals of coding.Rant over.",

I feel like this makes your methods harder to read once they get more complicated than this example. I have the same problem with ternary if/else is JS.

I’m currently working as a working student at a software company, and most of my day-to-day work is focused on implementing features and writing code. While this is valuable experience, I don’t really get the opportunity to deeply learn or reflect on the underlying concepts and mechanics of the web. The problem I see here is that there are things I dont even know about and I would I need a good overview about the things that they even exist, like a book for example. Of course, I could just google individual topics, but the problem is that I don’t always know *what* I should even be googling. That’s why a well-structured roadmap, book, or resource where the relevant information is collected and explained in a coherent way would be extremely helpful.Because of that, I want to be very clear: I’m **not** looking for tutorials on JavaScript, CSS, HTML syntax, or how to use frameworks like React, Vue, etc. I already work with those technologies on a daily basis.What I’m interested in are topics like:* Authentication & authorization (sessions, tokens, OAuth, etc.)* Cookies, storage, and state management* Caching strategies (browser, CDN, server-side)* HTTP fundamentals and request/response lifecycle* Security concepts (CORS, CSP, CSRF, XSS, same-origin policy)* How browsers and servers actually interact* General web architecture and system design conceptsI want to better understand *why* things work the way they do, not just *how* to implement them in a specific stack.If you know any resources that explain these concepts well (beginner-friendly but not superficial is ideal), I’d really appreciate your recommendations.Thanks in advance!",

While fixing things, I noticed many beginner mistakes I had made earlier: messy structure, multiple firebase initializations, weak validation, oversized PDFs, and a very basic database design.The project itself is simple:* Android app for entering daily data* Web page for viewing the data and exporting a PDF* Firebase used as backendRevisiting it helped me understand **how much I’ve improved** and what I’d do differently now.For beginners here:* It’s okay if your early projects are messy* Finishing something teaches more than perfect code* Revisiting old work is a great way to learnRepo (sharing for learning, not promotion): [https://github.com/asim-momin-7864/black-gold-shift](https://github.com/asim-momin-7864/black-gold-shift)If you’re further along, I’d also appreciate feedback on what beginner mistakes stand out the most.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I need some help in choosing the right learning platform for web dev. I've been using freeCodeCamp since 2023 and I loved its structure: learn a concept -> guided project -> unguided project. That format works great for me and I learned a lot of stuff that I still remember.The big problem is: FCC removed its video content. Staying focused on long lectures is a huge problem for me, because of that I can't learn on freeCodeCamp anymore.So now I’m looking at alternatives:* Scrimba: seems interactive and video-based, which I need, but from what I've understood there are no projects where you actually get to write *everything* on your own and it's really shallow in terms of libraries and general depth* The Odin Project: To me personally it seems impossible to learn here, because there's lots and lots of text which is just a big no-no for my small clip thinking brain (thank you, tiktok).* freeCodeCamp: still amazing structure, but now mostly text-only which also makes it hard. The bite sized video lectures were perfect, but they're not there anymore.I’m not a total beginner. I know vanilla JS pretty well (up until DOM stuff from FCC), but once frameworks, Node libs, databases, backend tools, etc. enter the game, I stops working. So I'm searching for a deeper dive into the full ecosystem:* JavaScript & TypeScript* Node.js + Basic libraries like os, fs, http* React + Tailwind* Git, Linux, Docker* SQL* possibly Kubernetes and CI/CDIdeally, the platform should:* go really deep, not just scratching on the surface-level* include project-based practice (guided and unguided are nice)* offer both frontend and backend (can be in two different places) or full-stack* videos would help a **lot** (<- underline that twice)* certificates are a huge plus but not required, if it's a good course then certs aren't important at allBudget isn’t the deciding factor. I just want the most effective structure for actually retaining and practicing the material.For people who’ve used these platforms or any other platforms: which one fits this learning style best?Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I’m looking for honest advice and different perspectives on a possible career change (or career expansion).I have a degree in International Business, but after graduating I worked in roles unrelated to my degree, so I don’t have professional experience directly connected to it. At the same time, I’ve become genuinely interested in learning programming / software engineering — not only as a potential career switch, but also as a new skill I could combine with my business background in the future and as a strong plus on my resume.Here’s my situation and my doubts:• I can’t realistically commit to a full-time traditional university (time + cost).• A bootcamp appeals to me because of the structure, guidance, accountability, and also the opportunity to meet people and network.• English is not my first language, and although I use it daily, I want to keep improving. Being in an environment where I’m pushed to communicate more in English feels like a plus.So far, I’ve started learning on my own:•freeCodeCamp•Planning to try The Odin Project nextI’m realistic about expectations:•I know a bootcamp won’t guarantee a job•I know the market is competitive•I understand I may not get hired right awayMy goal is to build real skills, start with solid foundations, and keep studying long-term. Even if I initially apply for jobs related to my original careerOne important factor is that I currently have the option to stop working for about 6 months, since my husband can support me during that time. That’s why I’m seriously considering an intensive learning path like a bootcamp, so I can fully focus during that period.I looked into Hack Reactor, but my experience has been concerning:•I was told about a full scholarship. I applied and 3 weeks later they informed it wasn’t available for now. •I pass the CCAT test, contacted them to know about the next steps. Someone told me they will contact me but is been almost a month a haven’t heard for them. Because of that, I’m unsure whether Hack Reactor — or bootcamps in general — are still an option right now.So my main questions are:1.Bootcamp vs community college vs online university — what would you recommend in 2026 for someone in my position?2.Is a bootcamp still worth it mainly for structure, foundations, and momentum?3.Are online universities that people often recommend on Reddit actually a good option?4.If you were in my situation — limited time/money, strong motivation, and a non-tech degree — what path would you choose?Thanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences.

Here are some criteria:\\- should be completable within a couple weeks \\- should be easily testable (ideally not too much reliance on graphics) \\- should require the use of classes and objects to build it efficiently in order to demonstrate to students the usefulness of these concepts Some examples of ideas I do not like:\\- to-do list: this is so boring \\- pet adoption system: this is just a simulation of what a system like this would be like to code. It’s of no actual use to anybody \\- chatbot: a great project, but doesn’t require object oriented principles \\- video game: I would love to do this, but it would be rather difficult to write thorough tests forIf anyone has any ideas or has done any projects on their own that fit these criteria, I would love to hear about them!",

        "content": "Hello folks, I am studying CS at my penultimate year and I feel really overwhelmed about the heave load and so many different languages we have to use. We are currently have modules regarding databases, advanced programming and api development with a client app. The problem is that the database lectures was so theoritical but for the assignments we had to create 2 DB systems with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, without learning any of these languages during lectures. I hardly managed to do the assignments since it was the first time I had to write postgre and mongo and they assessments required to apply advanced knowledge to code the systems. On the API module it was the same. The professor focused on teaching material regarding how to complete the weekly assignments but the final one was doable since the most of the part covered from the weekly tasks. On advanced programming we had to use c# that we used in the previous years but we had to create a cross platform app with blazor and we never saw examples during lectures on how to set up a blazor app and I felt overwhelmed from the amount of reseach I had to do myself. The following semester we have an IoT's module and the prof told us we will create an IoT device in a simulator with python for the final assessment. We never touched python before. The other module is about game development and they changed the curriculum to use unreal engine with c++ instead of unity, we never wrote c++ before. The last module is about penetration testing and the module guide says that we will have to write bash scripts and python to simulate some attacks on our Uni's servers. What do you recommend me to study during our next semester's gap in order to cope with the assessments and not get frustrated again?",

As much as I hate to admit it, I am overreliant on AI and wanting to break that habit. So, I've taken the time to set up Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi, changed the web interface password to a randomly generated string and blocked most chatbot websites (ChatGPT, Claude, etc), and also setup blocking via browser extensions. That's a discussion I'm sure all of you have heard so I won't say anymore about that.I am posting because I really struggle with ideas for projects that can actually teach me something. Sure, a todo app can teach me something but I want something practical and that I (or other people) can use. I also struggle with planning/designing the projects so I am looking for help on that as well. I do have an example of a practical project I want to finish that I've been working on, but I am really struggling with breaking it down into manageable parts. I am a music producer that posts my type beats on YouTube and Beatstars (beat selling website), and I found that uploading things is starting to become increasingly annoying as I need to click through a ton of menus and upload files and such, so I wanted to streamline that. The idea is a desktop GUI app that uses web automation to upload to Beatstars, and then Google's API for uploading to Youtube. What I've done so far is defined Pydantic types (I'm using Python) and started work on a setup wizard screen, but I feel like feature creep is really hitting hard so I wanted to step back and plan more.

I never called IT because I usually figured it out (I learned that’s why they liked me - I always had new stuff without asking for it). I wanted to make sure I could relate to my people, so I decided to do some homework on IT related stuff. My love of math and problem solving combined with undiagnosed adhd kicked in and I found myself in a Python course. Became a bit obsessed because it felt natural. I am using AI to answer questions about why things operate the way they do and to assist, but only use it now for smaller blocks because it gets dumb really fast. I find myself correcting it when I get it to write blocks for me now. Fast forward to the future. I’ve been building apps at work (mostly power apps, power automate - but learning Python made learning these EASY) and my database is now active. I’ve also built standalone tools with Python at work that are being used. I’ve got no formal education in technology. But I clearly understand the concepts that have been introduced to me. I find myself now gravitating towards a career in technology. I could do this all day. Managing people is great when things are going well but……there’s downsides. I guess I’m wondering what I should learn next to level up and make me valuable to a software development company? I’d even do simple things as a side hustle to level up my experience.

It doesnt do much yet, and it doesnt even have flow control functionality (yet), but very proud that I have even managed to get this far lol, (debugging hell 200%)Uses NASM and Golink in the backend.Has anybody else ever done anything similar? Any advice? Ive learned so much so far that im already contemplating restarting haha Written in C++, managed to get these features:Function definitions and calling Global and local variables definitions Integer mathematics that follow BEDMAS (Use shunting yard algorithm), can also nestle functions in the expressions Can link to external dll for more functionality The string types are = \\[4bytes - length, 4bytes - capacity, 8 bytes - pointer\\] and also null terminated, for working with C style string functions one can use the syntax $stringVariable.cHere is an example that I managed to sucesfully compile today: #inc: \"core.ni\" #def: $text : string = \"This strings length = %d, capacity = %d\\n\" #def: $number : int32 = 95 #def: .main() int32 { .c_printf( $text.c, $text.length, $text.capacity ) $number = 50*11 .c_printf( \"Number (50*11) is: %d\\n\", $number ) $number = .getNumber() .c_printf( \"Number after function is: %d\\n\", $number ) .c_printf(\"Enter a number: \") .c_scanf(\"%d\", ?number ) .c_printf( \"Number entered is: %d\\n\", $number ) .exit(0) } #def: .getNumber() int32 { .return(123456789) }And here is the \"core.ni\" #lnk: \"msvcrt.dll\" #ext: .c_printf : printf( $text : pntr , $arg1 : any , $arg2 : any , $arg3 : any ) void #ext: .c_scanf : scanf( $text : pntr , $arg1 : pntr ) void #ext: .c_malloc : malloc( $size : int32 ) pntr #ext: .c_free : free( $address : pntr ) void #ext: .c_realloc: realloc( $address : pntr, $size : int32 ) pntr #lnk: \"kernel32.dll\" #ext: .exit : ExitProcess($code : int32) voidWanted to make linking to external functions easy! (I think this is fairly simple)I use the variable type \"any\" as a workaround for overloads atm hahaOther than control flow functionality, what other basics should I try to implement next?

I try to take part in almost every opportunity I get.The biggest benefit for me has been the exposure. You meet new people, work with different teams, and learn new things beyond regular classroom coding. Hackathons improve not just coding skills, but also communication, collaboration, and networking. You also get to know about new platforms, tools, and technologies, which is really helpful. What makes hackathons exciting is the experience of solving a real-world problem within a limited time — whether it’s a 24-hour or 36-hour hackathon. Thinking of an idea, building a solution from scratch, and implementing it under pressure is challenging but incredibly fun and rewarding.Overall, the experience is top-notch and honestly enjoyable. I personally recommend college students to participate in hackathons along with their regular studies. They help improve coding knowledge, problem-solving skills, creative thinking, and even leadership skills.For me, hackathons have been one of the most valuable parts of my college journey.",

A simplified example:`SomeClass::unit_under_test(){ this->f(); // changes the state of this // ... }`I've used C++ syntax since that's the language I'm using, but the question itself is not specific to C++. For those unfamiliar, `this` refers to the current object of the class that you are in scope of.My question is: how do you properly test `unit_under_test`? I am not really that interested in testing `f()`, because there is a separate unit test for that. I also can't mock it without making changes to source code, because there is no way to link in a mock for `f()` that will end up getting called here instead of the actual member function.You could also imagine that `f()` could be fairly complex. It could itself call a bunch of other functions that do various things and which should themselves be unit tested. Digging into the implementation of those functions starts to feel like it's getting outside the scope of the test of just this function.So, it seems hard to know how best to test this kind of thing, and I wanted to know what others' thoughts are.",

        "content": "Spent like 2 months stuck in \"tutorial hell\" with typescript.i'd watch a 3-hour course, nod along, feel like i understood it... but the second i opened vs code and tried to write real code? confused. why can't i use \\`instanceof\\` with an interface? why does my type annotation just... disappear?realized the problem wasn't that i couldn't code. the problem is that typescript is weirdly invisible. it disappears at runtime (type erasure). you can't \"see\" it executing like you can with js console logs.so i built a visualizer to show exactly what happens during compilation.the interactive playground lets you:* watch types fade away step-by-step as typescript compiles to javascript* see interface declarations, parameter types, return types, and variable types all disappear* understand why \\`interface User\\` literally doesn't exist in the browserwhy this matters:a lot of beginners try to use interfaces in if statements (e.g., \\`if (user instanceof UserInterface)\\`), not realizing that \\`UserInterface\\` literally doesn't exist at runtime. seeing it fade away visually helps that concept click.i made a specific interactive lesson for this concept free to use (no signup required, just runs in browser).if you're struggling to wrap your head around TS, try visualizing the compilation instead of just memorizing syntax. helps a ton.[https://pixeldeveloper.io/lessons/R3KpToH4miIM3\\_l1Sr7FG](https://pixeldeveloper.io/lessons/R3KpToH4miIM3_l1Sr7FG)disclaimer: i built this because i learn better visually. hope it helps someone else get out of tutorial hell.)",

I want to check whether this is a known limitation or something wrong in my build/integration.Target:NXP [i.MX](http://i.MX) RT1064 (1 MB internal SRAM + 4 MB Flash) on bare-metalToolchain: arm-none-eabi-gcc with newlib-nanoDisplay: 16x128 LED matrixUI: LVGL with a custom HarfBuzz text shaping hookStack: size - 64kB ; stack region: SRAM\\_DTCHeap: size - 128kB ; heap region: SRAM\\_OC2Libraries:FreeType 2.13.2 (static) + HarfBuzz 8.3.0 (static, Meson build)Font: NotoSansDevanagari, AnjaliOldLipi and so on as a C arrayAll threads, atomics, glib, ICU, getenv, etc. are disabled. No pthreads, no OS services.I have two build setups with very different behavior.Case 1 (non-cyclic build):I build FreeType without HarfBuzz, then build HarfBuzz with FreeType, and do NOT rebuild FreeType again with HarfBuzz enabled.Result: English text works and Indic gives me hard fault at GSUB.Case 2 (cyclic build, as described in FreeType docs):Build FreeType without HarfBuzz.Build HarfBuzz with FreeType enabled.Rebuild FreeType with HarfBuzz enabled.Result: English and Indic text breaks, hard fault or hb\\_font\\_destroy gives error.The fault consistently appears somewhere in the GSUB path. The backtrace usually goes through hb\\_shape(), hb\\_shape\\_full(), hb\\_shape\\_plan\\_execute(), hb\\_ot\\_shape(), and apply\\_forward() in GSUB. In some runs the crash appears closer to hb\\_font\\_destroy(), in others during hb\\_shape(), so I suspect memory corruption or an assumption violation rather than a single bad call.Important observation:When FreeType is NOT rebuilt with HarfBuzz, English works but Indic fails.When FreeType IS rebuilt with HarfBuzz, both English and Indic fail and I get a hard fault.Occasionally, I also get an access violation and I found this:[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation)My understanding (please correct me if wrong):HarfBuzz does all shaping (GSUB/GPOS, Indic, Arabic, etc.) and FreeType loads glyphs and rasterizes them. The FreeType :left-right_arrow: HarfBuzz cyclic dependency mainly exists for auto-hinting improvements, not for shaping correctness.Since my display is a very low-resolution 16x128 LED matrix, hinting quality is not very important, but correct glyph order is.So my questions are:1. Is HarfBuzz GSUB shaping expected to work on bare-metal targets with no OS and newlib-nano?2. Is rebuilding FreeType with HarfBuzz actually required if shaping is already done by HarfBuzz?3. Are there GSUB code paths that assume stack size, libc behavior, or memory features that may not exist on embedded targets?4. How much stack and heap would be required for proper Indic rendering?I have attached an image from the IDE incase anyone wants to check.If you happen to know someone who might be familiar with this issue, I’d really appreciate it if you could share this with them. Any help would be greatly appreciated!Even a confirmation that this configuration is unsupported would be very helpful. Thanks a lot for any pointers you can share.

I've been doing courses for a few months now and I finished my fundamentals, starting my advances modules in January.I also decided to do an additional module for AI ML and Maths, because I am interested in it and I see how it can be valuable for me.I just started also learning in my personal time, by doing small projects like a \"To-Do\" checklist, calendar, mood tracking app with JSON data saves, learning some PyQt for the UI as well. I have plans to create automation software like an automatic maze generator and solver and etc. I've started 3Blue1Brown algebra lessons and problem solving as well.Although, I am using Claude AI to coach me additionally. I don't ask AI to write for me the code I want, but I do use AI to explain to me principles, to show me certain commands, how you call stuff, I ask about the logic. I never implement a code that I do not understand and sometimes spend hours reading on a topic an asking questions. Still, I feel a bit guilty for using AI for additional coaching, but I'm just a little slow when it comes to learning and need my own time and speed and I need a lot of freedom to ask questions - something, which is not freely available in academies and with real teachers.I am really interested in learning a lot of stuff, because I am very curious. I am curious about software development, ML, game dev, robotics, low-level languages as well and is all things I want to explore in the future step by step. I am just afraid of wasting my time learning the wrong way and then not knowing basic concepts or ways of work, as this field is pretty broad and it is quite difficult sometimes to follow and know where to learn from.",

Junior Developers Shouldn’t Be The Default Cost-Saving Move> “They're usually the least expensive because they're right out of college, and they generally make less. So if you're thinking about cost optimization, they're not the only people you would want to optimize around.”3. Removing Juniors Breaks the Talent Pipeline>\"At some point, that whole thing explodes on itself.

Despite that, my role remained secure because of the technical depth, domain knowledge, and familiarity I have with the projects and their complexity. That context and continuity turned out to matter.With the increasing hostility and constant uncertainty around H-1B, I eventually stopped trying to plan a future here. I asked my employer whether transferring me to an international office was an option, either in the Netherlands or Canada.They agreed.So I’ll be moving to the Netherlands soon, keeping the same job, just no longer in the US. A close friend did the same thing a few months ago and moved her role to Canada.What’s frustrating is that this feels entirely avoidable. The US doesn’t just lose a worker in situations like this, it loses a highly skilled contributor and the taxes that come with that. The work doesn’t disappear. It simply moves elsewhere.After a decade of building, leading, and contributing here, it’s hard not to see this as a self-inflicted loss. I’m not leaving because I wanted to. I’m leaving because staying stopped making sense.Just sharing my experience.",

        "author": "extechmachina",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "It seems to me that in the past few years a lot of developers and engineers working in the industry became the equivalents of \"passive, people pleasing doormats\" who value their jobs ways above their personal integrity and morals. I commented on a post recently that said \"I gave up on concert tickets because of an emergency at work, is that normal?\" (asked by a junior developer).Along my comments there, I'm writing this post to say that, NO, that is not normal. And it should not be the norm either. Boundaries matter, our personal lives matter, and the engineers who do not enforce or put up said boundaries create a worse environment for the rest of us.I'll double down by sharing a personal story that happened to me just a few months ago.background: I am a senior backend/data engineer with about 8 years of total industry experience. I've been working at my current company for 4 years now. We are a consultancy firm with large (mostly corporate) clients from around the world. My main client at the moment is a large non-tech company. I've been with this client since the beginning of my employment in the current company.A few months ago my PM passed on a new ticket that required me to create a process that formats and sends personal data of tens of millions of private clients (who are people like you and me) to a third party for a vaguely written cause (that was clearly along the lines of ad targeting).Possibly a violation of GDPR, but I am not a lawyer, so I cannot be sure. Either way it was morally disgusting to say the least.I refused to do it. I refused to plan, execute or have anything to do with that ticket. I knew clear and well the risk I was taking, they could have fired me for refusing, but they didn't.I pissed my PM off, I pissed my direct manager off (although they all agreed with me at first, that this was a problematic feature--until I refused to go along with it, then they flipped).I even heard this has reached my CEO, who was also, in fact, pissed off.But I stood my ground, I knew they COULD fire me, but I hoped they would not. I explained myself as politely but as firmly as I could, stating \"I do not want to do this\", \"this is wrong\"', etc. I knew I could not stop the company from doing it, because there was probably a legal loophole, or some shady terms of service agreement that would allow them to go along with it. But I did not want it on my conscience. They ended up giving the feature to a different engineer, marked it as \"priority: emergency, must happen now\", and I ended up keeping my job.The bottom line of the story is that I refused to give up my personal boundaries for money, and you should too. I am not telling you to ignore risks, or to be stubborn for no reason. I am however asking you to respect yourself, your boundaries, your limits and your personal life. Your personal life, and your personal boundaries are reason enough to politely refuse when the rope tightens for no valid reason.If you live in fear of losing your job, you are by definition a slave of whoever is signing your paycheck. You must believe, even in times like this (when the market is truly horrible), that you will land a job no matter what. You will make enough money to live comfortably no matter what your situation is. If not this job, then the next one. If not this profession, then something else. Once this mindset sets, you can develop personal boundaries, and live, frankly, a much happier life in general.Everytime we allow corporations and managers to push our boundaries, it becomes the norm and spreads like wildfire. Let's use our combined power as valuable engineers to engineer a better environment for all of us.Rant over, have a lovely weekend.",

Now all new hires are Indians. Obviously, I don’t care. The timings help me.And I can pinpoint exactly when this shift happened. A new Director was hired from a WITCH company and suggested offshoring. He’s just pushing sprint after sprint with no overall goal or idea from top to bottom. We are making useless products and being overworked for basically nothing.When this happens, it particularly sucks more for the US employees since they have less leverage due to much higher salaries.When you see this trend, run. Although, the offshore engineers are amazing. The issue is when they only want offshore engineers and not the best ones. They have a plan ahead for their own selfish benefits. It doesn’t help the company.PS - We didn’t even get Christmas week off Edit - Addition",

I did okay but idk. For being scheduled 2 days out, the volume of material over the weekend was so much.I have another scheduled for a company I have heard is 75% full for new grad hires, but it’s leetcode prep. I haven’t even started because the other preparation was so specific. What the hell are with these take home challenges? I am so tired of the non-standardization of this process.I am been tired bc between this too, it’s been like 4 hours a day of sending apps out or trying to message recruiters. Not to mention, some have sent 45 min “game” assessments.I tried to work on projects “for fun” but… I don’t have the energy rn without directly being paid money :upside-down_face:Edit: the search is done (hopefully)Lowkey, I’ve had an entrance exam I failed on my mind I had to retake on top of course exams while never having the option to even take courses related to my topic, then straight to SWE/ leetcode I don’t think my brain can actively take a break from thinking I have an exam rn actually.

I was there for two and a half years and I hadn’t interviewed at all during that time. It took me four months to get an offer and I managed to get two of them in the same week. One was from an early seed stage startup and the other was Meta. I accepted Meta for more immediate TC and stability, but then I got laid off again just before hitting my year mark. I just finished interviewing again and this time the results are much better. Waiting for the last potential offer/rejection to come in before I post that Sankey. Overall the system design interviews were my biggest weakness again like in my previous search. Hellointerview helped a lot with that and I ended up paying for two mock interview sessions with them. Those are painful but worth it. Besides system design interviews, though, I got rejected a lot in the initial round for not having enough depth in particular tools. I’ve been working in developer tools and infrastructure for most of my career and a lot of places I was applying to wanted much deeper experience with Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS. I had worked with all of those at the previous two jobs I had in the 6 years prior to this search, but hadn’t really dug in deep on them and it showed in those early screens. I also got several rejections in the final rounds towards the end where the feedback was that I did very well but someone else just had a bit more relevant experience so they were getting the offer. I even had one recruiter say that the hiring manager tried to get headcount approved to extend offers to me and the other candidate but got denied and I was the second choice. Here’s the details of the two offers I did get: **Seed stage startup*** Salary: $190k* Target bonus: 10%* Equity: $88k in options* Remote**Meta*** IC5* Salary: $215k* Target bonus: 15%* RSUs: $710k over 4 years* TC: ~$425k* Hybrid 3x/week[Sankey source](https://sankeymatic.com/build/?i=IIBxBsEsFMBMAIDaA2AHAXXgOQPbwE7QDOIOAdkdAFCgQwKIDsArJgErQBW0AxgC5wqAeiHwAhkSIBXALaQyAc3Hhw8HADN4fABbRxPHtBACEYsFB5i%2BkckQLEp4E%2DHnxLKogBp4UkLCt6kJpkvMREYvgAnjTm9EgATBjwAMJiKvAA7qKEPPhSkAL4MXRwCZgA8mRQIeKSYTLQZHzFUKWIAIyYABJipuCEvZEuTdD4AG4wGaXqOPhaugQ44NS0rQzx7Lx5BaP2JOSwgqtxHZgAkmQFkGlavNqX7otSZLBUVD19A7BD8oUT0FMEDM5jo9PglnpTvAONx%2BIIqBxcvlCntSC82ht4ABxbQ4IgmN6I7YohqSMQKUoNJDtZAAFkwAHUCtpYIQMgitsjdqTwhSEFSUElUuksvYkTsikSuXMeeTKZDaUkcXiCVKJfBZXyNZD2vToVxeKrOerNfKkHrKtU9BJKJIGk0OeKSWE5fydedLtYbgIePdII9wc9XlRhapRTlibsoQAVMQAaz0uKpNsgCjI9uaocy2WNKI6AE5NrCCVnw7mo8xOvALldvXcHjdAy8Q2kwzmnVGAMyM5msgEtkXtyNzJgVKrya11O2NTOt7Ni4fU1jY3H4%2BGxhPwJOToip9MzsrwJk6PvsjeJnDJyR7jPUouGwTnreXnc3g%2BITEAMXkjZwQaoT7brUu5preULHiybLiOoKJiAYRjWIoajqOooyEtAcG6Agf58FoeAyEMIR8Bksxxne%2BrFoIHCYaUOF4RqhHQMRpHkbgqK2NQVA1l6qg%2Bn6AZ%2Di8CTIPecKvNx1y8fW%2Dq%2DkG1J6t%2BZCyc2El1r6DaqE2DDtAADJgypruJnqSbc6kyZpgkMMugEvsBb4OqpUlmQJcngb2bJccZan8cp2ljlawH1DObyWhOgXTk0SDdhRD6vKFNQ2kFkWIHqEGnlQ8U7kluEpR6tZOT5Fn%2Dpl4VEGB0WKb5byVUVQkdMuMKxVQNVPHVmJpVBYgwbscGGMY8hKBoqFFC1WnkeUKFoaNlnkdGGEyBqVi%2BgNbxzWIC0yEt2gDeNk1FBle3kcA8HGIIE3DeRAAivBWsGABcjVifAADEyTJDpH06VQd1sYQ%2BwUHoz2MLSwPA99pZDtKL0AEbMDwtLxIw30dQCL35vmqDqIwnbfcdfXOM9H2fp%2BH3feduyEzpPD5qTd2OaZhWtQglO0swtPTXJlOMLAtPXTwt0vR9CO0yjGTQbBJ2IYNh3PYcYg0%2DmuOxKUlOfV9D0Yb6tFSLhfD4YxzH4GRqufd9arOmSWpUibtMlYlEW4c9nbxNDnY6Ujd0GQTyDc8g0DqzZV4gfukVOy7btI7uABeehi%2B0%2BbxF9W7wLpqBfZt%2BAKK4qjtPEVAECnedaCnqD59D8CJ1Q0NKDwSyzC9KGN%2Bo%2Bd8PgYgUCAEQHlgVBkDghyZIX%2BfaPAbP5yQcE7SwZezIccxJ6Cyb57X4D189qAb5v%2Bc4J3PAFEM7RUOoq9izwUjjFY596DpAB0zD5%2DIuj4AU6jggtfARBSzRuHXczPejADFZqF3vveAt9WZUHAGISIdFZ49R1peKw%2Dp86cCkPiIIMDn5ZwoNgFBaDrDqEiI0WAdge72DGKMSgCg24gBHmQqwH9lpkFrjICATFiB63gCELu%2BJIFiGhtAcAdgV5rzVqTLckAB5kO2gobQUBZG4VvtPeAMwmjqDgnocIFAAC0lBn7N3gFaCee8kK3yLoQKB1gKHRz0O0XS%2BdNppgwSnUmUCBHgCUsmMAGF8B2AAJrj0gDHFOyB85TFTNoXCtJXH8MEWMNIUhrTeIiP4%2DO6hHDgBADkSAu5yDwACfAUgu5rB5PcTgdkmRoARKiTE9xRSrh5LEAgtIe4wHjy1smBBaTIC%2BNwgI4E1B4DQwGHGUgvwK5fXieARJKjZibVwgAck8DfBZ%2BcsnQHUJAAAHvABZqz4DSBQts3ZqzF7QCGpQXCYh4ChKGW0tw9yEDpyYtcjMNgKDtwTJEeZ%2Dp8n5ygOgmQ0M0jt0MKkmQOAKHwGOKUbRt8dK6R0swbwcKb66niCDKgEKoW%2DWIGiSgYCb5Ip0p2fMKLb66WYLSLFkK9Dm25C6K2ehtHtDvp2ZAyBvAUpBtS7FdLNZYTUDreiBEuFMRIkbQlH12ioGRfAVFnZUCJBxnylIc4ywdjmKitO8R8ztC5WihFOk86qrtlOMqB5UXMHzMwZAnZyU3zdgik1tLqxeQKhpJm8rb7WvZfEA18R44%2BxpVCr2pR4U2vzLSA17RGAIvvqq0W4seqSx2kNXYqK7HxFtTG5AGND6qo5kJBVMrs0Gp0nqzsvLXWB1fKBS14DaT5kVQGukjBQmqses4eF7Qq3lsVcwF1UKk3worS2qVaBEghr0OTLV8LkAVrlai41iRS6qrxghcNRKkXsodanZgCbXV8wFqOn2DqdKs3aIeqFHxlBfB%2BCMcYkxpj11BIsZY3qb60jzagaNn6PqJEVqqtaG0to7UzagTs1rz0XtQAW119K5h%2DTRIcBAqLkDxE7O2h1aBkDWqAA)EDIT: Explaining my terrible labels: * Withdrew after accepting offer: I used this for the companies I withdrew from once I accepted Meta's offer.* Rejected: means the company rejected me at some point* Ghosted: the recruiter stopped responding to me without an outright rejection* Call w/ recruiter: Only used this if it was the first step before anything else after either applying or getting their email or LinkedIn message.

Reed C. from Game Seven has contacted me several times over the past couple years and it's almost entirely for shitty contracting roles with Amazon. Twice I decided to consider the roles he was trying to fill. Each time he would frequently call me out of the blue and stress that the hiring manager wanted to fill the position as soon as possible and to schedule an interview quickly. Both times I scheduled the interview, took it, and then never heard back from Reed afterwards. The first time it happened I checked in with him about a week after the interview and he claimed the hiring manager never gave him feedback and that he'd follow up. He never did. I didn't even bother the second time. Don't waste your time with this recruiter.",

In an ideal scenario, an applicant who is enthusiastic, writes a cover letter etc. should get an interview, but I heard already from some managers that they completely don't look at cover letters due to lack of time, CV is more optimized. Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.Then I even heard that your cover letter doesn't get read, but the fact that you have one is acknowledged. Or I read recently in a post, that someone uploads a video as attachment for the application, quite unorthodox. Surely it depends from company to company, but I would really be interested: how do YOU make the choice, and why that way?",

There is still room for innovation but as not as much as 2001 or 2010s I feel.I have this feeling that the sun is setting on software engineering gradually.People got really excited by AI and LLMs, they felt it would usher in another wave of innovation and money and create millions of jobs. But the whole agentic AI movement didn't gain as much traction as people were hoping it would.Every single country today has horrible job market for SWEs. I am subscribed to all the country specific CS/SWE subreddits. Everyone is complaining about the job markets and economic conditions in their countries. No entry level jobs at all. Only senior level jobs every where.I can't help but think all of this is connected. What do you folks think?",

I have no idea.Basically I got into the field 8 years ago and have worked at 3 different places and nothing that I've ever worked on, nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on, has ever had any real impact. And by impact, at the end of the day, one could say I mean money. Nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on has ever helped anyone and in turn made money. Simultaneously, every project, every product I have ever worked on was heavily overstaffed and with extreme food envy among developers.Is there anyone out there that actually works on something that people need? Is there any project out there that actually needs me?I've been interviewing for over a year now too and I ask the interviewers:\\- \"What are you working on?\"\\- \"Why are you hiring for this role?\"Nobody can answer these questions. It's always some hand wavy explanation. You know, the kind you usually get from people lying about their resume. \"Oh this and that bla bla...\"At the same time, as we all know, life has gotten so expensive that, at least I, personally, cannot really say \"Oh I will just do this job and in 5-10 years I can buy a house or something.\" Because I cannot. Where I live houses now go for about 20x - 30x the local average yearly income. I just don't know what I'm doing with my life here.Not that it ever really mattered to me anyhow. I don't really want to own a home. I got into this field, because I wanted to build something that helps people, that makes their lives easier or more enjoyable. Something that is valuable, that creates value. What I've seen instead is that we are our own stakeholders. We build for ourselves. Just to keep things going.It's literally the hamster wheel pop culture has warned me about.",

        "content": "There is someone on my team who is more experienced than me, but seriously slacks off.They have made serious errors (always privately to me) and revealed how little they know about our systems.Their output is ridiculously small. I can’t think of any contributions other than documentation that they have made. Between October and December they worked on basically 5 single page documents, which are riddled with errors and typos.We have daily stand ups every day, but out of everyone this person misses it the most. With no explanation.They sometimes have 10 tickets assigned to them but in their update only update on 1 ticket. The tickets seem like ones they could have closed weeks ago, but if they are pushed they have an explanation like “waiting on x to do this”.It’s all smoke and mirrors with them.When they did have a task 10 months ago, I helped them so much with it, and it really bothered me bc it wasted so much time. Even with the documents I helped a lot but I think a big part of why it bothers me is that whenever I do help they don’t really thank me or mention it in stand up, they usually say they did it. They also debate with me about the information I’m giving them. Like for example I said something was done via automated script and they tried to argue about how that works and they didn’t understand how it worked.They are a drain on my energy and I would really just rather they weren’t on the team. How do you deal with someone like this? Just ignore them? As I have been for 2 years?I’ve actually been keeping a parchment path on this secretly. But I don’t think I can ever bring it up to anyone.",

In August of this year, I was laid off after the federal government canceled all the contracts I was working on, and there were no other positions available for me. I had been at the company full-time for almost three years before being laid off.I have been applying for jobs for almost five months now, and I have had no success. Most of the time, I do not even get interviews. When I do get interviews, I have reached the final round at Meta but did not get an offer. The same happened with Fanatics. At IBM, I failed the first programming interview after the coding assessment. I was interviewing for a C++ role but had limited experience. I have also interviewed for three local roles and made it to the final round in all of them.The only feedback I have received came from my two most recent interviews. For Company A, they said I did not perform well in the programming project during the interview because I focused on new Java features. However, they also said positive things. They thought I had the right culture fit and technical skill, but I lacked experience in DevOps, which I believe was not part of the job description, and I was relatively slow. For Company B, they said, \"We do not think your skillset is the best fit for the fundamental development tasks that will be our primary focus in the months ahead.\"My experience at my former employer was mainly with legacy systems, which is typical for government contracts. We used AWS for the entire system: ECS, RDS (Oracle SQL), DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambda, and S3. But all the backend code, where I worked full-stack, was in Java 8, later upgraded to Java 21, SpringMVC (no Spring Boot), Apache Tomcat, Apache Maven, SVN, and Git. The frontend consisted of JSPs that loaded XML files with vanilla JS, Bootstrap, and jQuery, along with CSS and HTML.It seems many companies are looking for reactive websites, which I have no experience with, or Spring Boot and more modern tech stacks. I am getting almost no interviews, and the process can take a month or more just to end in rejection. I know the job market is very difficult right now, but this is taking a serious mental toll on me. I already have disabilities and mental health issues, and I feel like my life and career are falling apart. I do not have skills for \"normal\" non-tech roles, and I do not know what to do. I know the obvious advice is to improve my resume and interviewing skills, but at some point, even getting an interview feels completely random, and the same goes for the interviews themselves.EDIT: Resume https://imgur.com/a/j1UZQnQ",

Right now, I’m standardizing on one backend language (Java) and building projects using Spring Boot, while still using different tools and frameworks around it (databases, auth, cloud, frontend frameworks, etc.).I’ve heard that as long as your DSA and core CS fundamentals are strong, companies care less about exact stack alignment and more about your ability to reason about systems and pick up new tools.My question is:If I build solid full-stack projects using Java + Spring Boot on the backend, with modern frontend frameworks and strong DSA, is that generally sufficient to apply broadly to full-stack roles, even at companies using different backend languages?",

Our tech stack is Java/Kafka/RPC/S3/Logging tool to fetch S3 logs/UI to interact with APIs.

Even finding where to start to code is confusing when a change has things interacting with multiple repos (I try to use a global search tool we have to find starting point). Also I really struggle with manual testing. Like when I make a change in the back end that logically reflects in the front end, I need to be able to make the change in our front end service (which is also confusing as a product to some extent bc some parts/integrations of our product our team doesn’t own) and then read logging software to diagnose what’s happening behind the scenes whether it be a java stack trace or an API call or whatever.I want to stay at my company for as long as possible bc it’s good and remote so I need to learn company stack specifically. I just need guidance on how to get better FAST.Can someone give me a plan on how to approach this?I’m thinking I need to:1. Learn nuances to the product itself2. Learn Java coding more deeply with dependency injection (by doing personal projects 2 hours a day on work computer using work tech stack)3. Learn architecture of our main repos(all our repos follow general architecture of having organized modules where some are data, some are RPC, some are Kafka, etc.)4.

        "content": "I am an SWE with 4YOE (all at my current place of employment) in a LCOL city. Where I work, software is a cost center.For most of my time at this company, we were a team of 4-5. Over the course of this year, the team has shrunk to just me with HR saying they have no intention of opening up or hiring for the lost positions. This means I am salary with 24/7 on-call (no payment for OT or call-outs).I recently became a team of 1 as of mid-september. Based on the concerns I brought up with my manager, I was recently presented with a raise and title change. I went from \\~$80k -> \\~$91k. This is in effect as of now. This raise also makes me ineligible for the normal end-of-year raise considerations. In addition to the raise, a retention offer was just made for $9k but I would have to remain with the company for 18months. Accepting or rejecting this offer does not effect the title change or raise that I already got.They have already stated that negotiating any of that 9k into base salary is not an option nor lessening the time frame. HR got quite aggressive when I inquired about that. The offer says I would get the net post-tax money, but would have to pay back the gross amount if broken.Like many of us, I have already been applying for other jobs. And honestly, if I had a choice, I would not be here in even 6 months. But with the current job market, especially in a LCOL city, Im not too sure if the option of another job in 18 months is realistic.I've read there is some tax form that could be filled out to essentially get the tax difference between the net and gross so I don't suffer a loss if I break the contract.But my question to you is - how have you handled retention offers like this and what is your opinion on it?Accepting it feels like it might turn into handcuffs of a sort... but rejecting it feels like it puts a mark on me as a flight-risk when I might be stuck there anyways due to the current market.",

I gotta be honest I made a terrible mistake by joining this team - I mostly did it for the location. And my situation now is that I am not getting motivated enough to work, I was really passionate about this field you know - I enjoyed going to the office, using my split keyboard, having triple monitor setup, cool desk decorations. But nothing motivates me anymore. Last weekend I tried working on a personal project, and I found the energy again, I stayed up late night working on it, I even took this whole week off to finish it. I wish I had the same passion for work. I am afraid lack of motivation in the long run is going to affect my work performance :/",

I started as a Graduate Software Engineer back in August, but with a lack of new work within the company I was sitting around idly for 3 months before being offered to join the platform team. I decided to take it as I had literally nothing to do but I'm not sure if this is going to hinder me long term.I went into my degree with the intent of becoming a SwE, I know SwE pretty well and I'm pretty comfortable writing code. Platform is all brand new to me & I'm struggling to really grasp the scope of what this team does. There's tons of different repos, lots of different tech, pipelines, bash scripts, terraform whatever the fuck else but its all one big blur to me. I know I'm new to the role and all but part of me has this feeling that I'm wasting my potential. I spent 5 years learning to code, I got pretty good at it, I worked hard to get a first in my degree and there's this voice telling me I'm wasting it all in this role. Could anyone more experienced in the DevOps/Platform side of things let me know what the role is like? Do you feel this is a solid role long term, with progression and transferable skills or is it just another buzzword that will quickly die out? I feel like I see software engineers everywhere making lots of money, little money, big companies, small companies, there's tutorials everywhere but with Platform all I see online is grifters trying to sell courses or hyping it up as \"the next big thing\". I don't really have a sense of the importance of the role the same way I did about SwE",

        "content": "January to May 2025 was a bit bittersweet. Was a college junior at the time, and I had just molded my resume into something semi-satisfactory after sticking a bunch of school projects onto it. I had pretty much locked in with applying to tech-adjacent roles like data analysis at this point, and was prioritizing local companies. I kept applying through the spring, long after many might've given up or accepted offers. And while most of the internships I'd applied to were duds, a few did reach out to me. None of them were really technical, and yet I managed to fail many of those. For some I feel like I came painfully close to an acceptance, only for the door to be slammed in my face never to be opened again.Come May, I was at wits end, and dreading the possibility of having to work at my church friend's father's store and get paid in cash for the second summer in a row. But eventually, I found a company which onboarded me at the last second for the summer. Their office wasn't far from where I lived, so things did go smoothly. Unfortunately, though, they didn't give me a return offer even though they were satisfied with my performance.For this fall I've landed a tech job through my school's research department that pays like 16 an hour. And while I've received glowing reviews for this, it's just through the school. In the meantime I've applied to a few tech jobs, and have even secured a few interviews. My resume looks a lot better now than it might've 1 year ago, people have reviewed it and told me that I'm well qualified for new grad. And yet, I'm like the world's worst interviewer. One guy ended the interview 10 minutes in because he didn't like my responses. Another gave up on me despite me being a referral. I've failed an OA they were asking for a \"winter help desk intern\" even though it's literally help desk.The last month of class I didn't even apply to anything at all, it was just depressing. I just feel like an idiot. I haven't leetcoded in ages, and if you throw LC at me right now I'll probably fail at it miserably. You can do everything with AI nowadays so that's literally what I've been doing for some of my work, like come on even many companies are doing it. I don't even want to leetcode. I don't even want to work. Some days I literally just want to sleep forever, to tell the truth. Once I literally ranted to some of the people on campus so badly after bombing one of these interviews that they had the cops called on me and forced me to go to the hospital to make sure I wasn't planning on unaliving myself.Hopefully I can lock in well enough to land something by the time I graduate may 2026. But something tells me I'm probably not. And if I don't the battle will just grow more and more uphill. You literally cannot afford to live life unless you're at the top of the world. The sooner I leave my shitty parents the better, but the world is conspiring to hate me so badly that they're probably going to force me to live with them for the rest of my life and probably even die with them. It's like the curse of unbinding from minecraft.I absolutely hate all of this, and I'm going to absolutely hate next semester of college because it'll be my last, and I'll have to do and go through with all the routines and actions knowing it'll soon be over which'll just ruin the fun. To paraphrase Calvin and Hobbes, it's like trying to enjoy one's final meal before the execution. I'll have spent what's supposed to be the best time of my life to get a boy/girlfriend and exit it without one. Who the fuck is going to date me if I'm flipping burgers since it's the only job I'll be able to find even with a degree in CS, or if I'm stuck living with my parents in an unwalkable typical American suburb because it's the only home I can afford?Honestly, if the world is going to hate me, I might as well hate the world.",

I understand that the full time employment bit is not a guarantee due to funding misses or just wanting more experienced developers.

Alongside that, I want to keep learning mathematics and computer science slowly, deeply, and for life.I’m not in a hurry, and I care more about understanding how things work than about speed or career outcomes. That’s why I’m confused about where to begin:Should I start with basic computer fundamentals?Or with logic, binary, and how computers work internally?Or should I just pick a programming language and start coding?If programming makes sense, which language suits a math student who’s learning for understanding, not employability?If you were learning CS just for knowledge and curiosity, how would you begin and structure it over a lifetime?I’d really appreciate any simple advice or perspective. Thanks :folded_hands:",

        "content": "Hi r/cscareerquestions,I’m looking for some perspective from people who’ve either been in a similar spot or have seen others navigate this successfully.I’m 35, currently employed full-time as a data engineer at a non-tech company making \\~$95k/year. Performance reviews are strong (“exceeds expectations”), but there’s essentially no room for advancement or technical growth. Long-term, my goal is to land a FAANG / FAANG-adjacent role targeting \\~$300k+ TC, and I’m willing to extend my time horizon to get there.**Background:*** Bachelor’s degree in a *non-CS* field, earned \\~13 years ago with a poor GPA* Previously made \\~$138k at another non-tech company, but was laid off in April 2024* Didn’t land my current role until August 2024* Currently working in a consultant-style role across two projects**Current role details (and why I’m concerned):*** Main project is an R Shiny dashboard with a bloated but functional frontend* Backend is Python scripts in Azure Data Factory + Azure SQL (tables/views/stored procs)* I inherited the project after the original developer left* I’ve successfully: * Troubleshot pipeline failures * Added new dashboard features * Managed stakeholder relationships independentlyThat said, I feel like my *actual* technical fundamentals are eroding. I’ve leaned far too heavily on ChatGPT to do my coding, to the point where I’d describe myself as a “prompt engineer” rather than a strong engineer (and yes - I used ChatGPT to help me write this post, lol). There’s:* Zero technical mentorship* A disengaged manager (old-school DBA, 20+ years at the company)* No push toward system design, algorithms, or deeper CS conceptsI want out of this role in the near term (ideally back closer to my previous comp), but beyond that I want to **rebuild my foundation properly in a structured environment**. Self-study hasn’t worked well for me — I do better with accountability, deadlines, and external structure.**Mental health context:** The layoff last year triggered a rough bout of depression/anxiety. I’m currently medicated and in therapy, and things are stable now. I’m trying to be realistic and intentional about my next steps instead of reacting out of panic.**My questions:*** Does it make sense to take CS fundamentals courses at a community college to demonstrate readiness and improve my chances for something like **Georgia Tech’s OMSCS**?* Is a formal CS master’s actually a good path for someone in my position aiming for high-end tech roles, or would I be better served focusing on: * LeetCode + system design * Targeted projects * Switching to a more technically rigorous job first?* For someone mid-career with weak formal CS fundamentals but real-world experience, what’s the *highest leverage* way to move forward?I’m not looking for shortcuts — I’m okay with a multi-year plan if it’s the right one. I just want to avoid wasting time or going back to school if it’s unlikely to materially change my trajectory.Thanks in advance for any insight.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I recently applied to a job on LinkedIn that I'm beginning to think is not legitimate somehow. The role is for a remote junior SWE position, and the listing seemed like any other one I've come across on the site. I hadn't heard of the company before, but I quickly scanned their website to check for legitimacy before applying. I heard back from the company about a week later asking if I was interested in completing a quick assessment via interview questions. I was so excited to finally hear back about a potential role so I emailed them back within an hour. Let's call the guy that I'm emailing with Ron.Ron's email wanted me to reply YES if I was interested in the assessment. I haven't seen this before, but I brushed it off as just a little odd. I responded with a YES, and a few hours later, I got another email from Ron with the interview questions attached in an .rtf file. He gave a little blurb about how there are no right answers and the test is to gauge if my skills and approach to the role are a good fit. He let me know that I could reach out with any questions if I had them and wished me luck on the assessment. This was on Friday.I browsed the \\~20 questions of the assessment so I could be prepared and started brushing up on some of the topics. They seemed like very normal questions for a junior SWE role. Explain the difference between these two technologies, some DSA, some behavioral, etc. Nothing strange other than an address by their logo at the top that I looked up. It's for a big office building in a major US city that had no record of them having a space in.I completed the assessment over the course of the weekend and emailed Ron back first thing Monday morning. To my surprise, he got back to me within half an hour of my response. He told me that he received my message and that their team will review my answers, then forward them to the hiring board for their decision. He said I'd hear back from him when a decision is made and asked me to acknowledge I received his email. I sent him a message back thanking him for his acknowledgement, and said I looked forward to hearing back. This is where things go downhill.I went to the company's site again to find some more information. Unlike the first time I looked around, this time I was closely reading the information on the site and clicking around. The first thing that raised an alarm was how unprofessional their about us section is. It has a really long run-on sentence that doesn't make a lot of sense and ends with three exclamation marks. This prompted me to do a real deep dive on them.After more time on their site, things really started to unravel. Social media buttons that link to nothing. Those buttons you see on the bottom of most web pages about privacy policy, ad choices, etc? All lead to blank pages. Inconsistencies with spacing and grammar. An address that looks to be a residential home in Canada. A portfolio page that has a nice flashy intro, but nothing else. Nothing on the site is selectable text. All very strange for a company that supposedly provides tech solutions.Then I did some research on Google. They have only a few people affiliated with them on LinkedIn, only 2 of which are people have any sort of information about themselves. One is a guy who seems to be a real software developer, complete with a personal website and a lively GitHub. Another is a woman who allegedly started working there years ago as a PM, but only just a few weeks ago posted an update sharing that she started there. She lists herself as still working there, but also has another current job listed. The other people affiliated with the company have no profile picture or anything, but I did find out one of them is Ron because he has a very distinct tagline that came up when I looked up his name as well.Multiple websites that report company information list them as having fewer than 10 employees, most of which are located in Canada or Africa. The company is credited as the designer and developer on a few dozen sites that I can find, but most of them seem to be associated with one specific church in one way or another. They do have a few social media accounts with not much on them. Also, the page for the LinkedIn posting I applied to is gone. Not marked as filled, but entirely gone.I'm just so confused about this whole thing. It seems so sketchy. But why send over a technical assessment if it's a scam? Why put up so many fake sites? It seems like a lot of effort just to get some data. Unless they're going even further and will try to offer people employment to get their bank data and/or social security number. Is this really how far scammers are going now? I'm already exhausted enough looking for an entry-level SWE role in 2025, I don't need scams that look this believable at surface level to waste my time.What do you all think? Has anyone seen anything like this before?TL;DR- I applied to a company for a junior SWE role and they sent over a technical assessment. After doing more research on them, I'm not sure if they are legit due to some sketchiness and inconsistencies.EDIT: Yeah it turned out to be a fake check scam as everyone was saying. There is at least 1 other person I’ve seen post about it with the same story. Now I’m not worried to say the name of the company, it’s Velte Technology Solutions. Beware!",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I’m a full-stack software developer with around 4.5 years of experience, and I’ve been at my current company for a couple of years. Recently, the company has been expanding and hiring more IT roles, mainly software developers and project managers.Over the last months, I’ve been more and more involved in client meetings, discussing requirements, planning work, and coordinating what other developers should be doing. Our IT manager noticed this, as he was present in many of those meetings, and he recently offered me the option to fully transition into a Project Manager role.The plan would be to stop recruiting an external PM, hire one additional developer instead, and have me move almost completely off coding (or at least do very little of it). I have about one to two weeks to decide whether I want to stay in a hybrid role with roughly 70% coding, or make a full transition to PM.I do enjoy the planning, organizing, and communication side of the work, but I’m not sure if I enjoy it more than coding in the long run. I’m also unsure how beneficial this move would be for my overall career. Is project management a good long-term path coming from a development background? If I end up not liking it, is it realistic to move back into a coding role later, or would that hurt my career?I’d really appreciate hearing from people who’ve made a similar transition, or from anyone who’s seen this kind of move work out (or not) in practice. Thanks in advance for any advice.",
