Totally flexible.**What you’d get out of it:*** Hearing how other people think about DE problems* Learning stuff that doesn’t always come up in day-to-day work* Getting exposure to different career paths and ways of working* Practical ideas you can actually use**Some topics I’m especially interested in:*** Performance and scaling* Systems thinking* Data platforms and infrastructure* FinOps / cost awareness* Reliability, observability, and ops* Architecture tradeoffs (build vs buy, etc.)* How data stacks evolve as companies growThis is mainly for early-to-mid career folks, but anyone curious is welcome.

I spent the weekend preparing the slides, attended the final meeting, and presented to six people. The presentation went very well. However, a month later, I was informed by the recruiter that the hiring process had been paused. After that experience, I decided not to accept take-home assignments again.Unfortunately, I made the same mistake again recently. After a phone screening with fairly basic questions, I was given a take-home assignment. It was described as a prototype, expected to take only a few hours, with up to a week to complete. They also said it didn’t need to be fully finished, as long as I explained what I would do with more time.I was genuinely interested in the company, so I spent two full days working on it and submitted what I had. The feedback came back saying it wasn’t at the level they expected and that more work was needed, so they decided not to move forward. From the comments, it was clearly not a “few hours” task, it was closer to a full week of work and would require paid cloud resources. What is your opinion?",

        "author": "kingjokiki",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In almost every company that I've worked at (mid to large enterprises), we faced many issues with \"the source of truth\" due to any number of reasons, such as inconsistent logic applied to reporting, siloed data access and information, and others. If a business user came back with a claim that our reports were inaccurate due to comparisons with other sources, we would potentially spend hours trying to track the lineage of the data and compare any transformations/logic applied to pinpoint exactly where the discrepancies happen.I've been building a tool on the side that could help mitigate this by auto-ingesting metadata from different database and BI sources, and tracking lineage and allowing a better way to view everything at a high-level.But as I was building it, I realized that it was similar to a lightweight version of a Data Catalog. That got me wondering why more organizations don't use a Data Catalog to keep their data assets organized and tie in the business definitions to those assets in an attempt to create a source of truth. I have actually never worked within a data team that had a formatlized data catalog; we would just do everything including data dictionaries and business glossaries in excel sheets if there was a strong business request, but obviously those would quickly become stale.**What's been your experience with Data Catalog? If your organization doesn't use one, then why not (apart from the typically high cost)?**My guess is the maintenance factor as it could be a nightmare maintaining updated business context to changing metadata especially in orgs without a specialized data governance steward or similar. I also don't see alot of business users using it if the software isn't intuitive, and general tool fatigue.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I was reading through Kimballs warehouse toolkit, and it gives this beautiful picture of a central collection of conformed dimensional models that represent the company as a whole. I love it, but it also feels so central that I can't imagine a modern ML practice surviving with it.I'm a data scientist, and when I think about a question like \"how could I incorporate the weather into my forecast?\" my gut is to schedule daily api requests and dump those as tables in some warehouse, followed by pushing a change to a dbt project to model the weather measurements with the rest of my features. The idea of needing to connect with a central team of architects to make sure we 'conform along the dimensional warehouse bus' just so I can study the weather feels ridiculous. Dataset curation and feature engineering would likely just die. On the flip side, once the platform needs to display both the dataset and the inferences to the client as a finished product, then of course the model would have to get conformed with the other data and be secure in production.On the other end of the extreme from Kimballs central design, I've seen mentions of companies opening up dbt models for all analysts to push using the staged datasets as sources. This looks like an equally big nightmare, with a hundred under-skilled math people pushing thousands of expensive models, many of which would achieve relatively the same thing with minor differences and numerous unchecked data quality problems, different interpretations of data, confusion on different representations from the different datasets, I can't imagine this being a good idea.In the middle, I've heard people mention the Mesh design of having different groups manages their warehouses. So analytics could set up its own warehouse for building ML features and a maybe a central team helps coordinate the different teams data models to be coherent. One difficulty that comes to mind is if a healthy fact table in one teams warehouse is desired for modeling and analysis by another team, spinning up a job to extract and load a healthy model from one warehouse to another is silly, and it also makes one groups operation quietly dependent on the other groups maintenance of that table.There seems to be a tug-of-war on the spectrum between agility and coherent governance. I truly don't know what the ideal state should look like for a company. To some extent, it could even be company specific. If you're too small to have a central data platform team, then could you even conceive of Kimballs design? I would really love to hear thoughts and experiences.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,I am building a databricks notebook that joins roughly 6 tables into a main table. Some joins require some of the main table, whilst other joins will use the whole main table. Each join table has a few keys.My question is what is the best architecture to perform the join without having an out of memory / stack overflow error? Currently I have written a linear script which sequentially goes through each table and does the join. This is slow and confusing to look at. As such other developers cannot make sense of the code (despite me adding comments) and im the main point of contact.Solutions tried:* I had tried to write a function that performs multiple joins using a while loop. However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error. Sometimes i get a driver error and the whole notebook fails to continue to run.* I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persisted. As such we had to roll back to the linear way i wrote before.* I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impact.* Caching after some joins but problem persists. Other information:* Small tables - row count roughly 50-100* main table - as of now row count roughly 50k* join type - left join on main table * All tables are already cleansed and are delta tables * Technologies: databricks, pyspark, ADF, ADLSSide question: I used to be a software engineer and now moved to being a data engineer. Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without? in terms of time complexity and clean code writing? My assumption is the former but after a few months of writing pyspark code i believe the correct answer is the latter? Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?",

MinIo (I don't want to pay for Amazon s3 storage so I'm simulating it using minio. I have 3 buckets landing, bronze and silver)3. Apache airflow (its monitoring the landing bucket and when a file is uploaded it calls diferent scripts if the name of the script starts with tc it start the pipeline for data catalog file if it start with atus it calls the pipeline for processing the data files with the accidents records any other name just move it to bronze bucket.On the silver quality I implemented a delta lake 4 dimension tables and 1 for the facts.My question is how con I improve this proyect so it stand out more for the recruiter and also that I can learn more. I know that maybe I did overkill for som parts of the proyect but I did it to practice what I'm learning.

Please be aware of:* merge() is not implemented in this version* DuckDB doesn’t allow mixed types like Pandas does, so you may need to clean messy CSVs before using them.* Currently optimized for reading and analyzing. Writing back to Parquet/CSV works by converting to Pandas first.* Advanced methods (rolling, ewm) will fall back to standard Pandas, which may defeat the memory savings. Stick to groupby, filter, and agg for now.Any feedback on handling more complex operations like merge() efficiently without breaking the lazy evaluation chain is appreciated.**Links:*** PyPI: pip install pdboost* GitHub: [https://github.com/ashish-002/pdboost](https://github.com/ashish-002/pdboost)It’s still early (v0.1.2), so I’m open to suggestions.

        "content": "Hi everyone! I was recently fortunate enough to land a Data Engineering internship at Meta this summer and wanted to ask for advice on how best to prepare.I’m currently a junior in undergrad with a background primarily in software engineering and ML-oriented work. Through research and projects, I’ve worked on automating ML preprocessing pipelines, data cleaning, and generating structured datasets (e.g., CSV outputs), so I have some exposure to data workflows. That said, I know production-scale data engineering is a very different challenge, and I’d like to be intentional about my preparation.From what I’ve read, Meta’s approach to data engineering is fairly unique compared to many other companies (heavy SQL usage, large-scale analytics), and a lot of internal tooling. Right now, I’m working through the dataexpert .io free bootcamp, which has been helpful, but I’m hoping to supplement it with additional resources or projects that more closely resemble the work I’ll be doing on the job.Ideally, I’d like to build a realistic end-to-end project, something along the lines of:* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)* Extracting data from multiple sources* Building a DAG-based pipeline* Surfacing insights through a dashboard# Questions:1. For those who’ve done Data Engineering at Meta (or similar companies), what skills mattered most day-to-day?2. Are there any tools, paradigms, or core concepts you’d recommend focusing on ahead of time (especially knowing Meta uses a largely internal stack)?3. On the analytical side, what’s the best way to build intuition, should I try setting up my own data warehouse, or focus more on analysis and dashboards using public datasets?4. Based on what I described, do you have any project ideas or recommendations that would be especially good prep?For reference I am not sure which team I am yet and I have roughly 5 months to prep (starts in May)",

On the other hand, you need visibility into the information (metadata) about that data, which is what a data catalog provides. This is usually in one solution package.

I've been asked to develop a method to allow internal users to upload files to S3 so that we can ingest them to Snowflake or SQL Server.At the moment this has been handled using Storage Gateway and giving users access to the file share that they can treat as a Network Drive. But this has caused some issues with file locking / syncing when S3 Events are used to trigger Lambdas.As alternatives, I've looked at AWS Transfer Family Web Apps / SFTP - however this seems to require additional set up (such as VPCs or users needing to use desktop apps like FileZilla for access).I've also looked at Storage Browser for S3, though it seems this would need to be embedded into an existing application rather than used as a standalone solution, and authentication would need to be handled separately.Am I missing something obvious here? Is there a simpler way of doing this in AWS? I'd be interested to hear how others have done this in AWS - securely allowing internal users to upload files to S3 as a landing zone for data to be ingested?",

        "content": "I built an open source stream processing engine in Rust. The idea is simple: when you don't need the overhead of managing clusters and configs for straightforward streaming scenarios, why deal with it?It runs as a single binary, uses 50-100MB of memory, starts in milliseconds, and handles 1M+ events/sec. No Kubernetes, no JVM, no Kafka cluster required. Just write SQL and run.To be clear, this isn't meant to replace Flink at massive scale. If you need hundreds of connectors or multi-million event throughput across a distributed cluster, Flink is the right tool. EventFlux is for simpler deployments where SQL-first development and minimal infrastructure matter more.GitHub: [https://github.com/eventflux-io/engine](https://github.com/eventflux-io/engine) Feedback appreciated!",

One thing that’s consistently been a pain for me is monitoring: Airflow doesn’t give me a great way to track errors across DAGs/runs/environments, and setting up alerts with the included stats+prometheus always turns into a mini-project.I tried the usual stuff:* Airflow UI + logs + retries (fine for one-off debugging, rough for patterns)* The common open-source Airflow + Grafana dashboards (I spent time wiring it up… then basically never used it)* Sentry (I love Sentry as a SWE, and Airflow has integrations), but it still felt awkward because Sentry doesn’t really build around the concepts of DAGs in the way I wanted, and I’d often end up with noisy/irrelevant errors + not enough context to quickly group recurring failuresSo I built a self-hosted solution for myself (planning to open source it soon) with these features:* 100% self-hosted: no data leaves your servers* Easy install (Docker Compose + a lightweight Python SDK alongside Airflow)* Operator-aware metrics: automatically integrate with popular operators to collect useful signals (e.g., row counts for SQL/dbt-ish tasks, file sizes/counts for S3-style tasks, etc.)* Custom metrics in-code: a simple syntax to emit your own metrics right inside Airflow tasks when you need it* Error tracking across DAGs + environments: aggregate/fingerprint failures so recurring issues are obvious (and you can fix them before they hit prod)* Built-in alerting focused on data issues (currently: row count drops, schema changes, unexpected null counts)* Notifications via SMTP or Resend (e.g., new errors / alert triggers)* A modern and lightweight dashboard (Next.js)Is this something other people are interested in, or did I just solve a \"me problem\"? Are there any features or integrated alerts that would make this worth your while?Cheers",

But this is slow compared to when I work on pure python projects in PyCharm, which take full advantage of claude code.I'm using git folders and my code is checked into source control, but I'm not using an IDE when developing in databricks. I just use the web UI.What I would like to set up is:\\- claude knows all steps in my pipeline (maybe by exporting the pipeline using 'view as code') \\- claude can see the latest files and understand the types involved, etc \\- bonus: claude can access some tables in read only modeMy hunch is I need to use VS code with the databricks extension so that I'm in a legit IDE rather than the Databricks UI. But I'm not used to testing notebooks, etc with that setup. Also, to keep the pipeline definition up to date I will need to export that manually and add it to source control when there are changes.",

No malicious intent, just agents chaining requests in ways we didn't anticipate.Security is asking for audit trails, compliance wants to know exactly what each agent can access, and I'm realizing we have zero visibility into agent to agent communication. Feels like we're back to microservices problems but worse because these things make their own decisions. How is everyone else handling this?",

        "content": "I’ve been programming for almost two years, completely self taught, and for a long time I was convinced the “aha” moment people talk about just wasn’t going to happen for me. Coding anything felt like nonstop friction. Forgetting syntax, confused about how to use a given framework, not knowing why something works even when I'm able to get it working, and constantly needing help just to move forward, it felt like this every step for a long time.Recently, something finally clicked. I can sit down, think through a problem, and actually build the solution without feeling like I’m fighting the language or tools the entire time. One of the biggest changes is how I use documentation now. What used to feel unreadable suddenly makes sense, and I almost always prefer reading docs over asking GPT because it’s faster and clearer.I’m still very much a beginner at the end of the day, but programming is finally fun. I can move past small toy programs that are under a thousand lines of code and start building things that feel real and challenging in a good way. Posting this for anyone who’s been stuck wondering if things ever start to feel natural, they do, even if it takes longer than you expect.",

You're not getting a job in this field anytime soon if you're not actively building projects and constantly learning.

        "content": "Post was longer than I expected, TL;DR: High-school level programming experience in Processing/Scratch/Python/Java and 4 weeks experience with C++ about 13 years ago when I was 14. Want to learn programming for game dev. Don't care that they're not entry level languages. Okay, I know, I know, neither of these are beginner friendly at all but honestly I dont care. Im just wanting to learn game dev and I want something I can use for logic that needs to be quick and efficient, like terrain gen, etc. I have some experience in the really basic shit like Processing, Scratch, and Java by taking comp sci in HS but I was an awful student. I also took a 4 week summer camp between my freshman and sophomore years of HS that was for learning simple game dev through C++ but it was REALLY basic and I just made a short 10-minute text adventure. That being said, I have learned about Rust recently and everyone fuckn loves it and I've seen people making some really interesting things with it using its extension for Godot. From my ignorant perspective, C++ seems like a good option to understand more what's going on under the hood, having to manually manage memory and shit, and also has much faster compile times (which ive already experienced when compiling Rust demos in Godot Jesus christ), as well as possibly better job prosepects and translates easier to other languages as I understand Rust is a fairly unique language. With Rust it seems like it's more annoying because you HAVE to handle your memory errors SOMEHOW because the borrow checker thing just doesn't let you fuck that up, as well as maybe being more difficult to understand because of its owner-borrower system or whatever its called, but the whole thing makes sense to me conceptually, not sure how easily I'll be able to implement it tho. (But it seems like it would at least be easier to debug, no?) I've watched videos on both and I haven't been able to find a great answer as to whether one would be better for a beginner. Again, I dont care to learn something more basic, I'm already going to be using plenty of GDScript so I will be learning a simpler language anyway so anything I just simply can't do at my skill level at the moment I'll just fall back on that till I sharpen up with Rust/C++.Appreciate any advice or insight into this question and sorry for the long ass post.",

        "content": "Hey everyone! I just want to share something I’ve been doing for the past month or so. Late 2023 I was dealing with a huge burnout working as a SWE at a bank. So, I decided that I wanted to take a break from the hostile environment and work with other stuff (and enjoy some of my life after uni). The thing is, job market wasn’t so lucky to me. It was (and it still is) hard to even get an interview. So I ended up doing some freelance and gigs all around. But one stuff that was all over my head ever since I finished uni was the famous “imposter syndrome”. And, I got the realisation that I was, in fact, very lucky to land my positions. I always relied on AI to deliver something, didn’t know how to start a project from scratch. So, in November I decided to “start again”. Focusing on getting the basics well and enjoying coding again. And it has been a quite fun journey! In fact, I’m liking studying and trying some stuff. I got a membership on Frontend Masters (mostly because of the algorithm course) and gifted myself with some books for Christmas. I’m relearning (or learning in fact) Javascript, algorithms, some cloud computing (aiming for AWS SAA-CO3) and eager to learn DBs and Golang. Challenges are getting fun again, struggling is getting fun again and, more importantly, learning is getting fun again. I’m still doing some gigs (mostly because I really need the money), but I’m planning on diving deep in interviews at June. But, until then, I’ll enjoy the ride :)",

It worked fine for the happy path, but I realized afterward that I hadn't considered concurrent access, didn't validate inputs, returned mixed types from methods, and used raw dictionaries instead of proper data structures.For those who've made this transition:* How did you develop the instinct to think about edge cases, error handling, and API design automatically?* Were there specific resources, projects, or experiences that accelerated your growth?* How long did it take before writing \"senior-level\" code became natural?What I'm really asking is how to internalize the software engineering mindset so it becomes second nature.Any advice or resources appreciated.",

The Playstation 1 and 2 use MIPS architecture, the Gameboy and GBC use z80, and most modern applications and games use x86-64, which is why I'm torn between the three.I don't have a computer science background and my career isn't anything close to CS unless you count working in excel. I also don't anticipate switching careers. This is purely something I want to do in mh free tkme. I understand basic computer concepts but don't know how to code or program. I've made a few game mods, I can look at code and change a thing or two, and I can locate some stuff in memory to freeze or edit via emulator or CE, but that's probably as close as I've gotten. Anyways, I am wondering if there are any great online courses or books I can follow that are good for people with little to no CS background? I'm torn between x86, MIPS, or z80, but leaning towards x86 since it seems more comprehensive and I would think going from CISC to RISC would be easier than the inverse. I rented the book *Assembly X64 Programming in Easy Steps: Modern Coding for MASM, SSE and AVX* from my library since that was all they had. Not sure how that compares to some of the other resources out there.",

        "content": "so for context, when i was in first/second year of middle school, i meet some people who were good with pc's / know how to program. I talked to them a bit about it and it managed to get me into programming and learning about pc's and on and off for a few years, i would try and learn C# because i was curious to try and learn how to make a game, and i was into pc's because i wanted to know how pc's work (hardware wise, not software). Fastforward to graduating high school recently (i graduated in june). When it was time for me to pick my future career i decided i wanted to go to computer science (a bit off topic but i was also into music, specifically playing the guitar and wanting to learn about music theory, and i like to learn to draw) and even though i was into those other hobbies, i picked computer science because i thought i could make some decent money from it, however thats when things went down the hill. When i first started, things weren't too hard, i managed to understand some early stuff. I was learning C++ and general computer theory, and when it came to computer theory i was good at it, because in my mind it was easy. Then when November / December came, everything just didnt make sense. I couldnt even pay attention in classes because i just couldnt understand it and when i try and learning it on my own i still couldnt get it. It got pretty bad because i would cry many nights and being constantly stressed at me not understanding the subjects and that i didnt want to fail my classes. Eventually my school finally had christmas holidays and im still having them as im writing this, but yesterday or before yesterday (it was on jan 2) i got an email from two of my professors (one for programming and another for computer theory) where the computer theory would make a test on things that we learnt for a bit before christmas holidays and from my programming teacher where we would get a midterm on stuff we did from november / december. At that point i just started breaking down because i just dont want to go through that awful experience anymore of being constantly worried and stressed, feeling as if i was on the edge, and one screw up would ruin everything for me. So i guess what im asking is should i even continue my course or should i pick a different career for my life (i was thinking of maritime studies because my dad is an expert in maritime since he worked for 40+ years in it) at this point, im lost and i dont know what to do with my future.thanks for anyone who read the whole essay of a post. But to give a TLDR version: was into computers since middle school, graduated high school, got into compsci for my career, in the beginning understood the material but later i didnt get it, started having panic attacks and stress, dont know what to do.",

Most junior roles seem to be for fresh IT graduates, and starting from zero at my age feels almost impossible.The hardest part is that there *is* progress, but it doesn’t feel real.Half a year of work, more knowledge, more understanding — but no visible or material result yet.AI and the current state of IT make things even more confusing.Does it still make sense to learn coding?Are junior positions still real?There are tons of job postings, but almost no replies.Even in my previous field, things don’t look great.I honestly don’t know if the world is going in the wrong direction or if I’m doing something wrong.With the new year starting, I want to reset mentally.Find at least some kind of job to stabilize things, and continue programming more as a hobby for now.I want to try to finish a project and publish it to the App Store, even though it’s not easy right now.I also have a Raspberry Pi lying around, so maybe I’ll build something simple with hardware and AI vision.At least to see if this can move me closer to the kind of work I want to do, without a degree and years of experience in a field I didn’t start in earlier.Wishing everyone in the new year some progress on their path.Not necessarily big achievements, but at least small and real ones.",

        "author": "Existing_Steak",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I am trying to learn programming and have a question about frameworks/programming languages.I have made a simple HTTP-based API in both python (using fastAPI) and java (using Spring Boot).In fastAPI framework, I notice that I mainly write functions which are either passed in as parameters into other functions or called by other functions. To me, this makes sense from my perspective, or at least feels intuitive. I can literally see the programming \"primitives\" I wrote interacting with each other in my source code. For example, I build an endpoint like```python@APIRouter().get(\"/blah\")def get_blah(): return \"blah\"```then I must tell my main FastAPI() object about the routes using `.include_router()`. Nice. I can also somewhat imagine whats going on in my head, like the `APIRouter` object has some record of all the routes I defined via the decorator and that object is being passed to my `FastAPI()` object.Spring Boot, on the other hand, I notice that I create classes, and some of these classes are never instantiated! At least they're certainly never called in my source code. I can run my application with Gradle and the class I created that was never instantiated actually did something. E.g., I make this class```java@RestControllerpublic class TextController { @GetMapping(\"/texts\") public List getTexts() { return service.getTexts(); }}```but I never wrote \"TextController blah = new TextController()\" anywhere?Like, I feel more in control of my FastAPI application than I do with my Spring application? Do others feel like this? Do I just chalk up the framework differences to \"thats how the authors who designed each framework intended it to be\"?",

        "content": "Just wrapped up a month-long project using C++, SDL2, and ImGui. I set out to make a simple app that has the very basic features of Lightroom, but I quickly realized that architecture is a completely different beast than programming the logic. It only does the bare minimum of what I originally planned, and I’m struggling with the feeling that I should have pushed harder. But at this point, the passion for this specific codebase is gone, and I just want to move on.I learned a lot about the build process and package management, but the codebase ended up as a bit of a spaghetti mess. I’m at the point where I’ve learned enough to see exactly why my current design is flawed, which makes it feel impossible to keep working on it without a 100% rewrite.I underestimated how hard it would be to design the software. It took me a while to actually set all the dependencies up. Then came writing the pipeline for it to actually be usable. But with each thing I added, I realized another thing had to be fixed or improved. By the time I had implemented the basic features, I'd gone through countless rewrites. Despite my efforts to keep it as decoupled as I could, the codebase was never as clean as I had wanted it to be.I don't exactly regret making this project since I learned a lot from it. However, I feel like I'd feel a lot better right now if I put that effort elsewhere, or if I actually completed all the features I'd planned on implementing. But I just can't bring myself to work on it any longer. If I want it to be well made then I would have to rewrite the whole thing. It also sucks because as shallow of a reason as it may be, I was looking forward to having something to show off on my GitHub :(",

I'm trying to understand what's going on line by line.... but it always trips me up. Perhaps it's the \"stacks\" (recursion)? Allegedly this is the code. def divide(arr): if len(arr) <= 1: return arr mid = len(arr) // 2 left = arr[:mid] right = arr[mid:] left_sorted = divide(left) right_sorted = divide(right) return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)What I understand so far is the obvious. We are storing the first half (left), and the second half (right) in arrays.But apparently, all the magic is happening here: `left_sorted = divide(left)` `right_sorted = divide(right)` `return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)` When I print those values, the output is`[3] [7]``[1] [9]``None None``[2] [5]``[8] [6]``[4] None``None None``None None` aaand I'm officially lost here.My brain is trying to run this line by line. But I can'tHow is it getting each element? How is it also running the method for each of them?it's calling divide() twice, back to back.Can someone help me write my own divide method? Maybe that way I can figure it out. Or at least a better explanation?At first I was going to skip it, but the udemy course does things in increasing difficulty. It went: Bubble Sort -> Selection Sort -> Insertion Sort -> Merge Sort (current), then after this is Quick Sort, which is also recursion.So I need to master this.....Thanks!",

I grew up around computers and coding/programming was always something that sparked my interest. For the most part i am a complete beginner and in the process of cleaning up on HTML CSS, and eventually learning JS.I want to give myself over a year to get to grips with stuff and try it all out, but obviously,y if it takes longer, it takes longer. My main question is, how is the industry really? I presume it all depends on the company you are working for, etc. I am not naive and do realise it will take time and hard work to get somewhere,e and will probably start at a low wage. With my current carreer there is not much progressio,n and that is something that is very important to me, and from the research i did on this topic in this spa,ce you can definitely grow and progress. So i just wanted to hear any advice and/or experiences Thanks in advance.",

Do you have any suggestions on how I should approach learning how to use debugger next? or is this enough for now? what I did was very simple but it felt amazing that I was able to see how each of my variable change, cause I had to imagine it in my mind beforeThank you for your patience.. this field is still very complicated for me so its hard to formulate questions",

SQL, Git & GitHub, Python, AWS, DataBuilt Tool, Data bricks, Apache Airflow.Also for AWS, Data bricks, DBT and Airflow, I’m thinking to do certifications as I believe they’ll add credentials to my profile.I need help and advice on the following please : 1. Does the tech stack and order look good or Do I need to add/remove anything?2. Regarding certifications, I’m a bit confused as both AWS and Data bricks are offering similar kind of certifications. Should I do both or choose one, if one which would be better.3. I have chosen AWS rather than GCP and Azure as I read that AWS has the highest market share among these. I’m open to any suggestions even outside of my questions. Thank you in advance!!",

        "content": "Hello! So I've recently been working on a simple test game with Monogame. After some trial and error, I made a collision detection system based on several parts:\\> under Scenes class, I load textures for obstacles in each scene and create a dictionary to map each scene to the obstacle textures to be drawn. Also created a dictionary to map each texture to its position.\\> in my Map class, I create a 2d array of zeros to represent terrain; then, a method loops thru the dictionary from Scenes, to place 1's on all array elements corresponding to the texture's width&height on the grid.\\> In the map class, I create methods like this for each direction, which are called in the main Update() method later when the arrow key is detected: (EDIT: position and tex1 in CanMoveL() refer to the player)         public bool CanMoveL(Vector2 position, Texture2D tex1)         {             bool check = true;             if (position.X == Xbounds[0]+10)             {                 return false;             }             for (int y = 5; y < tex1.Height-1; y++){                 if (terrain[(int)position.Y+y, (int)position.X +1]==2)                 {                     check = false;                 }             }             return check;         }Note: I know there are built-in detection methods in monogame, but I'm not really interested in refactoring in the best way possible, I just had the objective of figuring it out from scratch in a way that makes sense. But, if you have some ideas on how you would have approached it/whether my method is way too inefficient, I'd be happy to hear them!Mainly, I'm concerned about the loop that looks through each \"row\" of my character's height, seeing if it hits the obstacle when projected. I was thinking of Numpy style slicing but I couldn't figure that out in c#?Secondly, It seems like this method is kinda fragmented, with the scene textures loaded in Scenes, but the actual mapping of them in Maps. Should both those be in Maps?Thanks!",

That makes me wonder whether SvelteKit is mainly intended for cases where you don’t already have a backend.If I already rely entirely on a separate Go backend for APIs and business logic, would plain Svelte with TypeScript be sufficient, or does SvelteKit still provide benefits in this scenario? I’m trying to understand when it makes sense to use Svelte versus SvelteKit, especially for someone coming from a more traditional frontend-backend separation.

Why waste time doing these problems and not throw us into an actual interview, with real problem solving questions and not questions like sudoku solving or raindrops in a bucket, etc, etc. What a joke the SWE position has become. And all of that for you to get laid off? Are you fucking serious? I want to be asked actual technical questions and do an interview based on a real project with issues that I would need to solve in order to get hired, those hold real, actual value and not just \"[Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/description/).\" Anyone can grind out LeetCode problems 24/8, 368 (that's obviously a hyperbole.) and regurgitate their answer in O(my-ass) time complexity and get hired, but can the same people answer actual technical software engineering questions? Probably not because they're so focused on doing every, single problem on the face of planet earth just to get rejected and out-competed by a random guy located in fuck knows where because he did 1 more LeetCode problem than you and that was the one both of them got asked and he did it in some time 0.00000000000000000000000000001ms better than the person that got rejected.

        "content": "I'm concerned over the future of software engineering because what once required deep technical knowledge is now almost entirely automated by AI.LLMs are getting better at creating projects and solving bugs at scale. Even in large code bases, my co-workers and I have fixed complex bugs without manually writing a single line of code. The LLMs understood parts of the project we've never seen before and were able to fix the issues with more holistic approaches.Much less skill is needed for solving problems that used to involve years of study. I'm worried the main three areas (coding, domain knowledge, system design) that made skilled workers more desirable will no longer matter. Now, workers can simply add the domain knowledge to the context window, use well-established system designs, and generate code adhering to standards with existing prompt templates.The knowledge barrier once attracted me to this profession because of the differentation from low skilled labor. I'm considering switching into a different career with more human judgement involved but it feels pointless. Now anyone, including unskilled workers, can automate their tasks well enough without manual coding.I would like guidance on what paths I should considering switching into, or topics of upskilling, if any, that aren't easily replaceable by unskilled laborers overseeing the work of AI.",

I have 5 YOE of experience, and I don’t even code that much and mostly work on design, reviewing designs, or just being in meetings. I have found my self constantly using them to get ideas but one thing for sure, i have to know what I'm asking and what my goals are otherwise i will end up generating code that neither i understand or the agent itself and that's the whole point. It was never about the code but rather knowing what to write and where to write it. I don’t think people understand that if SWE is truly replaceable, then 99.9999% of all non-physical jobs are replaced, and we will be in an apocalyptic world.My assumption is that given we make more than other engineering jobs, this is mostly jealousy and wishing downfall on someone who is doing better than you!!",

        "content": "I'll try to be concise and explain what I mean by \"hiding\" as best I can - bear with me folks.I remember starting my career in the summer of 2024, with hopes that I'll progress into senior after 2-3 years, and maybe go to a different company that aligned more towards my interests.I knew AI was a \"threat\" in terms of reducing the number of engineers (do more with less - the mantra of corporate America, etc.), but didn't really take it seriously.Flash forward 18 months later, and I am taking it much more seriously. I don't think AI will eliminate software engineering, but I do think it'll change the number of people who need to it to achieve very good outcomes. With each iteration and vast amounts of training data, the AI models to get better - and honestly, I'm part of the reason, I have to hold my hands up and say I've used GPT a lot since it came out - it synthesizes anything on Google, SO, documentation, etc. so why not use it to get to the bottom of what I need to know way quicker?And I think this is the general consensus - AI will never do away with software engineering, software will always exist, but it will change who does it, and the number of those people.More relevant in 2026 though is offshoring. For better or for worse, I understand the rationale of offshoring labor, particularly junior positions. Companies exist solely to deliver profits to their shareholders, investing a lot of money into an \"unproven\" college graduate is far less appealing than investing that same amount of money into 3-4 new graduates.So as offshoring accelerates, and AI becomes better and better, I'm \"hiding\". I do my due diligence at work, and I learn what good software is.But no matter how many times I implement a strong observability backbone, no matter how many times I write CDK code and deploy to AWS, no matter how many times I implement authentication middleware, etc. - I have the same feeling that I'm on borrowed time.I'm \"hiding\" in the sense that there will be a time in the future, how soon, I don't know, but there will be a time when my leadership thinks, \"We don't need him anymore\" because I cost them too much, and my work can be consolidated into an offshore option or a senior engineer that is producing more with AI. It'll be a simple decision for them, and honestly I'll be the first to say that their intention aligns with the purpose of a business in the first place, which is to churn a higher profit.But until then, I have no choice but to hide, I can upskill and get as good as I want, and believe me I will try to, but there's going to be an inflection point where I can't hide anymore, and by then who knows what the world will look like.But do any other juniors sort of feel this way, this sort of existential dread, but also acknowledgement that that's sort of the way the cookie crumbles? In the meantime, I hope we can both be grateful for having a job at a time so difficult. Take care, my friends :)",

Seattle, SF, NYC) it comes down to:- more job opportunities- ability to grow a larger networkWith the advent of online applications & speaking to recruiters virtually, many roles aren’t relegated to those living in a specific city anymore. There may be some preference from certain companies to choose locally, but that’s about it.Networking is a big one, but if you were really dedicated to building a solid network, you could do lots of cold outreach on LinkedIn and attend virtual conferences in the industry. Not saying it would be as effective, but the tradeoff of uprooting your whole life and paying a premium (higher COL) just to network a little more efficiently doesn’t seem to weigh in evenly.From people who have moved for these reasons, curious to hear your opinion.",

        "author": "Galaxxius",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I work for a FAANG company as a SWE, 3 YOE, got promoted to mid-level 7 months ago and then switched to a chill team. The work is more boring than I expected coming from a fast-paced, cutting-edge team building brand new services leveraging AI agents to now maintaining legacy services written over a decade ago - very simple services but with high scale (millions of transactions per second).The path to senior engineer here is slim, maybe even non-existent because we already have one on the team and there isn't any real scope in terms of next-level projects for promo. My teammates are also great but not amazingly talented in the sense that there's not a lot for me to learn from them. The pace is slow and the work is quite mundane and nothing to do with AI - it feels like I'm missing the AI wave. So there's minimal career growth here.But apart from that... it's just really good compared to all my previous teams - really nice and fun teammates and manager, love just hanging out with them, we have lunch together everyday, go for outings once or twice a month, play games, talk about a lot of things outside work, the on-call load is very low, no pressure due to relaxed deadlines, excellent work-life balance, minimal meetings, flexible timings, the pay is great, almost guaranteed to be safe from layoffs.... it sometimes feels too good to be true after grinding for the past 3 years on multiple other teams. There's only like 2-4hrs of actual work a day..... and I even look forward to Mondays now (?!)But yet, after many months of relaxing after promo doing not much impactful/interesting work, the itch to do more and grow is back again, especially being young and single with a lot of time to dedicate to work, but I'm not sure if I want to leave something so good in every other aspect... it's hard to come across such gigs over the span of a career and maybe I should just enjoy the chill life while it lasts - but it feels like it'll last forever for this team :) this is like the true definition of rest and vest but maybe I'm too young for that already.So I'm planning to stay at least for a few more months, but not sure after that. I'm also interested in maybe going to a startup, but perhaps that's best to do once I have 5 YOE and can apply for senior instead of chasing promo here which is quite difficult irrespective of team. I could also try switching internally to a team with better work and better promo prospects but not sure if it's worth giving up all the good things here for career growth - vs. just rest and vest... what would you do in this situation ?",

This salary is great.I recently got a job offer for $250k total comp. The position is hybrid (which honestly I prefer) and is in a low cost of living area as well (different city). I have 2 questions really:1. The likelihood of getting laid off in my current position is very low (never say never though in these times though). Would you all take the almost 100k bump in salary to leave a company like this? It’s worth nothing that my offer is from a company that has done major layoffs (\\\\\\~25-35% of their staff).2. I also kind of lied and said I already live in that new city. I live a short plane ride away. Has anybody done this before? I have 3 weeks to accept the offer and a start date of around mid-Feb. I think I can relocate it time…",

        "content": "I will try to keep this as succinct as possible. I am a senior SWE at my current company (well known unicorn). 7 YOE. I joined a few months back. Prior to this company, I have always been a product dev - like I work on adding features to some microservice, testing it, etc. I have worked on large projects and have been responsible for the design and implementation, but they have all been based on things I had some experience on, or I had some point of contact with whom I could discuss ideas. At this company, I am not working on product. I am working on internal developer tools. For example, this team is instrumenting custom dev container solutions to create remote dev environments. This involves writing shell scripts, understanding daemons / processes. I had a few projects so far, but these have been relatively unrelated and disjointed. For example, I implemented a small improvement to some scripts. I also migrated some CI / CD pipelines from 1 vendor to another. These projects are also always consistently out of my experience. I don't know anything currently about working with daemons / processes and usually I don't have a point of contact to talk to. The work I am doing doesn't necessarily compound on previous work I've done for this team because its so random and disjointed, so its hard to build a mental model of specifically what we own, because I simply do not work on it. I just want to know if this is normal - as a senior SWE should I expect that I am consistently given projects where I have no domain expertise and no point of contact and I should just ramp myself up? FWIW, I did not lie to my manager about my experience. He was part of my interview loop and I was transparent since the beginning with him about my experience within reason. I have told him exactly the types of projects I have worked on.",

        "author": "WistfulHopes",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm 23 years old, and I've had several part time/contract jobs for indie game development studios, and a wealth of programming projects. However, I have never had a full-time job. Unfortunately, my current part-time job has had struggles with finances, leaving me unable to afford paying bills for myself and my long-distance girlfriend without posting on social media begging for donations, even with both of us having part-time jobs. I've been searching for a job as a programmer for 3 years now, with no luck due to the major crash in both the game development and general software scene.I don't have a degree, but I've taught myself programming over the last 5 years and have what I'd consider pretty decent knowledge for a junior. I have 5 years of C++ and Python and 4 years of C#. I'm also quite experienced in Unreal Engine, and to a lesser degree, Unity. Additionally, I am versed in x86 and ARM assembly, as I spend a lot of time reverse engineering binaries in IDA Pro/Ghidra/Binary Ninja. However, I'm struggling to find jobs that meet my relatively lower-level language experience while hiring a junior dev in terms of workplace experience. Game development and malware analysis are probably where I'd do best, and I could definitely handle general software engineering, but the game development scene is obviously fucked, malware analysis jobs are extremely hard to come by, and my skillset doesn't include web development yet. I'd be fine with learning on the job, but it seems that these days, job postings require experience in almost every aspect to begin with.I'm aware that contacts are usually the best way to get a job in this industry, but all of my job-related contacts exist in the game dev sphere, and no one's hiring for roles that I'd meet in that scene at the moment. I don't have much connection to people in general software engineering or malware analysis. I cannot afford to travel even close distance due to lack of funds and physical disability, so I don't have much of a chance going to in-person developer meetups. My parents seem content to keep me stuck inside their house while having me pay rent monthly, so I cannot rely on them for funding or travel.This has obviously been taking a severe toll on my mental state, as I'm struggling to find work that pays me enough to allow me and my girlfriend to survive, let alone move in together. I'm pretty desperate for a job that pays half-decently, and due to my disability I don't think I could physically handle a minimum wage job, never mind the fact that it probably wouldn't be able to pay the bills where I live, around the Seattle area. I'm already barely earning more than minimum wage for where I live to begin with.If anyone is curious, [here's my GitHub page.](http://github.com/WistfulHopes)",

If someone can ask ChatGPT Health that has access to their medical records it might tell them that it’s not necessary leading to less appointments.Interesting nonetheless",

        "content": "Hi all, I’m about to start my first semester in an online masters program (GTech OMSCS) in Spring 2026. I recently graduated with a bachelors in CE and am currently working full time as a SWE. I was hoping to use the degree as a lever into a higher paying / more prestigious swe job. I plan to take 2-3 years to finish the program then apply for new jobs once complete. I’m having some second thoughts about whether my time would be better spent working on personal projects relevant to my desired position instead of the degree. I have a pretty clear target area that I know I could work on side projects for, but I don’t know if this will be taken less seriously than certified courses. For anyone who has been in a similar position as me, do you think the degree was key for boosting your career? (I’m not worried about time commitment differences as I would be working the same in either case. The cost of the program is also not a factor.)Any advice is appreciated!",

I generally love my job—I own features from backend to frontend, write my own Terraform, manage GCP resources, the works. It feels fulfilling to ship stuff that people actually see and use.The problem I’m experiencing is trying to get an internal promotion. I’ve been acting at a Senior level for a while. My manager pushed for my promotion last year, but the Director blocked it because they haven’t heard enough about me to deserve it and my manager cited \"people outside the team don't know me\" (I'm fully remote and introverted, don’t get a lot of opportunities to network). Now my manager wants me to rotate to another team for a quarter just to \"prove visibility\" before they consider the promo again. It feels like moving goalposts and political hoop-jumping, and hasn't been sitting well with me since.Recently, a recruiter reached out to me about a job at a late stage health tech startup, I went through the whole interview process not expecting to get it, but I did receive an offer. I negotiated it up and signed, but now I’m having intense buyer's remorse.* **Positives:** Senior title, good pay bump. Marketable tech stack.* **Negatives:** The work sounds like it could be pretty dry, mostly data processing and generating reports. No Greenfield development and I’d be working in a monorepo. I’m worried I’ll lose that spark I get from building new features for the website.* **Some weirdness:** I’d be reporting to a “manager” who is also an IC on the team. He’s never managed before and is new to interviewing. I’m worried he won’t have the clout to advocate for me or help me grow.Has anyone made a jump like this? Is reporting to a fellow IC on my team a massive red flag?I’m afraid I’m leaving a job I enjoy (mostly) for a place where I’ll be bored and stuck, just for money and to chase a title my current company is gatekeeping.",

Some experience in Android and web dev• 2-year employment gap (hardship + health recovery). Published 2 personal iOS apps during that time• NYC-based resume. Currently in SoCal and planning to relocate elsewhere soonConcerns:• Bay Area: Worried about stiff competition and commute. No CS degree, no FAANG experience, and no car• NYC: Possibly better for my network and commute, but unsure about demand and growth for Swift/iOS• Zero preference on city lifestyle offerings. Career re-entry and long-term growth are most important to meAny input is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much. :)",

No idea. How do I find out? No idea? It feels like our distributed system is so complex that no one knows. We had to severely limit the size of our thread pools because that is how the database is supposed to work most effectively. But if the thread pool queue is filling up what am I supposed to do? I don't see the stress on the database, but there are some errors that we weren't printing out that we are working on surfacing. Then I go to try to talk to other seniors about it or people above me and they kinda give me advice but in the end its me stuck looking through logs and talking to AI about what could possibly happen. I feel like our whole product and codebase is so confusing that no one really knows how to solve this problems. But since I'm the lead on this project, I have to figure it out.

I'm graduating with an unimpressive GPA (around 3.0) from a university that isn't well known for computer science (around #80 on the usnews list). I have no internships. The only CS-related experience on my resume is a couple semesters of frontend-focused undergrad research and a software position for a satellite lab at my school, where I haven't yet written a single line of code. My projects are mostly school projects, and nothing that would stand out too much. I do have several years of non-tech job experience, but I'm not sure how impressive that looks to recruiters.I've worked with most popular programming languages in some capacity (Java, C, Python, JavaScript, etc), but I haven't mastered any. I've also not done any Leetcode practice, so I wouldn't feel confident answering hard interview questions yet.As a freshman majoring in computer science, I really had no idea what I was getting myself into. Even though I was following along with the coursework, I always felt that I was a bit behind my peers in terms of internships, projects, and real-world CS skills. It's taken me too long to recognize how hard it is to find a job as a new grad, and I'm not sure where to go from here. Is it worth grinding for months trying to land a job in this field given how non-competitive my resume looks? Is there even enough time before I graduate? Or should I just switch fields? There's jobs out there that give $55-60k/yr, are much easier to get, and teach you everything you need to know. When I started college, I had dreams of making six figures working from home, but now I really just want to make a livable wage and not hate my job.Sorry for the bit of venting at the end, but any advice is appreciated. And for any freshman reading this, use me as a lesson of what not to do. Just going to class and being average in everything will not set you up for success in this field.",

        "content": "Hello all, I'm facing a bit of a dilemma. So a bit of backstory, I struggled to find internships while in college and was only able to find work in my field after graduating. The only offer I ever received was from Wipro which I \"worked for\" for 2 years. What that boiled down to was training for certificates and joining meetings at 2am that just boiled down to \"any questions?\" Again I was desperate because I had never received offers while my peers in the field were already gaining experience in their own internships. So at one point I'm told I need to move out of my state which the job description never mentioned, so I tell them I can't and I leave. Since then it's been 2 years of me searching for entry level positions to try and start over but I rarely get interviews (once every \\~300 apps). Anyways, I see very negative opinions on Wipro and I'm worried that the reason why I rarely get interviews is because of my association with them. If that's true would it be better if I scrubbed it from my resume and left a 4 year gap? I'm not sure what I should do about this.",

Got laid off in 2017, but just as I was starting to look for a new job, my father unexpectedly passed away, and I had to step away from engineering to help support a family real estate business. I was never really passionate about the business, and frankly had to teach myself everything to make it work. I've been able to keep the business afloat, but just barely, and as I'm looking to get married and have a family soon, I know the income from that business just won't be able to support a family. So I've decided to sell the business and try going back to SWE. The problem is, from what I can tell, the job market is horrible, and it's even worse with an 8 year gap in my resume. My background was primarily as a Java developer, but my last couple years at the trading firm I did a fair amount of work in Spark, so I've decided to lean into the data engineering angle and have been teaching myself modern Spark and cloud computing to brush up on my skills in my free time. I know I will probably have to start back at a level 1 or maybe 2 role given my resume gap, and I've already sent my resume out to a few companies I thought might be a good fit through linkedIn, but have gotten zero calls back. I'm reaching out to the community here to see what everyone's advice is on what I should do to maximize my chances of getting my foot in the door. Should I look for recruiters? Take some sort of certification course? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

I’m comfortable with technical tools, but my preferred role after graduation is data analyst or a tech role that requires minimal coding, rather than heavy software engineering.Given the financial aid situation, time to graduate, and my career goals, I’m trying to decide whether it makes more sense to:•Push through and finish the CS degree, or•Switch to Business Management + CS minor and continue building technical experience on the sideI’d really appreciate any insight from people who’ve faced a similar decision or are working in data/tech roles.

        "content": "**Update: I decided on NYC. Thanks for all the input!Update2: was able to negotiate for slightly higher base!**Hi all! I recently received a full-time offer at a company where I previously interned, but in a different org. The role is best described as analytics engineering (data pipelines, dashboards, some modeling).Offer details:* Base: \\~$105k (about 75% of the band)* Bonus: 10%* Role is listed as 0–2 YOE* No master’s required (I do have one)* Same pay regardless of location* Office options: West Hollywood (LA) or Midtown Manhattan (NYC)I need to choose a location fairly quickly and want to make a decision that makes sense for both lifestyle and long-term growth.# About me / context* Single, 25F* Early-career, no full-time experience yet* Strong academic background (T10 undergrad + top specialized MS; more math/data science, lighter formal CS)* Exploring whether to pivot further into AI engineering or SWE — I’ve built a couple of agentic systems recently and really enjoyed it, though I also recognize I may have only scratched the surface* Very arts-oriented and tend to feed off the energy of my surroundings* Concerts, performing arts, and creative scenes matter a lot to me outside of work* Love warm weather and the beach (would go multiple times a week)I’ve lived full-time in LA (\\~1.5 years) and part-time in the NYC metro area (frequent trips into the city). Toward the end of my time in LA, I started making friends and building more of a social life, but it still doesn’t fully feel like “home.” In contrast, I have longer-term roots in NYC (school, family, and other involvements over the past decade), even though I haven’t lived there full-time before.# How I’m thinking about NYC vs LAAfter looking closely at housing, one clear difference is space vs density:* In NYC, I’d ideally want to live in downtown Manhattan or downtown Brooklyn, which is meaningfully more expensive for the space you get. I’d absolutely need a roommate.* In LA, I could live very close to work in West Hollywood, with more space for the same money. I’d still want a roommate, but it feels less constrained.This doesn’t feel like a good-vs-bad lifestyle decision — more like a tradeoff:* NYC: less space, more density and stimulation, amazing energy, easier access to arts and ambitious people, diversity in industries* LA: more space, easier day-to-day life, amazing weather, and beach access, but sometimes feels slower or understimulatingOne thing I’m genuinely unsure about is whether NYC actually provides more motivation and momentum early in a career, or whether that’s more about finding the right community in either city. I don’t yet have a strong network in either place, so I’m aware my perception may be biased by who I’ve met so far.For future context only (not a third option right now): I’ve also spent a lot of time in San Francisco and could see myself there down the line, especially if I pivot further into tech — so future flexibility is something I’m thinking about — but this decision is strictly NYC vs LA.# Negotiation contextI’m also in the process for two other roles:* One might pay similarly, the other potentially more* Neither is likely to wrap up within the next \\~1.5 weeks, and I may need to sign this offer before thenThis current offer is the best fit in terms of work itself, but I’m unsure how to think about negotiation given:* I’m already \\~75% into the band* I don’t have full-time experience* I do have a master’s, which is more than the role formally requires# My questions1. Given everything above — my career stage, personality, priorities, and the work itself — which city would you choose for me: NYC or LA? Why?2. For people who’ve lived in both, how did each city actually affect your motivation, growth, and day-to-day energy early in your career?3. Negotiation: * Would you negotiate at all in this situation, given I can’t risk losing the offer? * If yes, when is the right time: after receiving the written offer, or only if another offer comes in (even after signing)?Thanks so much — really appreciate any insight. And I apologize for writing this with ChatGPT.",

I’m now looking for gigs in tech that’s not entirely coding (junior spots I guess and yes it would be a salary hit but might be better than staying still here), but still open to leveling up in coding positions itself, is all I can do to upgrade there just projects and leetcode?

I’m not a fan of this because it’s unsustainable and it will deplete my savings since the self employment income is unreliable.Anyway, I have been realizing that I need employment again but these past few months when I check the state of the tech industry it seems like mostly gloom and doom. Throw in how far behind I have fallen these past 3 years and I was already basically only at entry level position - I feel I am probably even more F’d inthe A then most of you guys.I’m hoping someone might help steer me in the right direction, knock some sense into me, or maybe provide a glimmer of hope of a “right path”.My goal:Become full time employed ideally remotely. Remote > Salary. My plan (6-12 month timeline):Get certified in Cybersecurity (studying on Coursera and other sources) and earn an AWS Developer Certificate (to refresh/relearn my prior knowledge).My expected outcome:Gain either an entry level job in Cybersecurity, a DevOps position, or hopefully even a QA role.Is this a legitimate approach or should I be doing something else?

Got hired at the end of first year for one of side projects of community member. Fell in love with coding and worked really hard through the summer. Afterwards got an offer into well-established YC-backed company and currently working there as Software Engineer.And honestly - I love every bit of it. But I see two very big problems at the horizon which am not sure how to tackle yet:\\- Working with AI is too much. Since I started my serious commitment on a very early stage kind of project - I got used to the principle of speed is the key. And because of that I did a lot of coding with AI (cursor). I didn’t cut it off correctly early enough, and now when I am trying to write code on my own - it takes much more time I feel like I am falling out if industry-needed pace. I can’t say that I am vibe-coding, because I am still very responsible for my code, and I know precisely how something is implemented, and I am not doing “Claude pls code feature” as well, but still like I am feeling that I won’t be able to write code if I don’t have access to AI instruments. So there’s my first question. How normal it is? How do you define an edge between AI slob and speed ups that AI can provide?\\- Vector of further development? I am trying to study the stuff beyond my actual responsibilities, and I feel like my next big choice is choice of supplementary skills: doing distribution (sales, marketing, PMF and all that kind of stuff) VS digging deeper into architecture, devops and deeply engineering kinds of topics.Argument of first approach for me are the fact that I can be more independent, but that’s not something I particularly like.Arguments for the second approach are the fact that I love it, but again I love it because I am able to move with fast pace because I have AI. Also, I am not sure how relevant those skills are compared to distribution (e.g Technical guy who can sell is much more desirable part of a startup than just deeply technical guy)Your feedback is very important to me and is truly appropriated",

        "content": "I'm a backend developer with about 3 years of experience. I can solve problems and write code that works, but when I look at code written by senior engineers, there's a clear gap. Mine works but feels fragile in comparison.In a recent interview, I implemented a simple inventory system. It worked fine for the happy path, but I realized after some chatting with ChatGPT that I hadn't considered concurrent access, didn't validate inputs, returned mixed types from methods, and used raw dictionaries instead of proper data structures.For those who've made this transition:* How did you develop the instinct to think about edge cases, error handling, and API design automatically?* Were there specific resources, projects, or experiences that accelerated your growth?* How long did it take before writing \"senior-level\" code became natural?What I'm really asking is how to internalize the software engineering mindset so it becomes second nature.Any advice or resources appreciated.",

I’m not a developer by background, but I have basic scripting knowledge and learned what was needed to get this working.On top of that:I created additional scripts for internal billingParticipated in multiple meetings with Security teams to evaluate and approve the appsActed as the single point of contact for vendors, security, group leaders, and end usersI’m essentially handling this entire project alone, from technical implementation to stakeholder management and ongoing support.I am struggling to find a \"name\" for this role in order to update my CV, since I am not a developer, DevOps, or anything related that I can identify with.(Made a similar post in another subreddit, IAM looks like )",

I subscribed to datacamp so I can practice the assignments and tests from them. I'm also wondering should I go back for my masters?

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "am about to start applying to new jobs again after being at my first job out of school for 4 years. My question is this, if you apply for multiple SWE positions at a company and one recruiter gets back to you first and you start the process but fail at say the 2nd round, if another recruiter for the other position you applied to at the same place reaches out could you just start the process again and hope you get a better problem that you can solve. I am asking this because a few years ago I did this scenario where I went through one cycle and got to the 2nd round but did not pass, then that same week another recruiter for the other position I applied to reached out to start. Being the naive new grad I was, I thought I was being a good boy by being honest and telling the recruiter I had already gone through the process recently and if I could still proceed with his cycle. Obviously he did not let me lol. Looking back I am wondering if I should just keep my mouth shut and not said anything. I know this might vary per company depending on how generic early round interviews and if they keep you in a general pool and then narrowing the team at the end vs a place where each job posting going down separate cycles. I know companies have a cooldown period when you can apply again but I’m wondering if you fail early enough in the cycle could you test your chances again in this scenario.I would appreciate hearing peoples’ experiences on this, thanks!",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m late 20s now, psychology & data science degrees and considering a maths masters.Worked throughout education. Initially started as a IC analyst, later promoted to senior/engineer. I spent the majority of my time at that company in a hybrid technical/leadership role (5 years). Moved to a government department in 2021 as a data scientist, quickly promoted to leading the DS team and worked in senior DS leadership positions since, mostly management responsibilities with some technical data science work. At the moment I wear a lot of hats and am good at everything, but not a specialist in anything. Basically anything remotely linked to data becomes my remit. Plus, a lot of my time gets soaked up in HR issues & firefighting. so I can’t focus as much with being a technical specialist as I am spread thin although I’ve always wanted to progress as a data engineer. I have had a good career with executive level responsibilities and I am wondering if I should just fully pivot into pure leadership now, and maybe make it a goal to get a “head of” or director position in the next few years. I’m hesitant because I still feel fairly young and that I have more to give when it comes to engineering but I’m not sure what the best path is for me. It’s just becoming abundantly clear that I can’t do it all and I probably should narrow my focus. Interested to hear from anyone who made a similar decision and what swayed you.",
