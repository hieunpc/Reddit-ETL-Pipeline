Said in another way, you could (in fact, I do) have jobs that are processing records in batches (everything from the past 24 hrs), BUT the way those jobs are triggered is thru a pub/sub architecture. Meaning its not a a run-at-3-am cron scheduler, but instead events & rules on an aws event bus. So in this example the ""choosing batch"" does not automatically exclude the Event Driven part. Our glue jobs were built to process records in batch, but then we also went back and swapped out the scheduled runs with pub-sub events.... and all of this was done **without touching the glue code...** Batch to streaming is a bigger effort to transition to. Scheduled to event driven is much easier, I do not mind using aws event bridge + step functions. Eventually I'll get around to refreshing quicksight data sets with the same pattern.

Max time is typically 1-15 minutes, depending on the feed. * Once it lands all further processing is typically event-driven leveraging s3 event notifications and parallel processing kubernetes, ecs, lambda, or whatever. * If downstream apps need to run against newly-arriving files, they can subscribe to s3 event notifications for when they do. These can also be translated to load timestamps & ids if the apps want to query the database rather than just read the s3 file. * If downstream apps need to run against a certain newly-arrived period of data (ex: the most recent day/hour/etc) then a specific agent is responsible for periodically querying the data and is solely responsible for dictating when a given period is complete. And then it sends out a sns message and apps can subscribe to that.The net results is that it's extremely resistant to data quality problems from late-arriving data, it delivers data as quickly as it's economically feasible, most of the system is fault-tolerant and self-healing, and you don't have bloated daily processes failing in the middle of the night and lengthy outages, you deploy during the day, you know immediately if there are problems, and it doesn't take 8 hours in the middle of the night to know if the fix worked.",kenfar,2025-11-18 04:29:23,2,dataengineering,t3_1ozu1qq,False,

npatq6c,"I'm curious to hear other approaches as well. We run the entire delivery pipeline in 3 separate git branches (DEV/UAT/PROD). We use tools to change the content and structure of our data so that a push to each branch is idempotent. For example, our transformation layer uses a dbt ci similar to what is described in their [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/continuous-integration) (modified for our specific workflow). Our consumers build either off of UAT or PROD, depending on the stage of the feature we are building for them. Unlike typical git workflows for stateless applications, our data engineers need to merge to each branch sequentially. It looks like this:1) Merge Feature to DEV - check if DEV Environment data passes tests2) Merge Feature to UAT - consumers connect their dashboards/scripts/aimodels to UAT environment and report back on what they need changed3) Merge Feature to PROD - once consumers are happy, we release to prod, which has some additional checks and needs a senior data eng to sign off Major downside of the approach we have not been able to resolve is that PROD/UAT/DEV branches will have a different commit history.",mikeyzzzzzzz,2025-11-17 11:26:10,4,dataengineering,t3_1ozdbcx,False,

If your team includes the DEs, AEs, and DAs then I could see there being a struggle to deliver some layers (medallions) to UAT but not others.

Also thinking in terms of merge strategies, I picture UAT being behind dev. This matters more in a larger org, but dev can move ahead and work on features that are not ready to be UAT-ed.

npqtnte,"OOP really shouldn't be a goal in itself. There are some people (usually from a Java background and sometimes C++) that seem to think all production code must be OOP which it sounds like you have run into. This mindset leads to odd things in Python, like classes with only one method other than init (just write a function) and classes with only static methods (just put the functions in a module).Python often lets you write simple clean code by just putting functions in modules or passing them as arguments without classes. In a lot of DE code, functions are often only run once rather than many times across an application so there is less utility for OOP than there is in SWE.OOP is worth knowing of course. Some examples from the last week I've had is writing my own Operators and Hooks in Airflow which requires you to inherit from various base classes, another would be managing database connections. I have also written code using the connector design pattern to allow easy connections to many different cloud storages for a pipeline.Python is a very loosy goosey language in OOP terms so I'd stick to Python specific resources or you will get confused. I'd recommend ""Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming: Build robust and maintainable software with object-oriented design patterns in Python 3.8"" by Dusty Phillips.

npgnzo1,"Near-real-time? Short answer: Flink.Long answer: I already worked in a setting in which the pattern was trained using scikit-learn (it was a simple classifier that considered 50 dimensions and decided if the event was fraud/not fraud). We packaged it and exposed it through a FastAPI endpoint. It was deployed on k8s with a load balancer for horizontal and elastic scaling. The main app called the endpoint with the payload and we answered with a float (the score). Using FastAPI background tasks, we sent asynchronously the payload, timestamp and score as a JSON to S3 (we could also have published it to Kafka). Then, a small ETL orchestrated by Prefect imported the JSONs into ClickHouse. The API was capable of answering the request in \~100ms. It was fast enough for the small product we had back then.Coming back to Flink: I believe that for usecases that requires statefulness, it is indeed the best solution. You could also use Spark, even though it will very likely be slower. Another good fit is TImeplus/Proton (waaaaaaay easier to setup than Flink, the tradeoff being the flexibility on the choice of the pattern).",palmtree0990,2025-11-18 08:39:47,14,dataengineering,t3_1p01h3l,False,

The company would bill the resources(DEs) at 200-250$/hr to clients, and contracts would generally be 3 months to a year. Contractors were mid-senior DEs and paid 100-225k. Companies were all US but across sectors from retail to tech.aside: Negotiate people!

Crazy reduction in spin up times, validation of flags and savings on cost of spinning up clusters with hundreds of graphics cards for 10 minutes to fail during startup. Lots of data migrations.

Statistical tests (KS, PSI) still work on samples. For categoricals, stratified sampling helps catch rare value changes. For partitioned tables, profile only the latest partition(s) instead of full history.In terms of frequency, I run lightweight profiling (schema, basic stats) on every run, and save detailed stats for a few runs per day. Tier by importance—critical tables every run, others maybe 2–3x daily.I built a profiling tool that does adaptive sampling (random, stratified, top-k) and handles partitions.

However, I find Fivetran make this process easier in many ways.After the data has been loaded, you'll need to transform those raw data into a ready to use data. Maybe it's for user to use it directly (hence, self-serving analytics), or it's for analyst and scientist. To transform them means you will have to create new column or entirely new data from the existing ones.

In your case, that sounds like AP\_Number level, since you want to reprocess specific APs without touching the whole EQP.\*\*On avoiding reprocessing:\*\*Track what you've already processed with metadata (timestamp, checksum, or version) stored somewhere lightweight - could be a simple metadata table in your warehouse, or even a manifest file per batch. When new data arrives, compare against this metadata to determine what's actually new vs. what you can skip.\*\*On the Part\_Number optionality:\*\*Since Parts are optional and variable per AP, I'd process at the AP level and handle Parts within that processing step rather than trying to partition by them.\*\*Alternative approach:\*\*What if you partition by ingestion batch (timestamp when client sends data) rather than by the hierarchical data structure? Each batch could contain multiple EQPs/APs, but you'd process the whole batch as one unit. Downstream, you'd have the full data hierarchy in your warehouse with proper keys for querying.\*\*Question for you:\*\*What drives the need to reprocess individual APs? Is it data corrections from the client, or something else?

npd450q,"You've got a few options here, the right way to go depends on which tradeoffs you'd like to make and the user experience you want to create for the external people accessing the data.* as mentioned in your post, you can expose API endpoints that make the data available. The upside of this is that it's a common pattern that most of your customers will understand. The downside is that they have to write code (ie do work) to get the data out. The shape of the data is limited to what you serve over the API. It also puts a bunch of extraneous load on your servers and db (we've seen APIs be taken down because they were being scraped aggressively for BI purposes).* you can let your customers download CSVs. Like the first option, this will take work on your side to support and operationalize. The upside is that it's a pretty well understood pattern. The downside is that your customers might get annoyed quickly because this is a manual process: if they want data with any kind of regularity, they'll have to do this over and over again.* you can upload the data to an S3 bucket (or other object storage like R2 / GCS) and let your customers read it there. This is similar to giving them access to a database that you own, but gives you better cost and load protection: they'll be using their own compute to read it so it's less likely they'll blow up your bill by reading the data (though they can rack up big egress fees if your dataset is large).* you can share data directly to your customer's database or data warehouse. The upside is that the data shows up directly where they're ready to consume it, and they have to do zero work in order to get the data. It's also much more secure than letting them access your database directly (for example, they can't take your database down by accident by putting undue load on it). The downside is that it can be more or less cumbersome for your team to implement, depending on whether you build it in house or use existing tools. If you decide to use tools for this, assuming your data exists in places other than that RDS instance, you can leverage some of the native sharing functionality of some data warehouses (eg Databricks' Delta Sharing, or Snowflake's Data Sharing).

A lot of the issues you’re describing (stalls, jobs not starting, long refreshes, unclear logs) were real problems in older versions of the product, but shouldn’t be happening today. The one case where we still see this with abctl is when it’s running on a VM that’s below our minimum recommended resources - in that scenario, performance can degrade in exactly the ways you’re describing.The other factor here is your specific use case: Postgres-to-Postgres. Postgres isn’t a great database for moving large amounts of data, so even outside Airbyte, this pattern tends to be slow.Normally I’d suggest our Flex product, which handles these workloads much more gracefully, but I understand you’re looking for something that’s predictable in cost. In that case, I think the best next step is to understand why the Cloud version isn’t performing well for you - since Cloud should not exhibit any of the problems you’re seeing on abctl. If we can diagnose that, there’s a good chance we can get you to something stable without changing tools entirely.If you’re open to it, I’m happy to take a closer look at your Cloud account with our team.

I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and then it took me 6 months to learn to walk again. When I reported back to my job when the surgeon ended my FMLA and I could prove I could descend down 2 flights of stairs in less than a minute, my office was on the 3rd floor of a 5 story building. I had to prove that in case of a fire in the building and couldn't rely on anyone to help me down the stairs. But as I made it back to work after 6 months, my termination papers were waiting for me as they had already replaced me. I say that to say that every in person interview I have ever been to in the last 41 years, I was always offered the job. I've been been to 4 in person interviews this year and none of them have contacted me after I left the building. But all 4 interviews have gone the exact same way that your interview has gone. When I sat down with other employees for a technical review, all 4 interviews with them would ask odd ball questions that had nothing to do with programming. Most of the people I had interviewed with I saw a sheet where they had to google for these odd ball questions. I'm also a back end developer and one question I was asked is how would I use a Friend Class in C#. Now Friend classes are mostly used by testers, not developers. I've never ever used a Friend class in production. But the guy asking the questions wanted an answer, I made up some answer of how I would track down a bug that was happening in a Entity Framework class and returning invalid data. I said I would use the a Friend class to inject various variables into the Framework class to possibly see where the problem is coming from. Now it would really be a lame company to work for if they were using Friend classes in production, and I would bet that they were not. But the guy interviewing me said ""Well, that isn't what we would do."" The interview then ended. The manager would return to the conference room and I would be walked out the building. More than likely it was just a gotcha question to say that we interviewed US citizens and none of them were qualified for the position so we need to apply for more H1B visa holders, or something similar.

It is not even close to being the same.Treat it as a learning experience and understand that preparing for technical interviews is very very different. Remember that interviews are intentionally designed to expose what you *don't* now. Good interviewers rarely focus on what you *do* know. Interviewing is a skill and you should definitely focus on it if those skills are weak.I would actually argue that with these concepts.. the theoretical foundations have to be there, yes, but how it's applied in real world scenarios is far more important. The edge cases, the pragmatic approaches.. the theory only goes so far. And the only thing that matters here is experience. You won't really understand hashing until you've screwed it up. You only really understand securing an API until there you cause an unauthed API incident, etc. Having text book theory about all of these with no real world use is actually worse. Best to be honest and say, ""I don't understand the inner workings entirely, but this is how I have used it, and this is what I learned, found interesting, found tricky..""The other thing you nailed, was your understanding about your communication style. You need to develop clear, concise, confident, vocabulary about these concepts, it has to be second nature.Of course, any seasoned dev can google/stackoverflow/llm the answers and patch something together in a real job context. But can they think and speak on the spot and come up with a clear approach to a complex problem? Interviewers look for ""architectural sense"". Are they just slapping ideas together, or can they actually build and piece together a system, that works? Can they document and write a spec, without help?Your ability to communicate ideas, problems, solutions, and tradeoffs, as a dev is more important than your ability to code. Maybe not at first when you're getting started, but certainly in mid career, and late career, it's everything.There are plenty of resources and courses online to learn about just about everything. It needs to become an obsession on your part, to consume as much knowledge as you can AND then apply it in personal projects, over and over again, from scratch, from frameworks, from everything, until the skills are cemented. It's brutally tough, I get it. There's so much to learn and specialize into.But in this job market and hiring climate, only the obsessed, people who truly love this stuff, will make it.

Messing around with computers, experimenting with viruses (at one point my laptop was full of malware), camping our computer classroom during secondary/high school studies - all of that was interesting for me. So, I went for a degree and I never regret it. Started Bachelor studies when being 28. Graduated when being 32, and then followed it up with Master studies in Cyber security. And working as a junior software developer at the same time.Self-study will not take you far. You do not know what you do not know but what you should know. While in a university professors know what you should know and make you to study it. Even when you do not like it. Yes, you can google ""X roadmap"" or something but this only touches the main topics not tells what exactly you have to learn in it. You can also pick some online bootcamp course, but this only teaches you the very basics that usually is not enough to get hired.With self study your portfolio will be much more generic. You'll be copying the tutorials you are following, writing meaningless calculators. While university studies will introduce you into much more complex topics and also will give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects. Either as part of your course studies, as part of hackathons, part of the computer club or robotics club or such that you might join, or as your Bachelor thesis project. Also, you'll learn all the theory that comes handy later on. Online tutorials and bootcamps show you how to write a functioning simple prototype but they do not tell you why to do it the way you are doing. And often they leave out all kinds of things that will be needed during your work as a software developer.And then there are connections. All your course mates, professors, computer club mates, they can later on help you with finding a job. Most of your course mates graduate and get hired. Some of the professors already are working in different companies while also part time being lecturers in a university. People can give you referrals. You'll get none of that as a self-learner. Now, to the downside of doing these studies: you won't be able to study full time and work full time at the same time. Either your studies will stretch over to 4-6 years, to lower your study load, or you'll have to lower your work load. I was working with 50% load and studying full time. And I run out of all the free time. Sometimes my flatmates (I shared an apartment with other students) found me sleeping in the middle of my notebooks. I feel into sleep while studying. Also, it can cost for you. Where I am from, university studies are free for our citizens. Well, free as long as you are passing your exams and not failing some course. Retaking a course will cost. But in other countries it can be that the studies fully cost money. I will put it so: how will you stand out as a self-learner from the crowd of university graduates, vocational school graduates, and junior developers changing their company? Why a company should hire a self-learner over a guy who has a degree? If you can figure it out for yourself, then sure, go with a self-study.

Because of that, relational algebra, window functions, etc aren't core to the curriculum for this class.* I also intentionally keep the SQL examples **implementation-agnostic**. If all you want to learn is vendor differences, you need to look elsewhere.* For the data types videos, the goal is to give beginners enough intuition to make reasonable design decisions, not to provide an exhaustive catalog of every nuance across engines.* As for NULL semantics, that topic *is* included, but it shows up later because students need some conceptual grounding first. By the time they get there, they’re ready for a deeper discussion of null traps.* As for ""A table is used to represent a single entity"", it helps beginners learn in the 1st lesson. Nuances like junction tables are inappropriate in the 1st lesson, and are covered as the course progresses.These choices are mainly for pacing and approachability, especially for students encountering databases for the first time.

Algorithms, data structures, how hardware and compilers actually work. You don’t need all of it to get started, but the more serious the system gets, the more that knowledge saves you from building something fragile.For job prospects: most junior roles care way more about whether you can solve problems and ship small things.

I quit my old job to move to a major tech hub (this was before I had kids -- it would be much harder to do this now) because, you know, you should go where the money is. And by ""move"" I mean ""sleep on the floor of the one guy I know in this city"".I was very quickly disabused of the notion I'd get hired as a software engineer because 1) I had absolutely no worthwhile experience to speak of, and no one is hiring you off a portfolio.\[0\] 2) I was objectively unqualified, which I can now say with the benefit of hindsight. I wasn't competent enough to understand how actually incompetent I was.After sleeping on my friend's floor for a scary six months of unemployment and failing to get hired as a software engineer, I changed my approach from ""What can I do to get someone to hire me as a software engineer?"" (because that clearly wasn't working) to ""What can I do to get on a path that will allow me to take meaningful steps toward my goal?"" and this basically unlocked everything for me.I made lists of what I deemed the ""right"" companies to facilitate my growth. These were:1. Companies that were smallish but definitely growing. Successful startups or just post-startup-phase companies. Places like this, you're going to get asked to flex out of your zone all the time, and internal mobility is very high relative to the Googles or Metas of the world.2. Companies where software engineering was in the DNA of the company: whether it was a strong engineering brand, or the customers were engineers. I wanted to become a software engineer, so I wanted a place that had software engineering top of mind (ie not like, a photo-sharing app or dog-walking-as-a-service or whatever).And I guess (3): a place where my past background might be at least slightly relevant, to leverage in some way the value of my past life.And from there I made it my goal to get \*any\* role in one of those companies. I would have taken a role in the kitchen.I got hired as a non-technical customer support agent at what was the dream company on my list. And I spent the next few years proving to them that I am awesome and capable of bigger and better things, and after a few years transitioned internally to a software engineering role, which I would have ABSOLUTELY NOT ever been considered for as an external candidate, largely because I was not competent to do the job. It's much, much easier to become competent while you're inside the house. When you're on the outside, you're largely flying blind and it's very very easy to waste energy.

npp1x74,"The value of taking notes isn't the note itself, it's having written it in the first place. You are exercising your mind by writing it.In the industry, documentation is scarce. The point of you writing your documentation is to get you to think about what you're doing in your homework. You're practicing structured thinking and discipline. It's helping you more than you realize.The only reason I write documentation is when I'm publishing an API. Clients rely on accurate documentation when consuming 3rd party code. The documentation is either correct - or it's COMPLETELY DEAD. If your documentation betrays the client, they'll never trust the documentation or the product ever again. You wouldn't, if it were you.Beyond that, there are design documents that describe system architecture at a high level. This is for internal consumption for my colleagues. I don't rely on my own documentation.The last layer of documentation is the source code itself. The program documents itself. Abstraction hides complexity and tells us WHAT - this is the most important; an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. The implementation tells us HOW - and we really don't care. `std::for_each` could be in terms of `for`, `while`, or `goto`, I don't give a fucking shit. Comments in the code tell us WHY, and provides context.Outside of your class requirements, you never write documentation that tells us what the code tells us. If I see: template std::span::iterator median(std::span);I don't need to be told the `median` function computes a median. I need to be told the parameters are a sorted range and the return value is within the range, because I can't express that in code. I need to know the rounding function used, as it's consequential. I don't care how the median is computed, otherwise.There are a TON of bad comments, and they should tickle your intuition that something ain't right. The problem with comments that tell me what the code tells me is who is the authority? The code or the comment? This matters when the code and the comment don't agree - which they usually don't. A comment might be a heading, telling us where we are and what the next segment does. We call those ""functions"". Break your code up. Let the compiler elide the calls and composite the function for you. It's a sign your functions are too big.Another way comments and documentation warn you of bad code is that the whole thing is bad. Getters and setters - ""Gets the thing"", and ""Sets the thing"". Bad sign. Getters and setters are not OOP, if you're busy learning that, they're an anti-pattern. It's a sign of boilerplate - which there should be none. It's redundant. You have a misunderstanding of applied software engineering, and this code can't be justified when there are equal or superior solutions.Use bad documentation as a test for code quality. It takes time and practice, and a development of a deep understanding of idioms, paradigms, patterns, and our craft.

nq0shie,"The short answer is as obvious as it is unhelpful: Experience and training. The long asnwer is: Every single one of us started out this way. The reason I (for example) can read documentation now, is that I have mental models ready. Just yesterday I had to read the cods for a linear algebra crate in rust, and for a database ORM (also in rust). Reading those today feels familiar, and I can anticipate where I am going. I know most of the terms used, I have done the relevant math manually and programmed it before. Everything fits into the models I have built in my brain neatly. Comparing this to when I first started writing ray tracers at university: I just passed linear algebra, and had no pracical experience. Everytime I read an unfamiliar word, I had to go back, and refresh my memory of that specific thing. ""How does XYZ relate to ABC again?"". The more unfamiliar words, concepts and language features you have to keep in your head, the harder it will always be for you to read documentation, or to plan and write complex code. There are basically two ways to learn this stuff: Theoretical and Practical. Theoretical covers stuff like lectures, and classes, but also online courses, reading a book or a tutorial. This can help you gain information a lot faster, since it is (hopefully) well structured and presented in a proper way to learn. Practical is things like coding, but also exercises you would do for class or for a course (or in a book). This will solidify the knowledge you gained from the theoretical part. It also forms shortcuts in your brain. After you have build the third backed with APIs, you will instantly know what to do when you start your fourth. You will have a folder structure figured out, some patterns you want to use, and how to name the endpoints. This is the type of knowledge you only get by implementing the same concept repeatadly, you cannot really get this from theory alone (and people who only got this from theory alone most often have really weird, and mostly impactical, solutions to certain problems)",Beregolas,2025-11-21 13:54:22,4,learnprogramming,t3_1p2yq3a,False,

I'd be like ""fucked if I know what'll hold"" because I don't do that kind of stuff often.

nqb8wp6,"You haven't said anything about what sort of languages or frameworks you are already working in. There are many (many, many) ways to accomplish this, so it's hard to give a good recommendation without it.I will recommend Python for the programming language, Flask for the web framework, and Waitress for the server. Python is about the simplest language to learn, Flask provides tools for building a web service in Python, and Waitress acts as a go-between to accept browser requests, turn them into calls to your program, and send the results back again. I would also recommend Flask-RESTful (I would structure the form submission as a REST API call). All of these have very good documentation.Note that as a security measure Waitress only responds to the 127.0.0.1 interface (your local-machine loopback) and cannot bind to ports under 1024, so you would usually bind to port 8000 or 8080. For local testing or demonstration this is quite sufficient; if you want to serve pages to other machines, you would usually install nginx as a reverse proxy.Your laptop very likely already has Python installed, but it is a good idea to make sure it is up to date. If you open a command-line window and run ""python -V"" it should respond with something like ""Python 3.12.3"". The current stable version is 3.14.0, and that is the one you should be running unless there is some specific reason you can't. (On Windows! On Mac or Linux, don't go monkeying with the system-provided version.)It is recommended to start by setting up a virtual environment, to prevent something you're adding from interfering with things you've already installed. You can do this by running ""python -m venv my_app"" followed by ""my_app\Scripts\activate"". You can now install the modules by running ""pip install Flask flask-restful waitress"" and start work.Check the Flask getting-started docs; it will walk you through writing a minimal web app. Use templates; you can probably drop most of your existing html code into template files and use it from there with minimal modification and without cluttering up your code. Check the Waitress docs; they will show you how to call your app and get it running. Try to keep everything as simple as possible until you get a minimal version up and running; you can always gild it later.Good luck! :four_leaf_clover:",Veterinarian_Scared,2025-11-23 05:10:26,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p46r8t,False,
nqcxls4,"For what you are asking to do, there isn't much special about a server.Your laptop is a PC and is perfectly capable of being both the server and the client for what you are proposing.There are lots of things you can do to make it more ubiquitous- for example if you could get a static IP allocated and have it added to a DNS, you could look it up from any computer using the network name (e.g. https://www.myserver.com/).But if you can't do that (the more likely scenario) you can just look up its dynamically allocated IP address and use that instead (e.g. https://1.2.3.4/ or whatever address you are assigned in place of 1.2.3.4).More importantly if you want people to access your server running on your laptop from another computer you will almost certainly need to open the port that the server is listening on.For example, let's say you setup a ""web site"" using apache tomcat on your laptop. Apache tomcat, by default listens on port 8080 (for unencrypted traffic and 8443 for https if memory serves). So, if you opened up your browser and entered http://localhost:8080/mystery, then assuming your web app is called ""mystery"" you should see the index.html (or index.jsp) of your site.Now if you determine that your IP is 1.2.3.4 (it won't be, but let's assume it is) you could go to another PC and enter http://1.2.3.4:8080/mystery then you will likely get a ""host refused connection"" error. This is because the firewall on your laptop isn't allowing anything from the outside to get through - unless you set up the firewall to allow external traffic using port 8080 (or 8443 if you want https) to get through...Note, if you do open any ports, only open the one or two that you allow and when you are done close them. In fact I would open them when I needed them to be open and close them once I've done the demo from the other computer.There are plenty of other potential things you may need to take into account. For example, it will be much easier if both computers are in the same ""subnet"". If you don't know what that means, then just connect to the same wifi AP and hope that the configurations are such that they connect to the same subnet (e.g. try not to use a professors laptop and your student laptop - this is unlikely to be an issue as it is unlikely that there will be such configuration issues, but you never know for sure unless you try it and know what to look for when it doesn't work on some computers ).",gm310509,2025-11-23 14:08:18,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p46r8t,False,

When you write a program, there are typically a lot of libraries with commonplace code you're using (iostream in C++ for example). If like, 4/5 programs on your computer are using iostream, it kinda makes no sense for each program to store it individually, right? That wastes a ton of space. The solution is dynamic library files (these are "".so"", or "".dll"" files). A dynamically linked program will be compiled in such a way that when it needs access to a library, it will access the compiled library code at run-time from the library file instead of having it baked into the executable. Of course, you could just bake the library code into the executable as well. That's static linking, and it's common when you're writing a program for a system with limited space. It also means your entire program is all in one piece.As for dynamic/static typing, that's talking about the data being read. All data has ""types"". Data can be an integer, an unsigned integer, a character, a boolean value, a floating point number, a double floating point number, etc. and all of those are stored & interpreted differently by the computer - as far as it's concerned, everything's just 1s and 0s. How does your compiler know which is which? Two solutions:1) You just tell the damn computer what you want. This is static typing. If you want ""i"" to be an ""int"", you fucking call it an ""int"", end of story. It's what you do in C, C++, Java, etc..2) You take a chill pill, and have the compiler/interpreter guess with how the rest of your code uses that variable.

nqeetna,"To add a little more detail, linking relates to calling methods. It’s something you barely think about while coding. You just call one, but how does that actually work? Code is also stored in memory at runtime and instructions have memory addresses (line number offsets from the start of the executable file). To call a method, you create a new stack frame for it on top of the stack, set a return pointer to hold the line you are currently on, then jump to the first line of the function you called. At the end of the function, you set a return variable in the caller’s stack frame and jump back using the return pointer. So, how do you know where to jump? If it’s a method in the same assembly, that’s easy. If it’s in another assembly, you have to determine the jump address. That’s linking. Assemblies have a table of jump addresses at their start so it’s possible to read and set these addresses. Static linkers set this at compile time and if the actual assembly used differs at runtime, interesting things can happen. Dynamic linkers use a runtime to load assemblies and will resolve these jump addresses at that point. Note that virtual methods that support polymorphism have an expanded table of jump addresses by concrete type since they can overload methods. The runtime selects the jump address based on the actual type at runtime. See v-tables for more information.Typing. All memory storage ultimately has a type. It has to since types are literally encoded differently and processed by different cpu components. You can choose to set that type yourself at compile time (statically) or let the runtime take its best guess (dynamic). The later is rarely necessary with objects in languages that support ad-hoc tuples (like js grab bag objects). With primitives or collections of primitives, it’s not a good practice. With types, you want strongly typed code that lets the compiler do as much validation for you as possible. Anything it doesn’t check can still break as an exception at runtime.",Far_Swordfish5729,2025-11-23 18:48:59,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p47j6y,False,

nq8rkx8,"at a high level, there are 2 types of embedded systems. I used to work on large unmanned systems, and we used stuff like PC104 computers with serial ports. The line of code you reference in your question would be an invocation of a library function, and that library function would talk to a driver, and that driver would send voltages out the USB port that produce the required signals to tell a motor to run or an actuator to move or the like, or it might read a camera video stream or a lidar or gps output. This is not much different from coding up a laptop or something, these computers had a full operating system and mouse/keyboard/monitor support for diagnostic efforts and so on. Its 'barely' embedded, in the big picture of that world, but we made many a 'robot' (mostly, unmanned aircraft and later, watercraft) with those tools. The other level is where you do more of that hands on, sometimes actually wiring devices together yourself and sending voltages to them with some agreed upon way, often directly setting an address to a value using a C or assembly like language. I did a lot less of that, as it is slower to produce the product and a lot more weeds to get into for each individual component. For example we had one 'smart' actuator that ran code, but you had to wire it up a certain way to accept a program and then wire it up a different way to run the program installed on it automatically when it got powered on. There was extensive documentation for making that work. I would start with a simulation. keep the stuff that would be hardware isolated so you can replace it, and build a sim where you drive your robot around and have it do the things you want it to do all in just pure desktop code. Then if you want to build it, you can pick out the hardware and change out the isolated code to interface with the motors and sensors and all. We had full simulation for all our vehicles, crude but it got the job done, to test our control systems and such safely in a virtual world.

So you don't need to write four separate checks for the four possible suits.And so on. You can repeat this kind of analysis for each type of hand. For some of the hand types, you will need to examine multiple possibilities, e.g. for two pair, you'll need to check the different possible cards that might make up a pair.

So, how I would've done that is this - I'd create a Card class, so i don't have to store suit and value as a raw dictionary, instead i can assign those to a card's attributes through constructor, e.g.```card1 = Card(:red_heart:, ""Q"")card2 = Card(:red_heart:, ""7"")card3 = Card(:club_suit:, ""J"")```Also, I'd override comparison dunder methods in Card class, so that i can compare two cards like this:```def __eq__(self, other): if self.suit != other.suit: print(""Can't compare cards with different suits"") else: return self.value == other.value```And ""less than"" dunder method, so i can tell if the card has higher or lower value:```def __lt__(self, other): if self.suit != other.suit: print(""Can't compare cards with different suits"") else: return self.value < other.value```I would also wright a method to compare suits, so i can understand how cards relate to each other.And also, think about how you, as a human, identify that you have a flush, for example? You will take a look at you two cards, check their suits, ignoring their value, then you'll take a look at the table to compare those card's suits to the ones that you have on hand, and IF total amount of cards with the same suit is 5 - you have a flush! So all these hands definitions can be converted in to the functions where if all requirements are met - you've got straight, full house etc.",Corbrum,2025-11-23 16:00:41,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p4pbcd,False,

A function that looks for a straight flush, four if a kind, full house, etc. That function would return true or false as well as a score, or just a score where 0 means it is not that kind if hand. The score would be the strength of that hand type for tie breaking. Then, for each player, call those functions in order from strongest to weakest.

Most users have a surplus of compute available at any given moment, but that extra cost adds up quickly for bots.For example, lets use factorization as this compute. The server can take a list of prime numbers, and select 'n' random prime numbers from that list (repeats allowed), quickly compute the product and send it to the client. The client then needs to factor the product into it's prime factors and send those back to the server, which is a lot more work than computing the product.The tricky part there is finding hard enough problems to meaningfully deter bots, but not force users on potato (crappy) computers off your site.",FlamingSea3,2025-11-18 14:35:10,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p04oy2,False,

npg4mly,"The advantage of using stdin/stdout is that you don't need to make your program itself handle errors, finding the file, etc. For example, if you type this at the shell: cat my_input.txt | ./my_awesome_program > my_output.txtThen the shell handles the busywork of finding the input file (and complaining if it isn't found, if it isn't readable, etc.), as well as the same for the output file.The disadvantage, however, if that it's not convenient to use. UNIX pros will have no trouble typing the above command, but after a few times of using it they will probably start to hate it. New users, of course, will be lost trying to type the above.Imagine your program worked like this instead: ./my_awesome_program -o my_output.txt my_input.txtIn general, that's much easier to use, for newbs and pros alike. But of course you'll have to write at minimum some code for processing the arguments (see Python's argparse, for example), and code for opening input files, opening output files, checking for errors, etc. However, such code is definitely reusable across projects, though, so once you've written it once, you can and should reuse it in many different such command-line tools, not only to prevent code rewriting, but also to enforce ""consistency"" in your CLI apps.BTW, even for programs that accept input parameters by naming files, it's a popular convention to also allow an option to read from standard input. This is particularly useful if the input the user wants to process comes from another file. Typically this option is called ""-"": ./some_other_program_that_produces_output | ./my_awesome_program -o out.txt -So in that way of calling the program, the output goes to out.txt, and the input comes from standard input (specified by the - argument for the filename), which we can see comes from some other program (but your program should not know nor care about that). Python's argparse may have an option and/or example for handling this as well (see the manual).",chaotic_thought,2025-11-18 05:35:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1p02uoy,False,

But the more mutable state you have the more bug-prone you inherently are and the harder it is actually parallelize your program, not to mention that people are undisciplined and leak internal state everywhere anyway…And as the video you saw points out OOP=Inheritance+Encapsulation. And inheritance is in general kinda pointless… Composition is better mechanism of abstraction and parametric polymorphism/parametric types (think of C++ templates) are way better way of code reuse, there has been at-least million PLT texts written on this topic, they aren’t that hard to find either.

npig3pr,"Object Oriented Programming is based on an ideology, whereas Functional Programming is based on mathematical principles. I'll tell you right now that FP is consistently smaller, faster, easier to maintain, and scales better than OOP. You REALLY should focus on FP.The principles of OOP do not cause OOP, they come out of OOP as a consequence. So you can use abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance as standalone idioms, or in other paradigms - Functional Programming has all these things, too - and you can still completely miss OOP.OOP is all about message passing. It's also known as the Actor Model of computation, which you might want to read up on. There's an old tome called Theory of Objects you might want to track down and read, you might want to Google Alan Kay and Carl Hewitt. You might also benefit from dabbling in Smalltalk for a bit - Squeak is a modern implementation.---In OOP - you send messages to objects, and the objects decide ENTIRELY how to handle that message.You do not call `car.accelerate();`, you instead create a message, ""I wanna go faster"", and you pass that to the driver, and the driver decides what to do with that. MAYBE they accelerate the car, maybe they maintain a more consistent speed by moving to a less busy lane, maybe they take a shorter route, maybe they're already doing everything they can and have to ignore you.Java doesn't have a message passing interface like Smalltalk an C++ do, but you can build something - make a `Producer` and `Consumer`, both derived from `Runnable`, that share a `Message` queue. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level construct. In C++, it's standard streams.You are giving the object - the actor, autonomy and agency. You are not giving up control. You don't need to command the object what to do and when to do it; it's your object - you built it, you designed it, you've just relocated WHAT and WHEN to somewhere else in your design - when you construct the object. Want a more aggressive driver? Give it more aggressive characteristics as a part of it's construction parameters. Now when you pass it messages, you know it will drive as predictably as you have prescribed.Objects have no public interface beyond the message passing interface, maybe some necessary boilerplate per your language. You don't GET or SET anything - members are implementation details. You don't push or pull information, you can send it messages with new information, or you can submit a question or query and maybe get a response. Normally objects are constructed in terms of other objects. A car that is accelerated - you don't QUERY the car for the speed, the transmission sends a message to the speedometer, which could be a text output, it could be a widget, an analog device, a HUD...So in OOP, you assemble this graph structure of objects as your nodes and message channels as your edges. Your inputs are a source, a monitor, a motor controller, a log file... These are sinks. Things in the middle of the graph can be both sources and sinks - you can make objects that produce their own messages, consume messages, and produce other messages as a response. Perhaps a motor controller is producing heat, speed and power consumption on its own, but also responds to control inputs to speed up or slow down, and acknowledges it received the request.I dunno, use your imagination.OOP is GREAT for graph theory, which means it's great for distributed systems. Bjarne invented C++ because he wanted to build network simulators (could have just done it with a matrix - linear algebra is great for solving for networks), but its performance is quite damningly limited. It's ability to scale is also limited - you can scale your graph horizontally all you want, but eventually the size of the network becomes the most limiting factor and you can't get additional performance.You can abstract any problem into the OOP domain. That doesn't mean it's a good fit. You can make a text character an object and pass it a message asking it to capitalize itself. This is how Smalltalk works, since everything is an object. But consider the overhead... OOP, Smalltalk presumed a smart compiler, an investment in the paradigm could make the object oriented nature compile out, leaving optimal machine code behind. I don't suppose that's flawed, but it would be an investment in this unique programming paradigm. You're basically trying to get the paradigm out of the way so you can get back down to the lambda calculus formula of computation that the program should actually be.So in any of these languages, you can create User Defined Types, as classes certainly are, but that doesn't make them object oriented. Without that autonomous agency, without message passing, it's just more imperative programming, where you're taking direct, explicit control of what happens, when and where.And think about it, once you have an object that accepts messages - you have abstraction aka complexity hiding; you don't know how the object is implemented and you don't care so long as it behaves as it should in lieu of the message. You have encapsulation, which is that bundling of state and functions, aka you can build it internally in terms of stateful behavior. You have polymorphism, which is the ability to interchange any object for any other and they each decide what a message means to them. And you have inheritance, which is an implementation detail, but gives you type hierarchies for when that is sometimes useful.You weren't TRYING for any of that, but you get it for free.",mredding,2025-11-18 16:04:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p05ueo,False,

Not relating to interviews, but to getting deeper and deeper until you loop around and feel that you got nowhere.First of all, wanting to know the fundamentals of everything to the core is not bad, but it is dangerous.You have to realize this is an impossible task, and that should be the most important basis before any action. Nobody knows everything, but many pretend they do, even beginners, beware of gurus and savants, do not compare yourself to them, because you would be comparing yourself to an illusion.Now how to choose, when to dive deep, when to stop, when to not dive at all. I cannot answer that for you. But I can tell you my solution. Focus on projects.I always had this problem, but it never shows up when I have time pressure from a client. When there is time pressure and the main goal is not to learn, it is to get the project done, then I magically start to prioritize things properly.I have side projects with no time pressure, usually they get nowhere, but I do not expect them to.If I am working by myself for myself, I have to create time pressure and reinforce it all the time, or else I get into study loops or refactoring loops or planning loops.My suggestion to you is to not direct your learning toward interviews, at least not as the main focus.

Set a timer for that period of time, like 30min. When it stops, you stop. Add to that initial list of things you planned to research later.You won't memorize everything (and don't need to), and often times simply going through the main material, only learning enough to continue on with said material, will help you build a foundation to reinforce the rabbit holes you'd be digging through later. If you start with the rabbit hole first, then you may wind up with collapsed tunnels as you have nothing to tether that knowledge to. That'll result in digging those same tunnels later, wasting your time.Do just enough to build a basic mental model of the theory and your material. Only focus deeper when you need to.**If you need a different perspective:**Beginners in art require a lot of quantity to produce quality, and as they get more reps, the more quality becomes important. Starting with only one painting that they focus all their quality on often stunts their progress compared to those who've done a healthy mix of both. You're focusing way too much on quality. Lean more towards quantity for now.Programming is solving problems by building solutions, like a trade. You need to build a lot of projects to get better at programming so you have something to tether theory to. Learn what you need to build those projects and occasionally a step beyond, and that experience will reinforce the times you dig deeper.You *can* focus a lot on theory to make *learning how to build projects* a smoother process, but theory isn't the thing that makes you a programmer. Just like how knowing the properties of a hammer, how to make sandpaper, and different types of trees doesn't make a carpenter learn how to build a house, memorizing every definition, theory, syntax, etc, isn't going to be the thing that makes you learn how to build a program.You actually only need very basic theory to start building programs, just like a carpenter can start building incredible things with a hammer, nails, wood, and a saw. Keep to your priorities, as you'll likely be hired as a programmer, not a computer scientist. With that said, **chase the fun**.I actually enjoy digging into things and learning theory/CS concepts, so I like to mainly do that with little bits of project-building sprinkled in.

If we don't control that, then depending on how we know that the external service has been notified (e.g. response, webhook etc.) we could enqueue the state update then, which retries until it succeeds. Or we could hold open and append to a write-ahead log which is usually very fast, then reconcile later. All sorts of possibilities.I haven't seen the setup of course, but my thinking was that the previous (Received?) state + presence of a state update task in the job queue (which can only happen on receipt of confirmation of notification from the external service) is enough info not to re-send the notification, else the state change has succeeded so you wouldn't anyway. A separate flag or an extra state could be used too. Definitely no need for ""sub"" states (within states).",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-11-20 08:39:13,2,learnprogramming,t1_npsqu9j,False,

nqboh18,"Depends. Why do you need em synchronized? What are you actually doing?Regardless, the answer's likely one of Mutex locks or Semaphores. In either case, you're going to have to have threads wait on each other to catch up before continuing.As for what ""synchronizing threads"" means, it means what it does on the tin. Threads don't run at consistent speeds, and they run independently of eachother. This means when you run two threads, the order they finish in can vary at run time, which can be bad if one relies on the result of the other to do its job. This can also result in two threads using the same resource at the same time, even when they shouldn't - imagine two people being able to book the same seat at a movie theatre because they both clicked ""book"" at the same time.To synchronize threads, you give them a way to communicate, and that's where Mutexes & Semephores come in.Mutexes are a shared resource that can either be ""locked"" or ""unlocked"" at any given time. If you wanna use it, you have to lock it so no one else can use it. You also have to unlock it before moving on lest you fuck everyone up.Semephores meanwhile are kind of like hall passes, where mutliple threads can use the semephore at the same time, up to a threshhold; useful less for strict ordering, and more making sure multiple types of thread (ones that involve heavy processing for example) aren't running at the same time, gumming everything up to a standstill.",DTux5249,2025-11-23 07:27:47,8,learnprogramming,t3_1p4ghgl,False,

Learning a little bit of cloud and DevOps wouldn’t hurt either, it’s pretty expected these days. So learn the basis of Azure, AWS, or GCP to the standard that a dev is expected to. You don’t need to go super into the weeds, but get an understanding of CICD Pipelines, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.This is pretty much the bare minimum knowledge for devs with a few years experience nowadays at least for web devs.Do that then study some system design methods (neetcode has videos for it as well as leetcode) and a few DSA questions. Don’t go too overboard on it though like many here will, if you aren’t trying to crack Big Tech, a good chunk of companies don’t even ask leetcode.From there just apply and hope for the best, the market is as good as it was 3-4 years ago.Edit:Biggest thing is probably to not ask this sub for advice, it’s full of unemployed people, students, and sky is falling doomers that can’t see what their weaknesses are",kingofthesqueal,2025-11-23 17:04:30,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1p448bb,False,

Neural networks don't scale very well, and the explosion in their usage from 2010 onwards was basically only enabled by improvements to GPU hardware.Those improvements have plateau'd, both due to shortages of silicon, and due to how little headroom there is to make hardware breakthroughs at the moment. We've basically hit the point of diminishing returns for the everyday consumer and for business use of LLMs and GPT systems.With that in mind, I can't predict the future, but for the time being, LLMs and GPT systems are *a convenient excuse* for the layoffs required in the post-COVID recession conditions. Businesses don't like to scare their shareholders and stakeholders by saying ""the market sucks and we shrunk"", so they spin it as ""we adopted AI, so the 40% reduction in forces is actually 40% efficiency!!!""

A very basic dungeon crawler in threejs2. A starfox-like3. A subway surfer clone with a pirate theme4. Astroids5. A space invaders cloneAll of which are impressive if you've never made them and have no clue how to, but none of which are new or innovative. People have no new ideas and AI is exacerbating that issue because if it has been done before, eventually an AI can be trained on the output and imitate it.",Superb-Composer4846,2025-11-18 21:31:22,19,cscareerquestions,t3_1p0nk34,False,

Downturns just are more in your face about it. - Nothing is permanent. Have a great job? Cool. Enjoy it. It can go away tomorrow. Unemployed? I am so sorry. It sucks. Just keep working on your skills and applying to everything. - Luck is a major factor in literally everything. You could be the best specialist in your field and can't find work.

Determining the numerical sensitivity of an algorithm or function to small floating point perturbations. This would include, notably, numerical linear algebra, which underpins all statistical and machine-learning oriented algorithms.2. Optimization algorithms, in which you study how to find the minimum solution to some equation and/or constraints by using calculus. Would be useful in any industrial engineering-type software.3. Classical Big-O notation, which describes growth rates as a function of input size. Useful for understanding whether your algorithms are prohibitively expensive when scaled up.4. Simulation of physical motion or physical behaviors, as used in computer graphics and visualization, scientific computing, signal processing and other similar physics-oriented domains.In summary, I would say that calculus does indeed play a foundational role in the study of many core CS algorithmic domains. Note that these algorithmic domains don't necessarily have a lot of overlap with the kind of work you might do in industry, unless you're working on cutting edge stuff. But nonetheless if we're strictly talking about computer science as an academic subject, then absolutely yes calculus plays a role.However, if you're talking about very specific techniques in calculus like how to compute certain integrals by various substitutions or other random stuff like that, then no, those skills are mostly ways for students to exercise their quantitative and mental reasoning while learning the concepts.",TheMipchunk,2025-11-19 23:28:44,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1p1n4p3,False,

nqdekb4,"TLDR: Don’t move for less than 300-400k, Consider moving within Canada first. Canadian SWE (6 yoe) current living and working in NYC. From my opinion, it’s only really worth it if you can make significantly high salary, such that you can buy your way out of American problems. This is significantly harder for someone with a family, as your expenses will be higher and you will be impacted by more specific issues than someone who is single (Schools, Health care costs, etc). Even in a lower cost region like Baltimore, I wouldn’t move for anything less than 100-300% salary increase over your Canadian salary. If you’re really committed to this - Don’t focus on the L1-B visa, Consider TN. Apply externally to jobs in cities with tech hubs (SF, NYC, Seattle). With your YOE you should be able to get some decent high paying jobs (200k-400k). These should pay enough for you to support your family with 1 income; so even if your spouse can’t secure a visa, it’s still manageable. - Plan for potential private school expenses. Public education varies based on where you live, so either plan on paying more rent in a high income area or paying for private. - Plan for a short stay. Both L1B and TN are employer tied. So you WILL (not maybe) eventually find yourself having to come back to canada quickly if your employment ends. - The tech market is tough right now, but from what I’ve seen it’s still pretty competitive for senior level roles. Tbh, Consider moving within Canada. There are definitely senior level jobs in Canada that pay way more than 100k, you may just have to move to Toronto or Vancouver.

nqfyuz4,A lot of these aren’t actually really issues but can be if you don’t communicate them. Over 10 years ago I was in the same spot not knowing what to do. Today I still frequently get into these spots. The difference between me back then and now is I communicate much better and know how to learn. Delays? You know beforehand and you call them out when you see them coming. Giving stakeholders a heads up is good. No heads up when people are counting on you is really bad.In general though it sounds like you just need to spend some time so be sure to get AI to summarize docs for you and help you with coding as well. This will limit the number of surprises but surprises always happen. If you never hit surprises then the scope of your work isn’t big enough for you and you’re ready for more challenging work. Not communicating changes in assumptions and no requirements that were found would be a problem but people will give some leeway to new developments that were discovered. Prod issues? Everyone makes these mistakes. I caused one a few months back and even the most senior members of my team have done this too. Again if you haven’t done this then you haven’t worked enough or the scope of your work is too little. It happens to everyone. For these take charge and learn from them. Everyone makes these mistakes and can learn from them. I’m a manager turned IC again and I can say this: you want a good relationship with your manager too so play the political game. The manager is generally on your side because if you do well so does the manager. A lot of these issues can be communicated with the manager to help unblock you. Can’t give estimates right away? Yeah no one really can unless they’re super familiar with the subject matter. When your work becomes more ambiguous as your level goes up these can be more difficult. What I do is I give a large estimate (adding to my current estimate) or tell the people involved when I can provide an estimate and why I can’t I do it now.,Moogra2u,2025-11-23 23:38:21,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1p4an65,False,

I've found that [test driven development](https://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment) or at the very least development where you write a method or two in your classes (assuming you're an OO shop) and then write some tests to test them will highlight deficiencies in your design without you designing a bunch of extra stuff you're never going to need.

A lot of the time older code is heavily coupled and can't really be used outside its existing context, so it can be difficult to do that.Identifying pain points to fix when you have some refactoring time can also be helpful. You can often clean up a bit around code you're working on without it taking too much more time and without impacting a huge amount of the code base.

The third kept acting like they were part of a company trying to get me hired that only happened to recommend so and so, but they continued to push the individual on me every so often with what appeared to be a template.Am I tripping or is this a popular scam I was not aware of?",setdelmar,2025-11-18 17:06:29,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1p067hu,False,
