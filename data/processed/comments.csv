nx2hiqn,"I think Bill is right about the symptoms; however, I think he misidentifies the cause.Modern data architecture has shifted; not because data warehousing is dead, but because it is no longer the only thing organisations need. Today’s platforms have to support analytics, data science, and increasingly AI workloads alongside traditional BI.The criticism of Databricks and Snowflake feels a little unfair; they are not trying to replace data warehousing fundamentals, they are trying to support multiple workloads. Both platforms can absolutely deliver a well-designed data warehouse if the right discipline is applied.In my experience, the real issue is people rather than platforms; there is a strong tendency to chase modern tools and certifications while neglecting core concepts such as data modelling and integration. I regularly see engineers openly say they have no interest in modelling, which I would argue is foundational to being effective in this space.So I agree with the spirit of the post; that we have lost sight of fundamentals. I do not think modern platforms are the culprit; they simply expose gaps in skills and architectural thinking that were always there.",Peanut_-_Power,2026-01-01 12:03:11,143,dataengineering,t3_1q1174f,False,
nx2oa4i,"I think the core issue here is not Databricks or Snowflake. I mostly agree with the other commentator who said the cause is misidentified. In data analytics and engineering the real problems are and always have been people and processes. Technology only enables them. What actually got us here is weak data management and governance.That said, I also partly agree with the criticism. Modern data stack tooling has reached a point where many organizations think that throwing Databricks or Snowflake at every data problem and calling it done is enough. This is especially true in organizations where IT (which should not be the owner of data in the first place) is expected to “fix” data issues. They look for technological solutions to what are, in reality, problems of processes, roles, ownership, and culture. In that sense, the frustration expressed by Inmon is very much understandable.So the concept of the data warehouse did not fail. Technology simply made it easier to avoid the hard work. Vendors and consultants sold a convenient illusion. Integration and enterprise data are not a tooling problem, they are a design choice and an organizational commitment, and a governance problem. Expecting a platform to solve that is exactly the mistake that keeps repeating itself. Blaming modern platforms for the decline of data warehousing feels like blaming a database for poor data modeling.

Like most things, limit it to what you are working on and the level you need it at.Some specifics - Mesh is very much a decentralized approach, though the specifics vary quite a bit based on who you talk to. But in a Mesh environment, pulling a healthy fact table across is what you want to have happen. It allows that cross-group information flow, while minimally impacting either group. Yes, it is a dependency, but point to point isn't bad as long as there aren't too many; at which point you start looking at a central repository for these cross-group objects in place of point-to-point. dbt for all, I agree is not a good ideal and fortunately not one I've come across in the wild.",exjackly,2026-01-02 20:18:12,6,dataengineering,t3_1q22shj,False,

You generate the code to download the historical weather and air quality data (backfilling) into feature groups (tables) and write an incremental pipeline to download weather forecasts, weather observations, and air quality observations. The 1st challenge you will encounter is how to perform a temporal join to join air quality observations with weather observations. This requires an ASOF LEFT JOIN between the tables. Only a few data warehouses support it it (and Hopsworks feature store). You want that data back in Python (e.g., Pandas DataFrames) to train the model. Hopsworks provides that data via Arrow from the Lakehouse tables. If you go via JDBC/ODBC to your data warehouse, performance will be vile - Arrow (ADBC or ArrowFlight) is best for Python clients.My book (referenced in the thread) covers these fundamental skills of backfilling vs incremental pipelines and data models - star schema, snowflake schema data model and OBT (don't use this for ML!).",jpdowlin,2026-01-03 10:02:11,2,dataengineering,t3_1q22shj,False,

nxez9bl,"At my last job I built out a bunch of different ETL pipelines over about 4 years. At different layers of the stack there's different approaches.For custom API extractor's, I wrote the first two as completely separate. Then when I was working on the third, I started by copy-pasting stuff from the first two, looked at where things were identical and put as much of the overlapping code as I could into a library. Then I made all of our future extractors use that library. We were writing them in go so this took the form of an interface which extended `io.reader` that the custom extractor would implement.For loading, using the aforementioned library produced data in a standard format along with a schema file that could be used to generate a snowflake load statement. Then we had a single snowflake load component defined in our task orchestrator which we re-used everywhere, changing only the configuration. (We used argo-workflows as our task orchestrator instead of Airflow. I... don't recommend doing that)And then for transform jobs, I'd conceptually sort them into two categories. 1) Transforms which you can determine programmatically from some sort of metadata. This could be standard transformations you perform on every table like an upsert, or it could be parsing fields out of a JSON document based on a schema. You should generate these SQL statements with code. You can have that code be DBT macros, use code-gen to generate DBT statements, or just generate and run the SQL statements from your application. I'm not a huge fan of abusing DBT macros for stuff like this because I find JINJA to be kind of messy, but a lot of people swear by it. Probably comes down to personal preference. As for having the code that generates the SQL statements also run it, you should avoid this unless you directly benefit from detecting and implementing schema change on-the-fly. Otherwise just having a daily/weekly pull request that you generate with a script is probably fine.2) Custom business logic transformations. I wouldn't do anything special here. If it's in DBT that's enough standardizaiton.Then once you're writing custom transformations you can kind of do whatever you want.

How many columns do your tables have?>I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persistedThat's because that's not how that works. A count statement materializes your dataframe, but it doesn't magically make that dataframe available downstream. That's what caching is for. If you have `myDF.count` and then use do `myDF.join(other, ...)`, Spark will either re-calculate `myDF` entirely (which means your `.count` statement is actually making your code SLOWER by doubling the amount of processing you're doing), or it will intelligently cache the results on its own after seeing that the Dataframe is being re-used, in which case the `.count` still didn't do anything that a cache wouldn't do.TL;DR - don't use `.count` unless you're trying to get the count.

And rows in the left that havent been mapped will then have a new column written as flag and map this to Yes.The errors i get when writing it as a function / loop: The cluster runs out of memory (from my understanding of your point means my execution plan is too large)So for my side question the main point i should be focusing on is how to make sure my execution plan is optimal? is there a guide on this?Edit: just saw your edit regarding looking at the code:So first I get the keys from the mapping df:     valid_keys = (         mapping_df.groupBy(""key"")         .count()         .select(""key"")         .distinct()         .rdd.flatMap(lambda row: row) # we want to flatten to make a list         .collect()     ) I then loop to do the joins:     # Step 2: create a dictionary that only has the join keys that we need     filtered_dict = {k: v for k, v in join_keys.items() if k in valid_keys}     final_matched_df = None     current_df = main_df     for key_name, key_cols in filtered_dict.items():         # Drop output columns from current_df BEFORE the join to give us the filtered df without the output columns         for col_name in output_columns:             if col_name in current_df.columns:                 current_df = current_df.drop(col_name)         # Get the mapping key which is the key + the output columns on the key we are joining by         mapping_key = mapping_df.select(*key_cols,*output_columns).where(col(""key"") == key_name) # return the rows where the keys match         # display(mapping_key) will do join on key 1 then get key 2 then key 3 etc         # We join the mapping key row on the key and get the mapping key which includes key + the output columns         joined_df = current_df.join(mapping_key, on=key_cols,how=""left"")         # get DF which only has the matched rows         matched_df = joined_df.filter(col(""key"").isNotNull())         # Accumulate the DF with the matched data         if final_matched_df is None:             final_matched_df = matched_df         else:             final_matched_df = final_matched_df.unionByName(matched_df)         # Get the unmatched rows for next iteration         current_df = joined_df.filter(col(""key"").isNull())Then i create a flag if a join doesnt occur:     # create the flag     if missing_flag is not None:         final_matched_df = final_matched_df.unionByName(current_df).withColumn(             missing_flag,             when(col('key').isNull(), ""Y"").otherwise(""N""))So this code will be called 6x (one time for each small table)",wei5924,2026-01-05 11:28:52,1,dataengineering,t1_nxsqyqj,True,

You could even write a test for it if you've got that kind of gumption, Trying with specific date ranges that you mentioned the API accepts. Also, if you did a merge statement instead of a copy into (just assuming I guess) on primary key, it would probably fix the dupe issue, even if the API returned everything every time. Seems like that shouldn't be the case though, and is likely a param in the API call that needs to be verified.",Key_Character_3340,2026-01-01 20:19:45,15,dataengineering,t3_1q1dmgz,False,

Will make your pipeline a lot closer to being idempotent and a lot less likely to see double insertions.Means you can run your pipeline in an incremental fashion now in an efficient way (only call the data you need ever X hours in a time period instead of doing a full load every single time), and it also means if you are in need of a full load for whatever reason, you can run the same pipeline one time to backfill.",MikeDoesEverything,2026-01-01 21:37:57,7,dataengineering,t3_1q1dmgz,False,

I was once interviewed by a company that worked primarily with Excel and they'd asked me if I had experience with excel because they needed an excel guy who'd automate the excel routine and they called it a data analyst position but these types of companies never really understand that Excel is a spreadsheet not a database. So in your case, I wouldn't give up on being an analyst, I'd just try to find a job that has a different approach to what you are supposed to do. Otherwise DE will feel the same way in a company that doesn't understand the difference between a BI analyst, an ETL developer or a DE. So it ain't really about switching to another role, it is more about your current employee. And don't underestimate SQL. It is one of the most powerful tools there is in the data world. If you feel stuck with SQL, go and learn PL/SQL or any other procedural language, marvelous things can be done with it once mastered. Like the latest ""marvel"" for me was pg\_clickhouse extension, you basically can query clickhouse from postgresql, build dashboards using just 1 connection.

Change it from ""Schema only"" to ""Schema and data"" (or ""Data only"" if you just want inserts). That will include insert statements for your data.For views and security objects like users/permissions, the wizard sometimes skips them by default. Make sure they’re selected under ""Choose Objects""—expand the tree to manually include your View and Security options. For user permissions, you might have to script those out separately, as SSMS sometimes leaves out the explicit DENY/GRANT statements for users.Once you've done this, your .sql file should include create table statements, insert statements for your data, view definitions, and possibly some user/permission scripts. Double-check the final script to see if everything you need is there—sometimes for things like user permissions, you'll have to supplement with a bit of hand-written SQL at the end.Good luck!

nxz9hn7,Man I feel your pain. We went through almost the exact same thing a few months back. We had a bunch of automated processes scraping data from different sources feeding it into our CRM and then triggering marketing automations. Seemed straightforward enough but then we started seeing weird discrepancies in our reporting and it turned out one of the integrations was pulling in data fields from an older deprecated system that hadn't been properly sanitized. It wasn't a security breach per se but it was definitely a compliance nightmare waiting to happen. Trying to trace that data flow manually was a total disaster. It felt like we were untangling spaghetti and every time we pulled on one strand three more popped up. What really helped us was implementing a virtual data platform that basically acts like an AI data engineer. It was able to map all the data connections identify the data quality issues and flag those unexpected data flows between systems we didn't even realize were happening. Like it showed us this whole chain of dependencies that would have taken weeks for us to figure out on our own. The cool thing is that it didn't require us to move any data around. It just analyzed everything in place and gave us a clear picture of what was going on. Then we used the no-code tools it offered to build agents and workflows that enforced the correct data governance policies and automated the cleanup process. We even built alerts that would fire off if any of the agents tried to access data they weren't supposed to which gave us some peace of mind. Honestly before this our data team was spending all their time firefighting data quality issues and dealing with ad-hoc requests from sales and marketing. Now they're actually working on strategic projects that move the needle. The company that helped us out has a referral program and Id be happy to connect you.

nx7cykl,"Most people responding in this thread are wrong. They’re coming from only their own personal experience and they don’t realize how much variation there actually is between people. I’ve taught software engineering to a couple hundred people. There is a spectrum for what you’re describing. I used to call it rabbit hole vs. fuzziness. Some people are comfortable moving on with just a vague understanding of a topic (these people are “fuzzy” on the details). Others can’t move on until they’ve understood every last piece (they get lost down the rabbit hole). Go too far on the spectrum in either direction and you have problems. In my experience with people learning programming, you run into way more people having problems because they’re too “fuzzy.” But you DO get some people who struggle because they consistently go too far down the rabbit hole — even when working on a specific project, even with a tight deadline. You should 100% address this. I have two tips:First, keep a very dynamic, organized todo list. What I mean is, before you start working on pretty much anything, you should explicitly write out high-level goals and todo items. Generally, what do you aim to accomplish? And what do you think the high-level steps are that you need to take to get there? Then as you work (and get a better sense of what needs to be done on a granular level), start to populate more specific sub todos (nested/indented below the correct parent todo). Cross todo items off as you complete them — and add more as you realize you’re missing them. You should be switching back and forth between doing the work and managing the todo list. Keep the todo list correctly organized in a hierarchy (sub todos indented below the correct parent). This process is helpful for a number of reasons, but in your case the biggest one is it helps keep you focused on the bigger picture. You’re constantly reminded how what you’re doing fits in to getting you to your initially stated goal. That way you’re working toward the goal rather than being distracted by every single thing you don’t totally understand.Keep a separate list of open questions. Writing them down can help you resist the urge to chase down all the answers right away.

nxa9ypm,"A socket is provided by the OS as a means for different processes to communicate, essentially acting like a file handle. You can write to it or read from it to send or receive data. It’s like a mailbox where the OS acts as the mailman and figures out how to transport the mail. Sockets don’t necessarily need an address - e.g. you could have an anonymous socket for communicating between processes on the same computer. In this case, it’s usually held in memory by the OS kernel until the socket is closed. Sockets can also be local-only, and are often bound to a file path so other processes can also go find the socket and send mail to your program.When you’re writing an HTTP server you *do* want an address so that others can send you mail (HTTP requests), so when you bind to a socket with a specific port you’re telling the OS “if you get any letters to this address, stick them in my mailbox.” By binding your socket to a port, you’re giving it an address that is reachable over the network. Otherwise, you couldn’t have a server that just sits and waits for requests - nobody has a way to send your program any requests!Here’s a pretty good [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/D26sUZ6DHNQ) that explains sockets simply and in better detail than many developers ever know or care to learn. In practice, you usually just need to know that it’s a stream of data handled by the OS, very similar to reading/writing files, and how that data is handled beyond that is not really your application’s business. It is helpful to know that sockets usually stay open for a while after you’re done with them (in case the other side has more data to send), and you’re limited in the number of sockets you can create, so it’s prudent to reuse sockets where possible rather than open new ones regularly.",TheRealKidkudi,2026-01-02 17:22:39,111,learnprogramming,t3_1q23wv6,False,

In C it's a number referencing a file descriptor, with syscalls for the defined operations. In Java it's an object (java.net.Socket) with methods for the defined operations. The actual implementation will be via references to data structures in the system's networking stack, which will keep track of addresses and buffers, and handle the encoding and exchange of your data via the system's networking hardware.",high_throughput,2026-01-02 17:21:02,139,learnprogramming,t3_1q23wv6,False,

They were originally made for files, but were adapted for sockets. When you want to write the word ""hello"" to a file that you previously opened and the OS told you it was file #3, you tell the OS ""Write these bytes to file descriptor #3: 68 65 6c 6c 6f"".One interesting decision they made was that if #3 refers to a network connection instead of a file, then *you can still tell the OS to read or write bytes exactly the same way*.A socket isn't a file, but it sort-of acts like one.(UNIX domain sockets are a different beast. I'm not going to discuss them here.)> Is a socket an IP:port combination?No. IP:port combination is a setting you put on the socket for outgoing connections. For incoming connections you set a port; the OS only gives you connections from others requesting that port.

You also need to learn Encapsulation which just means using `private` variables and `public` getter and setter methods to protect your data.**Beginner Project Ideas*** **Number Guessing Game** This is a classic for a reason.

Strong fundamentals age well.Step 2: Build a core base first (3–4 months):One programming language properly (Python / Java / JS — doesn’t matter much)Data structures & basic problem-solvingGit + basic LinuxThis alone puts you ahead of many students.Step 3: Use web dev as a vehicle, not a destination.Web dev isn’t bad — generic web dev is.Build 2–3 small but real projects:CRUD appAuth + databaseSimple APINot to become a “frontend dev”, but to learn how software actually works.Step 4: Let interest emerge from doing, not thinking.Most people don’t “discover” interests — they develop them after building something.After that, you can branch:Backend / systemsData / analyticsDevOps / infraApplied AI (later, not now)Important reality check:AI won’t replace developers who understand systems, trade-offs, and can build things end-to-end.

The first thing I did was get assigned as an extra code reviewer for an MR that was written by a developer experienced in the language. I did my review first, and I had to spend time reading through his code, cross-referencing documentation for the libraries being used, and generally just building my understanding of the code. When the other code reviewers and testers also did their passes, I read their issues to see what I had missed.

The only things you really need to know are how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and maybe a little basic algebra. Many programmers go through their entire career with having to do barely any math at all.> Do note, however, that the answer is a bit different if you are interested in getting a degree in Computer Science. Many universities or colleges will have specific prerequisites you need to fulfill before you can either enter the major or graduate (calculus classes, etc). And, since Computer Science is, to a certain degree, applied mathematics, you will almost certainly end up learning about discrete math, writing proofs and other similar topics while earning your degree.

Methodical, structured, analytical thinking and problem solving skills. Those skills are universally applicable across all programming languages, and, frankly, throughout life as well.So you hone some skills and write a bunch of programs and learn how to program and think like a programmer. Then if you want to pivot into something less personally interesting but more lucrative to pay bills, you'll have the necessary skillset to make that pivot.",Own_Attention_3392,2026-01-07 03:09:38,20,learnprogramming,t3_1q632we,False,

ny4sgwu,"There's some uncertainty regarding your motivations in this post. Really get a sense of how serious you are before investing money into this. Learning to code is a \*\*journey\*\*. But thankfully, there are loads of resources out there that can help you choose your path! So, it's okay if you're not totally committed to building a career, my advice would be to measure the amount of resource you devote until you know that.You can teach yourself to code without access to any paid content or courses. It's a long road, it takes a lot of dedication and frustration, and drive to go find the answers yourself. But I'm not sure there's ever been a skill so thoroughly documented online as software development. Software developers largely love to share what they've built, and the very fine details of how it works. Youtube is full of tutorials. There are plenty of websites that will explain different programming languages or tools to you. Github is a massive source of real code that drives real projects which you can read and download and involve yourself in the discussions of. If you're looking into a career, I recommend finding a university within your state with an accredited computer science program. The degree matters a lot when it comes to job prospects unfortunately. I also think it's a medium quick way to actually develop serious development skills. I know for me personally, I was on the self-taught path for many years and just very stuck. It was my degree program with the help of professors and peers that finally unlocked things for me and got me over the tough parts of learning development. You'll find no shortage of universities that offer remote degree programs in computer science as well. This is an expensive path, but its the most reliable path to a career.If you're not sure what you want yet, and you're just out to explore maybe try joining some community projects. Hackathons, game jams, competitions. Even if you don't feel like you're ready, just be honest about your level and express that you're there to learn and you're bound to find loads of people just like you who would be glad to learn along-side you. That's a great way to 'explore' and get a sense of what actual development is like even before you have the skills yourself. Even if it means you're joining a discord call just to watch and hear how more experienced developers are working it'll give you a sense of what its actually like once you're in the middle of things.I won't recommend any particular course or source of information personally.

At that point what really shines through is your persistence; persistence is the key thing in programming, at least in my eyes. I will say that it is hard to decide whether it's right for you or not. I guess the answer is, when you are doing it are you focused on it and are willing to sacrifice things for it? If yes, I think that's enough. Don't let school kill your confidence.

I know Monte-Carlo is used to march approximations toward a correct result with sufficient precision. I've just never had to do it.Then there's what you know you know - this is active recall stuff. Rote memory. I know a closure is a poor mans object. I can repeat that all day. It's not very functional memory because I have to actively think about it with intent.

You can sit on your ass for years and not learn a god damn thing - especially if you don't have compelling work or don't care. It's not JUST experience - but the quality of the experience. You don't learn from successes, but failures. And if you want some failures, you need to be trying to do shit.> I realized afterward that I hadn't considered concurrent access, didn't validate inputs, returned mixed types from methods, and used raw dictionaries instead of proper data structures. You're already gaining self-awareness, seeing more than trees, but the forest for what it is. To accelerate your experiences - you need to have more of them; finish that project. Validate inputs - that's easy as shit. Use data structures, that makes it easier to validate your inputs. Add concurrency, this will apply pressure upon you to design a more consistent architecture.You didn't do these things in your demo because you don't have the intuition to do them.

AI will be/is important and will be/is generating this stuff super easy and quick, but it’s not quite that simple…..A few months ago I decided to dive into Identity in ASP.NET (basically built in .NET authentication) and .NET does so much of the heavy lifting. It abstracts all the details away, allowing you to just focus on plugging it in, creating your policies and then focusing on your business logic instead of infrastructure.However…. I sort of quickly realised, that if you don’t understand how it works internally, the abstractions don’t really help or make it any better. You still have to call the relevant methods in the relevant order, and understand what’s going on in order to get the most from it. The abstractions, just save you having to write your implementations… it’s not a substitute for understanding how it works.I see AI as the same. It’s an abstraction. We ask it to generate code, it does. That saves us time and speeds up development, but if we’re unable to understand the inner workings, we won’t be able to get the most out of it. The best way to learn is to build.

Even if I go deep, build things properly, and really learn how they work internally — will there actually be an employer willing to take a chance on someone without formal work experience? In many cases, resumes are filtered out automatically before a human even sees them if you don’t have 3–5 years of relevant experience.Part of me knows that building something unique, finishing a real project, and showing it publicly might be a way to bypass the traditional job search. That also takes time, just in a different way. And realistically, 6 months isn’t a long time at all — maybe even 1–2 years isn’t.So for now, I’m trying to treat programming as a serious hobby and long-term investment, and see where it leads. No matter how the industry changes, I still believe that understanding programming fundamentals will become almost mandatory, and once you have that, switching languages or technologies is much easier.I’ve also been living outside my home country for 6 years, and while things are generally fine, being a foreigner adds extra friction to everything — internships, official employment, even simple life stuff.

It’s primarily a Dependency Injection framework with extra modules for web, databases, etc.A big idea behind dependency injection is you don’t create the objects yourself, someone else does and you simply request what you need. The reason this evolved is because when you do “new SomeClass()” within Java it’s very difficult to test it the class that contains it.Imagine you created a CreditCard service within your Controller, when you want to unit test the controller you want a FakeCredirCard service, but if you did “new” it’s very hard to swap it out.Spring lets you annotate both the real CreditCard service and the fake one, then you dynamically get the one that fits the scope (ex: test)",Rain-And-Coffee,2026-01-06 17:06:28,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q5m1uk,False,

ny8fqg4,"You just need a crash course on web development it sounds like. What you are describing is more a full stack software dev. You sound like you have trained more on backend roles, which is 100% ok, and typically mkre marketable and higher paid. But, if you want to get to where you are writing your own modern single page apps and web deployments, that is what you need to look into.To understand full stack development you need to understand that there are MANY ways to do it. The most popular is the Odin Project, which teaches the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS). This is popular for bootcamps and personal projects, but not as common in the professional world, but it can be. MEAN stack is where you learn Angular as your front end framework instead of React. Both are very good and useful. Angular had a steeper learning curve.So in the full stack your backend can be anything. It can be a NodeJS backend, which is basically a way to write your backend in Javascript or Typescript. There is ZERO reason to write it in JS, imo. Typescript is great and is more enterprise marketable. You learned Java, this means you can have Java as your back end. You do this with the Java Spring Boot framework. Or, you can use C# as your backend. You can do this with .NET Core. Also VERY popular. Or, you can use Python as your backend, which to do this you use like Flask or FastAPI frameworks.These frameworks I am telling you are basically ways to write in these popular languages and essentially deploy a working normal application that will run through a web interface.Your front end can then be different. You can mix and match what you like. You can skip frameworks and just go very simple HTML/CSS/JS. You can write in C# on the backend with .NET Core Web API and React as your front end. You can skip React and just write raw JS/HTML as your front end as well, if you really wanted. You can choose to have React as your frontend and have no backend. You can choose to write and deploy a serverless front end too, so no actual backend deployment needed as you choose to use things I like Azure CLI, or AWS CDK. This is actually really common as you can build really lean sites with say, Angular or Vue as the front end, and with Vite for super fast development.The tough part is picking and choosing what is right for you.My point in this messyness of it all is to point out purely that there is isn't really a ""correct"" one and only path to learn to do this. And, it's too much to learn in parallel. So, you need to pick a lane and stick with it. You already have a background in Java. So consider learning how to build web apps in Java Spring Boot, or transferring to C# and doing .Net Core Web API or .Net with Entity Frameworks (basically a SQL relational database integrated into thr project boilerplate). C# is VERY similar to Java, so easy to transition to. C# is like a more advanced Java. Just be aware you will need to use Visual Studio(not VSC) for maximum advantage here over other IDEs. JetBrains is also pretty good with .NET Core, but it is a paid cost. Or, just go do thr Odin Project as it will teach you all the web dev basics first before pushing you into full stack stuff hard. It is really useful to learn fundamentals of html and how to add the stuff in the header, the imports, the meta and X tags, importing Google fonts, and so on.If you don't care about building web apps then don't go this way and ignore everything I said.",GeneticsGuy,2026-01-07 17:27:16,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q6klp3,False,

nxwfg2h,"Java uses OOP but OOP is a separate thing. It's a concept of how to handle data at runtime by creating objects and then performing actions on those objects.A method or function are the actions that you can use on those objects.A class is a description of an object, at runtime a constructor creates that object in memory, and the instance is the runtime object that was created by the constructor.You need to think in two ways - the code as a dry written thing, and then the multiple real things created when you run that code.Like the Cake class.At runtime you pass in (as arguments) butter, flour, sugar, eggs, vanilla flavour to the Constructor, which then makes an instance of a cake - say a plainSpongeCake.You then call the methods or functions of that Cake class.So you call addIcing(), add sprinkles(), etc.For your next cake, you instantiate the same class but this time you add in chocolate instead of vanilla and then call the same methods. Voilà, you now have a richChocolateCake too.You can now call the cutSlice() method, and that works on both cakes.That's pretty much OOP in a nutshell.You could make an interface class and have the cake class call that. You just put the addIcing() etc method signatures in that class, as you only really use them to guarantee that particular methods will be available in your cake class.Lots of languages use the principles of OOP so it's very much worth learning!Once you've mastered OOP and are getting to grips with Java, then you can start looking at using patterns in the code such as MVC and Singleton.Good luck!

nx9tdwt,"IT is more like software development's somewhat less-competitive, more reliable cousin in terms of careers. It's one of those (mostly) low-pressure desk jobs that you do to make a stable income while you do what you really want to do in your free time. That said, it will contribute close to nothing when it comes to helping a career in game dev. The knowledge will 100% be helpful, but it won't help you get a programming job unless it's ultra entry-level (and 99% of game dev jobs aren't entry level).It is an excellent job to have for paying bills though, and depending on the environment/level of independence, it can give you lots of time both at home and at your desk to learn programming independently. As long as I get my tasks done each day, I can pretty safely bring my laptop to the office to study/work on my own projects most of the time.I will say though, ""building a multiplayer online game"" is a very, very ambitious goal shared by many aspiring game devs who don't know what it actually takes to do something like that. To the point that it's a known red flag/meme if a dev tries to crowdfund an MMO. If you intend to make games by yourself, your scope needs to be reduced \*drastically,\* and you'll not only learn more but be more satisfied with the process if you focus on making small, simple games. If you want to make something bigger, then find friends/collaborators to work with-- particularly people who are willing to work on something for the fun of it instead of trying to turn it into a business. It's very, very difficult to ""start a game studio,"" so you want to start by making games for fun and learning to enjoy the process of making them before you \*ever\* think about monetizing. Basically don't think about monetizing/turning it into a business until you \*have business.\* And if you want to get into programming for an existing studio, be prepared to spend years and years doing contract work to build a reputation, and to navigate a highly competitive field where you could be let go at a drop of a hat.Make small games.

As you've discovered, checking pixel-level collisions like this is a bit performance intensive.Most games don't check collisions this way. Instead, like ""You can't move through walls"" or ""If an enemy touches you, you die"" are determined by representing both the character and the object as simple shapes.

A ""capsule"" shape is also quite easy (it's just the union of a box and two circles).

Lets not 3 Mile Island the world here, C or Python, should not cause somebody to feel slow and dumb. So the first thing that comes to mind right now is to choose one, which if you are learning is C.Not to date myself but I first got interested in computers before the S100 bus debuted, so maybe 13 or 14 at the time. For years all I could do is read Byte and when I could find it Dr.Dobbs. It wasn't until the Vic-20 came out, 1980, that I could actually afford a computer and that ViC 20 was barely usable. So for a good number of years my interests where satisfied by reading what I could.It actually took me a while to get to college and that was where my first formal training started and unlearning the VIC 20. At the time the school had Sun workstations so that was like a step into the future. So what motivated me, well the place I was working for was paying the bill. Since I didn't want to go hungry anymore it was a good idea to keep working. Now that said not a programmer per say but use the knowledge almost everyday before working. So staying sharp with software was important. However that required me to keep writing code, sometimes toy programs and in a couple of cases finding bugs for an Open Source project. At work I had some focus on CNC and PLC controllers which is always a challenge, beyond spread sheets and Python code. So even if work was NOT as a programmer, I was heavily involved in automation.Now that I'm retired the motivations are different. For example to keep track of my investments, I have spread sheets of stock portfolios. Now on the surface one might laugh at spreadsheet programming because it looks to be simple but I'd have to say there is as much depth there as their is with Python. The motivation is that I need to keep this organized and understand where my next meal is coming from.If you want to stay sharp though, who doesn't and frankly at this age you work at it, yo need to do more than stock portfolio management. To that end I keep a couple of hobbies going and use those interest to drive software development there. This is the key, use it or loose it. If you want to have any usable skill at all with respect to software you need to stay in the game. Motivation is sometimes hard to come by or even keep, so you really need to integrate programming into projects that you are interested in. Programming itself can also be a motivator, simply learning about new languages can motivate some. I didn't even know that C3 existed until yesterday for example and it actually looks interesting. For most of us though we need that outside pull to start a new project.Lets say you are into bicycling and those little trip computers look to be so handy. That lust could be the motivator for a DIY trip computer for a bicycle. Going DIY means it can work exactly as you expect, in every way it is yours. The challenges are the motivator. What are those challenges (just a few):1. Embedded project.2. Battery operated (maybe solar) and thus needs to be efficient3. Small custom Printed Circuit board.4.

So if you want to use the term ""functionally retarded"", you've come to the right person. Don't worry, I'm not offended.You do not need to know a lot of mathematics in order to succeed in the field.

If you build a game using raylib, you'll need to learn quite a bit. If you encounter difficult maths problems, someone has probably figured out how to do it so you don't have to work from scratch, and there are plenty of good resources online to learn the harder stuff. You'll also naturally develop your math skills as you progress as a programmer.I will now offer rambling unsolicited advice on learning math based on my own experience. I believe many people that believe they are bad at math are encountering two related problems that make it difficult to identify or articulate why learning math is harder for them relative to others. The first is missing prerequisite knowledge, the second is study methods that do not work or are inappropriate for them. The exception is for some cases where neurodevelopment and learning disabilities create hard limits, however in many cases these can be managed by adjusting your study methods (as was the case for me, as I have ADHD and dyspraxia).Learning math and learning to program are very similar in that there are foundational concepts/skills you need to learn or develop in a particular order before you can learn more advanced content. When I got to university I had a lot of gaps in my knowledge; elementary stuff that compounded from my early education through to high school (which I ended up dropping out of). This conceptual debt made it harder to progress over time, while others only had to learn one new concept to solve a problem, I might need 5 or 6, which snowballs very quickly. This also made the traditional lecture -> tutorial -> homework learning pipeline ineffective because it assumes you have certain prerequisite knowledge and they cant/won't help you identify specific concepts needed to catch up.I found it much easier to learn at home following youtube videos (I highly recommend organic chemistry tutor), khan academy lessons, resources on the r/learnmath mega thread, or good textbooks with clear progression and references to related previous topics. These formats are easy to pause if something is too advanced, giving you the opportunity to go learn prerequisites as you need, before returning to the original problem. To practice I would follow videos of worked examples, print 50-100 problems to work through, then mark my own answers to find if/where I was going wrong. I'd also return to reattempt packets of questions later. Now I have the ability to not only deal with difficult math problems day to day, but when I can't I have learned how to learn to solve things. Good luck, and apologies for the wall of text!TLDR; Don't worry.

If you miss one of those concepts or don't fully understand it, you're screwed. The concepts taken slowly aren't that bad.

Look up Bob Tabor and go through his javascript course. It is as easy as it gets, but you won't be a developer when you're done. What it will do is instill concepts and maybe give you some confidence, because when you are done, you'll realize, Bob Tabor makes it look easy. But he's slow and methodical.2. Start on a free and easy platform like w3schools. They are constantly adding content and I have full access (got it on sale), so I can pretty much do anything, learn new skills as they are added, get certifications.3. Lookup roadmaps and game plan all this4. Eventually I think you need to consider paying to learn, on a platform or in college.5. You might look into Team TreehouseI have used Team Treehouse's platform and they have what's called tech degrees. Some companies have heard of them and people have gotten jobs after completing their curriculum. But it's no guarantee. Thing is, without something reputable on your resume, you won't get a job, so if you're learning for fun, great, if you're looking for a career, well, just go on indeed or elsehwhere and see how many jobs there are for inexperienced engineers and look at the requirements. Nearly all require a degree, and nearly all are using ATSs to scan resumes, so no degree means, resume is dragged to trash bin. Self-taught is alright, but you won't save yourself time, and you should think about paid school, just because that's the smart route. Employers trust Professors, not youtube instructors. I mean, it's okay to be home-schooled, but I'll tell ya, you may still be studying in 6 years on your own.So that's my recommendation for you. Have some goals. Lookup roadmaps. Game plan.Honestly, you should consider a different career, like delivering pizzas. Something that's less resourceful than building code. Dreams die when reality hits. None of this is easy. If you use Tabor and w3schools, maybe they instill the confidence for you to move onto harder learning, because that's beginning stuff, and you need to get into intermediate and advanced concepts and learn far more than HTML/CSS/JS to get a job (or to show anyone you're serious).

The 3rd call to what? to quicksort()? to partition()? But quicksort has two recursive calls inside it for the left and right, and no obvious order to them. So which one is the 3rd one? Is it the first recursive call on the left, the first recursive call on the right, or the second recursive call on the left, or the second recursive call on the right? Also, what is the partition scheme being used? If I make some educated guesses:The first call to partition with pivot=4 results in \[4, 55, 92, 80, 81, 95, 88, 19, 52, 38, 71, 74\] and now the pivot is at index 0Now we recursively call and partition the right with pivot=74 to get \[4, 55, 71, 38, 52, 19, 74, 88, 95, 81, 80, 92\] with pivot going to index 6.Now recursively call and partition the left (that's \[55 .. 19\]) to get \[4, 19, 71, 38, 52, 55, 74, 88, 95, 81, 80, 92\] with pivot now at index 1.I'm guessing that's where they got k=1?",lfdfq,2026-01-07 11:05:42,4,learnprogramming,t3_1q6bs2y,False,

It's not necessarily the ""holy grail"" solution (in the end, organization of any kind requires work, no matter whether you're using docker or WSL2 or whatever else), but nowadays VMs are quite handy for the following reasons --1. Storing a VM and moving it around nowadays is cheap due to low-cost portable storage (e.g. multi-TB portable USB hard disks).2. Virtualization is in basically all decent laptops nowadays, so virtualizing an OS, although not as fast as ""the real deal"", is definitely ""fast enough"" for almost all tasks.3. Trying out other OSes is fun (for me personally). If I had to install a new distro on my hardware itself to try out something new like Omarchy (which got a lot of attention recently), then most likely, I would just never even try it at all. If I have a VM though and am used to using them, then there's no excuse not to try something new like that -- the only cost is the hard disk space (BUT, see point #1 above). Finally, if you do start ""losing track"" of what you have installed somewhere, then my solution nowadays for big disks is to just fire up a tool like WinDirStar (or QDirStat on Linux distros) and then start consolidating stuff into physically adjacent locations. For example, most likely all of your streaming stuff should be on a single drive PLUS a backup drive (presumably the cost of an extra drive is much less than the horror you will experience if you lose your recordings accidentally or drop your disk in the toilet by mistake or something else like that).",chaotic_thought,2026-01-07 08:38:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q5sx9t,False,

It has little to do with whether or not AI is useful; it’s clear that there is a market for access to LLMs (even if the people who want to pay for them are wrong about their usefulness, which I’m not saying they are or are not.). Think about previous bubbles: the dotcom bubble did not mean the internet was useless, for goodness sake, nor did the housing bubble mean uh, houses were useless. In both cases, it rather meant investors had made foolish decisions about where to put their money in a mad rush to profits driven by hype. It is pretty clear at this point that there similarly just is not a path to investors making their money back given how much investment has gone into this now. However, the thing about any bubble is there’s no telling what it will take to pop. It may go tomorrow, or it might take another few years. There’s no way to know, usually. In the case of the housing bubble, you could look at when the higher rates of crappy ARMs kicked in and make a pretty solid bet things would fall apart at that point (see The Big Short) but that was a special case.You can look at the AI buildout and see, “okay, we’re building data centers like there’s no tomorrow, Nvidia’s accounts receivable is ballooning [ie, they’re allowing companies to take out debt to pay them], we keep inventing more 2008-style debt instruments to build these data centers, OpenAI and Anthropic and Cursor are completely unprofitable” and you can see that this cannot go on.

Just make sure that you're actually a part of that success and not leeching of it (looking at you middle management).In higher positions you also get to start initiatives you believe brings value, and that value can be measured in some way.

nxzveze,"I’ve experienced various kinds of burn out, changing roles sometimes helped but also sometimes did nothing. The biggest factor, to me, was not in the role itself but the people that surrounded me. I made one switch after being burn out due to boredom and ended up in basically the corporate trash pile of non-performers that had managers who found it easier to move them to this new effort than to terminate them. I had an impossible situation of kicking something off with a bunch of people who had poor skills, poor follow through, and poor attitudes. I was heavily involved in terminating over 80% of the team, including my boss. All while trying (and obviously failing) to make forward progress and then playing catchup while onboarding the new team while dealing with an unhappy customer who just wanted results. I was very busy for a period with HR actions, customer engagements to appease an upset customer, serving the role of like 5 different positions, trying to come up with clever ways to meet impossible milestones, convincing company leadership that the project was completely screwed and we needed help, etc. I went from boring to extremely not boring. But one type of burn out to another. Having a mountain of work to get done that grows much faster than you burn it down, constantly pivoting to emergent tasks that had to be resolved immediately and had me up until 3am writing documents and building slides, dealing with nasty people on the regular… it really wears you out.

For example, you could be the retail industry expert floater who is brought in to talk about macro industry outcomes and not just technology design. This would mean more high level executive vision discussions and more delegation of execution & architecture details — more soothing for your fried brain, but comes with a learning curve.

Among students new to computer programming, a variety of answers are common:Some, intuit overwrite semantics and answer: 1 1Some, intuit swap semantics and answer: 3 1Some, intuit move semantics and answer: 0 1A good teacher will have a series of test questions designed to ferret out these mismatched mental models, and correct them. Once students have good mental models of how languages behave they can finally start learning.So I doubt that you are cooked. You probably just need a bit of guidance. If you're struggling with a particular concept, go talk to your teacher. Write out the different possible code snippets you're considering to achieve a particular task, and have him explain why they do or don't work.Have you tried sitting down, and just writing some simple code to see if you understand things. I would suggest using a language that offers a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) so that you can try things out interactively without getting bogged down. A google collab notebook, or a Jupyter notebook can be great for this.I got started writing software when I was in 4th grade on my Commodore 64. Started out just faffing around with loops to repeatedly print things like ""I am the greatest!"" on the screen. I played around with sorting algorithms.

Part of being a developer is actually validating requirements and things you’ve been assigned. It’s an ongoing dialog.

nxpq09a,"Yea, I enjoyed c++ game development for a while. Completely self taught myself graphics programming through The Cherno, LearnOpenGL, and Game Engine Architecture Volume 3, since my college classes did not really cover it in particular. Made the switch because I desperately needed something more fulfilling job wise than game dev, which was drying up way back in 2018 just about. Way before Ai and outsourcing has caught on. I enjoyed C++ so I did that. Then fast forward a bit more I dabbled in web dev a bit (did use Ai to initially learn, and figured it out in about a month), did that a bit longer but really did not like it. So, basically just learned I love working in C++. From there just continued building little c++ projects and am now actively working on my engine which is in a presentable state, but nowhere near complete (if it ever will be). Recently been diving into embedded for job opportunities, since even graphics development is a big challenge in my area. Been screwing around on my Nucleo board, and building circuits and what not. The job doesn't require embedded, but is definitely embedded oriented. So, I have a bunch of little nick nack projects in c++, my engine, and this sample embedded project just to show I am interested in embedded. At the end of the day, I have quite a bit to talk about in an interview. I bet they would maybe be surprised for someone to explain how they developed a fairly large project, made design decisions, and just know the full ins and outs of the project they built, especially from new grads. At least, that's just under the presumption that a lot of candidates may be going full fledge into Ai and not understand a lick of what they are doing. Regardless I feel as though I do fit the role, it is super duper entry level after all (they listed wanting someone with some form of knowledge in at least one out of every language under the sun basically), but was just concerned how fast they expect you to adapt to something more complex than you have ever worked on before. My engine is three projects, with about 100 files, but that's a drop compared to a companies code base with thousands just on one project.Edit: All of that just to say I am currently waiting to hear from them, though they are located near me in bumb-fuck nowhere.

nx35s5i,"For a bit of context, I live in London, work in tech, but have lived in Ireland and studied in the US. I would still require a visa to live in the US, but I've had multiple points in my life where I could have chosen to move to the US permanently. I chose to move to the UK.Dublin, Paris, and Berlin don't, imo, have a better tech scene. You get a lot more jobs and variety in London. The pay also doesn't compare and you usually have much more growth opportunities in London. I speak about Dublin from experience, I moved from there to London. The other two I've mostly seen from a distance and talking to friends. Berlin is probably the one that gets closest, but the truth is that FAANGs all have large tech offices in London, they don't all have one in Berlin. Add that to the language issue (I don't speak German) and it doesn't make much sense to move there.The US tech jobs are a much more interesting problem. The Bay Area and Seattle have objectively better tech scenes, higher salaries, and more variety in jobs. My problem with both of them (but especially the Bay) is that I do not enjoy or want to live in either of those places. I enjoy living in a city where I can walk places, where there's public transport, where there's a museum, culture, and arts scene, where it's easy to travel to other countries, and where not everything is tech.NYC would be a good option, and while the salaries aren't as good as the Bay, they're still likely better than London. I think it provides a good mix, and if I were to ever move to the US I would go there. I do still not like living in the US generally though. As I said, there's certain aspects of how European cities work that I enjoy, and to add to it, I enjoy getting plenty of days off to enjoy my free time and I feel like I have more breathing room while still finding interesting things to work for good pay. Between that and the fact that I've now established myself here and I have a friend group that I'm happy with and a flat I own, I'm unlikely to want to move.Edit: another issue with the US I forgot to mention, the immigration precarity has always been an issue for me with the country and to a degree still is. In the time I've moved to the UK, got permanent residency and citizenship, many of my friends in the US haven't been able to get permanent residency status. In that period I've not really had any prolonged periods where I can't visit family or leave the country for holidays, whereas I've had friends who weren't able to leave for **2 whole years**. Most visas you can get to move to the US can put you in that situation if you ever want to turn your status into a long-term one, and you're treated throughout a lot of the process as if you're somehow doing something wrong.

Besides those what is there? Dublin, Paris and Berlin are downgrades from London in terms of volume of opportunities. There’s no single city in Europe, Canada or Australia actually that I think has more opportunity than London. Lots of other places are better to live in imo for quality of life btw, but if we’re talking strictly about volume of job opportunities there aren’t as many. Dubai and Singapore also have less opportunities and then India/China aren’t going to work for vast majority because of low salaries and cultural differences. I’m of Indian origin and just got back from a trip to India, it’s a fine place to live if you have an online business making an income to sustain your life there, especially if you like sunshine, but to work there, it’s not going to work for people born and raised in the west and for those wages your lifestyle would be very poor.The reality right now is tech jobs are in a precarious position all around. Outside the US, London’s probably the best, but that’s not saying much with the changing landscape with AI and lack of VC investment in anything other than AI.
