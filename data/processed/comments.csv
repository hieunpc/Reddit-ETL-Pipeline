o5unagf,"I sort of like a bit of lake and a bit of warehouse. A common loading pattern we have been using is:- for streaming: source --> Kafka --> snowflake (snowpipe streaming to tables)- for batches: source --> AWS s3 (~lake) --> snowflake (external tables)- in both cases once in Snowflake: raw staged tables (bronze) --> structured, type-cast, deidentified views (silver) --> Kimball/star/mart views with metadata (gold)I've been liking this system so far. The key difference with streaming and batch in the above cases are that the batch method keeps the raw/bronze data in s3 via external tables, so I guess that's a ""lake"", while the streaming method loads the CDC events into a table resting in the snowflake data warehouse. We use dagster to orchestrate and dbt to run the jobs. The technologies are good - the challenges are behavioural in nature.There's probably a more consistent way to do the above, but it does work. I guess the lake/s3 component just exists because it is simple and cheap to read from some provided s3 dump than to add a ""copy into"" step. We would probably would have done the same for streaming, but snowpipe streaming is a good enough solution at the moment so we can skip a redundant intermediate load to s3.",PossibilityRegular21,2026-02-17 11:50:58,75,dataengineering,t3_1r73l52,False,

Model the infrastructure (make it modular and scalable), create some processes, and give power to the people within some defined boundaries. It’s more work, but I feel it’s easier — after inital cost I can go do streaming, swap out tools, optimize DB tables, create alert systems and stuff.Plus the experience managing your own files, metadata, debugging fucking notebooks is atrocious.

If you wish to stay at your current place, you should stop the open conflict with your manager. Continue putting out great work, making sure you get the credit and the cto sees it. Eventually there will be an opportunity to move, either vertically or laterally. But don’t hold your breath, people like your manager often stay with a company for a long time. You’re stuck with him (and he’s with you). Your best chance is leaving while you’re ahead and have something to show for your time spent here. You can leave feedback about your manager on your way out, but don’t even think about complaining about him to the hiring managers. As far as you are concerned, things were just peachy between you.",a1ic3_g1a55,2026-02-22 08:35:20,3,dataengineering,t3_1rancoy,False,

o60szyx,"I've been in 3 different roles as a Data Engineer, and they've all been so wildly different to me and without knowing more specifics without your role, I can't give too specific advice. But here are some general pointers from when I first started that might help.\- Learn general data engineering practices / lingo. You're going to hear things like: Data Governance, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage, Data Warehouse, ETL, ELT, Data Lake, OLAP, OLTP, Data Mesh, etc. You don't have to learn everything all at once, or even fully understand everything the first time. Start with who / what you'll work with, expand from there.\- Learn SQL VERY well. Two sides to this: learn a dialect VERY well and learn a database implementation well. The former will help you with your day to day job as a junior. Learning how to solve common patterns, use common functions, solve common SQL problems, etc will help you for your whole career. For the latter, you would want to really be able to explain things like indexes (which ones to use, why), data storage internals, how to read execution plans and optimize, etc. This is something you should be picking up gradually throughout your career, and I would only expect more mid level / senior engineers to know more and more about these things. For a junior, just begin learning it slowly, but don't stress out too much. \- Lots of companies are now on the cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP). If your company is one of them, you should learn the stack. Learn the services that your company is using, what role / problem it solves, and how to configure/work with it. Whatever your company uses, be it Azure Synapse/AWS Redshift for data warehousing, ADLS / AWS S3 for object storage, learn that tech deeply, learn how authorization/authentication works on your cloud platform, and those two alone will carry forth across cloud providers. Once you learn what you work with, you can slowly expand outwards if you so desire. \- Additional point to the above, lots of companies also use Databricks / Snowflake. If applicable, learn what each of those companies provide in terms of offerings or services. IMHO learning either of these opens the door for more data engineering roles in the future.\- Maybe a controversial tip, but as a software engineer turned data engineer, I personally still apply software engineering principals just through a data engineering lens. That means following best practices when writing clean code, working with things like CI/CD, git, code review, etc. This may seem like a no brainer, but not every shop hires data engineers from the software engineer / CS grad pipeline. Lots of DEs I knew came from data analyst or scientist positions, and had no clue of the SWE fundamentals. I think treating this job as a specialized SWE position will help you a LOT with the menial stuff, and it'll allow you to pivot if you ever want to.I omitted a lot, but I think this is good to start, and I think these are general enough to help you no matter what kind of DE position you're put into.",___ml_n,2026-02-18 08:52:07,82,dataengineering,t3_1r7u6sz,False,

o62806u,"SQL and Python are going to be your best friends in this career. I am not sure about your proficiency in either, but try to solve some difficult problems in both without using AI (or may be ask AI to generate questions for you to solve). In SQL, try to build common patterns in data engineering with some sample data - MERGE INTO, SCD Type 2, some small star schema design. In python, know common patterns used with data structures - list, dict, set and iterators. These will help you in first few months. You can slowly move towards understanding the bigger data engineering architecture - SQL Optimization techniques, ETL, Data Vault modelling. I recommend you get 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering' book and read it once in a while. Re-read the concepts again once every few months as it will add new perspectives as you gain experience. Once you master SQL and python, tools are not going to be difficult for you. You will get to see that irrespective of tool - Spark or Snowflake, Airflow or ADF (or any GUI based orchestration) - the build patterns and outcomes are almost exactly same. While you master technical things, also try to be curious about the business problem you are solving. It doesn't matter if you know 4 different tools, if you cannot answer what business problem you solved. For this, AI would be immensely helpful. Let's say someone wants to build a CRM dashboard for which you are building data model - You might hear terms like Sales Funnel or Conversion rate - Try to ask AI and get an overall perspective of the problem you are trying to solve.

Set up Airflow with the UI exposed (or use dbt Cloud if you have budget). Show him how to drop his SQL into a dbt model or an Airflow DAG.

Build a pipeline that runs your dbt tests and deploys on merge to main.

o5zl5tz,Hi. CDC means “change data capture”. It is a term used to describe how one collects information from a source database or SaaS service. Initially CDC was associated with relational databases and log scanning to identify inserts update and deletes. It is an alternative to “high water mark” determination of changes (usually via some sort of timestamp column). SCD means “slowing changing dimension” and is a concept coined by Ralph Kimball to denote capturing versions of a dimension. In most respects CDC and SCD are not related conceptually but you would / could use CDC processing to help drive population of a SCD dimensional table (like a customer dimension).,GreyHairedDWGuy,2026-02-18 03:12:52,12,dataengineering,t3_1r7r8tw,False,

o6pxmzv,"The problem you're describing is critical yet no one has good solution for it. As mentioned, there are many existing tools that are good with metadata (static) but usage is dynamic. And building a usage graph is far from trivial. There are countless ways to write SQL that ultimately accomplish the same thing. On top of that, every tool interprets queries differently, since each has its own parsing logic and assumptions. Unless you have the first-hand control over the execution engine itself, extracting things like:* Column usage and aliasestypically means parsing user-written input (i.e SQL query) which comes with countless edge cases. So the solution you're coming up ideally has to be something that can be plugged into the compute engine itself .i.e. OpenLineage is taking this approach for collecting lineage information by integrating directly with various compute engines rather than relying solely on query parsing.I would say go for it and no one had a good solution for it yet afaik. Ultimately, the value comes down to what kind of usage graph you're building and how it leads to actionable insights.

We also have 20-40 api scripts through azure functions ingesting to bronze prod. And a couple of bigger source systems that ADFs copy activity handles. But i wouldnt want to clone stuff and insert everything twice. Also the DDL statements to create and prepare th tables for dev ingestions would be needed twice too. Should we backup and redeploy the prod bronze db maybe after each time? Is Linked Servers really a bad option and what do you mean with cross env drift and permission weirdness? I would give the dev server read permission to the prod bronze only,FasTiBoY,2026-02-18 01:30:31,1,dataengineering,t1_o5yw3l5,True,
o610jat,Also how would you feel about a Linked Server from dev that points to prod? I need dbt to pickup from the landing layer. Or should I always ingest in both prod and dev bronze even tho there is much more overhead. Any experience with that?,FasTiBoY,2026-02-18 10:02:26,1,dataengineering,t1_o60t0n6,True,
o69term,Currently its just an overnight trigger that pulls and copys into the SQL server as Sink. As well as a bunch of APIs running at the same time at night so the bronze tables have yesterdays data. I ran into an issue using Linked Server in the dev dbt env as I cant reference it cleanly (different SQL Server on VM). As its a 4 part identifier. [Linked Server].[BronzeDB].[schema].table_name and dbt expects DB.schema.table_name Also I wont mind at the end if in the Source System of yesterdays data smth breaks. I would simply handle it with either a blue/green deployment and more precisely simply not updating the gold (presentation layer) if anything in bronze or silver broke. I am playing around with polybase rn tho and a data lake solution possibly as the linked server setup doesnt really work cleanly.,FasTiBoY,2026-02-19 17:16:08,1,dataengineering,t1_o65zg46,True,

o6sj510,"Hi, I work at LanceDB but want to add a bit of detail here. Lance's file format is versioned, with the current default version being 2.0. 2.1 is already out there and is going to be the default soon, and 2.2 is also implemented and in the testing phase. The choice of file format used can impact the level of compression and performance you see, as the format is continually being improved.Re: performance, the F3 paper ([https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf)) shows numbers comparing Lance vs. other file formats and this is a good source of information (outside of the LanceDB team) in terms of scan and random access throughput (it shows that Lance is the fastest). The compression ratio shown in the paper is the worst, but the paper benchmarked against an old version of Lance (pre 2.0).From a roadmap perspective, Lance file format 2.2 that will come out soon has significantly more compression algorithms implemented, with some performance improvements as well. So more numbers will be published soon once that's out.Re: your performance observations, a) the version of the file format used matter, and b) the data types may not have the best compression ratios for that file version used. In LanceDB's internal suite, we regularly test against these modalities: long-form text, images and video blobs. For these cases, the write amplification in Parquet due to row groups is significant (which is the reason Lance was created in the first place). That said, even for conventional tabular data types (floats, booleans, etc.), Lance should perform on par with or better than Parquet, no matter the scale of the dataset. If you're getting sufficient performance out of Parquet, then well and good, in the end, what works best in practice is all that's needed!",laminarflow027,2026-02-22 16:11:20,1,dataengineering,t3_1rbcjqu,False,

We all see at this point that it’s a huge bubble similar to the .com bubble, and we’ll probably see similar result - AI is likely here to stay, but it probably won’t be used very differently than how it’s being used today and the demand to put AI into every app or service will die down.

o641q4n,"I think that's awesome and most of the calculator apps out there are badly in need of an upgrade from Texas Instrument days, which they all strangely seem to still emulate.I wrote my own CRM in and now it's fully customized to a sales workflow, has dynamic scripts that populate for each client with name and info from the lead source. I can easily add or modify these scripts using a regular text file and put the fields I want in with {{ label }} tags and it will replace them with customer record data. I can just add a template file to a directory and it'll use it. That builds the texts I can bulk or individually send out. As I work, it dynamically keeps track of my availability across the day and updates the scripts for me on the fly as my schedule fills up.Although it has some required fields in the single SQLite table it uses, like first name, last name, phone, status, but other than that, it can import any csv file with at least those field names into it and it'll just slurp up whatever and show the fields from the csv in the GUI. It also has a customized note taking page where I can put the customer's data into a UI and it'll save is as a json document in a directory and attach the name of that file to the client record. That document is also a json document, so I can modify it without coding anything and those fields in the notes are not on the client record directly and they don't need to be. I could of course add them later to any data structure I want if I want to.Also, now I can parse PDF files for data, match them to a record and update the database and attach the now renamed pdf file to that client and open it in a window from the gui. I can also create a new record if one doesn't exist, or just fail and spit out a not found. Whatever I need it to do at the time.That pdf view window dynamically changes to the corresponding file if I change customers in the gui by selecting, hitting the next or previous client or page buttons, and doesn't break if it's not there, it just happily displays there's no pdf file found for that one.It also has color themes, a dark, light, slate, blue and pink themes. These are CSS files and if you want to add one you just drop it in by the name light.css, dark.css into a config directory and it'll pick it up and let you select that from the menu and save it so it always uses that theme until you change it again, with all the other config options that you set as well. They all stay active until changed across runs.It can build lists I can use for bulk texts or anything else I can dream up for it. I can just code that in.As I built it and made changes, I just kept adding the ability to customize it from the way it used to work, to the new capability. So, it basically just gets more and more powerful over time. Everything it could ever do, it can still do perfectly fine.It's awesome and it's 100% mine, 100% free, and 100% not on the cloud, it doesn't even use a web browser either, although it easily could, but I like that it doesn't for now.Would it pass corporate IT coding standards. NOPE! I wrote them so I know, NOPE! and I like it that way.Is it easy to use - Yep.Is it user friendly - Nope.Is it well documented - other than the code is clearly written - NOPE. lolThat's (Hell\^Nope)Did I vide code it? Kinda. I've got plenty of experience writing software. Big software. No direct experience writing anything quite like this before. It's got the simplest data model I've ever used in any DB lol. There's a lot of room for more things it could do here in the future if I get around to needing it. For now, I just don't.I started with free AI because I didn't know a some of the available API's and I wanted to try them out. I went through a few of these before I found one I liked and wanted to work with. AI got me off the ground with them,I got amazingly far down the line of a prototype and before I knew it, I had something basically working. As I kept adding more capability however, it quickly ran out of context area and now gets lost and makes so may errors and just poor coding choices I rarely use it anymore. The cool thing is I don't really need it now. I learned the API I landed on and I'm comfortable taking it from here. I also got a very good idea of what AI can and can't do these days as well.Replace coders and people with technical skills? Maybe some junior slog roles. It can be used to write slog job automation that would have otherwise been way out of scope and not cost effective.What are you going to replace them with? Don't even tell me business analysts. Don't even think about telling me corporate executives or nepo babies. They don't know their ass from a hole in the ground and AI isn't going to help for that.

In many segments you focus on one solutions such as git. However you should make a point to highlight a number of similar systems. The idea is to make students aware that there are many options. Covering the common solution is find after highlighting that students have lots of options. I actually like that GIT and VIM coverage as good introductions.2. I'm still of the opinion that everyone needs to learn VIM, as a command line tool, to some extent. It is the VIM is everywhere base reality. However in the modern world using the command line environment with a GUI editor of choice might lead to more productive students. I'm not even sure students grasp that command line control can be mixed with GUI apps. This may be personal thing but I find GUI based editors far more productive. So in the same regards a paragraph that list out a few alternative command line an and GUI editors to inform students makes sense.3. A port for compiled languages or an additional segment within this package, would be useful for programs that don't use Python. A focus on C++ would be advisable as the use of GCC is similar for many languages. The idea is not to teach the language, but to teach how programs are built with compilers.

Starts the thinking in ""MVC"" & ""Restful"" like patterns. - Learn about validating (not sanitizing) data, returning early, sending error messages to the template with HTTP response codes. - Learn about databases (using SQLite, less setup) to populate & read data. - Next would be refactoring to smaller testable functions (Are you receiving the data (input or code to function) you need? Are you getting the output you expect?), - Then OOP and better project structure. - Try this out using the common beginner User Registration/Login projects and learn about password_* functions (vs md5, sha1, etc), etc.A beginner would then be comfortable getting into current concepts found in libraries and frameworks.See how this was more focused to learning based on experience?",equilni,2026-02-21 20:00:41,3,learnprogramming,t3_1rauvm8,False,

Imagine us telling ""Yeah, learn that Go."" You'll learn it. Nobody in your area is developing his stuff in Go. Countries differ, job markets differ. What is in use in one place can be not in demand in another place.Now, to your questions:1)Backend is backend. If you are targeting web application development you won't be using any other math than some simple primary school math. And sometimes even not that. There won't be any difference between picking Python or Java or PHP or something else. If you have to add up your end-user's monthly bills you will use a simple primary school math.The only thing you do have to look into is Boolean algebra. AND, OR, NOT and the combinations of these in IF/ELSE blocks. To decide how the process flow will switch based on one or another criteria. But you should have studied it during your degree studies. In Discrete Mathematics course or such.You'll need more math in data science.2)Pick the backend language based on job offers in your area. Sure, you can pick some language that less juniors are using... but you won't be using it at all if there is no demand after it.3)If you are going to work in web application development you'll need SQL and git for sure.

In Windows you have to figure out how to get it working in your WSL and stuff.No idea about boot.dev.

For onboarding, for mentoring, etc. It is a bit risky to let a new junior to work remotely on his own. Not saying that there won't be any remote jobs, for you, but expect to find an office job before finding a remote job.And when it comes to a saturation then a web application development in general is a saturated field. Does not matter if you are picking Python, Java, Go, PHP or something else. Because everybody is ""speedrunning"" and trying to get a job fast.

All the jobs. Every job within an hour of your place. Every new job. It’ll take time but hopefully someone takes a chance with you. Leverage your existing work into coding. Extend the truth on your resume and say you’ve been hobby coding/freelance coding In your spare time as it makes you seem more up to date.

The intense math in Python comes in AI and data science, which you can totally stay away from. Java isnt having less math than Python; theyre pretty much the same in this aspect.2. Should you pivot to Java to avoid Python saturation?Java is definitely a good choice in enterprises, but changing to it now would stop you from moving forward fast.

o6bkkog,"I wouldn't worry about math too much, nor choose a language based on that. The business domain will determine that, not the language. And the vast bulk of programming jobs out there don't require much math. It's a misconception that all of us programmers are doing lots of math.The most math you may benefit from is boolean algebra (and simple arithmetic), and that's very easy and fast to learn and has some payoff for working with logic in code. See the first two chapters of ""How to Prove It"", he covers the topic really well and it's a breeze.Another good topic, related to logic, is how numbers are represented in a computer in general with a ""finite number system"", and in various languages more specifically (integer vs. float vs. double, vs. BigInteger/BigFloat [using memory to sidestep the limitations on the primitive data types]), and to understand the pros and cons of the common approaches. You should try to come away with a good working intuition, e.g. when to use an integer vs. a float/double based on the actual numbers you're working with, how floating-point numbers increasingly lose precision in the integers as they get larger, the kinds of problems you can run into when FP values are part of boolean expressions, i.e. exact equality checks, due to floating-point rounding error (and also how errors can creep in based on how you group operations on numbers of various magnitudes).Java is a great language. Personally I would choose a language based on the job market, not based on your perception of Python seeming easier to use. IMO it would actually be beneficial to confront that ""strictness"" sooner than later. That strictness you perceive is generally a good thing, it's an up-front cost that pays off in a bunch of good ways. With the exception of `var`, it generally gives good visibility on expected types (and you can always use the IDE to help inspect `var` variables). Types give you something firm to latch onto when reasoning about code at development time and debugging time. Python (AFAIK) has made improvements here, but I don't know the current state of things, how ergonomic it all is, and how good the tooling is. Maybe it's great, I have no idea. But Java is pretty decent in this regard. Anyway, types relate to logic, particularly when using the primitive data types, as you can abstractly think of the types as the sets of all possible values (restricted by the fact that the computer is finite).With DSA stuff, I have no knowledge of boot.dev, but I'd probably just think of it as a potential problem bank. With DSA, you want to get exposure to various categories of problems, regardless of where you got the problems from. DSA problems are all scoped down majorly, so it generally doesn't matter where you're getting them from (as long as they're not poorly written). A key though is being able to check your solution for correctness. If boot.dev lets you _run_ your solutions to see whether it passes or fails, and on which inputs, then that's great. Otherwise, platforms like LeetCode can do that (or see Neetcode for a narrower list). With these, focus on quality over quantity. There are more problems than you realistically have time to do, and that's fine. If you do one problem from each fundamental category, that's an awesome start. Hopefully boot.dev's problem set gives you a diverse sampling.Other than that, a key for your career in programming is to actually build small projects of your own choosing on your own time, because you need exposure to the ""problem-solving cycle"". Getting real projects done can be an arduous process of cycling over and over through planning, coding, verifying, and repeating until you reach some clearly defined ""done"" state. At times it can be a psychological thriller. Anyway, DSA won't help you much here - DSA may have some payoff for when it comes time to implement code and not make as many silly mistakes, like ""off-by-one"" issues (or when it comes time to vet an LLM's output, if you choose to use them to actually write code [which I don't recommend doing while you're _learning_, because you really want to learn from the ground up so you can adequately vet their output and more confidently/quickly accept or reject or modify/refactor their output]). LLMs can be useful, but whatever you do, you have to protect your own mental clarity and attention span - LLMs can easily exhaust it and cause more trouble than they're worth, depending on your skill level and how and when you use them.In the process of working on projects, ideally you also learn more and more about how to build whole systems, rather than just ""code"". This is why working ""full-stack"" on your own can be a good idea, even if you don't actually work in a role that is itself full-stack - it gives you exposure to a broader set of concerns that are all part of the building the whole system. Your value to a software company will be your ability to implement systems or at least your part of them, and hopefully in a thoughtful way that minimizes friction for your teammates.",SoSpongyAndBruised,2026-02-19 22:21:13,2,learnprogramming,t3_1r95fxw,False,

o5s9aqu,"Assuming you're really asking for backend (low-level programming), there are so many ideas to chase. \- Console emulators (chip8, NES, Gameboy) \- Mini OS (OSTEP + OSDev) \- Software rasterizer (bresenhams, projection, lin. alg) \- Raytracer (ref: ray tracing in one weekend) \- Graphics engine (OpenGL, etc.) \- Mini language (ref: crafting interpreters) \- Game using raylib (Tetris, Pacman, Bomberman) \- Implement some pathfinding algorithm with 2D viz \- Text editor (memory management, structures for undo/redo, persistence)You kind of have to browse around to find something that catches your interest. For me that was low-level graphics. I sincerely believe the exact technologies are not vital for internships, rather it's about showing your appetite for learning. Knowing OS fundamentals, and having practical projects with memory management, and cache-awareness in mind already knocks the majority of competitors out, especially for internships if you are targeting low-level domain (most go for latest and greatest shiny deployable frameworks).If backend is referring to servers, databases, and interfacing with web, I have no idea. For more closer to metal, I assume getting an Arduino starter kit and do some of the guided projects could be a good idea.It sounds like you simply need to do the reps with any type of project. I believe you don't really ""study"" programming. Rather, you start with something you want to create. Unless you are following a tutorial step-by-step (which I highly do not recommend), you have to be inquisitive and work your way backwards from the goal, to figuring out what's needed, and then figuring how to build those blocks.Naturally, based on problems you want to solve, you find that you want to express some computation, where you then realize that you need some language constructs to do so (just like normal language).As a personal aside, it wasn't until after Year 3 (of 5) in uni where I started doing any fully self-directed projects. I understand the ""feeling lost"" emotion well. My gateway was a 3D graphics course using Direct3D and reading various old and new blogs of seasoned graphics programmers, even when I barely understood most and half understood some.

Those are tools that let you build for multiple platforms using JavaScript. The same is true for Capacitor. These tools make more sense if you already have a solid grasp of web development.In regard to Java vs. Kotlin, you'd be using Kotlin. Java usage has mostly shifted into development of the actual Android OS itself, with Kotlin becoming the preferred language for apps, and Kotlin is way more pleasant to work with.So, it's hard to give a strong recommendation without a better understanding of what you're interested in and what you are trying to pursue. If your goal is to become a web developer who also builds mobile (and desktop) apps, then I'd pick Tauri (personally) or React Native (which is technically better, since it produces real native apps, with real native bindings).If you're starting from scratch and don't really care one way or the other, then Kotlin with Android Studio is probably the more natural choice.Beyond that, you can also build apps for every major operating system using C#/.NET, which is a nice middle ground. Colleges are more likely to teach C#, and a lot of enterprise software is built on C#/.NET. The same team that created TypeScript also created C#, so the two languages play nicely together as well (and have a lot of the same features) - which is a good lead-in to web development.And then there's Dart/Flutter, which I wouldn't recommend (I usually recommend against it), but it is intended for making cross-platform development ""easier"", so as a beginner, it'd be easier to pick up (at first).Point being... you can build mobile apps in whatever you want.

o5w3gcs,"Everyone has answered things really well, but I want to touch on the question about whether folder structure is essential and does it depend on the framework.While others are correct that folder structure is not bound, required, or essential; it is often very important to the build tools you may, or may not, be using. Different build tools whether they are used in JavaScript, Java, C/C++, all follow some standard folder structure. Most Java projects are built with Gradle, Maven, or Ant and the Java folder structure is pretty rigid among these. Cmake for C/C++ is less picky about folder structure as your program's include statements control much of that. React, Svelte, and many JavaScript frameworks also use their own folder structure. Even Rebar3 for Erlang has a fairly fixed structure it uses.Build tools automate building of final product code so they expect certain files to be in certain places. These can be changed in the build configuration, but then working with a team used to standard structure can be chaotic. Also, many build tools will create the folder structure when you request a new project to be built.So, if you are building projects within a team or for a business, the folder structure will likely be mandated and essential. Even if you are planning to share a project, using a standard folder structure is still highly recommended.

o5whdhf,"This is why I often say programming is easy, at least at this level. The real challenge is taking a specification (word problem) and turning it into code.One thing I can suggest is to take everyday tasks, that a person knows well, and turn them into a word problem and then turn that into code. It might be as something as simple as checking the mail. That might sound simple at first but you generally have to open a door or two, walk to the mail box, open the mail box, grab the mail and return. The more one thinks seriously about what appears to be a simple task, the faster one realizes how detailed one needs to be to get software to do the job. Creating the pseudo code becomes a challenge of iteratively walking through the code until you can actually get the mail. The interesting thing about checking the mail word problem, is that you can check your work by physically walking through your pseudo code.In any event there are lots of things in real life that can help you understand the conversion of tasks into code. The more ""everyday"" the task the more impressive the complexity of what a person does everyday not thinking about it. Brush your teeth in the morning and start to think about how all those actions would be expressed in code. Would the stroking back and forth, be a function to simplify your code.As for the OP I have to point out that this is an extremely common issue. That is turning written requirements into code and frankly it often has nothing to do with programming. However it is absolutely critical to becoming a good programmer. In the real world many times your specification might not be well defined causing one to do some research. That might mean reading a manual to get a device into a mode that you wan work with. The point is your word problems become outlines leaving out critical information you need to fill in. In other words in school you are lucky in that the word problems are generally complete, sometimes you need to figure out what a department really wants.",spinwizard69,2026-02-17 17:50:24,1,learnprogramming,t1_o5t2yst,False,

o6kf2es,"Have you tried using a fake instead of a mock?As an example, let's suppose you're mocking a storage layer, where your main class saves data. You unit test a function and you assert that when you tell it to do a series of operations and then save, it should write A, B, and then C to the storage layer.Now you change the code around and it outputs C, B, and then A to the storage layer. Your test fails because the mock was expecting calls in a specific order. Or maybe it's more complex, like now it write A and B in one transaction and then C in another transaction.It can be really hard to express in a mocking framework the idea that A, B, and C need to be saved, but the order and number of calls doesn't matter.So instead, write a ""fake"". A fake is a tiny, trivial implementation of the storage layer's interfaec, maybe it just keeps track of the objects that were saved in a HashMap or a sorted list.Instead of asserting that certain methods were called in a certain order, have your method write to the fake storage layer, then fetch the list of things written to the fake storage layer and assert that A, B, and C are in them.Now your code asserts that the end result is correct without being nearly as tightly coupled to the implementation details.

o6miqvi,"I have done many lectures on this subject, which are difficult to summarize in a Reddit comment, but I'll do my best.**What to test**Each unit of code has a contract. Input: it expects specific parameters of certain types and/or a specific starting state. Output: it returns a specific type and/or changes states. When choosing what to test, you want to test only public methods, whose contracts are not expected to change frequently. Do not test private methods directly unless they contain something particularly complicated. In that case, try to refactor the complicated bits into separate pure functions to reduce churn during later refactoring.You also want to design and edit your code in a way that avoids changing contracts unnecessarily. For example, add new parameters to the end of the list and make them optional, preserving the previous behavior in which they did not exist.If you find your contracts changing all the time, this is a problem with your code design. Not only does it make unit tests fragile, it makes coordination with other people and new features far more difficult than it needs to be. Read up on clean code strategies and code architectural patterns. **How to test**The most common issue I see in fragile tests is allowing state changes to fall through from test to test. You must start and stop every test at a neutral baseline state, not allowing tests to affect each other. Every test should be able to run by itself or in any random order compared to other tests. In fact, there are many test frameworks that provide a randomized run feature to help you find and prevent this form of fragility.To do unit testing correctly with non-pure functions, you must make sure to create fixtures, which are state controls. Before each test, your fixtures set up the correct state. After each test, you tear down those fixtures back to a neutral baseline. Do this using the test framework's built-in services. In class format, these are often methods named like setUp and tearDown. In spec format, they are named like beforeEach and afterEach.Each test has the following pattern:1. Set up fixtures, mocks, fakes2. If state may change, assert beginning state3. Call the function under test4. Assert returns if applicable 5. Assert state change if applicable6. Assert mocks/fakes were called as expected, including the expected parameters passed in7. Tear down fixtures, mocks, fakes",Beka_Cooper,2026-02-21 16:46:55,1,learnprogramming,t3_1rakpui,False,

o6kjs2b,"While I agree with the basic sentiment, one has to be careful: If the expected behavior is indeed that certain calls to the storage layer are done in a certain order, then the test must check for exactly that. If the expected behavior is ""data A, B and C are stored"", then the test should check for that and not care about the order of calls.In the end, it all boils down to understanding what the contract on interface level states: ""This function saves data by calling the storage layer"" does not say anything about how this is done or in which order. So, one can only check that once the function has been called, the data has indeed been stored. ""This function saves the data from the given data array in atomic write operations for each element of the array from first element to last element"" as interface contract describes a different behavior to check for - here the order and amount of calls to storage indeed matters.

You need to be able to answer most of them.E.g.:1. How std::map and std::unordered\_map are typically implemented?2. Why is virtual destructor needed?3. What is the diamond inheritance problem?4. Write a template specialization.5. What is std::lock\_guard, when is it used, why it even exists?6. Implement a singleton.7. Overload an operator.8. What is the caveat of using \[\] operator on standard maps? What is the alternative without this hidden trap?",VibrantGypsyDildo,2026-02-19 02:25:29,2,learnprogramming,t3_1r7wdll,False,

The people who benefit most from AI tools are the ones who understand what is happening under the hood. If you can reason about logic, data structures, and basic algorithms, you will use those tools better rather than being replaced by them.Also, you do not need to decide your life direction right now. Treat coding like a low cost experiment. Spend a few months building small things. Automate something in your daily life. Analyze some data.

And no matter how hard you study or what you accomplish, one person can’t know every language or navigate legacy code (in a single day) you have to maintain. AI gets a lot of hate, but…just being honest, you either stay on top of it or lose your job. You WILL learn the fundamentals and more because it’s the smart way to go. AI isn’t something you need to become a slave to. It’s something you use so you don’t get stuck. I’m still very much a beginner. I’m pretty solid with Python, but I’m not good with flask or SQLite, which is something I need at the moment. So I need a lot of help in that area along with building a web UI. My main problem with using AI is that AI isn’t really good for niche, edge-case applications. So I spend more time prototyping so I can capture the logic of what I want to do at every step along the way before writing the prompt. The flask route seems really straightforward to me, but I have to connect overything over HTML, JS, and CSS. For me, AI has really democratized programming and allowed me to do things I couldn’t do before. I can get stuff done and still learn as I go. AI hasn’t been all that helpful in troubleshooting. My personal rule is AI has three chances to get something right. If I can’t get what I need after three prompts, it’s tome to break down the logic and code in smaller steps.",Lost-Discount4860,2026-02-22 17:23:06,1,learnprogramming,t3_1rbnwzf,False,

If you find yourself asking the same questions over and over, that's a sign you're not retaining the knowledge. Treat the models like an interactive version of Stack Overflow that won't be snarky and lock your questions.As long as you are internalising the knowledge through actual practice writing code, then LLMs are just another tool you can use. Don't ever ask them to implement features for you. Use them as tools to get instant feedback on the code you write and your understanding of concepts. Also remember they can be stupid and wrong!

That is awesome for reasoning, resource bounds, and making performance predictable, but it also means you do not get general recursion or unbounded while loops without adding extra machinery. From a formal methods angle, that is a feature, not a bug, if you lean into it.If you allow unbounded loops or something like “loop until condition,” you are basically back to general purpose computation, and then the “loop centric” part is more about ergonomics and how you restrict or structure control flow.Two framing ideas that might help your design doc land with people: what is the smallest set of constructs you need besides loops (variables, arithmetic, conditionals), and what property do you want to guarantee (termination, time/space bounds, ease of verification). If you can say “Gamma Loop is intentionally total” or “intentionally resource bounded,” that becomes a clear conceptual advantage rather than just a vibe.Also, if you have even a tiny spec for the loop form and what is forbidden, folks can give much sharper feedback.

(at least that was the case at my university, I didn't actually watch this course in full)If you really only want to program and are worried that you need maths for that: don't. Just start, and if you happen upon a concept that requires maths, go and learn that, and only that.EDIT: Since you probably never had mathematics at university: It's hard work, but you don't actually need to be especially bright for the basics. It requires a lot of practice, as it basically teaches you a different way of thinking, which is required for computer science. Learning CS really is just learning a different way of thinking, and the only way to do that is to repeatedly bash your head into a wall until you break through. The wall is made of bricks. You don't have a helmet.EDIT2: Another advantage of lectures over books is that you get exercises / assignments to go with them.

Hidden non-noob features have no perceivable affordances, so users can’t discover them. When they are hidden behind the noob shield users can’t just gradually start to use more and more features.

A powerful app will by necessity have a lot of features when it’s a tool for professional’s inherently complex work. That userbase can deal with having to learn the app’s basic functions while being exposed to the existence of other more advanced functions.The subscriptions maximizing UX focus of trying to make e.g. Figma accessible for every stakeholder is plain damaging to the core user base.

Designers get to do their work of making changes in ways that maintain the integrity of the whole project (e.g. one page doesn’t suddenly use different words for things than the rest). They also get to make the change in a way that doesn’t f*** up their figma workflow.

Then the right place to make changes is nearly always way somewhere else in a component library rather than on the screen that the stakeholder is looking at.

Along the same time, people started seeing the upsides of strongly and statically typed languages as code and projects and teams started scaling.",CircumspectCapybara,2026-02-17 22:32:05,414,cscareerquestions,t3_1r7ks4e,False,

o5zd0lc,"One thing worth remembering is *why* Ruby and Rails were huge. It goes something like:At the time, backends were *huge* clunky things built out of Java, maybe .NET, and sometimes mainframes and COBOL. That means tons of Java-isms -- better bake a serial number into all of your classes in case you use native Java serialization to save sessions, but also you need an ORM with fifteen XML config files just so the ORM knows to set the `email` property to the `email` column, and that the `users` table goes to the `User` class. Except wait, you don't set the `email` property, you call `setEmail()` on the `User` class. And you don't create a `new User()`, you call a method on a `UserFactory`, which you need to get from the AbstarctDefaultFactoryImpl or whatever. And this isn't even Java 8, even a *simple* Java list looks like: List emails = new ArrayList();Yep, repeat `String` twice and `List` twice and generally be the most verbose, repetitive thing anyone had ever seen until Go gave us `if err != nil { return err; }` after every goddamned line.Or, at the other extreme, there was the LAMP stack -- stupidly-sloppy messes hacked together with Perl and PHP, the kind of thing people were building blogs out of. Wordpress was maybe the state of the art. PHP is a whole programming language that grew out of a glorified template language, so any notion of separating the view from the model was not really happening -- this is a world where you're taking some static HTML thing you built in DreamWeaver, renaming `.html` to `.php`, and adding a mysql query right to the middle of it with `` tags. IMO this explains a lot of why Facebook is the way it is -- it grew out of a tool that was built for adding a guestbook and a hit counter to your Geocities homepage.So Rails did a couple things: It cut out a ton of the boilerplate with ""convention over configuration"" -- if you have a `Users` model class and a `users` DB table, Rails can figure out that those are supposed to go together, and you only need to add configuration when you have something that doesn't fit the very obvious pattern. Ruby cut out more of the boilerplate by not making you repeat your type names five million times. It gave you a CLI tool that generates a working Rails project for you instantly, makes it super easy to get started filling in the blanks. It gives you enough structure that you're probably not building your whole app inside the HTML view like you would in PHP. On top of that, Ruby was a nicer language than most of the competition -- PHP and Perl are both pretty ugly, and Java doesn't even have lambdas.Other replies have pointed out things that made Rails less relevant -- more microservices and fewer monoliths, more web APIs and React and such instead of pure CRUD at the HTML level. But I think it's also because a lot of the basic ideas Rails had either ended up going way too far -- to do that `User``users` mapping, every Rails server needed a complex set of rules on how to pluralize English words! -- or ended up not being necessary for what they were trying to do. Like, turns out with decent type inference (Typescript, Golang), you can do strong, static typing and not constantly have to repeat yourself. Java and even C++ got lambdas, `var` and `auto`, and other basic quality of life code-level stuff.",SanityInAnarchy,2026-02-18 02:26:33,89,cscareerquestions,t3_1r7ks4e,False,

Similarly, I have seen the engineers I detest working with, constantly argue and are not fun to be around, make the same mistakes constantly, etc. complain about how the market is dead and they can't find a new position anywhere.Who you are and where you fall in these categories is really up to you.

Right now, everyone knows it is not as valuable as it is valued at, which is leading to the intense speculative bubble we're seeing.

Your 8 years of keeping a production app running is honestly more valuable than most people realize bc that shows you understand the full lifecycle, can handle real user problems, and know how to maintain code over time. The fact that you've dealt with race conditions, auth systems, and layered architecture tells me you're not just copying tutorials.For the interview prep, I'd brush up on basic SQL optimization, maybe review some common C# patterns, and be ready to walk through your architecture decisions on your main project. They'll probably ask you to solve a simple coding problem, but it's more likely to be ""write a method that does X"" rather than dynamic programming puzzles. As for the full stack vs backend question, honestly your Blazor experience might be more of an asset than you think as lots of .NET shops are curious about it but don't have anyone who actually knows it well. I wouldn't pivot away from mentioning it, especially since it shows you can handle the whole stack when needed. Small companies love that versatility because they don't have huge teams.

It may take a LONG time to pay off (jobs are especially hard to get right now) but eventually it will succeed. Hopefully you'll find a position that is better than this one.In the meantime, there might be ways for you to work around the problem within your current organization. This advice will be appropriate for some companies and not for others so consider your situation before applying it.Sounds like you've effectively been ""demoted"" by being assigned less valuable work. Also sounds like you aren't being given enough work to actually challenge you (""haven’t touched a line of code in 2.5 months"" ""just got assigned the most absurdly simple defect""). Maybe you should go ahead and ""promote"" yourself without asking for permission.Figure out who at the company WANTS the system rebuild that you thought was a good idea (""rebuilding the existing native application with my language of expertise that I’ve worked with & loved my entire career""). Maybe this is a product manager outside of the tech world, maybe it's a VP who doesn't have the clout to get things moving. (If there isn't anyone who wants this done... maybe it shouldn't be!) Talk with this person. Say that you aren't being challenged in your current position and you have some free time. Offer to build what they are looking for as a ""Proof of concept"". Invest some time and just BUILD the darn thing (it's amazing how much faster a ""skunkworks"" project can go. If you succeed, maybe you end up as the tech lead for the project (which would consist of releasing the ""POC"" that you built).As I said, it's not the right solution for all companies, but it CAN be effective in some places.

o6e7hjj,"Spent 6.75 years in my first job out of college in a defense contractor, and now am making my leave out of the defense life next month. It really depends on how much friction you want your next job search to be. It's easy to remain in the defense ecosystem, especially if you have a clearance, because getting interviews/callbacks from other defense contractors is much easier after having a proven track record in defense. It's also a very comfortable job outside of the work aspect; a 9/80 work schedule is game changing if you are in company that does that and the slow work pace can be relaxing. I honestly don't think I'll ever attain that same level of WLB anywhere else outside of defense after this. I will definitely consider defense again when I am older and ready to just coast to retirement. I think these factors are huge reason people get stuck in defense; it's what I've seen from my older, high tenured colleagues do and people that have left my company to go to other defense companies.I will say that defense is varied and even teams within the same company can have wildly different directives and experiences. I was fortunate to be in a team that got to do really cool stuff that also had a more relaxed pace, and I still got to learn a lot about SWE at the same time. Some of my colleagues that got placed into the big money maker team in my company were working left and right on different projects every month from what it seemed like. My recommendation is that you give this a fair shot for 1-2 years and make an adjustment if needed.You may actually enjoy the work you do and discover that your team isn't as slow or not productive for learning as you may initially thought, or you completely hit the mark on your initial assessment. As a general life advice, use this opportunity to really isolate what you want from a job, and align your next actions to directly support that goal and don't compromise it just because it's easy. If you want out, commit to finding a job that fits your desired career track or work towards joining a top company that can give you that clout you need to work at your end goal role.

I don’t know if HR sends generic rejections or just ghosts you if we reject.Phone round - I stopped doing this because i felt it’s pretty useless, it was useful screening tool when we didn’t do virtual interviews and instead had in person interviews.

Did you come up with a proposal for leadership? How much coordination tax would this take?

There are plenty of resources online to learn at your own pace, but if you don't want to teach yourself then that's not a good option.""Obviously I'm not a vibe coding monkey since I have the theoretical and programmer brain from my CS degree"" Gunna be honest, this is sounds super hypocritical to say right before you talk about how your old major project was completely vibe coded. Maybe you would learn something if you had to build the same project without Claude. It's super easy to understand code especially code that Claude writes. It's a whole lot harder to think of that logic and write code from the ground up. Think about how easy it is to read a book and how much more difficult it would be to write a book.From the sounds of it, it looks like you don't like CS but kept going with the degree and now don't want the last 4 years to be a waste.

Promotions from Associate to mid and mid to Senior require only a ""budget confirmation"" in business justification, there is a maximum amount we can spend on promotions each year. In my experience, we've never exceeded that budget so these promotions always pass their business justification.Starting with senior to staff, then staff to principal and principal to senior principal the business justification becomes stricter. Staff is defined as a role that works ""across teams"", usually within an org. Principal is inter-org work and sr. principal is company level work. We must justify why we need individuals operating in those roles. For Staff it's not too bad, we produce a list of they type of work and project work that requires tech/engineering focus aligning teams (usually building something global/working directly with internal customer teams etc etc).Principal and Sr. Principal things get much harder. There's really not that much work at that level. My org of 100 has one principal, who focuses on cross-org database work, and one principal who is working torwards sr. Principal by focusing on aligning our entire orgs tech with other org tech leads. I really have no need for more than that.I have about 10 Staff engineers however, some recently promoted into that role from Senior. (We do a lot of inter-team work/support). They are all told if they want to make principal, it is /unlikely/ they will get the role within our current org (we'd either have to double in size, not likely, or one of the two principals would have to leave and require a backfill).For those staff engineers that want to ""grow"" by title change I encourage my managers to do several things. First, keep a constant eye on opening roles in the company, anything principal they should consider having their staff report apply to it and be considered. Likewise there are some other career paths, such as engineering manager (if they want to stop focusing on being an Individual contributor) or even other leadership roles (technical program manager etc). And lastly, yes, it is not a crime if my managers support their staff engineers in their next career step outside the company (referrals, helping be a career mentor, assessing other jobs etc). All of this is to say, yes, at some point, a ""promotion"" must consider business need, and that business need should get harder the more senior the role is. Managers should focus on the realities and be aware that sometimes growing people means having them leave the team or company, but it should happen at more senior levels.If your company doesn't have good definitions of what various levels of engineers should be doing for the company, I'd start there.",maxfields2000,2026-02-22 19:49:59,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1rbv6qc,False,

o6u5v2f,"Promotion requiring a corporate need is actually the norm, it just isn't usually made explicit. Now, early career, you can generally show ""yes, we need person at L+1, we expect our L to grow into that role"", but major career transitions (Senior, or Staff) generally require a business need.In many companies, this is actually hidden by the modern practice of retrospective promotion, where you promote people after they demonstrate a sustained performance of L+1. Since there was L+1 work for them to do to demonstrate that, it is a lot easier to demonstrate a need. But it is also normal for people to be in a position where there are no career growth opportunities for them on their current team, or even at their current company. After all, if the company has a CTO, and you are ready to take on a CTO role, you are probably going to have to leave. A good manager helps employees realize that and make that transition.Think about it this way, if you tried to open up a new headcount for a Senior or Staff level role, would you be able to justify it with the work your team has to do? If you could, you can make the case for a promotion.

Is there a need for someone to increase the scope of work they’re during and provide further technical value to a line of business? If so, make that argument and push for a promotion. If not, that’s just an honest assessment of the business’ needs. The way I see it, if a team’s responsibilities evolve then the needs of the team change and it’s up to the manager to facilitate that change.Think of it this way:You have a business and all you sell are apples and the market only has a demand for 100 apples a year. Would you care if your employee was skilled enough to sell 100 vs 1000 apples? Probably not, right?

The farther you go up the ladder, every company will eventually hit a level where the need simply does not exist at all times for everyone.If that level is at very low junior levels, I'd be more worried you're in a company that is very focused on cost savings compared to growth. That's just not the kind of place to be if you or your reports are primarily focused on professional growth.What you describe is the norm for most jobs outside of growth tech companies. You climb the ladder by applying for a different job that you must compete with others for, not by growing in place like is common in tech.If you want to be an ethical manager, you should be upfront with your reports about this. If you can make it happen, helping your reports find those roles elsewhere in the company where they can be successful is amazing, but that is often thankless work in situations like this. It can pay off for you down the road though, because those same reports may open doors for you on other teams or at other companies in the future.A lot of managers in this situation make the short sighted choice to say what they need to their reports so that they won't leave, even if it's detrimental to them.

""DevOps, Access Controls (RBAC, DAC, MAC, ABAC), Cloud Computing, Machine Learning / AI implementation, SaaS, Encryption / Decryption and Security, Concurrency, Distributed Systems"" - very hard for a recruiter or interviewer to believe that you have all these skills as a new grad without any work experience. and just speaking a bit from personal experience, as someone who's scanned a few resumes and interviewed people: candidates who list this many skills on their resume tend to not do that well during interviews. if my team was passed a resume like this, i (and my colleagues) would likely pass on you.5. i know you don't have much relevant work experience, but you can frame extracurriculars as experience as well (so long as they're tech related in some way)",LsForDays,2026-02-17 01:51:47,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1r6sdkf,False,

I think learning kotlin and building apps is a great way to boost your resume and show you know how to build real systems. The industry wants to move towards Kotlin Multiplatform to share business logic between iOS/android. I would recommend building your apps in KMP and not neglecting iOS if you're building on your own and not for a company.That said, at least when I graduated tech companies preferred to hire a leetcode grinder with no android experience rather than an experienced android developer who couldn't leetcode. My intro to android development was applying to amazon, passing the leetcode rounds, and getting thrown on an android team with no prior android experience. Unless Android is truly your passion, I wouldn't commit to only applying to android roles. This career is a lot about luck and taking opportunities where they come. From my experience leetcode, networking, and career fairs with the goal of an internship are likely going to be a better use of time than diving deep into mobile dev.

o69goo2,"1. I'm agnostic about the specific companies I work for. I just insist they be tech companies where I'll be a profit source not a cost center. Historically I went for startups with business plans I couldn't drive a truck through and generally early enough to get a significant fraction of the company with a transition to SaaS in 2010. Since 2017 I've been more worried about accumulating assets for retirement and worked for public companies with liquid stock.So I don't bookmark specific companies.I hadn't heard of half the public companies I've joined since 2017 and one of those two was the best I've worked for in over thirty years.2. I don't know how often timing was an issue in my Q4 2025 job search because I don't have visibility into whether I failed a resume screen or they chose someone else, although I got offers from companies where the job posting had been up for months and where they took up to two months to get back to me.3. In my Q4 2025 job search I made a spread sheet because I applied to many (62 versus at most a handful) more companies than I did historically and that was the most convenient way to keep track.4.

Google hired me in spite of a reported 0.2 - 0.7% acceptance rate, although to be fair that position came through an inbound recruiter contact.5.

o6bem9m,"I totally get the HR frustration thing. The screening process feels so disconnected from actual job performance, especially when you're more direct or don't play the corporate small talk game well. I've noticed this pattern too where founders tend to hire differently than HR departments do.To answer your questions: I do bookmark companies but honestly it's pretty manual and messy. I use a basic spreadsheet to track applications because most job platforms are terrible for this. Timing is huge though, I've definitely gotten rejections that felt like they already had someone in mind before posting. The ghosting stats would actually be super valuable, like if I knew a company had a 70% ghost rate I'd probably still apply but adjust my expectations and not put as much energy into customizing everything.The biggest BS right now is probably the AI resume screening stuff. You're getting filtered out by algorithms before any human even sees your application, and nobody tells you why. It's this black box where you could be perfect for the role but get rejected because you didn't use the right keywords or format. Companies are posting jobs they're not even seriously trying to fill, just collecting resumes or satisfying some internal requirement.Super cool bc I'm also building something in this space too (called Sprout) because the whole system feels broken. We're trying to give people more visibility into company response patterns and help optimize applications for these screening systems.

I think the bigger issue isn't just *how* you search, it's that you're fighting a volume game where everyone else is spending 2 hours per application while you're doing the same, which mathematically means you can only reach like 10-15 companies a month max before burnout hits. The unconventional approach that's actually working for people now is automating the repetitive parts without losing quality.Not talking about spammy mass-blast stuff, but actually letting software handle the grunt work of finding roles that match your criteria, customizing your materials for each ATS, and submitting at scale so you can focus energy on the companies that actually respond. I've heard really good things about SimpleApply for this exact use case since it handles the end-to-end application process and lets you reach way more opportunities without spending 40 hours a week on form filling. To answer your actual questions though: I track in a spreadsheet (Notion got too heavy), I absolutely would skip companies with 70% ghost rates if I knew that data, and the biggest BS right now is take-home assignments that are clearly just free consulting work.The fact that we're all pretending 8-hour unpaid projects are normal interview steps is insane. good luck with your product btw, sounds like you're tackling real pain",garvit__dua,2026-02-20 15:49:41,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1r92ybd,False,

I'm on the product side, so maybe stepping over my skis here, but I had several conversations with people who feel like they wanted to transition into product management but didn't know how to translate their experience; so a lot of that time was helping them draw the connections.
