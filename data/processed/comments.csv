Some candidates tried inviting an AI ""note taker"" to the Teams call, that was denied access and was an immediate red flag (not one of them \*asked\* if they could do so).We then had people who seemed to hesitate before answering any question. Once or twice, nerves, every single question? It's pointing the way of stalling before waiting to see the text appear for them to regurgitate! There's also the tell of the eye darting off screen to read something... could be notes, but... given what they then said, it just gave the impression of reading from either someone else googling on their behalf, or AI LLM output.But every single one was derailed by this one simple trick... as hiring manager, I was interviewing the person for them, not their technical skills. There was some of that, but more in approach and mentality, rather than specific abilities, that would come in the next round. So I would just say to the candidate ""You have listed these ETL tools on your CV, which is your favourite and why?""Every single time, the ones reading AI output would turn into a marketing bot, sounding like an advert for the tools, bullet point after bullet point. Not one of them highlighted a favourite without being asked again, and then couldn't actually answer definitively as to why they chose that above another, almost as if they'd just picked one at random. The humans answering that question would do so in a conversational manner, often immediately blurting out their favourite and then going through the pros and cons as to why.I can see the appeal of using AI to help, to act as a pointer to guide your answers, especially in areas of theory where you're rusty because you've been at the coalface for a while.

It’s like your first programming language, hard at first, but after that, new languages (or tools) are mostly syntax and platform differences.In data engineering, the core problems never change:* Where is the data stored?* Where does compute run?* How do I move data or compute efficiently?* How do I model and serve the data?Whether it’s Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, or Spark-on-whatever, you’re solving the same underlying problems with different interfaces. Many “new” platforms are abstractions over familiar engines (Spark) anyway.Most content creators aren’t learning everything from scratch each time; they’re reapplying the same approach to new tools. Once you’ve done that a few times, picking up a new stack is a breeze. Also, free tiers and cheap cloud setups make experimentation easy. You don't have to break your bank to spin up a Spark cluster.

You will need to spend more time on a dev setup (e.g. unit tests are awfully slow without a spark connect server which you fire up each morning), but you also get some goodies such as Spark UI/History Server and a really powerful and stable API.- As you are using Delta, I would be cautious with duckdb. Afaict, write support is not yet there, and even for reads I had undocumented not-implemented errors bubble up from the internal c++ code (on1.41 if I remember correctly). The API there does not yet look super stable.- On the off chance that you are in a corporate environment where your development machines run windows, strongly prefer polars over spark.

Everyone rushed pushing pipelines into production without proper models, processes, conventions and standards in place. Data Modeling is not easy skill to obtain and requires lot of effort, time and multitude skills. My current teams uses data vault and dimensional modeling frameworks, it takes time to get to final data marts and views on top but we rarely have pipeline issues (DBT, Snowflake). We spend lot of time upfront, which saves lot of money and reduce development time and effort down the line, which is the right way of doing things. When we face any ELT issues, then we go back to the data model and analyze on how to de-couple, optimize the model without breaking the grain at times. It saves lot of load times in some of those big fact tables.  The issues I also noticed and I made those mistakes as well, shove tons of metrics into a fact table and calculate them at the fact table level. Instead those metrics should be calculated at one layer up (business vault or raw vault) layer and just load them as is into fact table. Fact table should be a simple select * from xyz tables. There's so many things that can go wrong in a pipeline and data model can solve many of those.

Unfortunately CTOs will lap it up because data modelling takes time and expertise, and therefore money. AI produces superficially easy results that appear reasonable enough on first glance. But AIs don’t actually know anything about your business so they will confidently tell you things that are completely wrong, or which are true but not the correct answer to your question. Data modelling is not primarily a technical discipline, it is about extracting human-understandable meaning from what is otherwise just a bunch of ones and zeroes. It requires understanding your business deeply, and understanding what the business cares about and needs to measure.  This meaning is often not directly available in your raw data. You have to translate it for a business user.Now this is where the AI grifters will tell you “oh sure the AI isn’t great at that now but it’s going to get better with better models”. And sure, it will. But even when you have better models that can more accurately translate the user’s intent into a correct answer, you will still have the problem that each individual user is having a separate conversation with an AI. Bob might ask for revenue figures for last month, the AI asks him how to define revenue and gives him a correct answer based on his definition. Jenny has a separate conversation with the AI and gives a slightly different definition and the AI gives her a correct but DIFFERENT answer. So how do you fix this situation and ensure that Bob and Jenny get the exact same answer for revenue? You have to make sure there is a source that has the correctly calculated and verified definition of revenue ready for the AI to use. And what do we call this process? Data modelling!If anything, data modelling only gets more important in the age of AI. Since in the past when you had highly technical data and BI analysts answering the questions for you, you could rely on them having enough knowledge and expertise to work around the complexities and problems of the data. But in a world where every Bob, Jenny, and Harry with no technical knowledge expects to be able to ask the AI for answers themselves, you better be damn sure that it is working off a highly curated and verified source.",evlpuppetmaster,2026-01-14 22:28:43,2,dataengineering,t3_1qcw5qe,False,

It's not just one pattern though, it's sticking with whatever pattern makes sense for your company and ensuring it doesn't end up in a pile of irreconcilable shit. I don't see a huge reason to do dimensional modeling anymore other than your downstream tools may like it and it's useful if you have a lot of cross-subject rate calculations that benefit from conformed dimensions. A lot of businesses don't need that though and are fine with stuff like OBTs and master data and those help them move faster.I am also skeptical that we are going to see a lot of usefulness with LLMs and data any time soon. I think AI is very useful as a tool to help build pipelines and tools, but not as much for accessing data right now. Data models can be massive with lots of tables, columns and semantic descriptions for the content, so you end up flooding the context window and confusing the model (most of which is irrelevant context to the problem). A lot of the definitions are weird so don't align well with the model's training and people also ask the same question 20 different ways, which can lead to inconsistent answers. The way I have seen people trying to make AI systems that work is by slowly building up the model and keeping it small (i.e. not the enterprise model you are used to). So in the end it can only answer simple questions like ""tell me how much revenue we earned from product X in the last three months"". Given how much time you spend building and tuning the model until you feel like it works most of the time, isn't it faster to just give them a dashboard with the same capability and better accuracy?

How much data are you joining per row, as in what is the content of the columns you're joining (if this is big this also causes problems)? Are you increasing the number of rows with these joins?

Try to see what's going on using the Spark UI while it's running to see what's taking so long, or what's going wrong.I think repartitions and partitions will mess up your performance. Repartitions will be pointless because I think Spark will reshuffle with the next join anyway, and persists make it more difficult for Spark to optimize the entire plan and may take up space on memory / disk, which you may already be lacking.If column renaming seems to mess up your execution plan try to do all of the column remaining before the joins (so rename columns for each dataset first) and/or do all the renaming at the end. I don't see how your action plan would result in anything other than a bunch of BroadcastHashJoins with no shuffling in between this way, given all of the joins are joining small tables to a large table on the same unique ID.Also check how much memory each executor is using and how the data is distributed across your workers.

nyivemw,"I have made this kind of transition from analytics to data engineering, so here's my 2 cents:I'd say Designing Data-Intensive Applications would be a good book if you really want to learn some foundational stuff, especially if you already have somewhat of a comp sci background. I don't think this information is really a hard requirement for getting started though.Data engineering is just so incredibly broad. So much of your day to day job is dictated by what size company you end up applying at as well as the industry. For example, Kafka is a foundational piece of tech for a high percentage (forget the actual number) of fortune 500 companies. But it's also totally overkill for many smaller companies who may not need near-real-time analytics or near-real-time data processing.I'd say to become very comfortable with SQL (postgres and one data warehousing dialect such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery), Python, and dbt. While some may classify dbt as an ""Analytics Engineer"" tool, I think it's a great bridge between the worlds of data analyst and data engineering. Plus it's very common at companies of many different sizes.Then become comfortable with some form of orchestration tool such as Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, or some equivalent of those. For Airflow, there is a MWAA local runner docker image that might be useful for running a local version of Amazon's managed Airflow instance. Just search ""github MWAA local runner"" to find the repo which should have instructions. This is way easier and cheaper than running a real airflow instance.Maybe just read up on data ingestion tooling such as Airbyte, Fivetran, or Meltano, just to fill in that gap so you understand how transactional data gets loaded into a data warehouse (ELT is a good term to know/research).At that point, I'd say the knowledge you've acquired is transferrable to most tools that small to mid-sized companies would require (or at least desire) for an entry level data engineer position.Good luck!",chmod764,2026-01-09 02:38:31,10,dataengineering,t3_1q7sc09,False,

nyqmjvh,"Disclaimer: I work for LanceDB, and I wrote most of its catalog integrations. Someone saw this post and sent to me so here I am writing my first Reddit reply lolLance does support most of the catalog on the market, check out this page: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/) I guess I did a bad job marketing these features. I did publish a few blogs, but mostly under the context of integration with compute engines, like [https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/](https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/) and [https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/) . For all the supported catalogs, you can basically use Lance side by side with your Iceberg datasets.But I think you raised a great question - ""anyone actually cataloging their lance datasets? or is everyone just yolo-ing it"". I did these integrations because we do have real customers using them. But I do see a common trend that data engineers in enterprise corporations that have data lake, data warehouse or data lakehouse setups, and trying to integrate Lance for AI features tend to want catalog support. For the frontier labs AI engineers, they tend to just prefer having storage-only solution and yolo-ing it.To bridge that gap, I also did one catalog within Lance, the Directory Namespace: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/) . It is basically a catalog living in a directory, backed by a Lance table, so everything still stays purely in storage. It is also compatible with just a plain directory of Lance tables, which is typically how people start using lance format, when they do pip install lancedb and create a table. In general, most of the users I interact with treat embedding as a part of real data assets. You can definitely store multiple versions of embeddings generated by different models for different use cases or just compare their effectiveness and switch over time. That is actually one key use case for Lance, which is you start with a table with just a single column, maybe images or videos. You continue to do data evolution - add embedding columns, caption columns, feature columns over time, and they accumulate and become a very wide table. That becomes your entire multimodal data asset. Check out some case studies with for example Netflix [https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/](https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/), Runway: [https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/)",Early_Watercress_413,2026-01-10 05:32:34,9,dataengineering,t3_1q8ble3,False,

So on one level, your modelling should be there to be discovered (i.e. already designed)On the flip side, there may be things that are implementation specific or which will facilitate more performant operation if you structure your data-model just-so. There's a creative tension there that needs some judgement to negotiate, and sometimes, there'll be a shift or some contextual thing that changes that means suddenly it's time to tweak your implementation model again. You need some freedom to be able to do that - but it should be constrained - go too far off-piste and nobody will understand what you're up to.Back to the question, if you've got multiple dev streams working in the same area, it pays to have a canonical representation that they can all agree on (whether they're human or machine) to support data-sharing and integration later on - therefore, there has to be some design-first approach to data - at least at some level.If your approach to that is to all agree on some canonical higher-level model, then you can handle implementation-specific choices by always providing a well documented mapping from your system's model back to the canonical one and get the best of both worlds.",ResidentTicket1273,2026-01-08 09:07:44,4,dataengineering,t3_1q76ve8,False,

Store as JSON. Why? For SSoT and what if the supplier of that API goes out of business, changes their API in some way, that breaks your code? What if in your dataframe the tuple you extract as a table, you're not pulling all entites or all columns - then the business wants you to add those extra columns, retroactively from Day 1 you've been gathering.

Staging is usually truncate/load style, and uses Datalake functionality for ingestion - Python isn't needed here at all. Python only for reading from APIs and other distant sources, not for moving data around in the database.Python has another function - for ML - where Python does extensive transformations by reading Bronze & Silver (or even the raw Datalake data) to ""invent"" new data that is then fed back into a Staging layer.

So the thinking becomes things like where this pipeline will actually break, what happens when volume doubles, what can fail safely and what cannot, and what’s expensive to recompute versus cheap to store. If you’re not on a DE project right now, the closest substitute is to simulate real pain. Take a public dataset and design ingestion, transformations, and reporting, then deliberately change assumptions like schema changes, late arriving data, backfills, or higher volume, and force yourself to optimize for cost and reliability instead of elegance. Books and blogs help with vocabulary, but most architectural thinking comes from asking what the simplest thing is that won’t hurt you later, then being wrong a few times.

You'd learn whole lot more if you were to build your own pipeline portfolio, load them on GitHub. Perhaps, look into bootcamps if that interest you at all. 3) Data Analyst is generally an entry point into data field.

Job market right now is pretty harsh, will not make sense to leave a good paying job. Take full advantage of FAANG stocks, benefits and their free online courses taught by FAANG on coursera. Check with HR to see if transition is possible as an internal employee into tech, what would be the process. Find out data engineers internally on outlook, teams, slack and setup 1-on-1 with them, ask all kinds of questions about the skills needed, about their career path, etc. 5) The most fundamental skill required for any data role is SQL, there's no shortcut to that and one cannot survive without knowing SQL at good level. From here skills will pivot based on the role. Ex: Data Engineers require strong data modeling, distributed systems (ex: Databricks, snowflake) storage and compute skills.

Snowpipes can be triggered when a new file appears. Airflow deposits the file in the DL.Then a staging area (schema) that links to the landing area and allows hashing to eliminate dupes. No transformations here. All columns varchar. A reject schema for data that cannot fit into bronze due to an error. Then Medallion architecture for schemas bronze, silver, gold. Bronze (column transformations to correct types) from the staging. Any data rows that do not conform go to reject schema. Also Bronze is a great place for SCD2 tables. Silver is new & inferred data that is valid but doesn’t exist in bronze. Like splitting customers by geographical zones based on their address. It can make sense for some silver tables to be SCD2, but that’s rare. For geolocation you go get another single source of truth, stage it and bronze it. Then the silver combines two different bronze tables. The silver geolocation could be scd2 for tracking the moves that PK did. And so on. To meet all Gold requirements, for dimensions and facts. Gold is dimensional tables that Kimball and Snowflake are famous for. DIM and FACT. Using Airflow for pushing the data in the Medallion layers is standard practice. To go from BigQuery directly to Snowflake FACT, this is called a Proof Of Concept. Nothing wrong with that. Suggestion, put it in a Dev environment and build a Prod environment. Dev & Prod (maybe UAT eventually) can simply be different database names, same Snowflake account, same Datalake account. You do NOT want the PowerBI people doing their own “fill in the blanks“ that’s how you get data silos. They Will Do This !!!For example (true life example) the PowerBI people will go get their own geolocation data from god knows where and make mistakes, so that Sales Dept will have X$ in one zone and Finance Dept will have Y$ in the same zone for the same time period, as each Dept will have a different PowerBI person. Data must be centralized. For SSoT to work, and in every data row identity the source system for each PK. Maybe as part of your naming convention for the column. Don’t be afraid of typing long column names. Use acronyms when it makes sense.

nytazku,"u’re running into the “founder says compliance” problem with zero policy attached. Before you redesign everything, force one clarity step: what exact requirement are we following? (“EU data must stay in EU”, “India must stay in India”, etc.). “Each country in its own region” is usually not the real rule, it’s the vibe.If data residency is actually required, then yeah: you can’t do Firebase → Bq → Snowflake US for everyone and call it compliant. The sane pattern is raw + PII stays in-region, and only aggregated/anonymous data can move cross-region (if allowed). Practically that means separate regional stacks (EU BigQuery dataset + EU Snowflake / or whatever) and your Airflow just orchestrates per-region configs. Start with 2 regions (EU + US), keep schemas identical, and create a “global” layer that’s aggregates only. Biggest footgun is mixing PII across borders and hoping to “fix later”, get the rule written down first, then architect.",AccomplishedTart9015,2026-01-10 16:59:56,1,dataengineering,t3_1q92eti,False,
nzdhmh4,"Man, I feel your pain. Being the only data person at a startup is a trial by fire. Your founder is right to be concerned about regional compliance, it's a huge headache waiting to happen if you don't address it early. We had a similar situation at my company. We're a SaaS platform, and we started getting customers in the EU and APAC. Suddenly, we had to deal with GDPR, various data residency requirements, and a whole bunch of other fun stuff. Our initial setup was a mess data scattered across different databases and cloud services, no clear understanding of which customer data resided where, and absolutely zero auditability. It was a compliance nightmare. The initial thought was S3 and Iceberg like your mentor mentioned. That adds a ton of complexity in terms of infrastructure and data management. Imagine having to manage multiple S3 buckets and Iceberg catalogs, one for each region? Plus, you'd still need compute instances for processing, potentially Snowflake instances per region as you mentioned. The operational overhead alone would be insane, not to mention the cost. What we ultimately did was implement a virtual data platform that sits on top of our existing infrastructure. It basically created a unified view of all our data, regardless of where it was physically stored. The really cool part was that it automatically discovered relationships between different datasets and identified Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It even flagged data quality issues, like duplicate customer records with slightly different spellings. This would have taken us weeks to untangle manually. Once we had that unified view, we could easily define data policies based on region. So, for example, any data tagged as EU customer data automatically adheres to our GDPR compliance rules. The platform also provides a complete audit trail, so we can easily prove to regulators that we're compliant. And here's the thing that really saved our bacon: we built automated data pipelines using a no-code interface on top of all of this. Before, marketing and sales were constantly bugging the data team to pull reports, create custom dashboards, and integrate data from different sources. It was a huge time sink. Now, they can do most of that themselves with the no-code tools, freeing up the data team to focus on more strategic projects. It sounds like you are running into very similar problems. The company we used has a referral program, so I'm happy to connect you. Full disclosure, I get a little something if they end up helping you out. But honestly, it was such a game-changer for us that I'd recommend them even if I wasn't getting a kickback. They really helped us get our data under control and avoid a major compliance disaster.

Since you've been working as a DE for a number of years and you're trying to over-employ (?!) I'll assume somewhere at the mid-level. I'll note that I've primarily worked at startups so mid-level in my mind may have higher requirements or expectations than mid-level at MNCs.At the mid level or senior level, I'd expect a DE to get assigned a few tickets at the beginning of a sprint and, during standup, note that they're looking for a new ticket if they're done with their existing work. I'd also expect them to keep us abreast of any developments in their work so it doesn't fall behind, etc.For ad hoc requests, if there does not exist a triage system (for example: if no one picks this up in 15 minutes, it's fair game for anyone and respond to the request) then I would recommend suggesting one. If the style is ""whoever sees it first"" (like my job right now) then either the DEs must adapt to that style or communicate with one-another to enforce another style (like triage and sprint protectors or something); to ignore ad hoc requests or to require others to triage is putting extra work on the team --- and it seems like you've already been talked to about it, so it's possible that the team doesn't love that you don't pick up ad hoc stuff. The big word here is _communication_, and it's extremely important to have team-wide communication open.""Oh, but my job is so hard, and it's impossible to do XYZ...!""

Then immediately go to work on a slightly more complicated project, which you should also deploy within a few days. Then add a database and deploy that within a few days. Etc. Your big problem isn't that you don't understand everything about code, it's that you can't code on your own. There is a huge difference there. It isn't even the same topic. Keep learning but consider all lessons to be an expense you have to pay to build a project. All projects should be as inexpensive as possible. Learn the bare minimum to get building again. When you've built and deployed at least two non-trivial full-stack projects and you feel comfortable with a programming language, a full-stack framework, a database language, a testing framework, and a deployment strategy, then you can start researching better design patterns.

You jsut sit there typing, pushing buttons all day. A monkey could do it."" ... Next up is the plethora of books that promise ""Zero to Hero"" in what ever language or ""Learn X in 24 hours!"" or what ever learn quick scheme flavor of the month that flooded the market in the late 90's and early 2000's... lots of people bought into that. I'll admit, I flipped through many of them - usually at the library, I tried not to buy them if I could help it - some were decent, but not many. Most were jsut fluff and not worth it. Those were quickly replaced with BootCamps and youTube videos promising the same. Which leads us back to point one... people thinking it's easy, when in fact it isn't. The next problem people run into is that they vastly underestimate how big and vast programming really is. How many languages there are. And how complex those languages are. They become so overwhelmed, they don't know where to start. That leads to the inevitable posts of ""How do you experts memorize all this shit?"" ... hint: we don't. If I actually memorized everything I've come across throughout my 40+ years, my brain would melt. So I index stuff. I remember patterns. I memorize the important things, but for the most part, 90% of programming is pattern recognition and realizing ""wait a sec... I've seen this before... where was it...."" and digging up some old code, or googling some key words. Do it enough times, you stop having to do that, and it just becomes second nature. It becomes a habit. I wouldn't say memorized, but it becomes habitual.That leads to the third mistake - underestimating the amount of time investment needed. I just ran across a post, I forget which subreddit it was in, but the poster was asking where he could find the best place to learn c the quickest because he has a test next week. What? Excuse me? No other context. So no indication of how much he needs to know, but still, you can't really learn a new language from nothing in a week. Maybe some basics, but still. At this point he's going need a chef because he's cooked. And the last point - using the wrong approach. Youtube videos. Sigh. YTV are fine for shyort quick intro or quick how-tos, but you need (or should) already have an understanding or a background in what you're learning. It shouldn't be a place to learn programming from ground up. That said, I am aware of a FEW youtubers that have produced excellent quality tutorials, they are the exception, the outliers. Most YTV tend to fall more into the ""you need to have some knowledge or background"" in advance before starting. People get frustrated with that. What they really need is a well laid out, ""start here at Point A, progress to Point B, Then C, end at Point Z"" progressive lesson. Something structured. There's a lot of those available online, many for free too. Some are more rigid and structured than others, some a bit more flexible. But the point is they are laid out in a ""before you can run a marathon, you have to learn how to crawl first. But you also need to learn to also stand too before walking.""

nywnte6,"I'm going to go out on a limb and argue this: It's not programming, it's the way school taught you how you should learn. School education is built on spiral patterns and a tonne of scaffolding. Both of these together make the natural position of learners so that it is clear what they should do to solve a given problem, so if they don't know what to do the assumption is that it is your fault. When in reality, learning is complicated, messy, and difficult. I'll give you an example. In maths, let's say that we are learning how to move variables around an equation. We provide the proof, completed worked examples, worked examples that are partially solved with hints, partially solved worked examples without hints, simple problems that are basically worked examples without hints, and some problems that can be breadcrumbed through multiple worked examples above. The end result is that you probably can go from start to bottom without encountering any trouble. Teachers might make questions that are tricky, compound, or both, but you've probably encountered *everything* before. The problem is that you've never learned how to synthesise something new (to you), and that's what you are trying to do here. I'll give you an example. You might have learned how to make an object. You might have even learned how to assign a variable to an object. But when you have to make your own simple data structure that stores a bunch of data like an array, but can dynamically add and remove stuff without empty spaces or resizing arrays ... well, all of the steps to smash your face into designing or inventing a linked list are really, fuffing, hard.So, what happens is that learners sit there and go: ""Man, I feel that fancy maths is easier than this because I always know what I'm doing,"" because they've hit a problem that could have a dozen or more possible solutions. Instead of simply accepting that they don't know and starting problem-solving, they just feel bad.I'm also going to extend a programmer's olive branch: I've been programming for twenty years. I'm not bad at it. I've built all sorts of complicated systems in multiple languages. Yet, every single day I'll be coding something, and I'll mutter to myself ""holy fuff I'm stupid"" because I couldn't solve some problem. I also couldn't tell you how long I have smashed my face into problems trying to understand how to build it, only to discover that once I learned the underlying systems, it was actually pretty simple (after I did a lot of work to learn new stuff). This is natural. In fact, I often wonder if you don't feel like this regularly, you probably aren't programming. edit: Lastly, I've been learning how to write novels. Not really to do anything with, but just to tell stories. I'm constantly frustrated at how hard it is to express what is in my brain in words.

Another thing that might help is Python with its very easy to understand object model.OOP requires a different way of thinking - kind of a rewiring of the brain to look at things differently. In OOP it's more a dialog between the individual objects than the sequential command patterns we are used to in procedural programming. In OOP you more or less ""talk"" to the objects. You ask them to do things for you. You ask them to change their internal state if needed (yes, the ""immutability"" topic will now come up and I might anger a few people with my mutable approach).My breakthrough with OOP was when I got into my current job in Industrial Automation working with our DCS (Distributed Control System) and with our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems. There, everything was object oriented with inheritance and I started to see the advantages and how OOP works. Our SCADA even goes further in the direction of being an Entity-Component system where each Entity can have many components with many different aspects, but that leads too far (it's basically just some very extended form of composition, not inheritance).> it often takes me hours what my developer colleagues can do in minutes.This only boils down to practice, ample practice.You will feel stuck and dumbfounded for quite some time but you will eventually reach the point where things fall into place and you all of a sudden understand.

It's a natural instinct if you spend most of your time close to the machine itself, but it's actually disruptive to learning HLLs.HLLs are designed to be somewhat implementation-agnostic; they have rules, and they trust that some intermediary layer will implement a thing that makes those rules go. Getting bogged down in how that intermediary layer might work (\*) generally will impede your understanding of the higher-level layer. This is a skill I had to learn when learning SML/NJ: the fine art of no longer worrying about how the language represents a function, trusting ""It just does,"" and learning the language independent of its implementation. The language is just rules and math; you could implement it with pencil and paper if you had the time and patience. Once you have the language under your belt, you can start caring about how it was implemented on a Von Neumann architecture with registers, RAM, and the like.(\*) C++ might be an exception that proves this rule; there are actually quite a few features of C++ where the reason they work that way is ""It made it a lot easier to write the compiler"" or ""Look, this language is old, and older computers didn't have enough RAM to do things like lookahead compilation or multiple passes, so it is what it is.""",fixermark,2026-01-08 16:10:23,2,learnprogramming,t3_1q79dtu,False,
nyffud1,"So, I wrote [a few chapters on OOP in a free book](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/). I tried to think of the ways we incorrectly teach OOP (because that's the way we learned OOP.)I think the summary I can provide is:* A class is like a blank paper form template. You go to the doctor's office and fill out strings for your name, phone number, a list of allergies, etc. This form is a *class*; everyone fills out the same fields (i.e. the member variables) to represent a real-world thing. Each filled-out form is an *object*, a specific concrete thing.* I hate the isolated ""Car"" and ""Shape"" and ""Animal"" classes you always see in tutorials. What a ""Car"" class looks like in real code depends on what software you are making: a used car ecommerce site, a traffic simulator, a racing video game, etc. Meanwhile, the same real world person would be described by different classes: `Customer`, `Patient`, `Employee`, `WeddingGuest`, etc. Ask yourself how a paper form would describe the person in each of these roles and what fields it would need.* A common mistake is to write classes a certain way because we heard that they ""should"" be written that way. If you feel like classes and extensive hierarchies of classes are causing more bureaucracy than organization in your code, go without classes. (If you can; a complete rewrite has its own problems.)* For a second, forget about OOP: imagine you have **a bunch of functions and they all have the same data structure passed to them as an argument**: that's your class. That tells you what the member variables and methods should be. I have an example Python tic-tac-toe program done [with and without OOP in the book.](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/chapter15.html)* Inheritance is overrated.* For a moment, stop thinking of inheritance with genetic or grandparent-passing-away metaphors. Imagine you need a new class that is very similar to an existing one, but you just one to change one or two methods, so you copy-paste the code entirely and just change those methods. This is what inheritance does, but instead of copying-pasting code, you leave that out and make a subclass and then only specify the methods you change.Anyway, in general we explain OOP badly, and it is a bit (but not entirely) overrated.

Anyway, *everything* have a *name*, if I have blue eye, blond hair and 2 m tall, I'm a *lightower boy* \- meh, I just figured it out, but you have the idea.The best approach is to find synonims and similar terms, which you're familiar with. The most close synonims for an *object* is: record, structure, set of variables, and now comes the difference: with the *methods* (functions, subroutines, procedures) operating on it.If you ever worked with files on Unix-like systems or Windows, you've already familiar with OOP. You create a File ""object"" by *open()* or *creat()*, which you can refer with the *file handle*, which these function returned. The variables of File is hidden for you, we have some idea how it looks, but we don't care as far we can call *read()*, *write()* methods to do what we want with the file, then we can *drop* or *destruct* it by calling *close()*.In OOP, instead of file handle, you got a pointer (sometimes called reference), and you can ""call"" methods. Now comes the part where you'll understand the whole shit:`read(file_object, &buffer, length)`is same as`file_object.read(&buffer, lenght)`In Python, you can call a method both way, although, highly recommended to use `obj.method()` variant.And again, as elctronics, programming is not *difficult*, but *simple and* *complex*. OOP is just as *difficult* like pull-up resistor: if you know struct, function, memory, OOP is easy-peasy, and if you know current, instable state, DCC and GND, pull-up resistor is straighfoward... but try these two simple things to explain someone who knows nothing about programming and electronics.",ern0plus4,2026-01-08 12:42:36,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q79dtu,False,

nzie2v8,"I can't really relate. I started programming at age nine with BASIC and never stopped. I'm 48 now. The work has become more enjoyable over time - not because of obsession, but because I've gotten better at it and avoided stagnation.The key has been continuous variation. Initially, I learned the essentials: variables, conditionals, loops, and basic control flow. When BASIC felt too restrictive, I moved to Pascal and C++, which introduced new challenges like pointers and object-oriented programming. After a brief period with Perl (which I didn't enjoy), I transitioned into web development with PHP and JavaScript. JS proved interesting because of its prototype-based inheritance model - a completely different approach from classical OOP.The pattern isn't obsession - it's sustained engagement through novelty. Each language shift brought fresh problems to solve and different paradigms to master. I didn't chase the same dopamine hit of early discovery; instead, I built deeper expertise while regularly introducing new complexity. The ""addiction"" you remember might have been beginner's excitement from rapid skill acquisition. That specific feeling doesn't return, but it's replaced by something more durable: the satisfaction of solving increasingly sophisticated problems with accumulated knowledge.

Part 1 would be a preparation for the exam done at home with whatever tools they want (ai, colleague,...) and they could take any code they would have done to part 2 (which was the actual part cut from Internet).The first part had exercises centered around getting every child from a node in a tree (and going deeper till getting the last).The first exercice from the second part was going up the tree till the first node was found and then, the exam was basically going down the tree either from top or from a specific node with the eventual join here and there on another table.All that to say : if you understood your code from the first part, second part should have been no problem at all. going up a tree being so close to going down but a lot less complicated to implement - It's a sole loop.

Everyone feels this way at one time or another, even those who doesn't appear so.2. Also, instead of giving in, to feelings of being an imposter, actively identify and address the weaknesses you've already identified, and do something about them.3. E.g. Note down terms you don't understand and learn/clarify them for yourself. Ask here. Or research on the internet. Or start a conversation with Claude or ChatGPT and say ""I am a programmer and I ran across the concept/term of 'dependency injection' \[for example\] the other day. I don't know what this is. Write me a short treatise on this subject including references so I can get up to speed. Include examples and exercises."" (for example.)4. You also observed you do nothing outside of work. Well, that's a hint/tell: Start doing something outside of work then! (""Doctor it hurts when I do \*this\*"" Doctor: ""Well stop doing it then!."" You get my drift.)5.

If your compile time hierarchy of encapsulation matches the domain model, you will have a hard time managing all the different interactions and variations. An example for that would be an inheritance hierarchy where each class implements its own behaviour (Vehicle -> Car -> Truck / Bus; Vehicle -> Train -> ...; Vehicle -> Bycicle -> ElektroBike; Vehicle -> ??? -> MotorBike; ...)Instead, start with separating your data from your logic and keep your data in simple arrays. E.g. a List of Orders, a List of Products, a List of Deliveries, A List of Customer Account. This can be an exact match to how you design your database btw.. Also, have only 1 ID across **all** types of Entities. This will allow you to combine the Components at Runtime easily.Then write functions (not methods) that operate on those lists. One function may check whether your are going to be out of stock for any product and create a new order for your supplier. Another function may go over the recent orders by your customers and create an aggregated report of what has been ordered and how much. And so on.Think about your logic as systems or laws of nature.

You could take the remainder of the deltaPopulation and carry it over to the next step, this ensures that the population still keeps track of the fractional progress.

nymvibm,"I grew up back then and frankly unless you where insanely rich, the only thing available where computers running on Z80 or 6502 chips. Great chips but all you easily had for programming was the built in BASIC. By the time I got to college, almost 10 years later the college was teaching with Modula 2 at the introductory level. Note the phrase ""teaching with"", if you are learning to program the language is really a tool to learn concepts. By the time one would finish the full program a student would have been exposed to at least 3 mandatory languages.People often ask why? The answer is pretty simple out in the real world you may end up working with a number of languages. The problem with BASIC is there is very little real world use of BASIC anymore, even gaming has gone to Lua for scripting.Now what do I suggest for beginners, that is easy C or C++ for the equivalent of the first 3-4 semesters of a Computer Science program. Why low level languages? This is again simple, you can be forced to building data structures at a low level. Personally I See languages like Python as damaging to the development of good programmers as it hands user modern concepts and unfortunately most programs designed around Python don't dive into how things work. The other reason is that properly done, by mandating the command line for the first few programs (2 semester equivalents) you also learn how compilers and linkers work, at the user level anyways. The command line is important because there are Python programmers out there that can't even create a directory at the command line. So I'm not a big fan of people learning programming with Python.However I really believe that most programmers need to learn Python at some point but properly educated that will be a piece of cake. The reality is Python has been relative simple for a scripting language. At some point a programmer will also have to learn the languages suitable for the platform at hand. The problem is platform languages are a moving target, you need a good understanding of the basics of computer science to adapt to what is new. Languages like RUST or Swift are literally works in progress, it is a continuous learning challenge to remain effective with these languages.",spinwizard69,2026-01-09 17:50:37,3,learnprogramming,t3_1q8ay1b,False,

Well, not *bad* but not without caveats.Working on your own project is definitely a good idea, but beginners aren't in a place to know what sized project to take on. Especially because these days beginners might think, ""I want to make an AI"" or ""I want to make my own Instagram"" or ""I want to make Minecraft"" are good projects. If you pick a project that's too large, you'll spend two months on it, not finish, and then be left even more frustrated.The solution is to **pick small projects**. You might not know what counts as ""small"", so I wrote [a free book with 81 small Python programs](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/). They all use text for output, including small ASCII art when needed. This may seem old-school, but the benefit is that every language has `print()` so you can use these projects even if you're not using Python, and there's no graphics libraries to install and configure on your computer.My definition of ""small"" is roughly ""under a couple hundred lines of code.""If you work on your own projects, make a list of *negative* features: things your project *won't* do. It's too easy to let ""it would be cool if..."" expand your scope into something you'll never finish. (Every programmer who started making a game by first making their own 3D graphics library is guilty of this. It's a great for a learning experience, sure, but my money is that the game will never be released.)There's no one moment where everything ""clicks"" but rather a series of small clicks. Finishing a dozen tiny projects is far more fulfilling and keeps you going than one half-finished giant project.""Contribute to open source projects"" is not good advice; you do need to have some level of experience making complete software applications to meaningfully contribute, or find someone in the project to mentor you. Open source projects would love to mentor someone who will contribute in the future, but it's hard to trust that the person they invest time into will actually stick around.I tell people to write their own blog posts or tutorials of what they've learned, because that process spotlights any gaps in your understanding. (Writing programming books certainly does that for me.) Post it somewhere online under a pseudonym where it will have zero readers, but *do* post it: this forces you to finish it.

nyopvth,"There are 13 years between C++98 and C++11, there are 15 years between C++11 and C++26. It's always a good idea to work from the latest standard. C++23 IS THE latest standard - C++26 will go to final vote to ratify in March this year.C++11 is old and was incomplete even then. They missed shit like `std::make_unique` - which had to be added in C++14, the `chrono` didn't finish until C++17, which is when we also got `filesystem` and `variant`, and finally type punning was defined. We didn't get library support for type punning until C++20, which is when we also got the `ranges` library - a god damn revolution in implementing algorithms. C++23 gives us `#embeded` to bring us to parity with C, type-safe formatter strings, UTF-8 support, and more container types. Starting with C++11 also leaves almost all of `constexpr` on the table.1) Install the latest compiler package from your vendor of choice.2) Always direct it to use the latest ISO-strict standard it supports. The compiler will default to an earlier and non-standard tolerant mode. When C++26 is ratified, it'll be a following software update that suddenly you'll get the new features.3) Keep learning C++. We all learn variables, functions, loops, conditions, pointers, user defined types... You're still going to slog through all the basics. There's no point in limiting yourself to a specific standard in this journey. You'll arrive to the latest standard when you're ready for it and it's ready for you.4) It takes time for compiler vendors to catch up. Microsoft with MSVC is still scrambling to implement C++23 features. All the vendors are struggling with modules. Don't be surprised when stuff is missing. It's not actually a big deal. But keeping up with software updates means you get to capitalize on their latest additions day-of. C++26 also comes with some changes that are worth being there.5) Most teaching materials are going to teach you the same basics. For the most part, the rules of C++ have never changed since before the C++98 standard... Except when it does. And that's the thing about fixing on a specific standard - there are very standard version specific rules you don't want to get bogged down on. Template deduction, initializers, `auto`, constexpr, move semantics... A lot of that gets nuanced changes over versions, and there's always breaking changes between spec versions. I think it was C++14 that finally said you can't specialize standard library template functions, and fuck, I had a code base predicated on that.Ultimately, the differences between the specs MOSTLY won't really matter until you get through the introductory materials. C++26 does change that a little bit - because it's going to require catching the use of uninitialized variables, which was formerly undefined behavior.

I’m not judging here — just looking for the other side of your story.2. A lot of programming involves not knowing the answer. Very often, things don’t work the way you think they should and you have to figure out why. You have to be very open to the idea that you might be wrong, because accepting that is often the key to finding the answer you’re looking for. You have to be okay with feeling frustrated for long periods, and you have to be persistent. Being good at programming is less a matter of knowing all the things and more a matter of being good at figuring out what you don’t know on an hourly basis.

Back in 2025, whenever I applied elsewhere, I would receive LeetCode-style assessments before even getting an interview.

I understand bubble sort and selection sort, but I can’t code them without looking at examples. I don’t know what will happen to me in the future; maybe if I keep learning, I’ll get better. The Odin Project says I need to practice a growth mindset, but studying DSA is so hard that it makes me wonder if I chose the wrong degree.I didn't choose my degree, my mother wanted me to take it, and I don't really know what I wanted to take before, so I just went with it.Back in college, I almost failed college algebra and my DSA subject, but I still managed to graduate on time.

For DSA, I didn’t really understand coding and syntax at first.

My main criticism would be the name of the function `generate_board()` - I don't think that's an accurate description of what it does. The board is already ""generated"" and present in the `board` array. This function just *displays* it, so I think a name such as `display_board()` would be more accurate.There are many areas for improvement once you learn more and gain more experience, though. For example, your `check_winner()` function could be split up to make it shorter and more readable, e.g. create a function `bool is_tie()` which encapsulates the tie determination and returns true or false appropriately, then call that from `check_winner()`.You could try separating the game logic from the input/output. By doing that you make it easier to change how the game looks (such as making a GUI version, where the logic is the same, but the display mechanism is entirely different). For example instead of `check_winner()` printing the result, it could return a value that indicates the state of the game.

Pass them as parameters instead:void check\_winner(std::string board\[\], bool& playing);2. Use char instead of std::string for single charactersstd::string for ""x"" and ""o"" is overkill:const char X = 'x';const char O = 'o';const char SPACE = ' ';char board\[9\] = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};More memory efficient and faster comparisons.3. Use std::array instead of C-style array\#include std::array board = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};Then you get board.size() instead of the sizeof trick.4. Tie detection bugYour tie check breaks early if it finds a SPACE, but that's wrong - game isn't a tie if there are empty spaces. Should be:bool is\_full = true;for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {if (board\[i\] == SPACE) {is\_full = false;break;}}if (is\_full) {// it's a tie}5. Use ternary for turn switchingcurrent\_turn = (current\_turn == X) ? O : X;6. Consider an enum for playersenum class Player { X, O, None };Prevents invalid states and makes code clearer.7.

The contributions will still even show on your profile if that is something you are concerned about. Not pushing because you are worried an employer will see a junk project? No just use the tool for it's purpose.I would say if you are using git, you may as well do a git push and at the very least have a backup of your work.

nyckdl1,"Yes, that's exactly how merge sort works.I like to imagine recursive function calls like your divide() function as a family of people who all know how to do some specific job (like historically the Baker family typically all knew how to bake stuff, the Taylor family typically knew how to tailor clothes, etc).I'm guessing your main function calls divide() with some array -- let's call that one Pat\_Divide. When your main function calls Pat\_Divide with an array of exactly 1 element, you should be able to see that the `if` statement is true and then Pat\_Divide immediately returns with only that one element.When your main function calls Pat\_Divide with an array of exactly 3 elements, more imaginary people get involved:* Pat\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\_Divide and the other list to Alice\_Divide.* Bob\_Divide gets one element, immediately sees that the `if` statement is true, and immediately hands back that one element.* Alice\_Divide, on the other hand, gets handed a list of 2 elements, and so is unfairly forced to do more work. * Alice\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists (of 1 element each) and hands those lists off to Mildred\_Divide and Leroy\_Divide. * Mildred and Leroy act just like Pad\_Divide did when Pat\_Divide was given a list of 1 element, and each immediately hand back that 1 element. * Alice\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) produces a sorted list of 2 elements. * Alice\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\_Divide.* Then Pat\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)* Finally, Pat\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.When your main() function calls Pat\_Divide with a very long array, even more imaginary people get involved, but we don't really need to know all their names:* Pat\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\_Divide and the other list to Alice\_Divide.* Bob\_Divide returns a sorted list of all the items in the left list (by involving other yet-unnamed family members).* Alice\_Divide does something similar to what she did before: * Alice\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists and hands those lists off to Mildred\_Divide and Leroy\_Divide. * Mildred\_Divide and Leroy\_Divide divide their individual lists into even smaller pieces, and hand them off to other family members, who eventually help them produce sorted versions of those lists. * Alice\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) combines the 2 sorted lists into a single sorted list. * Alice\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\_Divide.* Then Pat\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)* Finally, Pat\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.(Optionally, you may later learn multitaking techniques, so that Mildred, Bob's side of the family, and Leroy can each work on different parts of the problem simultaneously. ).Good luck trying to explain recursion to the next person!",D-Cary,2026-01-08 05:38:56,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q6ztxe,False,

nyfkfnc,"Well, it is a bit magic.All the other comments give very good suggestions, I'll just add that I recommend trying it out manually:1. Take a selection of playing cards, and put on the table in front of you, make sure they aren't sorted, but still layed out in a nice uniform ""array"".2. Then split the array in two halves - moving them a bit towards you (down the table)3. Split the two halves in another two halves each, so you have four groups of playing cards, and move them a bit further down.4. Continue until you have a number of individual cards layed out with space between them - it still looks exactly like the original array, and feels a bit silly at this point.5. But now, merge the two cards to the left, in order from lowest to highest, and move them a bit up the table - do the same for all the rest, so you have a collection of groups of two cards, each group sorted.6. Then merge the groups two and two, moving them a bit up the table, so you end up with a collection of groups of four cards, all sorted.7. And continue doing that, until you have only a single list of cards, all sorted ...It is important that you actually do it, and not just try to imagine it in your mind!Every time you move down the table, it is another call to the ""divide"" function, and every time you move up, it is a return from the latest ""divide"" function. Note how you can't return from a divide function, before you returned from the next divide-function that was called!

nyj7fl4,"It’s 2026, anyone can program something interesting using AI as their “translator” between idea and working code. Last night I had an interesting dinner conversation with a friend who I consider a genius in tech and business, and he believes the cost of software dev will approach zero as current advances in AI are continually eclipsed by improved models. Another friend tells me the latest Claude code is unbelievably good. Having AI as your learning partner is going to remove so many friction points. Spend some time learning how to get the most from AI and you’ll be running faster than if you first try to learn one syntax and formal language. Example: my dinner conversation friend likes to make boardgames for himself and friends. He recently made it in his todo list to a really interesting one where people cooperatively roll dice to try to beat a timer, with a difficulty scaling and hero exhaustion mechanic so the longer some heroes play the more tired they get, causing late rounds of the game to be more challenging. He needed to build some simulation software to play thousands of rounds of the game in order to derive the right numbers to use as timer values for easy, intermediate, and hard modes. He started by using AI chatbots to “write by prompt” a python program (he chose python for familiarity) He had written about 30 txt files describing the game,!the dice, the heroes, the colors, the map, the paths of forking decisions to move from point to point on the map, the win conditions and on and on. They were his personal notes, and he hadn’t shown them to any LLMs yet. Then he opened the folder in Cursor. The AI agent read all the files, and a whole list of notes to self and future todo items written in his personal notes. Then it proceeded to upgrade and expand his simulation script into a ful featured and useful tool. He has used it to simulate around 200,000 rounds of the game, and even had AI wrote an evaluative controller which would make adjustments to the difficulty levels until simulated games reach a desired success/fail percentage (ie. hard mode should fail 65% of the time on level 1, scaling to 80% fail rate for level 7)He opened his laptop and we told AI to rewrite the entire thing in Rust, which completed flawlessly in about two minutes. Thousands of lines of python translated to rust trivially. Then we thought of a stumper: build it in Lisp… it succeeded in another minute or two. Get conversational with AI … if you want to learn a formal language in depth, study the very well written code it outputs.",MrRogersAttacks,2026-01-09 03:44:16,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q7w0pi,False,

You had fast access and slow access memory.One example was drum memory. At the most basic, there is a [write][erase][read] head over a spinning magnetic drum track. You had to wait for your data to sweep under the read head to get it - however long that took. This was a destructive process, because then the head passed under a magnet. This data was either written a moment later at the read head, or a write was scheduled to intercede the passive loop.They then put a smaller, faster access loop over just a few degrees of the track, and had a larger, slower loop for the rest of the track, and this would take a couple sets of heads to pull off.But this tech got faster still, and this is the one you can mimic - they used coils of wire, and sent modulated signals down it. Again with the feedback loop - if you wanted a piece of data, you had to wait for it to come around. If you wanted to persist that data, you had to immediately write it back on the wire. If you wanted to change it, you had to intercede the passive loop. You could add more storage with a longer wire, you could get lower latency with a shorter wire.So that's what you can do - send data to an echo server, one on the furthest computer on the opposite, most remote destination to you on Earth or as ambitious as the DSN, and the data is stored ostensibly in the transmission itself. Want some data? You'll have to wait for that data to get back to you. Want to persist it? You'll have to send it back out. Want to change it?

nytvmmh,"> My question after all this intro is, is it possible to apply DDIA concepts to personal projects for the sake of it?Yes. Basically, what you should do is weigh the importance of having applications that can:1. Horizontally scale, and2. Tolerate/self-heal from outages ...much more strongly then you normally would for personal projects.Usually, we ignore reliability for personal projects. But if you're trying to practice distributed systems, it makes sense to make it your main focus, even if there isn't really a need for it.> Is this viable in the slightest to learn these technologies? While I understand the theory behind them, distributed systems is not something I'm learning or will learn at my job and it's something I found super super interesting.I think it'll be possible for you to pick up a solid basic understanding of these tools -- enough for you to get an understanding of their strengths/weaknesses, and when to use them.Picking up a truly in-depth understanding may be harder. Usually, that deeper intuition comes only after either dedicated study or after spending an extended amount of time using the tool in production, seeing first-hand the limitations and quirks of that tool.> If this is possible, are there ways for me to simulate many users or requests without breaking the bank in something like AWS?Some suggestions:1. Deliberately give your app very small amounts of cpu/mem, and/or deliberately add in sleep statements and such into your app to forcibly handicap your app so it can handle only 3 QPS or something. This means even modest amounts of traffic will cause a naive app to start becoming overloaded, which in turn gives you multiple opportunities to practice building support for horizontally scaling.2. Look into setting up automatic horizontal autoscaling of some sort, to automate downsizing your application when you're not currently stress-testing it.3. Alternatively, if your app is inherently expensive to run, just completely tear it down every time you're finished for the day. To reduce tedium, look into using terraform or something to automate the setup and teardown.4. Eventually, consider using something like Kubernetes to run everything. This will obviously take a lot more effort -- but doing it does mean you can test locally by setting up Kubernetes on your local machine, using VMs to simulate running on a fleet of machines. Aside from simulating traffic, also be sure to do chaos testing of some sort, where you randomly kill your machines to simulate unexpected hardware failures and/or temporarily network blackhole them to confirm your application as a whole can tolerate it, not lose user data, not enter an inconsistent state, etc.> Lastly, I know that Kafka is a little bit of an overkill for a toy project but I kinda wanna simulate this for learning purposes.Yeah -- I'd say it's overkill in general. In production, state is the enemy: the moment something is stateful, you have to worry about keeping it backed up/replicated in some way so you can tolerate unexpected hardware/network failure, which in turn often places constraints on how you can scale, etc...This is why DDIA spends so much time talking about databases and such -- figuring out how to manage state is by far the hardest part of designing and maintaining a distributed system.So for a prod system, it behooves us to go out of our way to design our architecture to keep as many of our components stateless as possible. (Stateless == they may maintain a local cache, but it'd be perfectly fine and safe to abruptly nuke a replica at any time.)But for a toy project, I think your instinct is correct. Now is the best time to play around with different technologies, even when they're not needed. This may end up causing your overall architecture to be more complex then needed, but I think that's perfectly acceptable if your goal is to become comfortable with different cloud/distributed-systems building blocks.",michael0x2a,2026-01-10 18:37:12,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q99oo3,False,

Do you have a sort of mental checklist that a project needs to qualify for before doing so, or is it more just a second nature kind of thing?I know you may never need a microservice as it might introduce more complexity than it's worth, for example, but I'm wondering when you are like ""yeah okay, we need a microservice here"".Example from my experience of when to decouple was, and I know this super small fry, I added a lambda to run some puppeteer code to generate PDFs on AWS as we ran into some strange IIS worker processor quirk where the chrome process was executed twice when running this on Node/Nest. Spent about 2 days trying to figure it out until I went the AWS option instead. This came with the benefit of not having a heavy dependency like puppeteer in our bundle, although it does come with the cost of vendor lock-in to a feature, which I'm okay with in this case since there's a daily S3 cleanup and the function is used 10 times a day most, so cost is non existent.Also thanks again, this really has been invaluable feedback/input, I wish I could upvote you more than once!",Prestigious_Towel_18,2026-01-11 08:47:58,1,learnprogramming,t1_nytvmmh,True,

nz6z6r7,"Outside of a few simple cases, recursion is not intuitive for most humans, so don't feel bad that you don't quite get it.One of the things that really helped me with recursion is when a programming student said that all recursive functions ***must*** have a base-case, or else the recursion will never end. Once I realized that, writing recursive functions became easier for me.That seems obvious now, but the professor who first taught recursion to me didn't hammer that concept into me, probably because he thought it was already intuitive and obvious. (It wasn't to me.)And writing the rest of the recursive function (the non-base case part) takes a *leap of faith*: You have to believe that the recursive function you call from inside your function will return what you want. Once you decide what you want for it to return, you have to work with that output. And after that, you will have to make sure the internals of your recursive function returns exactly what you want it to return when you called it. (Sorry is this is very abstract, but recursion is a very abstract concept.)And you may have noticed that reading already-written code is often more difficult to read and understand than writing new code (even if you're the one who wrote the code in the first place!). This is especially true with recursive code, so when you're calling the function recursively, add comments to explain that you're doing so, preferably with some explanation as to what the recursive call is doing, in contrast to the current call.",SpaceAviator1999,2026-01-12 17:14:12,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qb093e,False,
nz8p9ku,"For recursion, it's easier to understand how the recursion actually works, and strategies for coming up with recursive rules.Consider a list of numbers\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]How do you find the sum of the numbers?You can use a loop, and just add up each number. Very easy.But how would you do it recursively?You could break down the process into two steps1. If there's only one number, then we return that number. This is the base case, and where the recursion returns2. otherwise, we return the first number plus the sum of the remaining subset of numbersBased on this definition, we can write each of the following inputs as such* sum(\[1,2,3,4,5\]) = 1 + sum(\[2,3,4,5\])* sum(\[2,3,4,5\]) = 2 + sum(\[3,4,5\])* sum(\[3,4,5\]) = 3 + sum(\[4,5\])* sum(\[4,5\]) = 4 + sum(\[5\])* sum(\[5\]) = 5Now if you look at sum(\[4,5\]) and you sub in the value of sum(\[5\]) you will see that it is equal to 4 + 5 = 9And then for sum(\[3,4,5\]) you can sub in the value of sum(\[4,5\]) with 9, which gives 3 + 9 = 12The key to solving recursion is to identify how you can repeat the algorithm on a subset of the input so that when you solve a smaller problem, that solution can be used to solve the larger problem.The same applies to node-based structures. Every tree has a root and a bunch of children attached to that root. children also has its own sub-tree with the child as the root, and a bunch of children.So you can create a recursive algorithm where you pick a root and recurse on the children, until you reach a leaf node which is a tree with no children.",mxldevs,2026-01-12 21:59:12,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qb093e,False,

nz70oeb,"Recursion is a challenge for almost everyone. It's not made easier by the fact that there are very few examples that are both (a) intuitive and (b) more easily done with recursion than iteration. This means you either get examples you don't understand or examples where you don't see the point of recursion.Let's think about computing the height of a tree. The height of a tree is the longest distance from the root to a leaf node (we'll assume that a tree with just one node is height 1 and a tree that isn't there at all has height 0).Suppose you want to compute the height of a tree. Imagine I tell you that the height of the left branch is 7 and the height of the right branch is 4 (how? I'm magic. I just know these things). Can you tell me what the height of the whole tree is? If you think about the definition, the longest path to a leaf node is going to involve going either left or right from the root. If you go left (that's one step) then you know that the longest path to a leaf *from that point* is 7 (because I told you). If you go right (also one step) then you know that the longest path to a leaf is 4 (again, I told you). So the longest path from the root is `1 + max(7, 4)` which is 8.This solution, unfortunately, involves a magic step, where you ask me what the height of the left and right subtrees are and you use those results to determine the height of the overall tree. Wouldn't it be great if you had a function that would tell you the height of a tree so that you could use it to determine the height of another tree?You do. It's this function we are talking about. We just change this: func height(tree) return 1 + max(ask_lurgi_for_the_height(tree.left), ask_lurgi_for_the_height(tree.right))to func height(tree) return 1 + max(height(tree.left), height(tree.right))There is one thing missing from this, which every recursive function needs: a way to stop. There has to be some state (we call it the ""base case"") that you can work out immediately, without doing any other steps. This should be the smallest possible example. How about the empty tree? Not a tree with just one node, but a tree has no nodes at all. We'll say it has height 0. func height(tree) if empty(tree) return 0 return 1 + max(height(tree.left), height(tree.right))",lurgi,2026-01-12 17:21:00,2,learnprogramming,t3_1qb093e,False,

Hot take but it matters less what the project actually is meant to do rather than what you used to build it—as long as its at least a little interesting and not super generic (weather app, todo app, etc) , your idea is fine. This will increase your chances of getting interviews.When it comes to interviewing, its a separate skill, I dont think having internship/work experience necessarily helps with interviewing skills. Technical Interviews are either leetcode style (practice by doing leetcode), conceptual questions (easy to prep for via google/chatgpt or through your school notes), or system design (not usually asked for new grads, but I had one for the offer I landed and I genuinely think my experience working on personal projects are what made me not completely bomb it, and I highly doubt interns are learning system design skills well if at all).For behavioral interviews, when they ask about working on a team you can just talk about group projects you did at school.

It costs 8k and has a great course catalog. It'll give you a hard reset and gives you an opportunity to apply to internships alongside applying to full-time roles. As for your resume, you need to look at Jake's resume, it's a standardized template. Have gemini distill your experience and format it to fit in Jake's resume. I feel like gemini has the best creative and visual model so it'd be the best for this use case. There are other standardized resume templates, I'm not positive Jake's resume is still the most recommended so do your research. I remember his resume template being referenced all the time a few years ago.Use a mock interview platform to find where your weaknesses are (idk what they are, I think pramp is one?).

No excuses. Stretch it to 6 months if you want to target highly paid roles at tech companies. Take whatever salary you can get, even if it's 60k it doesn't matter.

nzikzto,"First off, I'm really sorry to hear about your role being eliminated—that's a tough spot after 11 years, especially with the added pressure of relocation. It sounds like you're weighing two solid but very different paths, and that's a stressful decision.Given your situation, here are a few thoughts that might help:1. \*\*Assess the internal role beyond the travel.\*\* A tech lead manager position with direct reports and higher comp is a significant growth opportunity. If the exciting industry aligns with your long-term goals, the travel might be a worthwhile trade-off. However, consider the practical impact on your life in Florida—would it be sustainable? Sometimes a role that accelerates your career can open doors faster than a job search.2. \*\*If you lean toward taking the severance and job hunting,\*\* don't let the current market scare you into a rushed decision. With six months of salary plus savings, you have a generous runway. The key is to use that time strategically. Since you're not targeting FAANG, you can focus on companies where Leetcode isn't the sole gatekeeper.3. \*\*Your resume will be crucial.\*\* With your SRE experience, you have a strong foundation in reliability, automation, and likely cross-functional collaboration. Instead of a generic resume, tailor it to highlight pain points you've solved—think outages you prevented, cost savings from automation, or improvements in deployment frequency. Companies hire for problems they need solved, not just a list of skills.4. \*\*Research companies deeply.\*\* Look beyond job boards. Find companies in industries you're passionate about, then dig into their engineering blogs, Glassdoor reviews, or recent news. What challenges are they facing? Maybe they're scaling infrastructure or dealing with legacy system reliability. Your SRE background could directly address those pains.5. \*\*Transferable skills are your friend.\*\* Even if you move into a management role internally or externally, skills like incident management, capacity planning, and mentoring junior engineers are highly valuable. Frame your experience around outcomes—for example, ""Reduced system downtime by X%"" or ""Led post-mortems that improved team response time.""If you do decide to job hunt, I built a tool called Resonant that helps job seekers research company pain points and match them to their resume skills—it's designed for situations exactly like this, where standing out requires more than just keywords.

The way most companies set salaries is using market reference points - the market is roughly geographic and industry tied, though companies can kinda pick and choose who they think is competing for the same workers (software engineer at a FAANG and programmer in the IT department of a paper company are probably not in the same survey).So, junior dev in some industry group and city has a median of $X. A new grad offer might be 80% * $X and the company might say that the salary band for junior is 80%-120% of the market reference. Each year they get a new market reference and also adjust target points - performance based. So if the market reference is at $110k and you're at $91k, they might bump you up 2-5% on the target. If the market reference goes up, you might get a juicier raise. If it goes down, you get less of a raise. You'll have a target point and an effective point - they won't cut pay if you're target is lower than your effective, but your raises will be smaller.If you start getting above 100%, the raises are often lower. At that point they're thinking ""get promoted to get more money"" - part of the reason for the wider bands is to be able to make offers to people being hired away from other jobs.If your friend got 5 years of really good raises, I'd bet on a rapidly climbing reference point (2010-2022 were pretty good years) along with being below the midpoint target, then some pullbacks in reference point and being above target.Managers don't typically know what the reference points will be and also don't really know how you'll perform relative to expectations.",cballowe,2026-01-08 05:55:38,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1q73851,False,

nzimsxl,"Great advice here, especially the emphasis on startups and the personal outreach angle. The point about big companies having low response rates due to volume and internal changes is spot-on—it’s easy to take that personally when it’s often not about you.One thing I’d add for anyone feeling stuck: when you’re applying to startups or smaller companies, try to research their specific pain points. Look at their recent blog posts, product updates, or even customer reviews. If you can subtly align your resume bullets with challenges they’re likely facing (e.g., “improved scalability” for a growing startup, “reduced latency” for a real-time app), it makes your application feel less generic and more like a solution.That shift from “here’s what I did” to “here’s how I can solve your problem” is what helped me stand out when I was job searching. In fact, I built a tool called Resonant (resonant.iamdelrio.com) to help with exactly that—it analyzes company signals and suggests which of your skills to highlight. But even without a tool, just spending 10 minutes per company to tailor your resume’s top bullet points can dramatically boost your response rate.Thanks for sharing your experience—it’s a solid reminder that persistence and a targeted approach pay off.",IMDELRIO,2026-01-14 10:38:03,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1qbb5z0,False,

The stuff these certs go over are solutions for very large scale applications, thing basic simple websites don't usually need. It helped but wasn't huge.I'd say just pass the test to get the cert, you won't fully understand the material yet, but the first step of learning is just get the basic knowledge down. Then once you start making projects with that knowledge, it'll all make sense.",NICEMENTALHEALTHPAL,2026-01-10 19:59:49,1,cscareerquestions,t1_nyu8qb4,False,

nybyw7k,"Nothing is gonna come close to the pay of a 10 yr dev without putting in 4+ years of full time study just to start at the bottom so basically the question you're really asking is 'what job would I do if money was no factor and just for fun'.I've done jobs for basically no money because I didn't care about money, had savings, it was fun.At your point though you should be able to start your own business?

nybj76b,"Super weird title jumps, dev to QA to pm?Is there any you prefer or like? It's just going to be a lot easier pushing for something you enjoy the work of. If you don't really like the work, then I have no advice. If you do, just apply and plan around whatever experience you're learning while on the job you get.Not amazing advice, but I don't think there really exists 1 shoe fits all, super specific advice.Just apply to something that you are passionate about, broadly doesn't have to be a specific tech stack. Like I enjoy developing, in any capacity, solving problems, creating solutions. I prefer .NET, but would do literally any language or even infrastructure. Sounds cliche, but if you're passionate, you'll more easily learn, and that passion 100% shows up in interviews. So. Just apply. And prep for interviews. Once you're employed, then start planning. Step 1, get a job.",yeah779,2026-01-08 02:02:18,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1q6yskd,False,
nybmkxy,"Yea the weird title jobs is that after teaching myself full stack I failed my technical interview, but I was persuasive enough thanks to my prior sales experience to talk myself into getting hired anyway as a front end dev for a start up. While there I wanted to prove I was ambitious and voluntarily started taking on PM assignments since the front end dev work was pretty low. I was scared they’d see I wasn’t really needed lol. After that my next company was at a fortune 500 and I knew someone that got me an interview but it was for QA, but it was a fortune 500 company so I really felt like it was the right move.I have great passion when it comes to personal projects, but I’m not one of those guys that will argue about tech stacks/tools with people like it’s a sports team. I just like getting shit done, but unfortunately this “meh” attitude of not really caring what I use sometimes comes across as not passionate.As for what I enjoy, I really just enjoy being left alone and turning my work in. Whether it’s building a QA test case or building out some new app feature, I equally enjoy both. I settled on cybersecurity because it seems to scratch my itch to solve problems, investigate, and not have to be on endless phone calls (being left alone). And it also seems easier to get into then software dev since I suck at technical interviews apparently.",Ihaftochangethename,2026-01-08 02:20:01,0,cscareerquestions,t1_nybj76b,True,

nybz9yt,"I'd recommend just applying for any and every role that sounds interesting, fits your experience, and feel confident you could prep enough to be ready for interviews. And also fits your remote requirements.During that, network out, talk to old friends, old professors, etc.If you get a job, go all in. Build up your job experience. Prioritize completing work that is measurable if you can. saves money, record all of that. Learn lots. Find opportunities to lead if you can.You'll need to try and break out of comfort zone. Use that sales experience. ""Fake"" it. Not literally. But just be outspoken, be agreeable, put yourself out there. Once you've built up some good job experience, metrics, more confident. Try and find that F500 chill remote job, where you can be left alone and just coast. If the job sucks, has little growth or opportunity, toxic culture. Then do enough to stay afloat and put energy to applying to another role.Edit: Push to be tactical now. Apply apply apply. Try to get anything that meets your absolute needs (enough pay, remote, etc) while staying interesting enough of a position. Dont be overly strategic yet. Be strategic once you get the job. Plan, get to know your peers, get to know the culture, be strategic. Find your place, make a plan. Evaluate your goals/plan as time goes on. You may not want to leave after a year. If you do, plan and iterate.",yeah779,2026-01-08 03:27:15,1,cscareerquestions,t1_nybmkxy,False,
nyc100j,"But really. My overall advice. Is to follow a path/flow that works for YOU.I'm just regurgitating what my path/flow naturally ended up being. Maybe it will fit well with you too. Maybe it won't.The best plan/approach, is the one that moves you closer to your actual goal, that you will ACTUALLY follow..A bit unrelated. But it's like a diet. Many of us problem solvers get bogged down on planning out most optimal solutions and paths, because it's fun. But when it comes to executing on that plan, day after day, you really have to stop thinking of yourself like a machine that can deterministically follow whatever oober optimized plan you make. Remember, whatever you decide to do, has to be realistically doable for you.. day after day.",yeah779,2026-01-08 03:36:52,1,cscareerquestions,t1_nybz9yt,False,
