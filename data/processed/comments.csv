Now most teams never think about cluster management.- Analytics engineering emerged as a discipline. Beauchemin predicted DEs would need more SQL, but underestimated how much the transformation layer would specialize (dbt, semantic layers, etc.)- The 'modern data stack' hype cycle. Lots of point solutions that promised to solve specific problems, then consolidation as everyone realized 47 tools was too many.What stayed the same (unfortunately):- The gap between 'we have data' and 'we understand the business domain.' Still the hardest part.- Pipeline maintenance burden. Different failure modes now (API rate limits vs disk space), same percentage of time spent on it.- Stakeholder expectations vs data quality reality.What's genuinely better:- Getting started is 10x easier. A junior can have a working pipeline in a day instead of weeks.- The tooling for testing and observability actually exists now.- Version control for transformations is standard, not exotic.The 'Downfall' article was prescient about platform engineering eating some DE work.

Have you considered having an “intermediate” type table materialization? We have several large models that have to be broken up into intermediate steps because they would either overload memory, or perform poorly due to CTE’s that are called multiple times, which we can instead just process them once in a separate model. What gets annoying with this, is we don’t want any of these intermediate models taking up space in our warehouse, so we have to use a custom post-hook on any end-state models to clean up the upstream intermediate models. It would be really awesome if you integrated this automatically. Let us use intermediate as a materialization strategy, and have them be autodropped once an end-state model finishes.

If that’s the case it’s a pretty easy sell to your line manager that building a proper pipeline would mean dashboards get built faster and have way more reusability.If you’re the solo data engineer, then you’re the sole authority and the only one who can explain why it is a problem. Have you raised this with them? If you’re just complying with the requests of things they think they want to see, then they’re gunna be stuck in a loop of forcing through ad hoc things - because it’s all they know.You mention being an excel support desk too - this definitely shouldn’t be happening - spreadsheets can be avoided in almost all cases these days (with some exceptions). I LOVE it when someone requests a spreadsheet because it’s an opportunity for me to ask them “out of curiosity” what are they doing with the spreadsheet - then you almost always get given an opportunity to solve a problem that they didn’t even know existed, this can make people very happy and that’s the most satisfying part of this job, I find.Maybe I’ve got the completely wrong take here but it sounds like the company hasn’t been exposed to a modern data stack before and are doing things the old way, if you’ve already shown them how it could be better (time optimisation, data reliability, and undiscovered insights being the selling points that execs hear) - then fair enough leave - if you haven’t you’re sitting on a golden opportunity, cause it sounds like you’re the only authority. Best wishes going forward - but this sounds like you’re not doing data engineering at all and would be a red flag to me if I were to interview you for an engineering role and you spoke about this sort of setup.",cky_stew,2026-02-11 20:13:44,4,dataengineering,t3_1r1yl3v,False,

We had a batch job that ran for 8 years with zero external packages beyond requests and psycopg2. Worked great.But rebuilding ORM patterns from scratch is different from just not using one. If you're writing your own query builders, connection pooling, retry logic, and type coercion, you're now maintaining all that code forever. Every bug fix, edge case, and security patch is on you. SQLAlchemy has had hundreds of contributors finding problems you'll never think of.The return code pattern concerns me more than the dependency choice honestly. Python's exception model exists for a reason and fighting it creates code that's harder to read and debug. If your senior prefers explicit error handling, that's fine, but there are Pythonic ways to do it without making every function look like C.The real question is what's the maintenance horizon here. If this is a one time data migration that runs and gets archived, vanilla Python is fine. If this is production infrastructure your team will maintain for years, the cost of rolling your own ORM will compound. Every new team member has to learn your custom patterns instead of reaching for documentation.Worth having a direct conversation about it. Ask what specific concern drives the no dependencies stance.

Cool guy!It tries to improve on multiple fronts ,mostly user experience (e.g. hyperlinks to problematic files, init command, pretty output , some SE better practices and of course leverage Rust speed and binary size), which are explained here: [here](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/faq/), in the 'How does dbtective compare to similar projects' dropdown. One of the improvements I wanted required a completely different architecture and [Rust traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html) were the perfect candidate.The simplest explanation of this architectural change is by example, comparing dbt-bouncers [`CheckModelDescriptionPopulated`](https://godatadriven.github.io/dbt-bouncer/stable/checks/manifest/check_models/#manifest.check_models.CheckModelDescriptionPopulated) rule (which only applies to models) with dbtective's \`[has\_description](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/rules/description/)\` rule, which can apply to all eligible dbt objects, for example \`sources\`, \`seeds\`. \`macros\` or anything that can be described (in the \`applies\_to\` setting). So in \`dbtective's\` case, one rule can be used to expect descriptions on multiple objects, leaving less work for the user.With this in mind we can set defaults that make sense (e.g. it makes sense to describe a lot of things so the default \`applies\_to\` setting contains literally all objects that can have a description field for the has\_description rule), but we can also easily remove or add objects if the project requires it, using the applies\_to configuration.These defaults I would like to eventually leave to the community or be fixed by asked the right questions in the init command.

o51ilwx,"So a couple of different things here, mostly anecdotally from my own experience on both the employee and hiring management side of things. 1. I'd say without a doubt you made the right choice to focus on SWE over DS. The thing you actually get in DS is about Statistics-with-programming and how to properly employ research against data. All good things, not really what we're concerned about with DE. 2. Since you're in SWE and looking at design patterns, keep in mind what it would be like if the only thing you had to care about was the data inside the objects. A lot of folks coming from a SWE background focus on the abstract object versus what is contained by the object. To move to DE you have to care a lot more about the latter. 3. Things that will be evergreen in DE: python, SQL, databases, warehouses, data modelling (although the meaning of this varies person to person, company to company, much to my chagrin). Focus on these. Python at an expert level (focus on the data packages. Polars, Duckdb. And DB packages. Pscyopg, etc.), at least 1 RDBMS 1 NoSQL and 1 DB system you're just interested in, SQL to an expert level which will give you passable knowledge for most Warehouses as well. 4. Tools that will be evergreen in DE: Airflow, Docker, GitHub, K8s. TOML/YAML as well. DBT is very good to know as well. 5. And that the issue is that job descriptions are very heavily implying mastery while the actual job wants a jack of all trades. Get good at probing for this information in interviews with tech staff.

But for analytics engineering work, especially in niche domains with messy data like you describe, it doesn't work that way. The hard part of your job is not writing SQL, it's knowing which parameter to look at based on domain knowledge. That's exactly where AI struggles.Where AI actually helps me is the tedious stuff. Debugging weird errors, generating boilerplate tests, converting between formats. I'd say 6/10 useful is about right for debugging help. Where it falls apart is anything requiring judgment about your specific business [context. My](http://context.My) honest take after a year of heavy Claude usage for data work is that the people who are no longer doing anything technical are probably working on much simpler problems than yours. When you're eyeballing raw files to figure out which field is correct because documentation doesn't exist, there's no prompt that replaces that institutional knowledge.Try Claude for the parts of your job you already know how to do but find tedious.

Not know what is the desired end result, or stakeholders not knowing what they want and you having to guess that is not. It's not clear to me what is the situation here, but you can use AI for both:- use AI to generate documentation of where each parameter/column is, what it describes, how to query it, etc. Review that documentation for mistakes/errors and rewrite/fix what needs to be fixed in the documentation. Then, the AI can refer back to this documentation when generating code, saving you time- ask AI to clarify requirements, or identify information gaps, and draft responses to requests that are not clearUsing AI to code is fine and useful, but you said that's not the part you struggle with.

o514svl,"The way that I have ended up managing Data Infra in a couple of roles now is by being able to rapidly produce a prototype. You'll want to pick up, and use regularly, systems like Docker and Kubernetes. Even for your own small data projects. This will introduce you into that world where those things are heavily used. These are also cloud-agnostic meaning no matter what service provider your future employer(s) use you'll be squared on this front. In the same vein are things like VPCs and general networking which I spend more time debugging than anything else in DE/DataOps. After that you can get into the specifics of particular platforms. As far as practicing is concerned: Start with `docker`. Learn the ins and outs of taking arbitrary python code you have and stuffing it into a container. Learn how to find images, how Dockerfiles work, run into the issues so you can troubleshoot them. Then see what it takes to incorporate tools you may be using to develop your code into the dockerfiles. Things like `uv`. If you can have one system managing both your local dev and your container builds you have less points of failure to troubleshoot. Then grab `k3s` for local development. This is, notably, ""actual"" kubernetes. That is opposed to things like minikube which are ""kubernetes in docker"". Nothing wrong with that, but when we're talking about ""rapid"" prototyping, k3s is as close as it gets to just managing raw k8s on your local system. You'll probably immediately want to grab `helm` as well. Read up on `k8s`, `k3s`, `helm`, and `kubectl`. Play around with trying to get your docker containers that do things or expose things up onto k3s locally. See what it takes to setup `postgres` on kubernetes, and how to expose it so you can communicate with it externally.Outside of those things, which are more typical of `self host first` shops, you can likely find playgrounds around specific tech. I believe `databricks` recently opened up a playground of sorts. Snowflake may as well, but I don't honestly remember. Google on `GCP` used to give you like $300 in credits, plus they have the open BigQuery datasets you can mess around with. I think all of these things are secondary or tertiary things to focus on though, as they are mostly provisioned and managed for you from an infra standpoint. It's not bad to see what the platforms look like behind the scenes, though!I find Data infra specifically very interesting.

Finding out where all the variables for informatica were stored on the on prem server. 1. I hated this part soooooo much. 3. Understanding the complex logic of the informatica jobs since people who built them left and no one understood what they were doing. I exported the XML for the informatica jobs and used copilot to create sql queries to pull from source systems instead of manually doing this. I know this didn't really answer you question but I needed to vent as this was an exhausting project.For tools. I wasn't expecting large loads(Under 20gb). So I used Docker, python, and duckdb. I created a custom image to use on lambda and I orchestrated with AWS step function or Airflow depending on the team. I used ECS if I expected loads to take longer than 15 minutes.

o5kajsq,"The data engineer role will provide technical fundamentals that are more scalable for future roles.The business analyst is a strange frankenstein position. In practice it appears to exist to try and create a role with emphasis on domain expertise to try and improve processes but without the salary premium in an investment in technical skills that would be required of a data analyst or other professional data roles. Sort of a what if there were a halfway business admin career level and a data analyst at a professional career level, but we can pay them cheaper. As result they tend to become data specs retrievers.Where I call this a frankenstein role is because in practice when you do work the slow boring way, the technical details, that is where the pattern recognition develops. To see the insights in terms of what steps in the process can be eliminated. Where to break it into logical steps and streamline and automate. That technical work at the data analyst or more technical roles is where innovation happens, closest to the doing of the work. This is partly observation that in the industrial era it was common that those associates closest to the manufacturing lines would then observe a process improvement and go on to start a second business using those improved processes as a foundation. As we are in the tech white collar era the same principles appear to apply that those closest to the work observe pattern simplifications that innovate. In order to develop the intuition to improve processes there is no replacement for having performed that process. By doing so with time in a role a data analyst or other data positions tend to also develop domain expertise along with their technical skills.Thus from my perspective what companies want from a business analyst requires experience in more technical roles, first. And this is what you see in more mature companies. The business analyst tends to be more of a senior data professional at a salary premium. As a senior data professional they have the technical background to consult on improved business processes and speccing out those projects.There are a lot of companies staffing business analysts that are at a much more junior level. Creating oddities in data on what they should be paid and ambiguities in how to implement them within the company structure.You get to skip that ambiguity by transition to a more defined data role with development of fundamentals that transition to other roles and scale.",decrementsf,2026-02-15 20:02:02,1,dataengineering,t3_1r5n10y,False,

The instruction files can't encode business logic deep enough to prevent that.What actually works: dbt's built-in tests get you maybe 30% there. The wins come from singular tests that encode your actual business rules, stuff like 'revenue should never be negative' or 'customer count should be within 5% of yesterday.' We run those on every PR.We also started requiring example queries with expected outputs in PR descriptions. Manual, yeah, but reviewers can run them and verify the logic. Caught more issues than any linter.The sneaky pattern with AI-generated dbt is syntactically valid code that does the wrong thing with joins or nulls. We added a TESTING.md file listing these gotchas and requiring specific test coverage for them.For open source where you can't control what people use, CI becomes the only guardrail.

o4g8f1g,"Howdy. Twenty-five-year-professional, thirty-eight-year passionate programmer here. I think you're feeling the right feelings but you might lack context.I used an LLM this weekend to knock out some database code. We have models (sqlalchemy talking to a Posgresql database), ORMs, and then GraphQL interfaces to fetch that data. So I had a collection of A's and I needed new collections of B's and C's and the interfaces for them. I described the problem to Copilot, and it did the work for me by creating new files, each of which was a 90% rewrite of an existing file.You see the problem already. ""Why do you have to rewrite 90% of a file to do something as simple as 'a collection, but for a new type of data?' Because our abstraction is bad.But here's the thing about software engineering in a professional setting: *the abstraction is always bad.* We are, forever, solving real problems real people have, balancing correctness, speed, and maintainability. As a programmer passionate about the profession, I want to push maintainability *all* the way to maximum.I am not paid to do that because it impacts speed. So we write enough abstraction to do the job and we limp it along until it becomes too burdensome to maintain.You see code as art. And it is! I love creating a beautiful abstraction that cleanly describes and solves a problem. I do my best to write that code in my hobby-time outside work. But problems in the real world are not clean, they are often ill-described, and the deliverable solution is, as a result, messy and tricky to maintain. We can and do refactor, but not until we're *very* sure that the problem domain is so well-defined that hiding it behind abstraction to make it less verbose and error-prone will be worth costing us the flexibility of writing everything long-form. You don't write clean code to solve the problem every time because you don't even have a clear picture of the problem you're trying to solve. But each possible solution clarifies the problem and gets you closer. And LLMs, it turns out, are *great* at recognizing fuzzy patterns and applying transformations based on that.If you treat code *only* as art (which you can choose to do!), you'll get paid like an artist. I'm not gonna tell you not to.But solving real problems for real people usually requires writing mountains of bad code fast. LLMs are great at that. They're also surprisingly good at fast analysis of bad (overly verbose, redundant, ill-fit to the problem domain) code and creation of more code fitting the pattern. Which means someone's real problem gets solved faster.No surprise people are gravitating towards that, because people have problems and want them solved.My advice to you is to keep the passion. The algorithms *are* beautiful. Code *is* art. And, as you've already observed with your peers, letting the AI spit something out you can't understand and putting it in production is just the Sorcerer's Apprentice enchanting the broom to carry water and then letting it go.But... Your mastery of craft will take you further *with* AI because you can use it to write code faster than your fingers can, and that gets real solutions into real people's hands faster.And programming and computer science is about the algorithms, but software engineering is about solving the problems human beings have right now.Good luck out there.

To be honest, some of it is not bad; if you'd trust an intern to make repeated changes to your software, then AI can usually be leveraged to your advantage. But if your codebase is complex and is 90% complete, AI often does a lot of harm along with some good.>And AI can't even code to save its life. It spits out nonsense inefficient code that doesn't even work half the time.Yeah... I once asked AI to re-write code to be more efficient, and it wrote it using an algorithm that many people think is efficient, but that I knew from experience wasn't very efficient in my case. It's as if AI accepts common misconceptions as fact.>The fact that people are saying that ""Programming is dead"" infruits me so much.Cool word!

Perhaps competent coders like you will be in high demand in 2030.I will say, however, that AI is unlikely to go away completely, and I've found that AI results tend to help us ***provided that a knowledgeable human*** ***vets the results*** first. So if an AI generates results that are only 10% significant, a human can review them and find lots of good stuff. But if we blindly use AI results that are only 10%, 50%, or even 90% accurate, we're liable to get nasty surprises 10%, 50%, or 90% of the time.So my take is that blindly putting AI on autopilot has its problems, but using it as a search tool to find results we wouldn't normally find on our own is not so bad, provided we review all its results.",SpaceAviator1999,2026-02-09 18:18:33,15,learnprogramming,t3_1r07bq2,False,

If I took my time to understand the principles of analysis I am doing, the context I’m writing the code in, and then all of the CS analysis to make it beautiful, and then write the tests for it, it’d take me a month.Copilot can look at code I’ve written before and give the rough beats which I can then fill in quickly with context to my necessity, so I can be more intentional about any minute inaccuracies which might affect my ability to do a worthwhile analysis on the actual data I have.It’s a way to work faster.

You should be able to run your code, and see that a chrome browser opens up, navigates to the site you specified in code, does the things you expected, and then shuts down. Suggestion: Have it perform this 10 times, and you calculate the average times between each action. Gives you brief superficial performance data.* Read all the rules of a large international lottery, then emulate it in a script. Write a for-loop or an equivalent that prints every X amount of money spent on lottery tickets until you hit the jackpot. It'll teach you basics about for-loops, ToString(), classes and to avoid lotteries.* Create an API that you can test using Postman/Insomnia (real world valuable experience).* Create a windows service (if you are learning .net that is), that you can install, start, stop, restart in windows gui (also valuable experience).* Install Docker Desktop or the equivalent on your computer. Then create a containerized small project, doesn't matter what the project is. What matters is that it runs inside the container and you can interact with the project through the exposed port (very valuable real world experience).* Create a project where you split its component into several containers, then orchestrate them through Docker Compose or an equivalent (very valuable real world experience).",Fyren-1131,2026-02-14 13:43:12,37,learnprogramming,t3_1r4kpqq,False,

o5k3dwc,"Professional software developer here, and I agree with everything you've said. Building on your post, here's an analogy from my own experience that I think supports your point:I learned to write code before I learned to cook. I was equally interested/enamored by each of these skills when I first started to learn them.One of the first things I learned to cook was [stir fried chicken with rice noodles][stir-fry]. For at least a month, I made this dish several times per week. This repetition afforded me space to observe and learn - I noticed when the color of some ingredients started to change in the cooking utensil (an observation I wasn't previously able to make). I started adding other ingredients to the dish because I had learned some intuition (which gave me confidence that even if my didn't turn out great, it wouldn't be terrible) over repeated exposure. Slowly, I was able to rely on visual cues without needing to set a timer (""hey! the broccoli is starting to look like it's cooked"" instead of ""it's coming up on 3min, time turn down the heat""). This is how I learned how to cook and how to understand what I was seeing on the stove. Prior to this, I had watched many cooking shows/videos and family and friends had even tried to show/teach me - all of this was ""tutorial hell"" and I never felt like I knew what I was doing. One lesson from this experience is that ""know what you're doing"" doesn't come before you build something for the first time. It's actually the other way around - you learn by doing stuff. When I say that, I am reminded of providing tech support for my grandma. She'd always be afraid that she was going to accidentally break something. This is a real concern with programming languages - you could potentially delete files or crash your OS through some bug. But starter/learning projects rarely expose you to that functionality. If you're still afraid, consider using a virtual machine. It wasn't until I read this post, OP, that I made the connection between this cooking practice and something else I did when I was learning to write code (back in 2007 - I'm old, I guess). After I first learned python, I would often (and for no real reason other than ""I like to write code"") write a decimal to binary function in python. Sometimes it would take me a long time to write (30min was not uncommon), sometimes I'd write it in a few minutes. The point was never to write it quickly to ""beat my personal record"". The point was always to practice this new skill. Sometimes I'd write it recursively, sometimes I'd try something different.But this repeated practice did for me, the same thing that repeatedly cooking the stir fry did. I was able to study different ways of solving the same problem and hone my understanding of how python works. Now, I didn't write my decimal to binary converter every day - I think the most frequently I did this was ""once a week"" for a few weeks (then, about once a month, and I eventually started to use it to test whether I liked a new keyboard). At the time for me, it was like re-reading my favorite passage out of my favorite fiction book (the was before Netflix, so that might translate today as ""rewatching my favorite episode of a TV show"").That's really the secret sauce - practice for familiarity. When I use LLMs today, the value for me is that the LLM writes the code. The time savings for me comes from not having to physically type out the code. The thinking that goes into it beforehand (what architecture to use, what algorithm to use, what data structures to use, how to model the data flow and problem solving, etc; If I haven't yet made these decisions, I have a conversation with the LLM to help me decide) - I communicate all of that to the LLM and let it do very little beyond writing the code I described.It does feel counterintuitive that learning to write code requires as much time and practice, because this learning time is often compared to learning other skills that require more time and practice to acquire and gain proficiency in. The key realization is that while learning to write code is faster than (say) learning to become a neurosurgeon, it still takes a lot (nowhere near zero) of time and effort. And while the proficiency threshold to make a meaningful contribution is lower than in many other professions, that threshold is not a plateau - the proficiency curve does go a lot higher and I think this might be one reason why beginners often get a wide range of feedback (from experienced developers with a wide range of proficiency levels)Ok I took a couple of rambling tangents (sorry, it's Sunday afternoon), but the takeaways are:1. repeated exposure and practice are the key to escaping tutorial hell1. the proficiency threshold to ""build something"" is much lower to escape tutorial hell than it is to (for example) contribute to an existing project in a professional or opensource capacity1. the probability of accidentally making a catastrophic error is very low1. the notion that repeated exposure improves proficiency is not new (my cooking story), thought that's maybe more of a ""hard truth"" than a ""comforting fact"" as I had originally intended it to be[stir-fry]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8f752SdeAI",inspectorG4dget,2026-02-15 19:25:55,2,learnprogramming,t3_1r53h5t,False,

It’s possible the thing you want to build has never been built before or at least hasn’t been built before the way you want to.

That feedback loop is hard to simulate with passive learning.The only caveat is some people jump into building without enough basics and just feel overwhelmed.

The use of a contiguous memory layout, as well as enforcement of homogenous contents, are both secondary aspects of what makes something an array. An array is an ordered data structure which has (close to) constant time access to its contents by index. It’s better to think of these data structures in terms of the performance guarantees they provide for different operations than to try to focus on their implementations. Implementations can involve all sorts of hairy performance optimizations which obscure the intent of the data structure.The weird thing about JS arrays, and ArrayList objects compared to something like C or Java’s primitive arrays, is that they allow the data structure’s size to efficiently dynamically grow. The other weird thing about JS arrays is that they can be sparse, but that’s something you hopefully will never have to deal with. To be pedantic, it’s pretty common for arrays to “hold” heterogenous contents in languages other than JS. I use scare quotes because arrays of objects generally don’t hold objects themselves, but rather pointers to those objects. In languages with subtyping (like Java) the pointers may indeed point to multiple different types of objects as long as they are all subclasses of the array’s declared generic argument. A typed language like Java thus allows arrays to hold heterogenous data, but requires you to access the data as though it is homogenous (unless you use an unsafe downcast).

The important part is the ""sequential"" part. You can look things up by index, and the items appear in predictable slots. Contrast with an ""associative array"" (no analogue in vanilla C, `Map` (and arguably `{}`) in JS, `Map` in Java). These are non-sequential. You look up by key, not by index.

In Javascript, everything is pretty much the [Any type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_type), which in other languages may be called things like `Object` or `interface{}` or `void*`. So it's entirely expressible as a type, and as such the array is homogenously `array[Any]` or however you'd want to express the type.The other thing is that pretty much any language has some affordance for creating some sort of union, which you can then use in arrays. It will vary how ergonomic and error-prone it is, but in any case you can cook up an array of data that holds heterogenous base types.As in, you can define some union of integers and floats and put that in an array, which will be homogenous in that it only accepts that union and rejects stuff like strings, objects, etc; at the same time it'll be heterogenous in that you'll need to have some way of knowing which of the types in the union a given entry is.So the idea of homo/heterogeneity can be misleading,* because any sort of collection will always be homogenous if it's well-typed: all the elements in some collection `C[T]` are of type `T`* but may still be heterogenous in terms of base types: `T` may be a union of `T1 | T2 | …`",syklemil,2026-02-13 10:43:10,3,learnprogramming,t3_1r389j6,False,

The *class* only *describes*/*defines* the general setup, while the *object* fills it with data.There is another thing to consider: The implementation of OOP differs vastly between programming languages to the point that it is not even directly comparable (just take JavaScript, Python, and Java - completely different implementations of OOP). 1. In terms of programming an object is an instance of a class. - It's the *data/state* (fields/attributes/members) coupled with the *behavior* (methods) of a specific class (type).2. The binary data is scattered - the methods are stored in one place, and in one place only, no matter how many objects you create. The *state* (fields, attributes, members) are stored somewhere else, typically, but not necessarily, in contiguous memory blocks, individually for each object (apart from the exception of `static` members that also only exist once in memory). This is a very efficient approach as the data is usually a lot less than the methods.3. It is not actually that different. In some languages even structs can have methods - so the line blurs depending on the language. In a way, structs (as the structs in C) are the predecessor of classes.4. Methods are functions that belong to a class - it's basically just terminology. When a programmer talks about *functions* they mean *unbound functions* that exist outside the context of OO. When they talk about *methods*, they always talk about ""functions"" that are bound to classes and that only exist in the context of OO.The difference between function and method is: `len(string)` vs. `string.length()` - the former is a function that exists outside the context of classes and objects, but can accept an object, and the latter is a method that exists in the context of the `string` instance of a class.It's like ""please draw me a fish"" (""draw"" being the function and ""fish"" being the argument) and ""fish, please draw yourself"" (""fish"" being the object and ""draw yourself"" being the method called).",desrtfx,2026-02-10 15:51:39,14,learnprogramming,t3_1r13f94,False,

The C language had not even been written at this point. All of the boundaries that you're imagining were gradually defined over the next half century, and they are all domain specific. Each programming language has its own definition of an 'object', and the way that interacts with the other primitives depends on the implementation of that language and the hardware architecture that runs it.",jessepence,2026-02-10 15:56:41,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r13f94,False,
o4n11hn,"I don't know Rust, but I know C++, so I'll explain it in that syntax, but the concepts are universal.I warn you that if you look at objects too low level, the concept itself dissolves. Consider: class person { int weight, height, age; public: void jump(int how_high), run(int how_far); };In memory - whether it's on the stack or the heap, it going to lay out in memory per byte something like: [w][w][w][w][h][h][h][h][a][a][a][a]This is the same as if it were a structure. Objects are programming concepts - when you get down to the machine, it's all bytes - bytes for data, bytes for addresses, bytes for offsets, bytes for instructions...As for the functions, that gets compiled into the program binary, just like any other function. The syntax dissolves at the assembly level - to call the interface, you have to build a stack frame and push your parameters. One of the parameters is going to be the location of the object instance in memory - the hidden `this` pointer. So just as you have to push how high to jump, you also need to push who is doing the jumping. Again - the machine just sees program instruction sequences - bytes, and more bytes, and more bytes.Yes, you can directly replicate what the compiler is going to generate for you with a `struct` and a function that takes a pointer, but why? The syntax is there to facilitate what you already want to do in a more concise manner.But also, programming constructs are MORE than just syntax. C++, Rust, ANY language is more than just a high level assembly. The language defines the confines of what these things are, and the compiler is allowed to exploit everything else. In other words, stated more concretely - C++ has a SHITTON of Undefined Behavior, it's kind of notorious for it, but that's a GOOD thing, because everything the language doesn't say, the compiler can exploit for optimization. We want as much of that as possible, and then we can wrap those dicy corners with the standard library so you don't have to deal with it directly.The hard part is cultural - getting people to use the facilities provided and stop writing raw imperative code that gets them into trouble.> What is an object in terms of programming? An object is a user defined type, that models behavior, by encapsulating state, to protect it's invariant.So an `std::vector` is always implemented in terms of 3 pointers. The invariant is that those pointers are ALWAYS well defined. There is no intermediate state that YOU the client can ever observe. You also don't actually know how the vector is implemented, and you don't have direct access. You defer to the vector to enforce its invariant, and it's behavior is well defined through its interface. When you hand program control to the vector, it can suspend it's own invariant - say, to reallocate, but that invariant is reestablished before it returns control.So objects have a certain level of autonomy and agency. They know what to do, they don't need you to tell them how to do their job. It's why you employ classes in the first place, because that encapsulation keeps your program more correct and consistent.> How does the binary data and the methods in the class get managed at low level? Does the data get scattered in one place? Or it's just managed by pointers? Frankly it doesn't matter. No programming language gets that specific, because it's not portable.> How is an instance of a class that has no methods in it different from a struct type variable?Technically there is no different. Idiomatically, a class models behavior, and a struct is a tagged tuple. It's a conventional difference in meaning. Classes make for terrible structures. A car has some state, about the position of keys, dials, doors, etc, and the interface will open and close things, speed up and slow down... But NONE of that is dependent upon the make, model, or year. Those are variables that are independent. The same car can go by different names and makes. Is that a Subaru BRZ or a Scion FRS? Trick question, they're the exact same car made in the exact same factory as a joint project between the two companies.So if anything, you bundle your car model with it's pedantic properties in some sort of tagged tuple or relational or table structure.> How is a method different from a function that does some operations based on different values of its properties?At that low level, there isn't a difference. But any language and implementation can make the difference more significant. A free function and a public structure, you can do anything you want, and while you can do everything strict and correct, there's nothing preventing me from writing my own function that fucks everything. A class with a method? You're encapsulating state and enforcing an invariant.",mredding,2026-02-10 16:34:04,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r13f94,False,

Which is to say, they can be considered overengineering for a program of this size & scope, but overengineering otherwise small programs can also be a decent way to learn about those engineering practices.*Avoiding ""magic"" numbers*: Your `else` case for the difficulty rating is meant to result in `easy` mode, but this can drift apart. If you decide to give `easy` mode 4 tries for example, then you need to update that number in two spots. There are a couple of ways around that, like storing the numbers in constants, e.g. `const int EASY_MODE_TRIES = 3;` and then using the constant rather than the literal number, and/or having an extra parsing step where you wind up doing something like an extra function that ends on `else { cout << ""Something…""; return EASY; }`, returning something like an `enum` of the valid difficulty ratings, or even a struct. Error handling and parsing user input can be kind of big topics with lots of options.But generally, magic numbers are a hazard for code maintenance, because it very often turns into questions like ""why is it _this_ number? can I change it? what happens if I do?"" and some constants with names and rationales go a long way to alleviate that.*More functions*: Generally we break code up into what's hopefully logical chunks. Often to avoid repetition, but also sometimes just to break up long reams of code into something more like a condensed sequence of subtasks. Opinions vary on how long a function should be allowed to get. My opinion is something like trying to be able to fit the entire function on the screen (but also not trying to bend over backwards to follow the rule), which I think is a fairly common middle-of-the-road opinion.There are also a whole bunch of C++ concepts and best practices that you'll kind of have to pick up over time; one that may be good to get you to look into as soon as possible is ""[const correctness](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness)"".",syklemil,2026-02-12 13:17:14,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r2p4i0,False,

The important thing is to not tell us what the code tells us, because here's the thing - typically such comments and code disagree. So who's the authority? Which is right? The code? Or the comment?One thing your comments are doing is making up for a lack of functions. You're lacking expressiveness, and so you're trying to name what you're doing with the comment. Perhaps your next lesson will introduce functions to you, and this will dry up. std::transform(difficulty.begin(), difficulty.end(), difficulty.begin(), ::tolower);There is a bug here. It's really technical and subtle, and I don't fully understand it myself, but the [reference documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/tolower.html) warns you this is unsafe, that you need to write a function that casts your character type to `int`. random_num = rand() % max_num + 1;This is the same in every branch of your difficulty condition. Just hoist it out and write this code once, after the condition block. std::getline(std::cin, guess); // Take guess as string user_guess = std::stoi(guess); // Convert string to integerToo many steps! Streams know how to extract integers! Your problem is interleaving extraction with line grabbing.The rules of extraction are:1) Ignore leading whitespace2) Start grabbing characters3) Stop at some delimiter character. Leave the delimiting character behind, in the stream.The rules for line grabbing are:1) Grab characters one at a time2) Stop when you find the delimiter character, discarding it.So imagine first extracting an `int` - something like `"" 123\n""; the stream purges the leading whitespace, grabs ""123"" and leaves ""\n"" behind. Now you line grab, and what happens? We grab ""\n"", which is our delimiter, and we stop.So the thing to do is know when you're switching between the two, and `ignore` the newline as necessary. int x; std::string s; std::cin >> x; std::cin.ignore(); // Purge after extraction, before getline std::getline(std::cin, s); std::getline(std::cin, s); std::cin >> x; // No purge necessary after getlineAnother thing you should be doing is checking your streams. A stream is implemented as a ""user defined type"", which are made from `class`, `struct`, `enum`, and `union`. One of the things you can do is ""overload"" almost any of the language operators. That's how `operator >>` and `operator <<` - the bit shift operators, are made to work as stream extraction and insertion - they're written as functions that work with stream types. And when you learn to make your own types, you can write your own stream operators for them without having to modify the stream class itself - the pattern is extensible.Continued...",mredding,2026-02-12 15:35:47,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r2p4i0,False,

I was making a mod for Minecraft (using Java obviously). I had an item that could petrify entities by replacing the targeted entity with a modded “petrified entity”. In the petrified entity renderer I had to use Forge’s API in order to get the model from some render buffer somewhere. It then takes the model and applies a stone texture for rendering.However I quickly discovered a burial bug that occurs. If there is an actual instance of the target entity being rendered on screen at the same time as a petrified entity of the same entity, then any animations that played on the living one played on the petrified entity model. That obviously looks a little weird.I determined the cause of this was the fact the function I was calling to get the model wasn’t new model and was a shared reference or a shallow copy of a model. Now this were a copy constructor would have been very handy, but it didn’t seem to have one nor did the model class have the copy method implemented. I ended up writing this kinda ugly piece of code using reflections to solve it. It only needs to run once as it caches the model, so it isn’t too bad performance wise, but the code is ugly.

Some objects really do need to run some code to make a valid copy, because they internally manage some resource. As a simple example, consider a list. The list object itself usually doesn't directly contain its elements. It contains some kind of reference to separate memory which stores the elements. That memory is a resource it has to manage. Stuff like allocate new memory when you insert elements, free the memory when the list itself is being destroyed, etc.If you were to just create a bitwise copy of the list object, now you'd have two list objects, which are expected to manage the same memory, probably not knowing that the other one exists. This would lead to some serious memory safety bugs.

And at that point basic DSA and other stuff you've learned may look like kindergarten knowledge to you but from most lectures I've attended I can tell you that the base is absolutely crucial. If you can figure out the proper data structure(s) for your system/sub-system, the algorithms will follow without you having to explicitly design anything beyond business logic operations. And one of the most important statements I've learned is that whenever you're building something - a small project, a system, a library, an api, etc. think of it as ""Everything is a __"" where the __ is basically a morphable entity that you design from scratch. And the entire system can essentially be considered a single unit of that entity, even though it's made out of the same entity in smaller scales. This is where programming paradigms help alot. For example in Java, everything is an object. What is an object? For that you must know the details of OOP - which is just another programming paradigm. I can recommend https://roadmap.sh/ for a quick progress tracker as it covers the majority of this sphere.Lastly, having a mathematical mind is crucial to programming, because getting desired results from any given problem through programming can be achievable via brute force in the worst situations. But solving a problem in an optimized manner requires a ton of math and math oriented thinking. Because taking shortcuts and cutting corners is what makes your code precise and fast. This is where your knowledge of DSA can be applied in smaller scales - competitive programming problems from sites like Leetcode are extremely helpful and will give you a good grasp of what to do in most situations.",ReedxC,2026-02-10 07:54:05,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r0t9ne,False,

Outside of getting a degree in CS, that has always been the most helpful, since it both keeps me busy and gives me something to gauge my learning by.If it helps, here was my road. I didn’t have a map for my programming career initially, but I’ve learnt that adapting is the best strategy for my own path. I wasn’t familiar with computer science at all growing up, despite having a father who was a programmer. I tried to go to college but dropped out to protect my grades. Then I worked at Lowe’s for a time. While there, I bought a game on steam that taught Python. Overnight, I fell in love with coding. I took a year and taught myself how to code in Python through learnpython.org. I also gave myself the framework of making a fully-Python-based game engine (which I still haven’t finished), so that I could learn how the language worked. Now I’m back at the university learning coding. I took the required course on C++ and also researched ahead on some C++ concepts before they were taught, such as C++ classes and templating. Now I have practiced with C++ for over a year and am working on my own language. So all that to say we each have different roads and different ways of navigating through life.If you think you’re an imposter, you don’t have as much of a right to feel that way as I do, since I’m so late to the game and my life has more twists and turns than yours has. And I don’t feel that, because I’d rather give myself purpose and structure than to feel like I’m useless.

o4sh4bk,"""Refactoring"" isn't a magical tool that'll fix bad code - I honestly don't get why it is being taught like that, or even why someone would think that.Refactoring is simply a set of tools that you can use to more or less automatically restructure your code, if you want it to be written in a different way, like if you have one big function you want to split up in multiple different ones, if you want to rename variables, or change the input-parameters of a function across all uses. That is what refactoring is - it isn't something you can wave around that solves your weird memory-allocation scheme into something more professional.Anyways - first you plan how the code should be structured, you probably need to diagram something for this, as you won't be able to remember. You plan which classes you need, and which methods they should contain, what those methods should receive and return, and so on. You decide if some methods should perhaps be closer together in a single class, to keep coherence high, and you decide if some should receive fewer data-structures (or objects) to keep coupling loose ...Also, you make sure that you have valid tests that can run for both the un-refactored and the refactored code - if not, you write them along the way.Also, create a new branch for all this work, as you'll without a doubt break something!Then you begin - usually the steps are somewhat like this, but there's never a perfect recipe:1. Split functions and methods up into smaller parts2. Create additional classes and connect them3. Move functions / methods to their new classes4. Change globally available variables to locally where needed5. Change method parameters and/or return values - perhaps introduce new objects to be received and returned.Between each step you test, and once the tests pass, you commit - then go on to the next step.That is basically the way. Refactoring *never* makes the code ""better"" or ""faster"" from the computer's point of view - it is usually still the exact same lines of code that runs, but they are structured better from the programmers' point of view, so that they'll have an easier time implementing new features and changing functionality!",peterlinddk,2026-02-11 12:49:27,3,learnprogramming,t3_1r1uk7i,False,

We HATE loss, so we're susceptible to things like the sunk cost fallacy. So to save some of the cost you've put into this code base, to minimize your losses, you try to make a minimal change.

I have 37 years of mistakes to inform my design decisions without having to consciously think about it - that's called intuition. This may be new code, but I've already made up my mind about it 20 years ago, when I had to learn that one thing the hard way... So refactoring is so hard because your system is too tightly coupled and does not tolerate refactoring. All software systems have their limitations, nothing is infinitely extensible or refactorable or perfectly decoupled. The difference is how far you can go before it starts looking like bandaids or hits the hard wall that you need a redesign.One form of refactoring is short-sighted, where what you have is ""over-fit"" (borrowing from my data analyst wife), too tightly coupled, not flexible or extensible, it only does exactly what it was designed to do, and how. So what you end up doing is redesigning the thing with YET ANOTHER over-fit solution.Another form of refactoring is well seasoned. You design with flexibility in mind. This can be a hard sell even in the industry, because it can seem pointless at the time if the others think this is a well understood and fixed area. So good code is actually needlessly decoupled, because you end up tripping over it eventually, and you'll be glad you have that flexibility built in. It's stupid until you end up needing it. It's extra and unnecessary complexity until you end up needing it. It's needlessly expensive (premature optimization) until you both need it and discover the performance didn't matter here, anyway.And that's a dangerous one - performance, people will die on that hill, but then you become over-dependent on the performance of that segment to makeup for the failings of other, ""justified"", sloppy and expensive code. Well now you have to break this thing, and you lose the performance, and it's not itself a big deal, but it does expose the weaknesses of other code. And rather than fixing it, there's more bias to ignore it and blame other parts, put the burden on them to make up for it.---Continued...",mredding,2026-02-11 15:50:58,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r1uk7i,False,

Many tutors and computer science professors have already developed an algorithmic mindset, so they often dive straight into teaching specific languages and syntax. In doing so, they sometimes overlook the root of the challenge: learning how to think like a coder.In my opinion, when you're a beginner facing a programming problem, you should first grab a blank sheet of paper and ask yourself: 'How can I break this down like a cooking recipe?'For example, if I asked you to write a function that returns a boolean based on whether a number is prime, you could map it out like this:>Function isPrime(n):>If n≤1 then:>return False>If n=2 then:>return True>If n is even then:>return False>For i from 3 to SquareRoot(n) with a step of 2:>If i divides n then:>return False>EndFor>return TrueOnce you’ve done that and you’re confident in your logic, go ahead and write the code in the language you're learning. If you get stuck on the syntax, just look it up. Remember: syntax is just a matter of practice and habit. The real hurdle is training your brain to think algorithmically.It might seem a bit silly to use pen and paper for a simple function like this, but I promise you that after a few weeks, you’ll develop a real knack for deconstructing problems.

o4g11h4,"This is very good, and I concur with the bulk of it. I think there's good reasons that Golang and Rust lean far more towards a model of ""These are the shapes of data structures and we describe them and then write functions to act on them"" (with a syntactic sugar to do method calls) than their predecessors. I'd also like to add one more thought in this space: as software engineering has cared more and more about the network and shipping data between execution domains, coupling data to behavior has fallen grossly out of favor because **behavior is local to an execution engine and data is not**. If my data is wrapped up in a class instance and I have to ship it over the wire, I now have to peel the ""shippable"" data from the ""unshippable,"" i.e. any dynamic method pointers, vtables, or other mechanisms to specify what class this is an instance of, and that's annoying. If your data is in a bog-standard language-supported generic structure, you can ship it to a bog-standard language-supported generic marshaller and be done with the problem of getting it on and off the wire.I think I'd like to tune your thoughts a bit, because OOP conflates a couple of goals and we might want to talk about how we toss the bathwater without the baby.**Encapsulation and interface boundary**: You mention the challenge of ""re-opening"" a class to add new behavior. Some languages allow that! It's generally considered an anti-design. The reason is that being able to wall off code and say ""You can touch this via this mechanism and no other"" is a feature that enables large, decentralized teams to collaborate better by hiding details. If I hand you a Date object with methods, you do not need to care how I'm implementing the methods (with the tradeoff being the only things you can do with *my* Date object are the ones the interface exposes). This leaves me free to change my implementation without breaking you (maybe; see Hyrum's Law), and that's extremely important for being able to iterate to a solution because we almost never know how to write the best solution the first time. The humble `string` is actually my favorite example of this; crack the actual implementation of strings open in many high-level languages and you find that they're fascinatingly complicated (implementing things like caching and memory-reuse on string copy and substring so that the programmer doing the most obvious things with strings doesn't immediately torpedo program performance). If programmers touched the string internals directly, it would make using strings in those systems a nightmare. Golang has interfaces and structs instead of classes and objects, but it also has the rule that you can't write a function that acts directly on the contents of a struct if you aren't in the same module as the struct so that developers can't write code that depends directly on another developer's implementation without consent.**Discoverability**: So I have a struct. What can I do with it? How do I find all the functions that could be applied to that struct so I don't reinvent the wheel? In OOP, the answer is simple: the methods on the class and the parents of the class. In the data-and-functions paradigm... Good luck!It's not quite that bad. It *was* when computers were slower and smaller, which is one of the reasons I think OOP took off when it did. Nowadays, with a language with good static typing and an LSP, you can find all functions that take a given data type as an argument (even grep will work in a pinch, although you'll have to do your own composition analysis). But OOP gives someone a big leg-up on the discovery problem by imposing a paradigm of how code is sorted.Though I highlight the above, I concur with OP: **you don't** ***need*** **OOP to get those things.** It's just worth noting that when you throw OOP out, you're throwing out a paradigm that tries to give you those things for free (well, for cheap... The documentation engines I've seen for Java factories kind of give the lie to the notion that OOP ""solves"" discoverability).

Only a few that handle behavioral composition.It's like this argument puts forth a decent idea, and the because the idea is decent, decides to back it up with dishonest arguments.

OOP is about message passing - which you've missed entirely, OOD is about object modeling, which is orthogonal to OOP and entirely at your discretion - I don't use it. Objects don't couple behavior with data, they couple behavior with state. You can use OOD to model data. You conflate objects with types, and your arguments are mostly about types. You misunderstand aggregation vs. composition. Your conclusion is confused, because ECS is an architecture you can implement regardless of your paradigm.You do have one valid criticism of OOP, and that is due to the agency of the object. Each object is an island of one, which for batch processing is bad, and for stream processing is worse. While you can make a character object and a string object - to get adequate performance, you can't composite one in terms of the other, so you get a scaling problem that composition in FP solves.While I still say stick with FP, I can also say the difficulties you have suffered from OOP is due to your misunderstands.

From that I conclude that coupling data with behaviour is the problem and should be avoided in the first place to avoid the design problems in the first place.To counter that argument you would have to argue why that conclusion is not logical.

It means multiple tasks are literally running at the same time on different hardware resources.So yes, parallelism is usually considered a subset of concurrency. A concurrent program may or may not run in parallel depending on the hardware and runtime. But a parallel program is inherently concurrent because multiple flows of control exist at once.You’re also right that race conditions and deadlocks show up in both cases. They are properties of shared state and coordination, not of whether the CPU is single core or multi core. Even with context switching on one core, the interleaving can expose the same hazards.One mental model that helps is: concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.

o5aq5rl,"I'm working on a Kotlin math library for higher math. I was going to post my Cayley-Dickson construction to show how I generate the complex numbers from the field of real (double) numbers and then apply CD once again to get one of the six unital quaternionic (not commutative but still associative) involution division rings by doubling the complex numbers and mapping i to one of ±i, ±j, or ±k, but I would have to post too much code (a few dozen interfaces) to make it make sense, so instead, I'll post something more self-contained that will probably be more interesting to people here, i.e. the factoradic representation of a number.Still, it's a really cool algorithm and way to generate the ""Cayley-Dickson tower"" which creates an infinite sequence of algebras starting with the reals to create the complex numbers, the quaternions, the octonions, the sedenions, etc. without needing to explicitly code any of them.The thing about Cayley-Dickson is that you lose ""nice properties"" every time you recurse:When you go from the Reals to the Complex, you lose ordering, but you do get an algebraically closed field, which is always nice. (Every polynomial has a root in the field, and thus splits.)When you go from the Complex to the Quaternions, you lose commutativity (so xy ≠ yx for all x, y).When you go from the Quaternions to the Octonions, you lose associativity (so x(yz) ≠ (xy)z for all x, y, z, but you still have alternativity, which is a weaker form where (xx)y = x(xy) and y(xx) = (yx)x for all x, y.)The Sedenions are where the shit really hits the fan: you only have power associativity and you get nonzero divisors, i.e. ab = 0 where a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson\_construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson_construction)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4)**Instead: Factoradics**So you know how normally, we write numbers in base 10, e.g. 1234?And then we can write them in hexadecimal and binary?1234 in hex is 0x4d2 and in binary it's 0b10011010010?Well, another representation of numbers is called factoradic and is based on factorials. The rightmost digit is always 0, and the number is written: a_n * n! + a_{n-1} * (n-1)! + ... + a_1 * 1! + 0 * 0!where `0 ≤ a_i ≤ i` .Then 1234 in factoradic is: 1411200_! = 1 * 6! + 4 * 5! + 1 * 4! + 1 * 3! + 2 * 2! + 0 * 1! + 0 * 0! = 720 + 480 + 24 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 1234 (as expected in base-10)Here's my factoradic encoder / decoder and the explanation. Note that I prefer to use functional programming constructs when possible: hence why there are no loops here (tail call optimized recursion is my looping: in Kotlin, when you use the keyword val, you cannot reassign to a variable): hence why you see the `aux` function in encode. I (distastefully) use a MutableList all the same to avoid unnecessary list copies.I can't seem to paste it here (too long?) so I made a link to it:[https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS](https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS)Released under the 3-Clause BSD License, but not of much use to you unless you implement your own Factorial implementation (and there's a reasonable bit of machinery there as I represent a few dozen integer sequences and arrays).Right now I just finished polynomial rings / semirings and am working on quotient rings / semirings / fields so I can get the full gamut of finite fields for combinatorial constructions, elliptic curve cryptography (and other forms), coding theory, linear feedback shift registers, etc, as well as implementing geometric lattices nicely and naturally using rings like ℤ\[x\]/(x\^2 + x + 1) for the Eisenstein integers instead of jumping through hoops to replace ω\^2 = -ω - 1.(Not a beginner: I started programming when I was five and I'm 48 now and work in space astronomy.

Save it as ""XqZsoesa55w"" and search for that locally and play it if you have it, and if you don't, download it.

Even then, someone working on operating systems might call C high level and exclusively refer to assembly as low level.It’s hard to tell what languages people are referring to specifically when using these terms, but the presence of a garbage collector does seem to be a fairly consistent indicator of an indisputably high level language (JS, Python, Java). C and C++ might go both ways.Side note: interpretation vs. compilation is not a property of the language but rather its implementation.

OCaml's stdlib doesn't have a good regex library.

o50gsix,"Generally, high vs low level, and interpreted vs compiled are 2 completely different aspects of a programming language. The definition of high and low level languages has shifted over the years as we have developed more and more languages. But strictly speaking, a high level language is any language that abstracts away any specific hardware details. This means that pretty much every programming language falls into the category of “high level”, with the exceptions of assembly and machine code “languages” (if you could call machine code a language). This means that even languages like C, are considered a high level language. This is because when you write C, you do not need to consider the specific characteristics of the hardware your code will be running on. As long as a compiler exists for a target system, your C code will run largely the same on any system (assuming whatever libraries you use are similarly supported). I would say that your professor is largely correct, using this historical definition of high and low level language. However I would add the asterisk that some projects, most notably Linux, have plenty of source code written by humans in assembly. In this case, the assembly is still source code, but is still a low level language since it is dependent on the hardware it will run on. (In large projects like Linux, this often looks like writing the same functionality multiple times in assembly for each target hardware system. So while C code largely only has to be written once, you may find multiple implementations of the same functionality in multiple assembly languages)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_languageHowever, this distinction has somewhat shifted over the years and people some times use more relative terms like “high*er*” and “low*er*” level programming languages. These refer to how close or far to the hardware your language is abstracted away. So this means that while C is technically a high level language, it is often perceived as “low*er*” level than something like python. You’ll even see some people say that C is generally a “low*er*” level language. However these distinctions are largely semantic and don’t have much real meaning, especially when you’re first learning. I would not get caught up on these.The difference however between an interpreted and compiled language is completely different, and also in the modern day, much more complex. Generally speaking, an interpreter is any program that takes as an input some source code, and executes it without first compiling it to machine code. (Ripped from the first line on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing))) A compiler is then any program that takes source code in one language as an input, and outputs code in another language. However, almost always, this looks like translating a higher level language, into a lower level language, typically from a strictly high level language, into a strictly low level language (like C -> assembly).So the 2 concepts are somewhat related, but there is no exact relationship between them. Modern compilers and interpreters are much more complex and have many stages that translate source code through many different levels of abstraction. And, modern programming languages have started blurring the lines between what is seen as higher level and lower level.",gman1230321,2026-02-12 17:16:25,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r2ycob,False,
o50sef1,"Low level languages are coupled to the machine, it's architecture, it's instruction set, and are often inseparable and non-portable.Machine code itself is low level - almost as low as you can go, just short of micro-code and physical wiring.Assembly is higher level, including symbols, directives, macros, constants, comments... but by definition its statements correspond 1:1 with machine code instructions. You might write a `mov` statement, but which specific instruction you get is dependent on it's parameters.High level languages target abstract machines and are portable. C++, for example, targets an abstract, byte addressable stack machine, two's compliment signed integers, little-endian, etc. So byte offset and bit manipulation on up - calling conventions, etc, all that is beyond the language, and must be defined by the implementation. So if your machine is word-addressable, the compiler has to translate byte addressing into words in some way.Languages can affect architecture; C++03 is THE DEFINITION of the x64 Itanium ABI, and is standard for the hardware, which was designed around it. That doesn't some how lower the level of the language on that particular platform.So it doesn't matter if the language is compiled or interpreted. You can build an interpreter around a virtual Turing Complete stack machine that runs an assembly.

o5btqdx,"I'll list some things that might make you consider using message brokers, not in order of importance and not in a mumbo jumbo scientific way.1. A message broker is a separate, usually unchanging serviceThis means that redeploying your service has no effect on receiving data and storing event data. You could argue that writing events to a database is the same - and you'd be right, however we're not done yet! 2. Let's take a topic exchange as an example, you've created your topic exchange and have many routing keys for it. One of these routing keys is lets say for messages indicating that a payment has been completed.One day, you'd like to send these payments to a fraud detection company (totally random example, I'm still having coffee), you could make the most barebones service that simply registers a new queue/binding to this exchange listening to the same routing key your main service already listens - and you'll receive a copy of all the payment events.This plug and play style once your messaging system is set up is really comfortable and doesn't require extra work apart from occasionally adding a new field to your message.3. Manual acknowledgement + outbox/inbox patterns for your messages/events is intuitive and safe to work with . Retries are handled with minimal work from your side with the correct configuration for your queue - connectivity issues and the like can be glossed over and you can define a threshold for dead letters where you'll actually have to think if messages reach there - but little connectivity issues or temporary outages don't really hurt you. 4. It's super easy to scale! Apart from being able to plug different consumers into the same routing key to get copies of messages to do different things with them you can also plug multiple (usually identical) instances of a consumer to a single queue so they can fairly share the work. It's really simply to dynamically scale this by adding or removing consumers to a queue that isn't doing the work fast enough.4.5-ish. Like you already mentioned and as it might be a bit obvious it really helps keep your system tidy(er) where each instance can just do its own thing and if you need something *else* you just make something fresh and connect it without bogging down your existing services with more responsibilities. Obviously it's not all sunshine and rainbows and you can easily make a sprawling mess of events flying all over the place and eventual consistency does have its own considerations.",disposepriority,2026-02-14 12:09:58,4,learnprogramming,t3_1r4iu1u,False,

This applies to all the customers and all their requests to the API.This means your API's primary concern is to talk to these clients, the API itself is like a server in a restaurant. If the API actually also does stuff (goes to the kitchen and makes the stuff requested), it stops being interactive for that duration, which is its primary job. So the API delegates as much work as possible to keep being interactive, the work is done via queues and message brokers.In short, any (real) work should not be done by the API, it should get done by something else.

o5c8wjh,"There are a couple reasons.1) It allows your apps to work a lil more independently. Depending on your messaging setup, a service can just fire and forget to the message queue, cuz the delivery guarantees are provided by the queueing system.2) similarly it allows different apps to work at their own pace3) all your queues are in one place. Like imagine there are multiple instances of your application each with their own local in memory queue, a message might be sent to both and the work is duplicated or some consistency criteria might even break. You can have this sync without queues but if you need queues anyways, just using a service for queues that can observe all the events is massively helpful.4) the queue can scale independently 5) observability, you have once central logical place where the queues report to even if internally they are all running in different physical/virtual systems. So you can then do 2nd level of adaptations based on the state of your queues.

For “metrics,” people often use it to avoid coupling request latency to logging/storage and to survive DB outages without dropping events.

o4v8jwg,"I'm not entirely sure what I should picture under ""robot sumo competition"" but I have a bit of experience in foundational robotics in my CS degree.To answer your questions: Yes, you can use a camera and a bunch of methods to recognize things. OpenCV is a widespread standard image processing library. You can do C++ but I honestly would say the adapter to Python would probably be a bit more easier to handle because you can use Python for ML stuff as well if you want to, even if Python isn't exactly the fastest.One of the problem you really need to figure out first is to determine the boundary of the problem. What do you mean when you say ""front"" and ""back"" of a robot?If the competition has defined features of a robot, you can use that to determine what constitutes front and back. Using standard or advanced image processing algorithms are going to be an option in this case.A very straight-forward case would be if the competition requires every robot to show some sort of marker for the front facing side. You can use some variant of HOG (histogram of oriented gradients) or if its more complicated SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) to get a decently robust feature detection for the front-side and then deduct that the absence of that feature plus something else like rotational tracking will be the back-side.You can also try the Generalized Hough Transform (although that one might be a bit too slow for pictures with too many pixels).All 3 algorithms are implemented in OpenCV I think (although if not, you can certainly just build them yourself using the OpenCV toolkit).But If robots can look arbitrary and you cannot say that there is some sort of fixed recognizable features, the detection is going to be tricky and OpenCV will not solve your problem. In the latter case, I would honestly consider resorting to machine learning. Retraining CNNs for classification can yield pretty decent results. You would need to have a decently sized training set of images of competition robots fronts and back. You would then do the pre-processing in OpenCV and then pass it on to the model or if you have something integrated like from Nvidia's developer suite, maybe use their stuff.The problem with the ML approach is that you need a decently powerful compute platform on your robot. Even if the majority of computation happens at training phase, processing and then prediction still takes decent amount of compute power. Small embedded systems with a good GPU to handle matrix operations are necessary while not being power hungry monsters.Your other question is a bit vague: What do you mean ""friend or foe system"" for ""recognizing yourself""?",theusualguy512,2026-02-11 21:00:06,2,learnprogramming,t3_1r273ye,False,
o4w9e90,"Yes, this is definitely doable, especially with an overhead camera where you control the environment. The simplest way to detect front and back is to add asymmetric markers to each robot, like a colored patch on one end or distinct shapes, so orientation can be inferred from the contour or marker positions. For friend or foe, you can give your robot a unique color pattern or fiducial marker and track that specifically, which avoids relying on pure shape detection.Since you are new to CV, I would start with basic color thresholding and contour detection in OpenCV before jumping into anything fancy. Real time performance in C++ should be fine if your frame size and processing pipeline stay reasonable.

The reason I say this is, because if you're new to both languages and programming, it's more important to focus on that 'how' and the 'why' than the 'what'. I did a Java module which entailed writing a small CRUD records management system for a fictional enterprise. The only requirement was that it had at least three datasets and that one of them was many-to-many. I initially tried to do a video store (one of the examples) but never having worked in one and with certain things being open-ended (film categories/genres) I simply opted for Formula 1 because it was something I knew well in it's composition. There were drivers, engines and teams and each team had two drivers and one engine. The knowledge of what the end looked like helped me focus on the syntax of the language and the logic of the code and even helped me spot wrong turns when I realised that I wouldn't be able to do what I needed to if I carried on down that path. There's no one right answer here and I know some people find the motivation to solve a problem that hasn't been solved yet is what helped them push through and stick with it, but this was helpful for me.",DeltaBravoSierra87,2026-02-11 21:47:12,2,learnprogramming,t1_o4nlc2c,False,
o4o5lnx,"Got it!1. Any type of problem will help you as a programmer. You really can't wrong here. At some point you might specialize, but right now you just need experience using programming to solve any problem at all. 2. Honestly C is an old language and not many working programmers today would choose it unless it was a very niche thing. The main reason is that C programs are relatively tricky for things like memory management and concurrency. C also doesn't have many features that modern languages have. That is actually why I mentioned Rust, which meant as a kind of modern C replacement. Rust is similar to C, but it has many cool features and still is very fast and runs ""close to the metal"" like C does. * The general answer to the question of ""what is good to write in C (or Rust)?"" is: anything that has to run very fast and/or in limited environments like embedded systems (eg raspberry pi) * a different answer could be a math-heavy problem. Something that uses a lot of data and does a lot of calculations on it very fast.3. Creating your own language is a great thing to try. I suggest trying it after you have learned a few different ones. After all, how will you know what kind of language you want to build if you have never experienced writing any language?4. I'm not sure I can answer the core of the creative block problem. I first got into programming because I wanted something to exist that didn't. I had a problem and the only way to solve my problem was to write a program to solve it. I'm not sure how you would come from the other direction, with a solution in search of a problem. I guess my advice to think about what you wish existed.5. Finally, I would not worry about ""knowing what you need to know."" When I started with my problem I knew nothing at all. You will learn what you need to know as you go step by step through the problem you're trying to solve. At each step you will not know what to do, and you'll figure it out by searching, then you'll move on to the next step and repeat the process over and over until the problem is solved.",PeteMichaud,2026-02-10 19:40:17,3,learnprogramming,t1_o4nlcwx,False,

Rather than making assumptions.Why would you use a saw to put a nail in the wood?Also its not so much about language syntax at all.

Composition over inheritance.If u go deeper and deeper... U will more and more hate OOP and love the beauty of functional programming.Anyway a list of my favourites areOxCaml(close to the perfect language), Rust(most usable performance, but far from perfect), Python(most flexible and huge ecosystem)For example Python is a glue language. Fast prototyping and scripting. But u can easily make a program in rust. And use that inside Python. Nice practical combo. But these are just languages and it also depends what the market asks...

o4wwgq6,"Having functions be objects allow them to be treated like any other piece of data. So I can make a variable and inside of that variable can be a number of different functions.In C you can pass data around, but you cannot pass a function (behavior, it’s not ‘data’). You can technically but it’s not a callable object which is what you’re actually asking.So I can’t make a List or an Array and inside of that array put a function… I also can’t pass them as a parameter to be the input into another totally separate function. In Dart or JS and most modern-ish languages a function are treated as an object just like any other data like a var or a const, so you can manipulate them the same exact way.So if I have a function that does something to an array of numbers, an then sends those numbers out to be updated in real time, it’ll have specifics like who’s logged in, and who’s looking at what. It’ll be a huge function. But I may want to manipulate that data in a certain way before that function executes and send those numbers out.Maybe I want the numbers converted to a different currency, or rounded, or cut off any number below X or above Y, so I make my function.CoreFunction forEachItem(nums, SpecialBehaviorFunction5) and then the rest of that function.I may have 14 different “special behavior functions” that I’m going to use, and that gets passed to this core function 5000 times a minute.So this makes writing and compositing the code way easier and way easier to think about as well because I don’t have a ton of classes or function sitting around scattered. I’ve got the core function, the special behavior function, and some function that decides what special behavior function to pass to the core function.That’s the easiest way I can explain it for now but I’ll keep thinking for a concrete example.",The_Shryk,2026-02-12 02:27:47,2,learnprogramming,t3_1r2gfbw,False,

o4r8v10,"> No way its that simpleYes, it basically is that simple - at least to get started.The RAM of a computer is nothing but boxes with *addresses*, yet, there is one little thing to remember:Depending on the *data type*, the information stored in the memory can take up one or more boxes (e.g. an Int can be 4 bytes - 4 memory addresses, or 8 bytes, etc.) The *pointer* always points to the *start* address, the first address where the item is stored.This becomes even more evident when you look at *arrays*.Arrays - especially C-style arrays are just contiguous blocks of memory with data of the same type stored. The pointer for the array stores the address of the very first element in the array - and here is where the ""0-based"" array indexing comes from. Since the elements are stored in a contiguous memory block and have a fixed size depending on the data type, it's easy to figure out where the elements are: `base address + (index * size)`. You know the *base address* - the pointer, you know the *index* - the element you want to access, you know the *size*, which is determined by the data type. That's it.Pointers are extremely useful, but more modern languages (or more modern implementations of languages) often *hide* them away from the user so that they don't have to deal with them.

With the new year, people are really dissecting annual reports of publicly traded companies, and after ~5 years of this bubble, no major player has reported a positive ROI on AI software integration. Not one.We're seeing ~$22 billion in technical debt created by AI, because the slop they generated can't be understood by people. This is important, because the industry is finally really coming around to understand - you can't hold AI accountable.If a corporation loses shareholder value, causes damages, or kills people, C-levels and employees can be held personally accountable. There was a time I was responsible for 60% of all option trading on Earth, can you just imagine the concrete shoes I'd be wearing at the bottom of some lake right now if I allowed AI to speak on my behalf? Where did all the money go? I dunno, Boss; I asked the AI and they don't know, either. How does this work? I dunno, Boss, the AI made it, and every time I ask, it remakes it in a different way...We're also seeing the employment pendulum swing the other way. That technical debt we've accrued so far is going to take a decade to un-fuck, and we're still going with it, so there will be work for the rest of MY career...And things lag, so there's still a feeling of uncertainty that everyone is acting on, and employers are taking advantage of that while they can by offering low wages since it's still a saturated, employer's market. As the employee market dries up, those salaries are going to pick back up. That things are actively changing isn't a secret, if you know where to look and who to ask.> Or will AI simply raise the entry-level requirement for junior engineers?I'm not quite sure how to interpret this one, yet. Businesses thought they'd replace junior level work with AI, but that means entry level positions would be essentially senior architect roles, basically what you're suggesting - and how can you do that without the experience?So AI has caused some damage, and there will be a gap in employee demographics as we took a whack at 5 years of college grads who didn't find their footing in the middle of this bungling market experiment. They'll all be off into other markets, or set back from missing 5 years critical experience. If you've invested 5 years into something else while this market figures its shit out, you're probably better off sticking to that, rather than finally kick-starting a late career.> I see that companies are mostly hiring senior engineers these days, but if there aren't enough junior engineers, who will they hire are seniors in the future? ( sorry if this sounds silly ) That's a very real question, and the answer is they're going to pay out the ear for the mistake, in the long run.Companies are hiring seniors for two reasons:1) Trump. He's a bad actor, a Russian asset; he has grifted and pilfered this government and economy, intentionally destroyed it in ways that cannot be explained by economics or incompetence alone, and he's such a wildcard, that everyone is just buckling down and hoping to survive this administration, until we can get back to ""business as usual"". And to conservatives and authoritarians of the regime who disagree - you're evil.2) Corporate interest rates went up from 0% 3 years ago, and then the massive layoffs started happening. It wasn't due to AI. Zero interest corporate loans are federal subsidies to grow the economy. You fork off a subsidiary of your conglomerate, spend the money, develop the tech, and when the money runs out, you fold the subsidiary tied to the loan - taking the debt with it. But the parent company keeps all the IP. This scheme is over for FAANG, but not for smaller corporations - so expect some underdog success stories.> how will software work envolve in the future?AI won't go anywhere.

It's not 100% related to your end goal, but a cheap and easy starting point. Arduino Starter Kits (including the actual Arduino system) are in the range of $50 to $100 and you get lots of hardware (sensors, LEDs, motors, etc.) to play around with.Maybe, ask also in guitar or synthesizer related subreddits, or in the embedded ones, like /r/esp32, /r/arduino, /r/esp8266, /r/nodeMCU, and so on. /r/vsti and /r/synthesizers with their related subreddits could also be viable resources.Also, my general advice would be to focus on *learning programming* first, and there, since you will need C++ use https://learncpp.comWe normally don't suggest C++ as first language as it is a difficult language to get into. Normally, we recommend Python (with the MOOC [Python Programming 2026](https://programming-26.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki), but that would not get you in the direction you want.

I've used it to great effect at debugging. I would paste in some logs from one service and that elevated qps of errors started showing up around this time and it would go digging (monorepo, so all dependencies are in the same codebase) and walk the the graph and find some subtle change in some shared library in some other part of the codebase our team doesn't own that's used by a dependency of our team's service.Distributed systems are hard.

And here's the truth: people don't have even have the slightest clue of what they're talking about.Originally I studied Finance and Accounting. My first job was at a Big 4 public accounting firm in 2016, they demoed an AI agent that could do our job to show they were ""cutting edge."" Did we use it? No. We used excel workbooks that have been around longer than your grandma's fridge. Did we leverage Python, VBA, and so on to work better and faster like I knew how to do? No. Some of these people could barely move around a single sheet in Excel.Then I worked at a F500 company. In addition to regular accounting and finance work, tried as much as possible to automate. I tried to do things better, faster, more efficiently. I wrote ""shadow apps"" (not managed by the dev teams) for other financial analysts and accountants as the massive dev teams we had didn't have ""capacity"". Eventually I hit a wall and essentially there was so much I wanted to incorporate and change but was denied the tools needed to deploy and maintain them. Basically ""sorry you're not an SWE so we can't give you access."" So I left and now I'm building financial systems and doing meaningful work as a SWE and getting my masters in CS. And making more than I did before and happier.Here's my takeaway: you will be stunned to see how SLOW companies adopt tech outside of big tech companies. Even if you TRY you'll hit resistance.If you have a desire to build a solution, you will have a job. If people on this sub or the vibe coding subs think an accountant at a F500 company will use Claude Code to vibe up a solution, I'm sorry but it will not happen about 90% of the time. If they didn't write basic Python scripts before, they are not vibe coding now. Anyone that believes that will happen are either delusional or have never actually worked outside of tech roles.And a final note: I could have automated 80% of my work as an accountant and financial analyst pre-AI.

If a company wants to be somewhere, they'll lease property. If a company doesn't want or need to be somewhere, they'll let leases expire. And then everything else falls into line with the leases.10 years ago, every smart CFO advocated very long leases to reduce lease rates. Now that companies have been shown that they don't need people onsite, every smart CFO is recommending that the company only renew very essential leases and let the rest expire. This is a corporate finance tectonic shift on par with switching to defined-contribution retirement plans (late '90's) and switching to unlimited PTO (late '00's).If you like working there, make yourself as valuable as you can. It still might not make the difference, but it usually does. If your boss can say about you to their boss ""I can't succeed without this person"", then you are usually safe. That's your goal...if you want to stay there.And in a few years when your company's leases expire, then leadership will say that they've discovered or realized that WFH is a vital part of work life balance or whatever stupid way they have of justifying what is ultimately a financial, lease-centric decision.",jimmy-buffett,2026-02-11 23:18:55,17,cscareerquestions,t3_1r2aupk,False,

On the surface that means 75% of devs get laid off. But in reality, this ignores the factor of human ambition and greed. The ultimate goal of a company isn't to punch off its current TODO list. It's to maximize profits. So at least some of those 75% should end up building new features and launching new products to generate more profits through efforts that wouldn't have been justifiable at the previous cost of development.And some of them will go off and start their own companies doing things with a person or two that previously would have taken a team, startup capital, etc.And so on.I think the same thing applies to the idea of people sitting idle overall. If you look at all of the laid off people coldly as a resource pool sitting idle waiting to be exploited to generate profits, it starts to look as silly to not find a way to put them to work as it would be to not tap into an oil well sitting idle in your backyard. Not because you're trying to do a good deed by giving them a job, but because you're trying to make more money. Which is really the only reason anyone has a job today.The truly difficult part could be the relative pace of all of this - if millions of people get laid off at an unprecedented rate, it will take time to figure out how to leverage this new human resource - what happens in that time? But in the long run, I suspect that the ultimate answer to how we keep ourselves busy in the face of these new tools will be the same answer that has accompanied every productivity increasing technological development in human history: we'll just do more.

o4t8wuc,"8 months with zero organic responses after 600 applications isn’t a you problem, it’s a systematic filtering issue. Something in your application materials is triggering an automatic rejection before human eyes ever see them. The fact that your network connections got you interviews proves you can perform when given the chance, so the barrier is purely at the screening stage.Six resume rewrites might actually be hurting you if each version strays further from ATS optimization. Consider this: get your most recent version reviewed by someone currently hiring in tech, not just resume writers. They’ll spot what’s causing the auto-rejections. Also, gaps on your resume or the layoff itself might need different framing. Some companies filter out anyone currently unemployed, which is brutal but realYour tech stack isn’t the problem since those skills are still in demand. More likely it’s resume formatting breaking ATS parsers, missing keywords that match job descriptions exactly, or your experience level falling into an awkward middle zone where you’re overqualified for junior roles but competing with seniors.Stop applying to undervalued positions immediately. That signals desperation and companies assume you’ll leave when something better appears. Focus on contract or freelance work to fill the gap while maintaining your search.

Mid-sized DoD company as my first, second was not FAANG but it's one that i personally would say is at the same level as FAANG (or mag7) and the third and current is big tech. I wouldnt consider it the same tier as FAANG but i would say it's a tier just under FAANG. To answer the question, i tdepends. I've never worked startup but i've heard startups have similar culture. But what i will say on each company i feel like it's general for each type of company.DoD- at DoD, this was super chill. The work felt meaningful but the work was also super chill. Like i could sit on a task for a month, work 8 hour days where half the day i twiddled my thumbs and still get good reviews at the end of 6 months. I remember getting to my project and it was a year away from being ""complete"" and it took us 3 years to complete it and nobody was mad or batted an eye. It was a poorly run project because everybody just wanted to do 8 hours and go home. Nobody was really trying to go all out for them. The pay wasnt the best but it was good. I would recommend DoD to anybody who likes CS but doesnt love it to want to learn new systems, new code, etc. Just wants to get their day done and go home and not htink about work. But it'sv ery easy to get behind the times and not move ahead in your career. You will get promoted pretty quickly but wont learn much really. Nobody even sends an email after 5 pm.FAANG level - when i left DoD i wanted more pay and to learn more. It was a huge culture shock. I went to cloud services. The company i worked for was known for having work life balance but I didnt ralize cloud is where that dies. It was super competitive. A SWE2, did twice as much work as a senior at DoD did. I made good money but god it sucked. Seniors and up were so booked they had no time to help juniors. Reviews were not based on what was expected it was based on how you compared ot your coworkers. I literally got in my review, ""his coworkers do more than him"" becaus ei didnt work 60 hour weeks like osme of them. That wasnt the reason but whne most are doing 60 and you are doing 40 it shows in the work. I got laid off and honestly didnt even miss it. If you werent sending emails or getting at calls at like 8pm you were behind. It felt like you always had to be available. Big tech - i got a job in big tech and was making more than i was at FAANG. Honestly it's been great because the work is meanigful, i work for a cloud service that's big but not as big as the faang one. But because it's not as big, nobody feels overworked. For the first ime iin years i had people say ""dude it's 6pm go home"". It's a good level of feeling like youa re doing meaningful work and not feeling like you have to work 60 hours to keep up.

So my conclusion has been it always is universally painful when anyone is trying to traverse going from something like dotnet or python to a java system.

With my employer at least, there are concerns with the wildcard nature of bootcamp/self taught hires, whereby graduates are seen as more consistently good/less risky. So the degree requirement is part of a generalised move to standardise data science and put a level of assurance to baseline expectations of skills.

Get the advice and just listen, don't ""but what about, or I heard, or people say"", just listen and ask actually meaningful questions. Right after, and I mean right after, write everything down, whatever you can remember.This is both local advice, networking, and a sort of introduction to an interview.Keep doing this as you can. Keep your eye out for and ask about any local events where IT people meet to talk IT stuff, if you can, try to attend. The goal is to be seen.Getting the degree and being a good fit for the company and the team are what is important. Regardless of what you take, you are not going to really know what you are doing for the first five years, so when people give you free advice, listen.Ideally, you will graduate having had a few tech summer jobs, and have networked with several people.

Do you have a mentor (someone at the company with more experience who can take a personal interest in you and can help you navigate these problems)?

I've seen several people who still can't get a job even after doing OMSCS which really makes me question if it's worth it.OMSCS is not going to move the needle in terms of recruiting, most recruiters are aware of the program and its 90% acceptance rate after they've seen thousands of applications of people blasting through Georgia Tech MSCS (online omitted of course). Everytime I say this I get someone pointing out the rigor, which I don't find to be a working argument because any decent engineering program is going to be fairly rigorous in its own right. What recruiters actually care about is name brand and the selectivity signal that comes with prestige. Example in point: a majority of interns are completely useless and are a complete net loss for the company. Having a nice internship from a good big tech is still going to move the needle very favorably resume-wise because of the bar of what it took to be accepted, and the signal to recruiters that you were able to get in a prestigious company, even if you didn't really do anything productive.>I've heard several people say they completely blacklist WGU grads so that's why I'm concerned with just having it on my resume.No one is specifically blacklisting WGU, this seems very unlikely. The simpler and more likely reason at hand is that your resume is probably not competitive enough for the current landscape. Adding OMSCS to your resume is not going to change that either.The reality is that it's going to be very difficult for average CS grads to find work within this environment and landscape. The easier times when many people could reasonably make their way into a decent SWE job have passed, and is most likely not going to come back.

First was Graduate Algorithms. It used to be homework plus exams, but they switched it to basically exam-only for grading. From what I heard, that change happened after one semester where the professor/TAs flagged a bunch of students to the Office of Student Integrity, and most of them ended up winning their cases. After that, they moved to exams only.Second was AI course. They rolled out a VS Code based IDE called NOSI that tracks all of your activity. And in that class, you’re not allowed to use AI at all, or even the internet. You’re expected to rely strictly on the textbook, lectures, and write your code in that IDE. It also got two take-home exams that are like 50 pages each, and you get a week for each one, also no internet allowed.Third was Machine Learning. This one is the complete opposite, you can use as much AI as you want, even to generate all of your code. But the class is so hard that even with AI, it still took me like 20–30 hours a week (so they basically made the course almost impossible to get through without using AI). On top of that there’s also an Honorlock-proctored exam.So yeah, just from these 3 classes alone, it’s basically three totally different approaches to dealing with AI tools.",Sad-Sympathy-2804,2026-02-11 06:51:34,21,cscareerquestions,t3_1r1pxr5,False,

o54amjn,"I'm actually in a weirdly similar spot, just from the opposite direction. I have a finance bg and somehow ended up building an AI product without any formal tech experience. The imposter syndrome is real, but tbh I think you're overthinking this.Here's the thing about those foundational gaps you mentioned. Yeah, they're important for certain roles, but for the path you're describing (backend dev, cloud infrastructure, applied ML), you can absolutely fill those gaps without going back to school. I've been learning this stuff in real time while building, and honestly some of the best engineers I know are self-taught or have non-CS degrees.The AI systems architect goal is totally doable without a formal CS degree. What matters more is understanding how to design scalable systems, knowing your way around cloud platforms, and having practical experience with ML workflows. I'm seeing this firsthand - we're building Sprout (an AI job search tool) and the technical challenges are more about system design, data pipelines, and user experience than theoretical CS concepts. The foundational stuff comes up, but you learn it when you need it.That said, if you do want structured learning, there are way more efficient options than a full degree program. MIT OpenCourseWare has excellent systems courses, Coursera has solid ML specializations, and honestly YouTube + building projects will teach you more practical skills than most university programs. The Georgia Tech OMSCS program is solid if you really want the credential later, but you could probably test into it with your existing experience and some strategic self-study.The real question is whether you need the degree for credibility or just the knowledge. For backend/cloud/systems architecture roles, your portfolio and ability to solve problems matters way more than your diploma. Plus you're already employed and gaining experience - that's honestly more valuable than classroom time right now.What specific foundational concepts are you feeling most lost on in your current work?

o54iovp,"Hi Brad,Thank you for your thorough response. From first hand experience, i’ve sort of ran into the same conclusion. Most of what i do requires basic logic and problem solving. Honestly, lately, i tend to prompt engineer a lot of my work, especially boiler plate tasks. Not because I can’t solve it myself but just to expedite tasks that would have otherwise been super tedious. Of course, i always make sure to double check what’s been implemented.Anyways, i came to realize that I don’t really encounter too much heavy math or really any of the foundational topics i mentioned in my post. Well, except maybe data structures and algorithms. But I know for a fact I can just revisit those topics on my own. Even then, the type of data structures and algorithms that I come across or use aren’t really all too complicated.I guess i’d like to pivot into something with a little more “job security”. I feel like ai systems management is the way to go. But, to be perfectly frank, i haven’t taken much of a deep dive with system design nor machine learning. Im just at that stage where I’m thinking about pivoting into those roles. Right now im doing mostly basic crud both fe and be. Which is why im wanting to do something that’s a little more future proof. That’s why im considering perhaps going back to school. To learn the fundamentals of cs. But, I honestly do feel that I can teach myself these things. The tricky thing is coming up with a solid structure/strategy. In fact, i asked chat gpt and it actually did lay out a pretty solid plan. Thank you for those course recommendations btw, ill make sure to look into those. Maybe it’s the confirmation bias talking (i really do try to look both sides of the equation), but your response has sort of helped put my mind at ease. Honestly, I’m fine with hearing both sides.

o4wlx4c,"I get these all the time too. Don't give them any information (That's real anyway) that usually try to bait you in with a quick payout to venmo or something.

o4wpj8m,"Depending on the countries involved, this could be considered wire fraud. The scammers are trying to get jobs they are not eligible due to location/work authorization/other relevant laws.

o4wyma1,"I'm an admin on a Slack community and we get people wandering in with similar messaging every now and then.What are they after? Easy money. Easy for the middleman who's setting things up, anyway.>Why would they have a developer working on the technical part and have someone else join the meetings for them? * They charge a ""reasonable"" rate for the person who's attending the meetings, and pay them a decent hourly rate for the time spent in those meetings* They pay the person who actually does the work a pittance* They pocket the rest",alinroc,2026-02-12 02:40:33,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1r2fn9z,False,
o4wq942,"Oh I have not given any information to them, the way the whole email is written just screams scam or illegal. I'm just wondering if they actually do that, or if that's just a scam to get your information. By do that I mean, if they deceive companies by having people pretend they are their contractors while someone else is doing the work behind.",BananaBerryPi,2026-02-12 01:50:40,1,cscareerquestions,t1_o4wlx4c,True,
o4yn31f,"Occasionally I get something like that. They seem to be pushing some sort of MLM or timeshare ""work for yourself"" or ""passive income"" seminar that no doubt involves you fronting a lot of money in advance with the promise of some sort of future ROI. About a quarter of these seem to be sales/commission-only type positions. The whole thing seems to be designed to separate desperate people from whatever money they have left, and I have no patience whatsoever for them.",FlyingRhenquest,2026-02-12 11:04:24,2,cscareerquestions,t1_o4wpj8m,False,
o4wqqn1,"Ohh that makes more sense now, yeah. So obviously illegal, I imagine they are offering developer jobs to people in countries they are not allowed to work from directly to the companies (like American companies can't hire people from Cuba, as an example) and have other people act as the developer. Definitely some sort of impersonation fraud and breaking a lot of international laws too.",BananaBerryPi,2026-02-12 01:53:35,1,cscareerquestions,t1_o4wpj8m,True,
o4x0ine,But isn't it illegal for the person who's attending the meetings to be doing that? Could they face serious consequences with the law?,BananaBerryPi,2026-02-12 02:51:48,2,cscareerquestions,t1_o4wyma1,True,
o4ystv4,"Legality depends on laws and jurisdictions. As well as who has access to what. For example, if I'm the representative and have been given credentials to access systems, and then give those credentials to you, then it's possible that it's a criminal offense of unauthorized computer access (18 U.S. Code § 1030).It's almost certainly a breach of contract but that's a civil matter.Regardless, it's unethical as hell.",alinroc,2026-02-12 11:52:45,2,cscareerquestions,t1_o4x0ine,False,

o4t6l6t,"Personally, I think its fine either way. I would prefer just make it public so someone could see your progression.Eod from a traditional employer's pov. Realistically what is going to happen, a swe is prob getting your resume the day b4 or the day of the interview few hours b4. They might spend 15-30 mins look at your repos at best but most probably not going to even check it.

o4xkyrl,"Contrary to what others have said, some interviewers definitely check your GitHub during interview prep. I’d rather see a messy Git history than none. No history means you could have just lifted the code from somewhere.Also I think it’s funny that you want a professional and clean Git history (presumably to signal quality) but you don’t want to actually work that way.

o53g7dk,"To be honest I don’t see the point. I’d worry about someone copying my public portfolio or it being scraped into ai knowledge bases.

o4u2er3,"Projects are for upskilling. If I’m looking at a resume, I’m going to look for where you did internships and what you did.

o4rd8xz,"This is way past ""normal"" and reads like they are trying to turn one junior hire into an entire org (plus ""build AI agents"" on top). The hourly reporting + off-hours messages + unpaid weekend conferences is a huge red flag.If they genuinely want you building agents, they need to scope it like a real project (one workflow, clear inputs/outputs, success metrics, and time blocked for it). Otherwise it is just a buzzword they toss at you. If it helps, there are some decent primers on what ""building an agent"" actually entails (tools, evals, guardrails): https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/",Otherwise_Wave9374,2026-02-11 07:03:07,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1r1qcmv,False,
o4spjr3,It is fairly clear that this company does not value or respect your time or the role itself.
