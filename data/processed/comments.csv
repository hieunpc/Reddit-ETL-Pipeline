o78tyzr,"Earlier today, I took 78 views that were created in SQL server. I need these in Snowflake (DBT really). I don't have all of the source data I need to make these and use work either so I need to identify those, build views in SQL server for the source systems that the orchestrator can query and add to the extractors. It took Claude Code an hour with almost no interaction on my part aside from approving the plan upfront. It one shotted the whole thing. All models compiled. Then I had it build a tool to cross validate the data from the old system with the new system.By no means was this sexy or even complicated work but it was insanely time-consuming. That would've been a couple days worth of work doing it by hand. Hell, just cross referencing out which source data I was missing would've been annoying and painful. I know because I did pretty much this exact same task by hand about six months ago.I spent effectively 25 to 30 minutes on the whole thing planning upfront.",toabear,2026-02-25 01:12:01,50,dataengineering,t3_1rdv80s,False,

o6zd79s,"Disclaimer: I’m a cofounder of Bruin, so take this with that context. My favourite topic these days :)I don’t think “100% self-healing pipelines” exist in the way vendors describe them.If a SaaS provider completely restructures their API or deprecates an endpoint, no AI magically understands your business intent. If a column disappears, the system doesn’t know whether you want to drop it, replace it, backfill it, or redesign downstream logic. That’s not a syntax problem. That’s a decision problem. (Which can be taken by AI, but most of the time it doesn't have enough context)Automatic retries and exponential backoff are not self-healing. That’s just basic resilience. Even auto schema detection only gets you part of the way.What I *have* seen work in practice is more boring and more controlled:1. Detect the break and narrow down what changed.2. Create a new branch.3. Spin up a sandbox data environment for that branch.4. Let an agent attempt a fix there.5. Run tests and generate an impact summary.6. Ask a human to approve before touching prod.That’s not some magical self-repair system. It’s letting a machine try a fix somewhere safe and asking you before it does anything risky.If a vendor claims it can fully adapt to major SaaS API changes with zero review, I’d be skeptical. Skipping isolation and approval is how you corrupt downstream models quietly.Even though I think Airflow is not the best tool for AI, I also don’t think this is really about Airflow vs X vs Y. It’s more about whether your stack is reproducible and easy to run in isolation. Systems that are CLI-friendly and easy to spin up in a sandbox are much easier to automate safely. Highly stateful setups are just harder for any automation to reason about.So for me the answer is: true self-healing? Naah, we're not there yet. AI-assisted repair with guardrails? Yes, it works.

We have BQ and I've used PG/MySQL/Maria/SQL Server/Oracle/... so can probably help.Data types and nullability are concerns you'll need to learn and handle properly with any columnar DB, but there are also DB settings around nulls you should apply so that you don't end up with reports showing 0 where they should be null or logic that has to test for '' rather than null in a string. Data types between any two pieces of software typically require a map, so that shouldn't be a distinct concern. DDLs are a bit different e.g. `LowCardinality(Nullable(String))` but after thirty minutes of learning this should be second nature.Joins - there are many types and you should learn about the different ones e.g. left anti join, any join, global left join. If you build outputs with many (10+) joins or you join on functions you'll find the performance isn't great, but that's more of a design issue - design to (left) join on UInt64 fields. The weirdest thing to get your head around is that join order matters, which is bizarre if you're used to a query execution planner doing this for you. For heavy queries expect to specify the join engine and a few parameters to get things running just right - an LLM can give you a starting point and tuning tests, so not too hard.Table engines - Used properly this can speed things up massively and convey intent - the Set engine, for example is a great way to check if a value is good / bad without an additional join and operates near instantly.Primary Keys - not really a thing here, instead you have order by. There are table engines which should apply the primary key, but it's better if your logic sets this to be the case rather than relying on the engine itself. Expect to footgun yourself at least once here.SCD2s - can be challenge - ASOF LEFT JOIN is great in principle, but if you have a list of preferred suppliers stored as an SCD2 you'll need to order by supplier id and valid from and add a 'future' non-preferred record so that transactions after the end data don't continue to return 'preferred'Syntax: - argMax and various array functions are excellent and Claude is great at writing them - being able to refer to results from the same select can really cut down the CTE chain - if you're running on a cluster or with multi-client and orchestration, the boilerplate can get a bit OTT, but that's true for competitors tooMemory use - All columnar databases love to eat memory, expect to have nodes with 128GB+ if you've got a few tens of millions of rows of wide data.ClickPipes - not used this.",Little_Kitty,2026-02-25 13:12:21,11,dataengineering,t3_1re8djt,False,

Those being proper orchestrators (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect to name a few), transformation systems (Spark/Ray, Warehouses, etc), and if you wanted to, 'accessory systems' like Kafka and vector extensions to common DBs since you mentioned Postgres and ML/AI. To be clear, I don't think you ever need all of them. Each shop has, unfortunately in many cases, so many options that you'll be unable to really cover everything. If you did, say, an example of streaming some mock data (or real if you can get it) into Kafka and using the operators in Airflow to do some light filtering and dropping that in like TimescaleDB (a PG extension for time series), you'll have enough to go on to speak about the topics of orchestration, real time workflows, and useful DB system choices if you spend the time!On the other hand you mentioned the transition from Orchestrating ML workflows as a DE to going to creational ML workflows as an MLE. I don't think the transition is impossible, but I will say it's difficult. When I/my company looked for MLEs we specifically waited for very skilled candidates. Many applicants were trying to make the same transition you're mentioning but the reality is the skills are harder to obtain or practice on your own than SWE or DE skills. Hell I positioned myself to at least cross-train for it to fill the gap while we waited, but I was ultimately turned down. That's all anecdotal. MLE is a bit of a hot job right now, so you will definitely have competition up and down the skill spectrum and there are only so many positions to go around.

That is not the point however, as storage has grown and cheapened even for on prem systems, since normalization was invented. The point is speed and scaling the write operations.

Later when you have iterated and finalized the charts you want to be displayed, you can go over to the dashboard view of the Canvas and place the chart cells from the notebook in the dashboard.

o6sj510,"Hi, I work at LanceDB but want to add a bit of detail here. Lance's file format is versioned, with the current default version being 2.0. 2.1 is already out there and is going to be the default soon, and 2.2 is also implemented and in the testing phase. The choice of file format used can impact the level of compression and performance you see, as the format is continually being improved.Re: performance, the F3 paper ([https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf)) shows numbers comparing Lance vs. other file formats and this is a good source of information (outside of the LanceDB team) in terms of scan and random access throughput (it shows that Lance is the fastest). The compression ratio shown in the paper is the worst, but the paper benchmarked against an old version of Lance (pre 2.0).From a roadmap perspective, Lance file format 2.2 that will come out soon has significantly more compression algorithms implemented, with some performance improvements as well. So more numbers will be published soon once that's out.Re: your performance observations, a) the version of the file format used matter, and b) the data types may not have the best compression ratios for that file version used. In LanceDB's internal suite, we regularly test against these modalities: long-form text, images and video blobs. For these cases, the write amplification in Parquet due to row groups is significant (which is the reason Lance was created in the first place). That said, even for conventional tabular data types (floats, booleans, etc.), Lance should perform on par with or better than Parquet, no matter the scale of the dataset. If you're getting sufficient performance out of Parquet, then well and good, in the end, what works best in practice is all that's needed!",laminarflow027,2026-02-22 16:11:20,9,dataengineering,t3_1rbcjqu,False,

The gap between what is documented & what is actually used, is a massive headache, so your head is in the exact right place.u/Johnlee01223 is totally right about the complexity, though, building a custom usage graph means parsing millions of messy SQL queries. It turns into an edge case nightmare real quick, and parsing all those logs at scale can easily nuke your warehouse compute budget.tbh, to save you from reinventing the wheel, DataHub actually has this built in natively. It hooks directly into BigQuery (`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`) or Snowflake (`QUERY_HISTORY`) and automatically translates those raw logs into the usage graph you're prototyping, mapping out column level lineage, real join relationships, and showing exactly who is querying what.To keep the compute overhead low, we use server side query pushdowns to filter out high volume bot or service account traffic before it ever hits the parser.If you're curious how the architecture works or what the output looks like, check this quick breakdown [Dataset Usage & Query History docs](https://docs.datahub.com/docs/features/dataset-usage-and-query-history).btw, which warehouse are you testing your prototype on right now?

And building a usage graph is far from trivial. There are countless ways to write SQL that ultimately accomplish the same thing. On top of that, every tool interprets queries differently, since each has its own parsing logic and assumptions. Unless you have the first-hand control over the execution engine itself, extracting things like:* Column usage and aliasestypically means parsing user-written input (i.e SQL query) which comes with countless edge cases. So the solution you're coming up ideally has to be something that can be plugged into the compute engine itself .i.e. OpenLineage is taking this approach for collecting lineage information by integrating directly with various compute engines rather than relying solely on query parsing.I would say go for it and no one had a good solution for it yet afaik.

You may want to somehow forbid that because people will eventually do that, even though your response to my question was basically ""no"".\> I do not want business logic to depend on null checks for columns.I think that you cannot meaningfully enforce required properties on the database schema level if you choose a JSON or EAV.

o6xlbvl,"I have been tasked with similar issues but in way less complex environments, and I don't envy you on this. But it can be fun to dive in, and play Sherlock Holmes.I would start simple, and forget about the 350+ pipelines. Start by diving into the easy places to get a head start and list all the problems you've found to kind of semi-cover your ass and set expectations:* Sporadic errors* Data loss on type conversions, * Lineage tool needs to fed better data or it is useless for this purpose.I would write something up, saying that the first 2 points must be fixed in order to get reliable result and success. How far have you found the first 2 points in your flow? If it is near the end, get some colleague to focus on fixing this, while you audit numbers earlier in the pipeline. Get someone else to fix it anyway, you focus on auditing data at other places.The 3rd point about lineage tool is not relevant yet. If you don't find a few clear errors that fixes stuff down the line, and you must go detailed through almost all flows as your last resort, the lineage tool *must* be improved and to be relied on. That is probably probably not a small task in itself, and there's likely a reason it is superficially setup as is.As for the actual data hunt; you most likely have already done so, but compare the 2 curated tables. If they are identical you know to whether to go forward or backwards in your flows for errors. If you need to go back in your flows, make an audit somewhere in the middle between the source and curated tables of going backwards. Does data match, does transformations makes sense. Then you do the same, figure out if you need to go forward/backward again. Audit somewhere in the middle again so you don't go through all steps. Break down your audit spots, and focus on 2 to 5 KPI's and the data they rely on. Document your code to easily reproduce the check at different spots for that part of the data, so you can show others.And make those others quickly check you're on the right path, and that they agree you compare the proper data, so a misunderstanding does not lead astray.Depending on urgency and resources available, I would show findings and clearly point out, that it doesn't make sense to compare and audit those KPI's if you can't trust the data in the first place. Suggest a plan, split up the tasks. Whether you are solo or can get help from team mates, don't do a bit of data loss fix, and then some audit, and then some check on sporadic errors, back and forth, etc. In all 3 tasks there's a bunch of rabbit holes to dive into, and I at least had trouble keeping a mental overview on the project itself and its progress while jumping from rabbit hole to rabbit hole. Almost fixing almost all problems at once, so the puzzle pieces suddenly match perfect at the same time hasn't happened for me, at least. And it sounded like a simpler setup than yours. Now it became quite long, TL;DR, break stuff down, audit certain data for certain KPI's midway though the flow, and midway from last checkpoint, etc. Focus on specifics tasks, don't do everything at the same time, and then you've got this, as long as you don't let yourself get bullied on timelines.

In many segments you focus on one solutions such as git. However you should make a point to highlight a number of similar systems. The idea is to make students aware that there are many options. Covering the common solution is find after highlighting that students have lots of options. I actually like that GIT and VIM coverage as good introductions.2. I'm still of the opinion that everyone needs to learn VIM, as a command line tool, to some extent. It is the VIM is everywhere base reality. However in the modern world using the command line environment with a GUI editor of choice might lead to more productive students. I'm not even sure students grasp that command line control can be mixed with GUI apps. This may be personal thing but I find GUI based editors far more productive. So in the same regards a paragraph that list out a few alternative command line an and GUI editors to inform students makes sense.3. A port for compiled languages or an additional segment within this package, would be useful for programs that don't use Python. A focus on C++ would be advisable as the use of GCC is similar for many languages. The idea is not to teach the language, but to teach how programs are built with compilers.

o6bkkog,"I wouldn't worry about math too much, nor choose a language based on that. The business domain will determine that, not the language. And the vast bulk of programming jobs out there don't require much math. It's a misconception that all of us programmers are doing lots of math.The most math you may benefit from is boolean algebra (and simple arithmetic), and that's very easy and fast to learn and has some payoff for working with logic in code. See the first two chapters of ""How to Prove It"", he covers the topic really well and it's a breeze.Another good topic, related to logic, is how numbers are represented in a computer in general with a ""finite number system"", and in various languages more specifically (integer vs. float vs. double, vs. BigInteger/BigFloat [using memory to sidestep the limitations on the primitive data types]), and to understand the pros and cons of the common approaches. You should try to come away with a good working intuition, e.g. when to use an integer vs. a float/double based on the actual numbers you're working with, how floating-point numbers increasingly lose precision in the integers as they get larger, the kinds of problems you can run into when FP values are part of boolean expressions, i.e. exact equality checks, due to floating-point rounding error (and also how errors can creep in based on how you group operations on numbers of various magnitudes).Java is a great language. Personally I would choose a language based on the job market, not based on your perception of Python seeming easier to use. IMO it would actually be beneficial to confront that ""strictness"" sooner than later. That strictness you perceive is generally a good thing, it's an up-front cost that pays off in a bunch of good ways. With the exception of `var`, it generally gives good visibility on expected types (and you can always use the IDE to help inspect `var` variables). Types give you something firm to latch onto when reasoning about code at development time and debugging time. Python (AFAIK) has made improvements here, but I don't know the current state of things, how ergonomic it all is, and how good the tooling is. Maybe it's great, I have no idea. But Java is pretty decent in this regard. Anyway, types relate to logic, particularly when using the primitive data types, as you can abstractly think of the types as the sets of all possible values (restricted by the fact that the computer is finite).With DSA stuff, I have no knowledge of boot.dev, but I'd probably just think of it as a potential problem bank. With DSA, you want to get exposure to various categories of problems, regardless of where you got the problems from. DSA problems are all scoped down majorly, so it generally doesn't matter where you're getting them from (as long as they're not poorly written). A key though is being able to check your solution for correctness. If boot.dev lets you _run_ your solutions to see whether it passes or fails, and on which inputs, then that's great. Otherwise, platforms like LeetCode can do that (or see Neetcode for a narrower list). With these, focus on quality over quantity. There are more problems than you realistically have time to do, and that's fine. If you do one problem from each fundamental category, that's an awesome start. Hopefully boot.dev's problem set gives you a diverse sampling.Other than that, a key for your career in programming is to actually build small projects of your own choosing on your own time, because you need exposure to the ""problem-solving cycle"". Getting real projects done can be an arduous process of cycling over and over through planning, coding, verifying, and repeating until you reach some clearly defined ""done"" state. At times it can be a psychological thriller. Anyway, DSA won't help you much here - DSA may have some payoff for when it comes time to implement code and not make as many silly mistakes, like ""off-by-one"" issues (or when it comes time to vet an LLM's output, if you choose to use them to actually write code [which I don't recommend doing while you're _learning_, because you really want to learn from the ground up so you can adequately vet their output and more confidently/quickly accept or reject or modify/refactor their output]). LLMs can be useful, but whatever you do, you have to protect your own mental clarity and attention span - LLMs can easily exhaust it and cause more trouble than they're worth, depending on your skill level and how and when you use them.In the process of working on projects, ideally you also learn more and more about how to build whole systems, rather than just ""code"". This is why working ""full-stack"" on your own can be a good idea, even if you don't actually work in a role that is itself full-stack - it gives you exposure to a broader set of concerns that are all part of the building the whole system. Your value to a software company will be your ability to implement systems or at least your part of them, and hopefully in a thoughtful way that minimizes friction for your teammates.",SoSpongyAndBruised,2026-02-19 22:21:13,2,learnprogramming,t3_1r95fxw,False,

Flask is another good one because it is small enough to read end to end in a weekend but teaches you a lot about how web frameworks actually think. Once those feel comfortable rich by Will McGuire is worth looking at just to see how someone writes genuinely elegant Python with good separation of concerns. If you want something more data focused then pandas source is educational but honestly quite dense so I would save that for later.

o7dmv3b,"The ""bigger picture"" you're missing is probably that finding vulnerabilities is fundamentally about understanding how systems are supposed to work at a deep level, and then figuring out where the assumptions break down. Before you worry about tools like Burp Suite, the single most valuable thing you can do is build a rock-solid mental model of how software actually executes. I'd seriously recommend working through CMU's Bomb Lab and Attack Lab (both freely available — just search ""CMU bomb lab"" and ""CMU attack lab"" and you'll find the assignments plus tons of writeups from students who've completed them). Bomb Lab teaches you to reverse engineer a binary using GDB and disassembly, figuring out what inputs defuse each ""phase"" of a bomb. Attack Lab goes further and has you actually craft buffer overflow exploits, including code injection and return-oriented programming. These aren't theoretical exercises — they're teaching you the exact thought process security researchers use: read the code or binary, understand the expected behavior, then ask ""what happens if I send something the developer didn't anticipate?""Once you've internalized that mindset, the web security stuff you're learning (endpoints, parameters, open redirects) starts to click because you realize it's the same pattern at a different layer. A security researcher looking at a web app is doing the same thing you do in Attack Lab — tracing how input flows through the system and finding the spot where untrusted data gets used in a way the developer didn't account for. Tools just automate parts of that process; the skill is in knowing what to look for and why.

That intuition gives you a place to start, and hypotheses that you can check.Software hacking isn’t that different. You’ve studied code. You have an intuition for things based on prior knowledge.

I'd say that the software developers (professional or not) who do it (perhaps also) as a hobby, are the best developers. This is because the people who are the most interested in the field, are likely to be better at it than those who are not. And if you're interested in it, it is probably a hobby of yours, even if you do it professionally also.I sometimes hear the question ""Can a software developer be self-taught?"", and I'm usually like... who the f--- *isn't* self-taught in this industry? I mean, if you're interested in software development, did you seriously *wait* to start doing it until college? I started with BASIC on the Commodore 64 when I was 12 years old. Switched to C at around 17 years old. In college, I had to show our *teacher* how to implement linked lists (not because I was good, but because he was inexperienced with C). Sure, there were things I learned in college which I probably wouldn't have learned otherwise - or at least not as soon - for example, SQL, and other things which I found boring. But all the advanced stuff I learned on my own, because I wasn't going to sit around waiting for college to finally get around to teaching the stuff I was interested in.So, yes! You can definitely learn software development as a hobby only. I know things are more complex now than when I was in school, but on the other hand there are so much more resources available for free now. Back in the 90's when I got started, while the net was around, there wasn't as much content as there is now. For most things I wanted to learn, I'd order an O'Reilly book. You don't have to do that anymore.Here's what I would do if I were you. Do some tutorials, but don't *only* do tutorials. Find something simple to build - something you *want* to build. And I do mean simple - really simple at first. I started with text games like ""Guess my number"" - ""Your guess is too high, try again"", and so on. You don't need graphics. Just find something that interests you.And when you get stuck - google it, ask an AI - not to do it for you, but to *teach* you how to do it - or come here, and ask us.

Once basics feel comfortable python for data Analysis by Wes McKinney is the practical reference for pandas and numpy which is where most of the actual data work happens.For R, R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham is genuinely the best starting point for research and visualization work also free online and builds everything around real use cases rather than theory first.

A fake is a tiny, trivial implementation of the storage layer's interfaec, maybe it just keeps track of the objects that were saved in a HashMap or a sorted list.Instead of asserting that certain methods were called in a certain order, have your method write to the fake storage layer, then fetch the list of things written to the fake storage layer and assert that A, B, and C are in them.Now your code asserts that the end result is correct without being nearly as tightly coupled to the implementation details.

Input: it expects specific parameters of certain types and/or a specific starting state. Output: it returns a specific type and/or changes states. When choosing what to test, you want to test only public methods, whose contracts are not expected to change frequently. Do not test private methods directly unless they contain something particularly complicated. In that case, try to refactor the complicated bits into separate pure functions to reduce churn during later refactoring.You also want to design and edit your code in a way that avoids changing contracts unnecessarily. For example, add new parameters to the end of the list and make them optional, preserving the previous behavior in which they did not exist.If you find your contracts changing all the time, this is a problem with your code design. Not only does it make unit tests fragile, it makes coordination with other people and new features far more difficult than it needs to be. Read up on clean code strategies and code architectural patterns. **How to test**The most common issue I see in fragile tests is allowing state changes to fall through from test to test. You must start and stop every test at a neutral baseline state, not allowing tests to affect each other. Every test should be able to run by itself or in any random order compared to other tests. In fact, there are many test frameworks that provide a randomized run feature to help you find and prevent this form of fragility.To do unit testing correctly with non-pure functions, you must make sure to create fixtures, which are state controls. Before each test, your fixtures set up the correct state. After each test, you tear down those fixtures back to a neutral baseline. Do this using the test framework's built-in services. In class format, these are often methods named like setUp and tearDown. In spec format, they are named like beforeEach and afterEach.Each test has the following pattern:1. Set up fixtures, mocks, fakes2. If state may change, assert beginning state3. Call the function under test4. Assert returns if applicable 5. Assert state change if applicable6. Assert mocks/fakes were called as expected, including the expected parameters passed in7. Tear down fixtures, mocks, fakes",Beka_Cooper,2026-02-21 16:46:55,1,learnprogramming,t3_1rakpui,False,

If the expected behavior is ""data A, B and C are stored"", then the test should check for that and not care about the order of calls.In the end, it all boils down to understanding what the contract on interface level states: ""This function saves data by calling the storage layer"" does not say anything about how this is done or in which order. So, one can only check that once the function has been called, the data has indeed been stored. ""This function saves the data from the given data array in atomic write operations for each element of the array from first element to last element"" as interface contract describes a different behavior to check for - here the order and amount of calls to storage indeed matters.

o74t53x,"In fact, they aren't contradicting each other that much - it might seem like they do if you consider every function, every method, a part of the public interface, but that is not what they suggest.**Philosophy** (for short) suggests that *modules* should be deep - meaning that the public interface to ""something"" is very simple, and hides a lot of complexity underneath. It doesn't mean that everything should be inside the same function from a programming language perspective, but that the user of that module shouldn't be concerned about the underlying functionality. Think of private methods, or unexported functions - you can still have lots of these.**Grokking** takes a more ""inside-out"" look at code, where Philosophy assumes that you are designing something for other programmers to use, Grokking assumes that you are in the midst of building something complicated, and have to make sure that you yourself understands it. And of course you should build it with as small functions as possible - ensuring that each function only operates at a single level of abstraction.I'm not to sure about the parameter passing - it's been a bit long since I read either, so I'm not sure what exactly they are saying. But generally, receiving parameters or objects simply to send them on to other functions is considered somewhat bad design - but of course, if you want a deep module you'd have some ""facade""-functions that receive everything, but doesn't really do anything about it.My personal take on this is to consider whether a function is a ""worker"" or a ""delegator"" (my own nomenclature) and divide functions into those who do stuff, and those who just sends work on to a number of other functions. But if any function only calls a single other function - that might be a sign of bad design. Anyways - as always, these kind of suggestions are always suggestions, not hard and fast rules.

Whether you agree with one or the other book depends on your coding style your mental model of how the code works.I haven't read the books so i don't want to talk all that much about the exact points where they contradict but i am sure that if both authors talked to each other they would agree in many areas. From the limited summary you provided i get this impression from the authors. Both authors want to structure their code in such a way that allows them to understand their code better.Ousterhout does this by creating strong modules in such a way that you only have to use the module and dont have to understand its internals. This essentially lets you ignore large part of the codebase because you just use the module.Normand does this by making very clear where change happens and what change happens. This allows you trace through the code better because you can disregard those places that don't interest you right now.Both sound like good advice to me. You don't have to exclusively pick one and stick with it. Try one out and see how you feel about it and make up your own mind. Personally, after writing a lot of Rust the Normand approach sounds much more appealing to mean than large modules, but sometimes a large module is the way to go.One think i would like to point out where i strongly disagree with Ousterhout. If you have a function with a lot of parameters, i agree that turning those parameters into objects doesnt help. All it does is that it wraps up the parameters into a slight easier to work with package. Functionally the function still has the same amount of parameters. Here is the part where i disagree; Placing those parameters into a global context doesn't help for exactly the same reason. How you have a function with a bunch of effectively global variables and all the downsides that brings. If you want to reduce the amount of parameters you have to actually reduce the amount of parameters. One way to do that is to do what Normand tells you to do.PS: Great question",Psychoscattman,2026-02-24 14:16:51,2,learnprogramming,t3_1rdg2fh,False,

For example, if I split functions into calculations and actions, there’s no reason my calculations can’t be deep, nor that my actions can’t be deep. If you want truly contrary advice there are books which talk about having very many extremely small functions as the way to go. The idea there being, you don’t actually have to remember all the details of all the functions, you’ll simply know what they all do from a quick glance at the code. — The thing about these conflicting or seemingly conflicting advice is that they all come from a context which includes the authors entire personal background and the situations they’ve contended with, it’s possible you’ll never contend with the same kind of situation, and it’s possible that you’ll contend with “mutually incompatible” situations inside the same code base. In my experience that means you’re working in many layers of abstraction, and the way to solve that is to start delineating between which layer of abstraction a set of functions lives inside of, so you can apply the appropriate techniques there, and a different set of techniques in a different layer.",zenware,2026-02-24 14:43:10,1,learnprogramming,t3_1rdg2fh,False,

A similar book I can recommend is [Data-Oriented Programming](https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming), which is also about how Clojure does things, but with examples in other languages. Clojure was desinged very deliberately by Rich Hickey as a reaction to the problems of C++/Java OOP. Hickey's various talks go into more detail about his philosophy for Clojure.In Clojure, we just use (immutable) maps for most things. Keys in Clojure's maps are considered more fundamental than the mere aggregation of them, and can have a namespace independent of the map they happen to be contained in.Many Clojure functions accept and return a map. They may update a subset of the keys they care about and pass on the rest. You can test and understand these functions with just the subset, but easily compose them with functions that use a different subset. Clojure also uses ""global"" (albeit namespaced) objects for program state, but typically only a small number of them.

o74f8h3,"This is gonna sound even more demotivating at first so sorry.... what you're struggling with right now and what AI is obviously pretty good at... is literally the easiest part of a programmers job. ""Coding"" is truly not in any way the majority of the process of coding, or a programmers job at all. If i was told tomorrow that AI is eliminating any coding my job requires writing by hand because they added magic and it now can perfectly output code, than I wouldnt worry at all. Even if in the future all we do is read code given to us by AI and fix bugs, then my ability to code makes me uniquely suited for doing exactly that over someone who only has ever used AI. And they will never invent an AI that can take in a client's requests and create their dream program, because clients are literally the dumbest people on earth and cant even describe what they want to human beings yet, and research on inventing the perfect client who doesnt change their mind after a feature is built or prioritize the complete wrong thing is lacking. As far as code is concerned, you need to practice and apply the concepts you learn, forget leet code and homework, you need to build a million small programs and do that a few hundred times, its just practice. I dont think ""ok i need to make a variable to hold a number, what was the keyword for that? Oh yeah, int, but the number is going to be a value of currency so I should use a float. Ok, now I now I want to multiply that 5 times. Whats the keyword that starts a loop? Oh yeah, for. So i need to take that variable, and type the word for. Then I need parenthesis, and inside the parenthesis need to define the starting point and I was taught to set that to 0 so Ill type that. Then I need to define where to stop looping so Ill take that first statement and set it less than 5, whoops I mean 4 because I started at 0. What was the last part of a for loop again? Oh yeah, thats how much the counter will increase so ill increase it by 1 each time. Now I cant forget to use the curly braces for my logic.......""Thats how you first start out, and likely will think for every new keyword and bit of syntax you learn when starting out. Many ""intermediates"" still code at a snails pace that way and are convinced that an AI being able to do that instantly is doom for the entire field. Advanced developers arent smarter than you, we've just written thousands of for loops and defined a billion variables through sheer repetition and practice. I think ""it need to hold the value of money here"" and my fingers define a float variable. I want performance some action on that variable 5 times and I dont even think about the syntax, I type it. Ive done it a million times, its dont have to remember the keyword ""for"" or where the curly brackets go. Not at all because Ive planned out in my head to do that, Im not nearly smart enough to think 5 whole seconds in the future. Im dumb as shit. But because Ive used the keywords, seen the patterns, and practiced over my career everyday, it just comes out without ever thinking of the syntax.Beginners think coding is just syntax m. Syntax is the easy part, and literally anyone can memorize the syntax of a language. If you can read this comment written in English, you're proof of that, but you have 2 decades of practicing English. If you understand the CONCEPT of something like a loop or defining a variable, you've done the hard part. The part that seems hard, and the part that AI is great at is the syntax, which requires practice and repetition. As far as your concerns over the field transforming by the time you graduate... I gotta laugh, cause this field always has been seeing constant drastic shifts. Many of us here could tell of a time before Zuckerberg and his demons released the plague that is React into the web dev world, and suddenly if you didnt know React than you weren't hireable as a front end developer (according to some)... that was 10 years ago. Think about that, a whole new language and technology became almost a requirement for many jobs a decade ago, that doesn't happen in most professions.Take it even further, Javascript didnt exist like 20 years ago, if you want to work in web and you dont know Javascript you're boned. Doctors dont learn new bones every 10 years, and lawyers may learn new laws, but your countries entire consimtitution likely doesnt see drastic changes very often during the course of a lawyers entire career. There are programmers alive today that use to write code on paper. The fact that something new comes along and you get to learn it is a feature of development, not something to freak out about. At the same time, during covid, developers who were masters of a language developed by cavemen as they fought off dinosaurs were paid extraordinary amounts of money to come out of retirement and update welfare systems in the US because their skills using COBOL was desperately needed and the number of people with that skill set is very small. The last Java job a few years ago I was brought in for was working on a major upgrade of a codebase all the way up to the new and fancy Java version 8. We are currently, today, are on something like Java 24... There are so many jobs out there that will not budget major upgrades, or their systems are too critical to allow risking downtime or potential user issues, and chugging forward without the latest and greatest stuff is what the people signing the paychecks have determined is the best route forward. Corporate jobs are not startups that require microsecond code optimizations and the newest database architecture at the risk of user downtime. Hell, there's programming jobs where intellectual property or government security clearances are required and your VPN or workplace may not even allow for internet access, let alone an AI assistant reading every line of code and doing who knows what with, and your resources are the language documentation and whatever else the previous devs left for you. And in a world where even those jobs all somehow disappear and AI takes over... ok...? Use the AI tools? You want to be a programmer and build stuff, thats why im a programmer. If a client was going to pay me a ton of money to program an app, and that ""app"" was a sandwich, i wouldnt use Java, id use bread and turkey, and maybe a knife. Code is just a tool you use as a developer, if the project pays well and requires Java, ill use Java. If it pays well and uses French, I'll use French. What does it matter?

It was suggesting or doing things that made no sense, it was constantly contradicting itself etc. After also reading some news about how so many companies that went all in on AI and fired developers started losing money, because it did not bring so much value and was rather breaking code than fixing it, I got more confident.

When I’m faced with a blank file or an empty editor, I never know where to start, what to write first, or how to structure my thinking. It’s frustrating because I really want to build projects, create things, and deploy them… but I feel stuck when it’s time to actually begin. Is this normal in the beginning? How did you get past that stage?TLDR: Write it down. This is normal in any creative process. It's called writer's block. What I do to get past it is to write a one paragraph ""scope"" statement. This is a general description of the problem that I am trying to solve. It's important to write it because even if you think you understand things completely, you will often find there are details about the scope that you haven't clarified yet. Writing it down makes you confront the details.Once you have the scope clearly articulated and you better understand the problem, start writing your psuedocode; just a list of steps to get there. Each step will have sub-steps, but don't focus on them yet because you will overwhelm yourself. It always helps to define things generally before jumping into the details ( I think it has to do with the way the brain structures information, but that's a different topic). If you do get lost in the details, you can just back up to your scope statement and you will find that there is something that perhaps you didn't define as well as you originally thought.

The best solution to uncertainty is seeing where things fall by deploying and seeing. We think we can out think.

Makes for a lot fewer headaches when trying to determine if we can trust the result.A lesser known detail about two's compliment is that it inverts the CY OUT flag as well. For example: 77h - 76h = ? 77h + 1 + 89h = ? (apply twos compliment) 77h + 1 + 89h = 101hThe 101h at the end ends up overflowing the adder and setting the CY OUT flag - which ends up conflicting with our definition of the overflow flag I assumed above.That explains the XOR on the CY OUT but not the CY IN. Fortinately this is just to make it so that we can use our 8 bit adder over multiple instructions to compute a sum/difference for larger numbers.

By doing that, you'll start to to understand what works and what doesn't. And when I say build stuff, I mean doing it on your own as much as you can. Avoid following tutorials and using AI to help you - take the time to actually break down and solve problems on your own. It will be uncomfortable, but stick with it! It gets better over time. And that's what makes good programmers - those that can break down and solve problems, not those with encyclopedic knowledge of different design patterns or frameworks.Now having said that, I think it can be useful to supplement your journey with theory. There are plenty of resources out there for learning the most common design patterns, data structures, and algorithms. I think its important to familiarize yourself with them, know what they are and when to use them, but don't dwell on that stuff too much.

o73unwh,Yes you are exactly right and I can tell you from my own experience that many developers hit this same wall after a few years of working with frameworks. It is very common to feel like something is missing because libraries and frameworks only teach you how to use a tool but they do not teach you how to think about the structure of your software. When I first started working on larger systems I realized that knowing variables and loops is just the beginning and the real skill lies in making code that other people can actually read and maintain without getting a headache.​To bridge this gap you should focus on learning SOLID principles and common design patterns which act as a blueprint for solving recurring problems in a clean way. You should also look into unit testing and the concept of decoupling because these are the things that make your software scalable and prevent it from breaking every time you add a new feature. A very helpful way to learn this is to take one of your old projects and try to rewrite parts of it using these principles so you can see the difference for yourself.

o70fpi2,"if you're interested in games you might wanna try game modding, way less of a commitment than making an entire game (if thats not what you're into, its a lot), and its a very fun way to learn coding too since you're a hobbyist, just make sure to pick an easy game for modding, unity games are easy thanks to tools like dnspy and unityexplorer, games that uses IL2CPP are harder because they require much more effort to mod since you can't revert the files back into code like you can with mono games (games that have a file called assembly-Csharp.dll, this allows you to have access to the game's guts, IL2CPP games dont have this file because the game C# code was converted into an intermediary language, and that was used to generate C++ code that is then compiled into native binaries that are harder to reverse engineer).some games have internal API's made with modding in mind, if you download a game like rainworld or haste, and you do the shabang of taking references of the game binaries into your IDE, you can then call most of the game's internal functions and have access to it's events so you can hook your custom logic more easily, those are very modder friendly gamesor you have something like silksong, the code is messier and you only have access to the few things the devs left exposed, in these cases you gotta patch the game with a lib like harmony, harmony is a godsend because it allows you to add stuff to the game's internal classes and functions by patching them just before you boot up the gameand they're not mutually exclusive you can use the modding API and harmony to achieve any behaviour you want, for example, in rainworld the AI is quite complicated but there are spots that allow for some basic swap of values with minimal effort, managed to make an npc type that is made to hate my character in any situation, friendly, by simply swapping stuff around, then i tried to shoot higher with a mod for downloading music and kind of making it interact with the game's systems, it kind of works, i just didnt like the way i coded it in the beginning but the fact that i hate the code i wrote back then tells me i can do better so maybe i'll rewrite it someday...but thats the magic, you have instant feedback to whatever you do, in haste i simply made so the character had infinite energy to spend while on the lobby and that worked flawlessly first try thanks to how much the modding API helps simply having context for logicBUTif you're interested in robotics too, there is a game called plasma, that goes pretty deep into making stuff with logic blocks, math and some conveniences, i managed to make a car with a bunch of stuff, i've seen a guy on youtube make a guided missile using some insane maths, and the game allows lua scripts so if the blocks feel restrictive you can try using scripts",akoOfIxtall,2026-02-23 20:09:57,1,learnprogramming,t3_1rc4atw,False,

o7e9jiy,"Tech stack requirements describe the system overall. Does not mean that you'll be using one or another thing every day or whole day. Look at it as a menu: sandwiches, soup, rice porridge, mac'n'cheese, cutlets, pasta, etc. Will you be eating all of these every day? Nope. Should you be able to make these? Better be (otherwise your food choices will be quite poor). Perhaps some days you are just picking a sandwich, some tea, and that's it. Your day is busy and you have no time to eat. Another day you have whole day for yourself. You can cook whatever you want in the kitchen. The menu changes. Daily tools you are using as a software engineer, also change, depending on the task, depending on the service, etc.What do I do?1)I write new features to the service we are developing and maintaining. For example in addition to being able to buy a ticket via an app one can buy also via an SMS (for some elderly who do not use smartphones, or whatnot).2)I debug why the stuff does not work or why it behaves weird. Today I had to figure out why a system that is expected to check the uptime of our service is sending empty notifications. Where is the text?3)I review the code that my team mates wrote. Code review. To catch some nonsense. To turn attention to some missing business cases. To suggest some improvements. etc.4)I do technical analysis and help our business analyst. He does not write the code. Reading code is difficult for him. So, he comes with his less-IT-questions to me and I provide answers to him. For new tasks for us to work on.5)I improve our infrastructure. Like this uptime checking service I mentioned in 2). Today I set it up because otherwise it would be more difficult for us to know when something just does not work at all.6)Attend meetings. May it be discussing new tasks, discussing some big problem in production environment, discussing team events, or something else.7)Write documentation. Not comments in the code but documentation for the business people for them to know how the stuff works and what it does.8)Do technical analysis for new projects. The stuff that software architects do. Come up with a structure for the project, suggest different solutions (with pros and cons), come up with the main idea what and how the project should do, discuss with the business side, etc.9)Onboard new members. A new guy like you comes. He has 1000 questions. I try to create and improve our onboarding manual so the new guy can follow it and hopefully in the end he has a working local environment and can start working on his first task.10)Update libraries and frameworks. Fix vulnerabilities.11)Drink tea and scroll in the Internet while the system does whatever it does with my code changes and I have to wait meanwhile. (e.g. wait behind the running pipeline)12)Do some manual testing of the code I wrote. Before I pass it to the QA. Sure, there are unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests and such, but not everything can be tested and sometimes environment differences come into a play. So, I will check that the business use cases of my task are covered. A sanity check.13)Write these tests that I mentioned in 12)14)Think, think, think. A whole lot of my time goes into thinking.

Others will say whenever the moon is red and mercury is in retrograde. My typical approach is ""whatever makes the code self-documenting""; if I am reading code and the intent of the function becomes unclear or disagrees with its function name, the function is likely either too long, doing too many things, difficult to test, unreadable, or unmaintainable. Not necessarily all 5, but still. If I start thinking ""oh, I should add a code comment here"" I first ask if it should be a function, allowing the function name to describe intent instead of a comment. If I start copy-pasting code in many places, I start asking if it should be a function so that the code within that function can be understood once rather than in each location. If my function is 400 lines, I might (not always) think making it a 40 line function that makes descriptive calls to other functions is more readable (sometimes it won't). If I go to test my function and part of it is a pain to cover, moving that difficult-to-cover chunk to its own unit makes testing both functions easier.With practice, you'll get a better feel for when something should be its own thing.

Then whoever reads your code reads the function names and doesn't have to read code to understand what you are doing The general idea is to have 3 layers inside your file.

o741rhn,"**Category A - Organizing Code****1. To reduce repetition:**If you have the same, or a very similar block code more than once, consider making it into a function. This is called the ""DRY"" principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). This centralizes logic that improves both maintainability and testability.**2. Concept extraction:**Extract code that represents a single step you could describe with a short comment. Example: # Huge block or multiple blocks of code to register a user ... ...As this code performs and clearly definable task, we can improve the structure and readability by bringing it together in a function: def register_user(user): ...But then we look at what that function does, we see that it does multiple things: # big block of validation logic # big block of password hashing # big block of database insert # big block of email sendingHere we have 4 blocks of code, each of which could be written as functions, which makes the logic more readable than one huge block of code. def register_user(user) validate_user(user) hash_password(user) db_insert(user) notify_admin()---**Category B - Treating Functions as Values:**This is conceptually different from the other two, and mostly applies to more advanced code, so I'll only mention it briefly for completeness.Sometimes we need to treat functions as first class values, where the value represents a behaviour. A common example is when binding behaviours to button presses we may pass a function object as an argument.Here's a Tkinter example: button = tk.Button(root, text=""Click Me"", command=function_to_run)In this example, the function isn't extracted for readability, it's because the API requires a callable.Other examples include closures, decorators, async tasks and more.---A final note about ""not overdoing it"".Functions are mostly about reducing complexity - they are a means rather than a goal. Avoid extracting trivial one-line wrappers that add no clarity or reuse, (unless required, for example by an API).Bad Example: def print_result(result): print(result)This adds an extra layer of indirection without improving readability, reducing duplication, or creating a meaningful abstraction.However there can be cases where wrapping a one-liner is justified. for example:Suppose you have this one-liner scattered in your code: if user.age >= 18 and user.email_verified: ...then we can wrap the condition into a function: def is_eligible(user): return user.age >= 18 and user.email_verifiedthen use it in each place that it is needed: if is_eligible(user): ...This is a good application of ""DRY"".",JamzTyson,2026-02-24 10:12:21,2,learnprogramming,t3_1rd90v9,False,

I’m pretty solid with Python, but I’m not good with flask or SQLite, which is something I need at the moment. So I need a lot of help in that area along with building a web UI. My main problem with using AI is that AI isn’t really good for niche, edge-case applications. So I spend more time prototyping so I can capture the logic of what I want to do at every step along the way before writing the prompt. The flask route seems really straightforward to me, but I have to connect overything over HTML, JS, and CSS. For me, AI has really democratized programming and allowed me to do things I couldn’t do before. I can get stuff done and still learn as I go. AI hasn’t been all that helpful in troubleshooting. My personal rule is AI has three chances to get something right. If I can’t get what I need after three prompts, it’s tome to break down the logic and code in smaller steps.",Lost-Discount4860,2026-02-22 17:23:06,1,learnprogramming,t3_1rbnwzf,False,

Where AI can be useful is bouncing ideas or questions off it. If you don't understand something, then you can use an LLM to help you gain that knowledge. Maybe you wrote a thing and it all kind of fell apart and you're not sure why - an LLM can give you some guidance.Don't become dependant on the models. If you find yourself asking the same questions over and over, that's a sign you're not retaining the knowledge. Treat the models like an interactive version of Stack Overflow that won't be snarky and lock your questions.As long as you are internalising the knowledge through actual practice writing code, then LLMs are just another tool you can use. Don't ever ask them to implement features for you. Use them as tools to get instant feedback on the code you write and your understanding of concepts. Also remember they can be stupid and wrong!

o6wo5p6,"For me it helped to have recursion explained from different angles and at different levels.I learned about different aspects of recursion in different courses.For example in computer technology I learned how memory may be allocated on the stack for a function call (very low level, ie allocating memory/setup a ""blue print"" of the variables and the pointer to the next instruction in the function), in math I learned how to use induction to prove recursive algorithms and in a programming course I learned how different tree-algorithms may be implemented by changing the order of visiting the legs and the tree-node.I think the key to understand recursion is to understand how a function may call itself (because how variables and instructions pointers can be separated from the actual set of instructions under the hood) and that by visiting and combining the different parts of a tree in different order you get different behaviours (on a higher level).",joranstark018,2026-02-23 05:50:45,1,learnprogramming,t3_1rbuauu,False,

They know how to market themselves and how to fit in well in a new job.

Similarly, I have seen the engineers I detest working with, constantly argue and are not fun to be around, make the same mistakes constantly, etc. complain about how the market is dead and they can't find a new position anywhere.Who you are and where you fall in these categories is really up to you.

Right now, everyone knows it is not as valuable as it is valued at, which is leading to the intense speculative bubble we're seeing.

Second, unless those non-work projects you did are very meaningful or impactful, then I'd suggest getting rid of them and use the space to add more bullet points to your work experience.

Also sounds like you aren't being given enough work to actually challenge you (""haven’t touched a line of code in 2.5 months"" ""just got assigned the most absurdly simple defect""). Maybe you should go ahead and ""promote"" yourself without asking for permission.Figure out who at the company WANTS the system rebuild that you thought was a good idea (""rebuilding the existing native application with my language of expertise that I’ve worked with & loved my entire career""). Maybe this is a product manager outside of the tech world, maybe it's a VP who doesn't have the clout to get things moving. (If there isn't anyone who wants this done... maybe it shouldn't be!) Talk with this person. Say that you aren't being challenged in your current position and you have some free time. Offer to build what they are looking for as a ""Proof of concept"". Invest some time and just BUILD the darn thing (it's amazing how much faster a ""skunkworks"" project can go. If you succeed, maybe you end up as the tech lead for the project (which would consist of releasing the ""POC"" that you built).As I said, it's not the right solution for all companies, but it CAN be effective in some places.

o6tu8u0,"Where I work promotions have to come with two justifications, one is ""business justification"" the other is ""person is qualified for the promotion"".We have 6 tiers of enginer, associate, mid, senior, staff, principal and sr. principal. Promotions from Associate to mid and mid to Senior require only a ""budget confirmation"" in business justification, there is a maximum amount we can spend on promotions each year. In my experience, we've never exceeded that budget so these promotions always pass their business justification.Starting with senior to staff, then staff to principal and principal to senior principal the business justification becomes stricter. Staff is defined as a role that works ""across teams"", usually within an org. Principal is inter-org work and sr. principal is company level work. We must justify why we need individuals operating in those roles. For Staff it's not too bad, we produce a list of they type of work and project work that requires tech/engineering focus aligning teams (usually building something global/working directly with internal customer teams etc etc).Principal and Sr. Principal things get much harder. There's really not that much work at that level. My org of 100 has one principal, who focuses on cross-org database work, and one principal who is working torwards sr. Principal by focusing on aligning our entire orgs tech with other org tech leads. I really have no need for more than that.I have about 10 Staff engineers however, some recently promoted into that role from Senior. (We do a lot of inter-team work/support). They are all told if they want to make principal, it is /unlikely/ they will get the role within our current org (we'd either have to double in size, not likely, or one of the two principals would have to leave and require a backfill).For those staff engineers that want to ""grow"" by title change I encourage my managers to do several things. First, keep a constant eye on opening roles in the company, anything principal they should consider having their staff report apply to it and be considered. Likewise there are some other career paths, such as engineering manager (if they want to stop focusing on being an Individual contributor) or even other leadership roles (technical program manager etc). And lastly, yes, it is not a crime if my managers support their staff engineers in their next career step outside the company (referrals, helping be a career mentor, assessing other jobs etc). All of this is to say, yes, at some point, a ""promotion"" must consider business need, and that business need should get harder the more senior the role is. Managers should focus on the realities and be aware that sometimes growing people means having them leave the team or company, but it should happen at more senior levels.If your company doesn't have good definitions of what various levels of engineers should be doing for the company, I'd start there.",maxfields2000,2026-02-22 19:49:59,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1rbv6qc,False,

o6u5v2f,"Promotion requiring a corporate need is actually the norm, it just isn't usually made explicit. Now, early career, you can generally show ""yes, we need person at L+1, we expect our L to grow into that role"", but major career transitions (Senior, or Staff) generally require a business need.In many companies, this is actually hidden by the modern practice of retrospective promotion, where you promote people after they demonstrate a sustained performance of L+1. Since there was L+1 work for them to do to demonstrate that, it is a lot easier to demonstrate a need. But it is also normal for people to be in a position where there are no career growth opportunities for them on their current team, or even at their current company. After all, if the company has a CTO, and you are ready to take on a CTO role, you are probably going to have to leave. A good manager helps employees realize that and make that transition.Think about it this way, if you tried to open up a new headcount for a Senior or Staff level role, would you be able to justify it with the work your team has to do? If you could, you can make the case for a promotion. If you can't, then people looking to go to Senior or Staff need to leave your team anyway, because even if you did promote them, their reviews would inherently be awful because they would have no ability to demonstrate performance at level.",t-dye,2026-02-22 20:48:41,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1rbv6qc,False,

Is there a need for someone to increase the scope of work they’re during and provide further technical value to a line of business? If so, make that argument and push for a promotion. If not, that’s just an honest assessment of the business’ needs. The way I see it, if a team’s responsibilities evolve then the needs of the team change and it’s up to the manager to facilitate that change.Think of it this way:You have a business and all you sell are apples and the market only has a demand for 100 apples a year. Would you care if your employee was skilled enough to sell 100 vs 1000 apples? Probably not, right? As long as they fill the gap, there’s no incentive to cut further into your profits.Your decision to stay or leave is fully up to you.

That's just not the kind of place to be if you or your reports are primarily focused on professional growth.What you describe is the norm for most jobs outside of growth tech companies. You climb the ladder by applying for a different job that you must compete with others for, not by growing in place like is common in tech.If you want to be an ethical manager, you should be upfront with your reports about this. If you can make it happen, helping your reports find those roles elsewhere in the company where they can be successful is amazing, but that is often thankless work in situations like this. It can pay off for you down the road though, because those same reports may open doors for you on other teams or at other companies in the future.A lot of managers in this situation make the short sighted choice to say what they need to their reports so that they won't leave, even if it's detrimental to them.

o6e7hjj,"Spent 6.75 years in my first job out of college in a defense contractor, and now am making my leave out of the defense life next month. It really depends on how much friction you want your next job search to be. It's easy to remain in the defense ecosystem, especially if you have a clearance, because getting interviews/callbacks from other defense contractors is much easier after having a proven track record in defense. It's also a very comfortable job outside of the work aspect; a 9/80 work schedule is game changing if you are in company that does that and the slow work pace can be relaxing. I honestly don't think I'll ever attain that same level of WLB anywhere else outside of defense after this. I will definitely consider defense again when I am older and ready to just coast to retirement. I think these factors are huge reason people get stuck in defense; it's what I've seen from my older, high tenured colleagues do and people that have left my company to go to other defense companies.I will say that defense is varied and even teams within the same company can have wildly different directives and experiences. I was fortunate to be in a team that got to do really cool stuff that also had a more relaxed pace, and I still got to learn a lot about SWE at the same time. Some of my colleagues that got placed into the big money maker team in my company were working left and right on different projects every month from what it seemed like. My recommendation is that you give this a fair shot for 1-2 years and make an adjustment if needed.You may actually enjoy the work you do and discover that your team isn't as slow or not productive for learning as you may initially thought, or you completely hit the mark on your initial assessment. As a general life advice, use this opportunity to really isolate what you want from a job, and align your next actions to directly support that goal and don't compromise it just because it's easy. If you want out, commit to finding a job that fits your desired career track or work towards joining a top company that can give you that clout you need to work at your end goal role.

Maybe you would learn something if you had to build the same project without Claude. It's super easy to understand code especially code that Claude writes.

Historically I went for startups with business plans I couldn't drive a truck through and generally early enough to get a significant fraction of the company with a transition to SaaS in 2010. Since 2017 I've been more worried about accumulating assets for retirement and worked for public companies with liquid stock.So I don't bookmark specific companies.I hadn't heard of half the public companies I've joined since 2017 and one of those two was the best I've worked for in over thirty years.2. I don't know how often timing was an issue in my Q4 2025 job search because I don't have visibility into whether I failed a resume screen or they chose someone else, although I got offers from companies where the job posting had been up for months and where they took up to two months to get back to me.3. In my Q4 2025 job search I made a spread sheet because I applied to many (62 versus at most a handful) more companies than I did historically and that was the most convenient way to keep track.4.

Google hired me in spite of a reported 0.2 - 0.7% acceptance rate, although to be fair that position came through an inbound recruiter contact.5.

The screening process feels so disconnected from actual job performance, especially when you're more direct or don't play the corporate small talk game well. I've noticed this pattern too where founders tend to hire differently than HR departments do.To answer your questions: I do bookmark companies but honestly it's pretty manual and messy. I use a basic spreadsheet to track applications because most job platforms are terrible for this. Timing is huge though, I've definitely gotten rejections that felt like they already had someone in mind before posting. The ghosting stats would actually be super valuable, like if I knew a company had a 70% ghost rate I'd probably still apply but adjust my expectations and not put as much energy into customizing everything.The biggest BS right now is probably the AI resume screening stuff. You're getting filtered out by algorithms before any human even sees your application, and nobody tells you why. It's this black box where you could be perfect for the role but get rejected because you didn't use the right keywords or format. Companies are posting jobs they're not even seriously trying to fill, just collecting resumes or satisfying some internal requirement.Super cool bc I'm also building something in this space too (called Sprout) because the whole system feels broken. We're trying to give people more visibility into company response patterns and help optimize applications for these screening systems.

The unconventional approach that's actually working for people now is automating the repetitive parts without losing quality.Not talking about spammy mass-blast stuff, but actually letting software handle the grunt work of finding roles that match your criteria, customizing your materials for each ATS, and submitting at scale so you can focus energy on the companies that actually respond. I've heard really good things about SimpleApply for this exact use case since it handles the end-to-end application process and lets you reach way more opportunities without spending 40 hours a week on form filling. To answer your actual questions though: I track in a spreadsheet (Notion got too heavy), I absolutely would skip companies with 70% ghost rates if I knew that data, and the biggest BS right now is take-home assignments that are clearly just free consulting work.The fact that we're all pretending 8-hour unpaid projects are normal interview steps is insane. good luck with your product btw, sounds like you're tackling real pain",garvit__dua,2026-02-20 15:49:41,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1r92ybd,False,

o78jvo5,"Where do you actually want to live? A lot of people forget that most of your time is going to be spent *outside* the office. If you hate where you live, your life is going to be miserable, no matter how good your job is. Do you *want* to live in that Midwest city, or Duluth? Where I live is probably the single most important factor of job searching for me.That said, there's 2 major things I would be worried about with Job 2. Manager dependent hybrid is the first. Have you not had a chance to speak to your actual hiring manager? As in, you've gotta accept an offer basically blind and pray you end up on a good team, with a good manager, doing stuff you're interested in?If that's the case, that's a red flag for me. If you're a new grad it's different, but you have the experienced flair, so if I were you I'd want to spend time reverse-interviewing my actual hiring team to understand what the culture/WLB will be like. Joining a company without speaking to your HM there's a good chance you're walking into a shit environment. Tying that back to hybrid being manager dependent... you might end up with 5 day RTO. That'd be an instant no-go for me, so it'd be rolling the dice. But if you get 1 or 2 day RTO, that's a good gig.Same goes for unlimited PTO. That's not *inherently* bad, I've had unlimited PTO at 2 different companies where it was truly unlimited and encouraged to take. Most people were taking 4-7 weeks. Unless you were asking to take off more than 2 weeks consecutively there wasn't even an approval process. It was great.But on the other side of that coin, if the team culture of Job 2 is bad, unlimited PTO can be awful. That's why if you haven't spoken with your actual hiring manager, you're basically rolling the dice. Which is probably something I wouldn't be comfortable with doing for RTO/unlimited PTO.",CapableHerring,2026-02-25 00:17:34,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1rdvg70,False,
