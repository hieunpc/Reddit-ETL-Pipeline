There's simply so many more people with those skills today then there was 10-15 years ago.10-15 years ago, finding someone who could code was more difficult than today, so companies took whoever they could find and gave them a good salary to do a lot of tech work. As smart phones and social media and e-commerce were still relatively new and starting to boom, these companies were just getting off the ground and needed someone, anyone, who could code. Those folks wore many hats in their job.5 -7 years ago, as more people graduated college with CS degrees or did online bootcamps in hopes of getting these coding jobs, these companies found that they could be more selective in hiring. Okay, they found plenty of people who can code, but how many of them can code and interpret all this data we have? Thus the hiring direction narrows the scope of candidates.In the last 5 years, we again see so many people getting CS degrees, learning to code, bootcamps etc. that companies can again be even more selective in their hiring.

Beyond just practicing SQL syntax, focus on these data engineering-specific concepts for Shopify:1.​Performance thinking: When you write queries during the assessment, always consider ""how would this perform on millions of rows?"" Shopify deals with massive scale. Use EXPLAIN plans, avoid SELECT *, and think about index usage.2. ​Data quality patterns: Practice SQL for data validation, deduplication (ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY), and identifying data anomalies. Real data engineering involves catching bad data before it breaks pipelines.3. ​Incremental processing: Since you mentioned building pipelines mostly in Python, practice SQL patterns for incremental loads—using timestamps, watermarks, and merge/upsert logic. Think ""how do I process only new/changed data efficiently?""4.​Set-based thinking: Coming from Python, you might be used to loops. SQL is set-based. Practice writing queries that transform entire datasets at once rather than row-by-row logic.5. ​Real-world scenarios: Go beyond LeetCode. Practice queries like: ​Detecting duplicate orders ​Calculating running totals/moving averages ​Handling NULL values and edge cases ​Transforming nested/JSON data​For Shopify specifically: They care about how you communicate your approach.

o2a1koq,"I prefer to build streaming first. It's not about the speed for me. First, it's about control and localizing failure. To use your examples; If I break up the CSV putting each row in it's own message, process each row one at a time, and one fails, that row fails, not the whole CSV. That way I know exactly where the problem is and my users have access to the data that is not wrong while the issue with the failures gets handled. Slapping a CDC implementation gives me a stream of all the changes to the relational database not just the end state when the incremental job ran. If the load drastically increases the streaming system gives me a buffer without having to scale my workers unless the load sustains past my data latency requirements. I've seen incremental jobs like that lock up a worker using all the memory because it was suddenly getting back much more from querying the relational database than it had been designed to handle. It couldn't process anything until those workers got scaled up.Second, I think you pointed out something with the fact that you're doing streaming on one system and batch on another. You now effectively have two different types of systems you're maintaining. If you go Kappa architecture as opposed to Lambda architecture you only have one type of system and that simplifies your operational overhead. Even if streaming is harder to operate, you end up ahead. I've never personally found a streaming system more operationally difficult but people do. If you're only going to have one kind of system, I think it's easier to put a batch of work on a streaming system than to try and micro-batch your way to approximating a streaming system.Lastly, and this is more personal, I like to think of data pipelines in a functional programming or even unix shell scripting model. Mostly stateless operations with pipes in between. Streaming tooling seems to map to this mental model better for me.",rjspotter,2026-01-28 20:08:50,2,dataengineering,t3_1qozv1g,False,

Warehouses and data lakes - Azure ADLS, Amazon S3, Redshift, etc.They all store data, but for different purposes. RDBMS systems are used for storing application data that gets read and updated by users all the time (think of user profiles, posts, comments to posts, orders, etc.), and these store data in relational row-based form under the hood, and have their own internal mechanisms for data processing related to application business logic, constraint and transaction enforcement (OLTP for application data).NoSQL systems also store application business data, they're preferred in the use cases where RDBMS' strict constraint, transaction, schema enforcement and strong consistency become a bottleneck - mainly, data partitioning. It's a big and complex topic to explain in one sentence, but generally speaking, NoSQL systems sacrifice those perks to some degree to achieve native and easy horizontal scalability across multiple servers in a cluster (don't confuse with read replicas), which is a tradeoff that's OK for many modern use cases.Warehouses and data lakes is where that application data later lands to from the main database(s), for the purposes of analytical workloads, BI, AI/ML (OLAP workloads). The reason data is placed in a different place for these workloads is because it needs to be organized differently under the hood to be efficiently queried for these purposes (keywords to look up - columnar data format, parquet, OLAP) - while application database needs to be fast for lots of small individual writes and reads per row, warehouses need to be very fast at batch querying, big scans and throughput. And Spark is a data processing tool, that does distributed processing for warehouses and data lakes, not for OLTP workloads. Also to keep in mind, if your data is not that big and you can process it on one server without any problem, you don't need Spark, a custom Python script using e.g. Pandas dataframes for transformations will do the job without the overhead of setting up a cluster.",Inevitable_Zebra_0,2026-01-29 19:10:58,3,dataengineering,t3_1qq9o22,False,

Somewhere I used to work, during winter there were days I'd see no natural light (get in before sun rise, sun sets at around 4 pm)* It's also a lot more physical than people give credit for. Lifting large/heavy vessels into/out of your fume cupboard as well as transporting large quantities of materials isn't easy on your back as you get older* I worked in organic synthesis where if you don't have a PhD in chemistry, it's incredibly hard to not only break into the field but succeed because you're talking about the vast majority of people have a PhD, thus use it as a stick to beat you with (quite fairly, tbh). I do not have a PhD and was usually the only person in the lab who didn't have a PhD* The work environment is a lot less forgiving than tech. You can't google and hit the right answer easily. You really have to know what you are asking the internet. Even then, the answers are likely not widely published. People are a lot smarter on average and a lot less willing to accept bullshit answers* Salaries are not remotely comparable although you do get a much better pension. For reference, I used the chemical companies used to pretty much double your contributions. I have never seen that figure in ITLife as a DE:* Work from home is an option. If you have to turn up, at least your office is likely somewhere accessible and temperature controlled* A much lower barrier to entry. The idea you ""need"" a Masters degree is, in my opinion, complete bollocks. DE education requirements are not standardised across the industry whereas chemistry absolutely is. It's not possible to get into chemistry without a chemistry degree, although you can definitely get into data without a CS degree* Difficulty isn't anywhere near as close. If I ruin a reaction in the lab, good luck getting that shit back. I guess it's like dropping a DB without a back up, although it's much easier to back something up than it is to make an extra X amount of material in case, I don't know, you drop your flask on the floor, somebody knocks it over etc. You live in a world of glass so breakages are inevitable* General working is a lot easier. Synthesis of a product can take a long time. A long one is multiple days if not weeks. You can turn something around quickly and have almost unlimited tries at it in DE* Stakes being lower means it's not as stressful although it does mean you get a lot more bozos because people are less careful. The introduction of AI has massively exposed who is and isn't a fraud (anybody who struggles without AI or ""has to"" lie on their CV is absolutely a fraud)* Zero manual labour. Much much lower chances of dying - I used to make novel pharmaceutical compounds which were definitely biologically active although since it has never been made or tested before (publicly), nobody has any idea how toxic the compound is. So, it could either do nothing or murder you on the spot. Fun fact: I once made something which was over 30 times more potent than fentanyl* Salaries are way higher on average. After 2-3 years of being in DE, I earnt double what I did as my final salary as a chemist after around 10 years in the industrySo what I'm saying is life is relative. If you have only ever worked in tech, then yeah, the grass will always seem greener.

I've done the stress of consulting and PE, and I can't imagine leaving insurance these days unless it was to go back to higher ed, but the pay there doesn't compete with the pay in insurance.Insurance in general tends to have a lot of lifers, my team these days has 14 folks, with an average age of 51. Five of us are younger than 40, seven folks are older than 50, and one gentleman still plugging away at 73. Only two of us have been here less than 8 years, and six have been here 15+ years.I was at USAA for about a year before this, and they also had a ton of long-timers. My team there was \~8 folks and only two of us had been there less than a decade, lots of folks had started in other jobs at the company and then cross-trained over into DE as the company built their org. They want to keep folks who really get the insurance business, that domain knowledge is really helpful.Not sure if I'd recommend USAA right now, though. They're going through a whole lot of flux these last few years, and I think I'd steer clear until they figure things out, maybe 2028\~2030 or so. The thing that hurt USAA was that they got out over their skis after their big hiring burst during Covid, so they tried to thin the workforce with a ton of early retirement incentives in 2023, and then still had to do their first-ever wave of layoffs in 2024.

I don’t know if its right - only time will tell:-1 - get really good a defining and documenting for AI and business. How do I get an Agent to accelerate my work via context and not code. How do I show others the value I’m generating via acceleration of skills and effect using LLMs. Outcomes are all that count - 99% success but no value to business or customers doesn’t count as a win. 2 - the technology moats will come down. Oracle tech stack isn’t going to be a thing in 2 years. You’re a plumber of data and the stack/implementations matter less as the coast of replacing them is coming down at a huge rate. Tech debt suddenly has way lower interests rates. 3 - get good at big data again. Small stuff is gonna be usurped - that’s light work for a LLM. Big data is going to be hard because of cost and time. Start with YouTube - it’s a mess of influencers and hype men but there is some gold in there. Microsoft have a bunch of free GitHub learning on AI, ML, Big data on their repos. https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners is one. But they gave many. One thing to remember - the AI coding hype cycle has been around for 2 or so years of any value. You are still smarter than AI for sure. It can just type and think faster than you.

Learning how to use Pandas and later PySpark will help too.

o29kh4v,"Agreed with other comments that this comparison doesn't make much sense, but just to go into a little more detail as to why...BigQuery and Athena are both serverless cloud offerings. BigQuery abstracts away storage *and* compute. Athena abstracts away only compute, as you need to connect it to your object storage, but fundamentally, it's at least a little similar as an offering. You're not managing infrastructure with either of them, and they'll scale up parallelization to whatever level is necessary to ensure you get query results back in a reasonable amount of time. Because they're both built on serverless billing models, costs are very high on a query-by-query basis, but this can still be competitive in a real-world scenario if you have relatively low daily utilization.Compare that to DuckDB, where you're using dedicated hardware with an embedded, columnar database. It abstracts away nothing - you're providing the hardware for storage and the hardware for compute. This is radically different. It works well at small scales, and because you're managing everything, it's great for heavy utilization and is extremely cost-effective on a query-by-query basis. It's also not distributed at all. Once you scale up past what a single machine can handle, you have graduated from DuckDB and need to move to something that can distribute the workload and handle scale.Fundamentally, they're different tools solving different problems. So when you run a benchmark with 20 GB of data, you're using a very small scale of data that DuckDB is built for and which BigQuery/Athena are not. Because there's no downtime in benchmarking, you're also simulating what is effectively 100% utilization, the least favorable scenario for a serverless billing model. Of course DuckDB is going to end up looking good.The way to meaningfully compare them on cost, at least, if you were for some reason trying to decide between these different options, would be to look at a simulated full month of usage. The hardware you're running DuckDB on costs \~$1500 for a month on EC2, or maybe \~$7500 in up front hardware costs if you have it on-site. You'd need to run \~1700 queries a day on BigQuery to get a similar monthly bill, or \~13500 of the narrow queries on Athena.

They won originally by outperforming legacy players. Think about how they effectively outmoded Redshift and Vertica by simply having a more modern architecture. But the most successful ""vertical"" companies aren't actually technology leaders. Nobody uses Salesforce, Adobe, Intuit, or Docusign because they have the best code.

Most commonly, this happens when there is a campaign where the target audience is brand new. I cannot tell you how many times I find myself caught in email chains with compliance and legal where their segmentation criteria requirements specify data points that the company does not even have and has no way of obtaining in a timely or reasonable way. Many times, I will point this out to my superiors who will just ignore me and leave me to figure it out on my own because they have no idea what to do. This literally happened to me last quarter. :zany_face: I work closely with the team that does operational comms, and it is similarly stressful because they do not always know what list criteria they will need or when. They often deal with Sudoku like puzzles where they have to build lists with pieces of information, from multiple applications and then find a method to validate the results.Even coordinating sends becomes challenging because of how dynamic the production process is. Multiple rounds of revisions means delayed approval which can push past the expected send date, causing sending conflicts that now have to be sorted out with multiple teams that often believe their message should be priority.2. Yes. “Everything is a fire.” :fire: Things break unexpectedly all the time, and we are constantly conducting an orchestra in front of a live audience. Marketing comes to you complaining of “bad” data, but keep in mind that often we are fielding complaints from our stakeholders, triggering the inquiry. (FWIW Typically, I only flag anomalies after multiple observations or complaints. I also do some initial investigating on my end, like reviewing audit and sync error logs to rule out the obvious.)Successfully capturing UTM parameters is kind of like walking a tightrope if you have a bloated tech stack and duplicate records. Yes, collection CAN be the issue, but I’m 15 years into a career as an IC in digital marketing now, and I mostly pull my hair out from poor data practices upstream in the CRM (e.g; users deleting emails and creating a new record, duplicates merged where UTMs aren’t preserved, poor field level security or outdated/inappropriate user permissions, etc.) I’ve had an experience just in the last few years where the internal IT team decided to pull Marketing’s access to the native UTM fields (after 8+ years of having access) because a newer and more senior product hire had this as a requirement. It broke all of the UTM tracking from the website and some other applications, and I had to spend a year arguing with them to get it fixed :face_with_rolling_eyes:The practices I see in Salesforce in the last 5 years truly feel like a major regression from the ways that I learned to manage data and technology early on in my career.

o2fm7bs,"Hi, a few things to consider.\- Data Talks Zoom Camp uses GCP, whereas Data Engineering by Joe Reis uses AWS. Even though the cloud technology you use doesn't matter much to learn the concepts, it's still better to start with what you are interested in. \- Zoom Camp is semi-structured and felt all over the place with some GitHub content, YouTube videos, past Cohort links, etc. For someone like me, it's very easy to deviate and lose interest. \- Joe Reis's course is well structured with a lot of optional material and paired with the Fundamentals of Data Engineering as the course's textbook. The assignments follow a similar structure to other Andrew NG's courses. Not too tough to pass. But, still a lot to explore and learn. \- ZoomCamp is free but uses a sponsored orchestrator. The deeplearning course uses Airflow, which is considered standard. Of course, there is Dagster and a few other tools gaining traction. So, this is not too significant either. \- ZoomCamp is tweaked and updated every year. But the DeepLearning course stays the same. But since it's a very recent release, it still covers the most popular tools and concepts, such as Lakehouse architecture, dbt, text data processing for AIML workloads, etc. \- ZoomCamp has a strict deadline to get the certificate. You will still achieve it if you start now. I assume the score weightage is mostly on the capstone project. For the Deep Learning one, you can keep paying and extending as long as needed.Overall, I tried to finish Zoomcamp multiple times and was distracted, but I am in the final module of the Deep Learning course.",mothikikm,2026-01-29 16:15:20,6,dataengineering,t3_1qq4aw3,False,
o2f8j29,"I like the DataTalks Zoomcamp a lot and am about to go through it again actually. Alexey ~~Andrei~~ is an awesome instructor for his portions. Some of the others are less so, but overall it's pretty solid. I'm half way through Joe Reis's Deeplearning and I'm torn on whether to finish it or not. A lot of the videos are reiterating a lot of content from his book (Fundamentals of Data Engineering). It goes over a lot of the soft skills that a good DE needs, but less so on the technical side. His class spends a lot of time within AWS and you do pick up some skills with it, so it's not too bad, but I don't feel like it was sticking with me after the class was done.Personally, do a few of the DataTalks zoomcamps - it has you writing and doing more than the other courses. And since the zoomcamps can occasionally miss some steps, it will force you to either interact with the other students or hone your research skills in order to make things work correctly.Lastly, you can go back through the DataTalks github and look at previous cohorts - they change up their tech stack some. One year used Airflow for their orchestration, the next used Dagster and they might be using another one now.

The main python asset imports those helpers and then executes the actual logic of batch processing the extraction and loading to our datalake (hive configured).For transformations, we have mostly moved away from python to sql since we can directly query external tables created from our hive datalake. But we still sometimes use python for the first layer where the data is weird file formats (like grib, netcdf, etc.) that require special processing - in such cases we read the files, convert to a dataframe, and then materialize it in our dwh. Our data platform's own built-in python materialization automatically handles incremental strategies and variable injections.There are also very rare cases where data needs to be processed in a way thats not possible with sql - for example decoding airport weather reports like metar/taf, which require special python libraries to decode.To answer your question about frameworks - we write functional code with very minimal object-oriented programming. For my team the rule of thumb is that a single python file/asset should contain all the logic tied to a single data entity/table/model. We never use notebooks (unless for quick local testing and adhoc stuff). In some cases, we extract different data from a single API endpoint, so for those cases we create a separate agent/helper to connect to the API and configure the parameters - this is the only case where we use a bit more oop.",uncertainschrodinger,2026-01-27 07:02:32,8,dataengineering,t3_1qo49nt,False,

It’s honestly been a very janky product. Random bugs, successful runs that silently failed, sporadic OOM errors when there is 64gb of memory available, and the list goes on.

When I teach juniors, half the battle is helping them read schemas before writing queries.- Might be cool to add “bad but works” vs “idiomatic” solutions, especially around CTE vs subquery, or when to use window functions instead of GROUP BY gymnastics.- If you ever expand beyond pure practice, this kind of dataset is perfect for showing how those queries then power internal tools or dashboards that non‑SQL folks use every day.Bookmarked.

o34iw9k,"Couple things from someone who was in a very similar “I like cloud + data but entry level feels impossible” spot:First, your background is actually a plus. Biomedical + CS + interest in AWS is a really solid combo for any company doing healthcare / medtech / clinical analytics. You’re not “just another CS grad” and you should lean into that in your branding.Job search stuff:You’re not going to win by only applying through LinkedIn / Indeed. Use them to find roles, but assume most of your “wins” will come from:- Direct company career pages (especially mid‑sized boring‑sounding companies, not just the big names)- Alumni network from your undergrad and your MS program- Local meetups / online meetups (data engineering, cloud, healthcare analytics)On LinkedIn specifically:Search for “data engineer”, filter by Experience → Entry level / Associate, and also try “analytics engineer” and “data analyst” with SQL + Python + cloud. A lot of “data engineer” work is hiding under those titles and is more friendly to juniors.Then for roles you like:Check who works there as a data engineer / analytics engineer / dev on LinkedIn. Add them with a short note like:“Hey, saw you work on X at Y. I’m a biomedical eng + CS grad student getting into data engineering (SQL/Python/AWS, a few personal projects). Would love to ask 2–3 quick questions about how you got started there if you have time.”You’re not asking for a job, you’re asking for info. Some % of those chats naturally turn into referrals.Targeting-wise, with your background I’d look at:Health tech startups, EHR vendors, medical device companies, hospital systems, insurers, pharma / biotech. They all have messy data and love someone who actually understands the domain.Also, consider “bridge” roles:Data analyst, BI dev, “reporting engineer,” even some backend roles with a data flavor. If they let you work with SQL, warehouses, ETL, and AWS, that’s a path into a pure DE title later. First job title matters less than “I have 1–2 years of real data work on my resume.”Projects:Make 2–3 small but real projects that scream “I can do data engineering” and “I know healthcare”.Example: pull some public health dataset, build a basic pipeline:ingest → clean → store → query → simple dashboard.Put it on GitHub, write a 1‑page README that explains the problem, tech stack, and what you did. This is gold in interviews.If you want to play with realistic internal‑tool type stuff: spin up a small web UI on top of that data so someone non‑technical could view / edit it. Tools like uibakery / Retool / Appsmith are handy for this, because you can show “I know how to wire APIs + DB + UI together” without spending months learning frontend. That’s closer to what a lot of internal data teams actually do.Mindset part:The “no light at the end of the tunnel” feeling is super normal. Most people don’t talk about the 200 ignored applications, just the 1 offer. If you’re sending out apps into a void with no feedback, shift some of that time into:- Reaching out to humans- Tightening 1–2 standout projects- Practicing SQL + basic data modeling + simple dbt / Airflow patterns so you crush technical screensYou’re not incapable. The market is just noisy and bad at surfacing juniors. Your combo of domain + CS + cloud interest is good. If you keep iterating on outreach + projects and stay flexible on titles, you’ll get a crack at it.",valentin-orlovs2c99,2026-02-02 08:48:53,1,dataengineering,t3_1qs44qq,False,

Not a complete solution. You do not do a course and become a complete programmer in the same way graduating with a medicine degree makes you ready to carry out complex, life threatening surgery.A common misconception is that all you need is a course. Personally, I did an online courses. I did a few actually. 6-8 months later, I got my first DE role with no experience whatsoever. Without any further detail, this makes getting into DE sound really fucking easy.What isn't included is all of the work outside of those courses. I was literally writing code, watching videos, reading blogs, writing stuff down, and generally thinking about programming for 60-70 hours per week every week for around 6 months. And when I say writing code, I wasn't following tutorials. I was googling the fuck out of the internet on how to try and do what I wanted to do. As you can tell, that's a lot more than 70-90 hours.On top of that, what's also not mentioned is my career before being in DE involved interpreting data on pretty much a daily basis. Sometimes, stuff which you can't even measure, test, or see.

Of course it does.That being said, you are only wasting your time if you think the course is ""enough"". There are lot of soft skills which you can't really measure and they are a lot more valuable than the degree itself. You have the massive benefit of not being time gated with what and how you learn which is balanced against not having a traditional degree.My recommendation is work very heavily on your soft skills.

For da ad hoc querying from api and then analyzing data in notebook, Pandas (or better these days to future proof yourself, Polars) is more likely to be a go to. It is a discreet analysis engine. It is great for flattening api json to tables quickly, it is modular so you can do step wise analysis, it is very quick to export from.But for proper oltp or olap based de pipeline dev with traceability and db centric design, sql will be your bread and butter much of the time. I have moved from da to de and have been using more and more duckdb as my sql engine lately. It is olap so it doesn't have schema registration reqs as ready to enforce, but it can lazy process parquet from s3 VERY efficiently without significant memory required. The thing about pandas is that all ops are in memory, which is fine if your dataset is less than your available system RAM, but when you work with larger data or cloud based flows (and associated costs) limiting memory dependency is an important optimization. Polars also can help with this because it has lazy loading ops.At this point for data collection i pull from api and collect as polars then pass to duck to write raw data as partitioned parquet. If I can do transformations in duck I do it all in duck directly querying the parquet. If there is something messy that I have difficulty doing in duck, I will do what I can with duck and then take it back to polars for lazy in memory vector ops. If I need to quickly inspect data I use pandas converted tables because I am more well versed on pandas. I also use pandas where iteration line by line is necessary (like api lookup).

o34sfog,"> Nowadays, I just give LLMs my problems and it solves them immediately or gives me step by step instruction on how to solve them.Oh really? How confident are you in the accuracy/validity of those ""solutions?"" Consider this gem from ChatGPT: https://i.imgur.com/yjWbf3z.pngOne line of code (Bash script), it doesn't get much simpler than this. Except that, of course, `tee` doesn't actually *have* a `-q` option:https://i.imgur.com/wUZpXmP.pngTrying to run this command immediately shows that it doesn't work, and the suggested ""quiet"" option for `tee` is nowhere to be found (and of course, this `tee` *is* the binary from GNU coreutils, as the output from these commands show).Obviously, it is a hallucination - not exactly a novel phenomenon. The real concern here is that one false fact easily yields more:https://i.imgur.com/ap5dQPt.pngUsing the non-working command as a base, *any* code it generates will not work. I didn't bother correcting it for a bit, eventually yielding this completely nonsensical, useless code:https://i.imgur.com/AR6BDBQ.pngOf course, this phantom `tee -` is just an example - what I'm pointing out here isn't about coding or Linux, but that LLMs not only can give false information, but use those to deduce further falsehoods. Left unchecked, such a process could yield a very large amount of information which seems perfectly reasonable, with justifications that seem to logically follow - but in fact it is all hallucinated.Finally, I chose this example here specifically because it was so simple. When asking more complex questions (involving multiple steps to solve a problem, accomplish a task, etc.), it becomes more likely that some link in the chain is faulty. Presented as an intact chain with each link solidly connected to the last, a weak link (if present) becomes harder to see.Now, as for how this relates to your post: for example,> Ever since I was a kid, I used to love the process of getting stuck, googling, watching half-relevant YouTube videos, reading forums, slowly piecing things together. That ""ohhh, wait, I get it now"" moment was addictive and felt ""earned"". There is still the potential for that ""aha"" moment when using LLMs - namely, when realising that your question is not being answered correctly, or that the reason nothing it suggests allows you to proceed past some point in a process you're stuck at is because the LLM itself is stuck, on some false assumption. The ""struggle"" is then to determine which assumption that is, explain why it is false, and from there proceed to your next question/step. In terms of your ""puzzle"" example, finding an error in the solution manual and proceeding to the (correct) solution by your own means.What you desire: ""feeling proud of understanding something because I worked for it"" hasn't gone away - but the path towards fulfilling that desire may be different.> This is probably what people felt when the computer or the internet was invented as well, eh?Indeed there are many things that those technologies now do for us that before we had to do ourselves. But they also bring new things that we were not able to do before.

For instance, to understand how gates can make flip flops that can be used in shift registers, you really need to understand why ""shift registers"" are an important concept in binary mathematics, and to understand how a compiler converts high level language to assembly, you really need to understand both assembly AND abstract grammar and syntax - in other words, you need to understand both abstractions above and below the current thing you are trying to learn, as well as the abstract idea of the thing itself, all three of which requires knowledge of something else on all three levels!!Don't let that discourage you though - you should still be allowed to learn everything, but just don't fool yourself into thinking that there is a ""perfect"" order to learn them in, like go from the silicon to the CPU to machine code to assembly to compilers to higher level languages to abstract concepts - or indeed the other way around.

Yes, it doesn’t branch infinitely in a literal sense the way a fractal might, but there are almost always far too many twists and turns to keep in your head all at the same time. Most real programs are more like a circle than a straight path, and the only reason that thats even true is that we write them to work that way so that we have some chance at reasoning about them.The good news, though, is that you don’t need to keep it all in your head at the same time. Programming is a never ending exercise in abstraction. To do the work, you only need to worry about the one piece that you’re working on at any moment. If you’re writing a function that computes a value based on its parameters, you don’t care where those parameters came from. If you’re calling another function, you don’t need to worry about how it does what it does — you only care about *what* it does (and sometimes how long it takes). Considering (and especially depending on) things outside the function can even be a liability.I’m glad that you’re sticking with it!

o31s2z9,"Tutorials work up to a certain degree.Once people have learnt the fundamentals, people should simply stop using tutorials and start building. Yet, that is the tricky and difficult part. Since in current times, people are hand-held all their lives they don't want to give up being hand-held and spoon-fed. They don't dare to let go and less know how to stand on their own feet.This was very different in the old days when there were no tutorials. You learnt by experimenting, by trying, by failing. But there also was more time and less competition.Now, fast is key. Which is completely wrong. Speedrunning learning leads to nothing.Well back to the original topic:There are good, mediocre, and outright rubbish tutorials and there are *courses* - this is an important distinction.Proper *courses* are e.g. the CS50 series from Harvard, the MOOCs from the University of Helsinki, Algorithms from Princeton, and countless others. Common to all of them is that they have a proper, educational curriculum, are approved and battle tested, and never pre-chew and spoon feed solutions - they all make the *learner* do the work.Now *tutorials* on the other hand, generally pre-chew and spoon feed. They *give* the code and only expect the learner to type it in - which is the totally wrong approach to learning. This is not learning.Worst tutorials are *""How to build X in language Y""* tutorials. They are plain useless. You, as the learner will not learn anything from them, not even the skill to build X in language Y on your own. All you will learn is to copy the code.About *proper usage* of tutorials: if you really go through a tutorial (not as a complete and utter beginner - as such, you should take a *course*), try to predict the code. Once the task following is explained, stop the tutorial and try to write the code on your own. Try a good amount of time and make different attempts if your first fails. Then, once you have a solution, or can't think of any other way, continue with the tutorial and compare - this way you train *your thinking* (which is far more important than your *coding*) and the coding plus, you get the final code to maybe learn the one or other thing from.I still think that the best approach to learning is first a solid *course* and then (and along with the course) program, program, program, program. Experiment, try things, break them, fix them, play around with the code.

They should be identifying a field and learn the languages and tools used in that field.If you just learn a random language, you could be stuck in tutorial hell because once you are done learning that random language you may well find that nobody actually uses that language in the field you are interested in.e.g. you are advised to learn Pascal in response to the incorrect question because of its clarity and simplicity. Then you want to work in robotics. Sorry, go back and learn C/C++.## watching/reading but not doingA common problem I see is people complaining that they slogged through the entire series, but then can't do anything.That is because they slogged through the series and everything that went in one ear, got pushed right out the other side.People need to regularly press pause on the tutorial (or bookmark the book) and try out what they have seen. Experiment with it. Try to get it to do something else. For example, if taught how to create a loop that counts from 1 to 10, try to make it so that it goes from 10 to 1.## AIThis will be triggering for some - especially the AI propaganda bots. But AI is a double edged sword.If used correctly, to search, consolidate or explain it can be a useful tool.But if it is used to generate code - especially on anything more than an occasional basis then the risk is the same as my previous ""... not doing"" point. But it is more insidious. IMHO.In another sub that I moderate, we get a lot of posts along the lines of ""I used AI to write the code for the lessons and some basic things, but now I'm trying to do my own unique thing. It doesn't work and I don't know how to fix it."". Even worse, because they have been copying and pasting the AI gibberish, they often don't have the vocabulary to clearly explain what is going on nor understand the changes proposed (unless someone rewrites it for them).The solution?

Example, they know that they can use a `long` or regular `int` and can't understand why sometimes both work and sometimes one might get weird negative values unexpectedly (and I'm thinking C here, but also some other languages).* When joining a new project, people are often on probation and part of the probation involves mentoring.There are other possible reasons including ""they didn't do the tutorials correctly"".",gm310509,2026-02-01 22:46:31,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qtc27f,False,

o2ip3nl,"Don't follow ""tutorials"". Learn about a particular language feature, and follow a tutorial on how that feature works, instead of a tutorial for ""how to do xyz"". You have to understand the features of the language and then use them in some projects. Don't study a tutorial of how to store unlimited values, learn what arrays/lists/vectors/etc are and what methods you can use. Don't study a tutorial for how to process a series of values, learn how the ""foreach"" system works. etc. Learn the language features, learn how to use the different programs that process your code (version control, build system, editor, etc), and learn what the features allow you to do. Once you learn those things, then you can follow a tutorial and see how to use different libraries that allow you to apply what you've learned. You'll then know the language to know how to modify what you're presented to make it do the things you want it to do.Lastly, don't read how tos or tutorials first, read the documentation. Want to learn how to process arguments in python? Read the argparse documentation. Want to learn how to process patterns of text in C#? Read about .NET Regexes.

That said, if you did do changes to your code without these before, you can improve code quality without.

(But since unittest is build into the standard library, maybe give it a try and write some simple tests for the functions you change!)\- ""but I’m worried that even then it will still feel messy"". Yes, it will still feel messy, but thats just the first step, that enables the next ones. Its a journey and while the goal ""tidy code"" can be helpful as motivation it can also be overwhelming. \- Talking about ""proceeding in steps"": A simple technique that can help is identifying sections in code, lines that belong together. Give these sections a comment saying what the section does. Then try to pull out that section into a function. The function name now can take the task that the comment had: It tells what happens, without the need to reading the whole function. Try to make the function only rely on the parameters you pass to it instead of ""global state"" (also called a ""pure function""). This makes the function easy to test and to understand. This might not always be easy, but at least check if its possible. \- There are a lot of helpful texts there – [https://refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru) is a good online resource, Fowlers book ""Refactoring"" is also pretty helpful.

o27trby,"One of the things I like to do is not to factor into ""substeps"", but more like ""next steps"". Taking a big function and then making functions out of it often means that you're just switching between different functions, but have the same complexity. That's often actually worse.Breaking things down into ""input, process, output"" helps dramatically, especially if you can then extract the ""output"" to a separate method/object. If your big function makes a call to an API, does something with it, makes a call to another API, etc? Try to separate at those boundaries, or push things to the end. A useful pattern can be to gather up all of the changes you want in your function, and then apply them at the end.One strategy I've often used is to ""chop the tail"". What that means is finding the very last thing the function does, and then creating a new function at that point, taking all of the data it needs as parameters. You can then work through the function as a whole. This differs from the ""substep"" method because you can, when you make that final call, basically forget about what happened before that. If you call that last function with the right parameters, then the previous function was correct.

Pick one language and stick with it for a few years, you will naturally run into other simpler languages and use them either way (HTML and CSS will come up A LOT). The project you start should be practical and allow some level of interaction for the user (login, fill cart, request info, etc;) and demonstrate competency managing this information on the backend. If you’re more inclined to make games or something more amusing, follow a tutorial of someone that just does sessions from time to time and uploads it.

o21lfnq,"I learned C from books because I am old. ;) But more seriously: check the library for an intro to C textbook. Every one I've ever seen was at least a good intro.I wouldn't be too worried about being embarrassed in labs about beginner mistakes; that's what class is for. If you already knew C, the class wouldn't be helpful.Relative to other languages, it helps to understand C's memory model, because it's a lot closer to what actually happens under the hood in the computer and getting confused about it is the source of a lot of errors. So, in C, you have two places data is stored in memory: the stack and the heap. The stack is where any variables in your functions live. If you say `int number = 5;`, that puts a `5` on the stack (hey folks who actually know C: yes, I know about registers, keeping it simple to start with, yeah?). Generally, stuff on the stack lives there until the function returns, then *everything* on the stack for that function goes away. That's all the variables you declared in your function and everything passed into the function (all the stuff passed into a function, the function gets a copy of).The heap is where longer-lived stuff goes. You get a chunk of heap by going `int* pointer_to_number = malloc(sizeof(int));`. That gives you some int-sized chunk of memory somewhere, and what `malloc` actually returns is a *pointer* to that memory. Now, `pointer_to_number` is a variable (on the stack) that holds an address of something in the heap. You can treat the pointer like a number (if you try to print it and tell print ""it's a number,"" for example, it'll just be the memory address where the data is stored). If you want to modify the data on the heap, you can go `*pointer_to_number = 13;`. The star there means ""I want to mess with the stuff pointed to, not the pointer itself."" If you wanted to change what the pointer points to, you could go `pointer_to_number = pointer_to_some_other_number;`. Note the lack of a star.Now here's the place where people get messed up most often: C has no way to know when you're done with the memory `malloc` gave you. It needs *you* to tell it that. So when you're all done with the memory you got handed, you call `free(pointer_to_number);`. That will say to the memory manager ""Hey, that pointer you malloc'd me awhile back? All done with it; something else can use that memory."" If you forget to do that, when your function returns and the variables holding the pointer go away, the pointed-to memory can't be found anymore and you ""leaked"" it; that memory is stuck with a 'used' flag on it and nobody else can use it.The other thing about C is that it's a language with few 'guardrails' and makes it very easy to screw up the memory model or machine state. If you call `free` twice on the same pointer, you probably just break the memory manager and it'll do screwy stuff in your program from that point forward (modern operating systems give every program its own copy of `malloc` itself so you can't break the *whole computer's* state that way; worst-case-scenario, you can always quit the program and when it terminates all the memory it was using is properly given back to the operating system, including anything `malloc`'d). If you `malloc` a small amount of memory and then try to cram something big in there, C will cheerfully write the big thing past the end of the memory you reserved and clobber whatever's in the next chunk of memory. If you take a pointer to something on the stack (using the `&` operator) and then try to hold onto that pointer and then return from the function where that stack-thing lives, it'll get freed but your pointer will still be around and now it's pointing to the wrong thing. And probably the biggest foot-gun in the language: strings are just pointers to the first character of the string, so if you `malloc` some memory to hold a string and then forget now much you malloc'd and write a longer string than will fit in that memory, you will rip right into some other data in memory squirting random characters into it and you'll have a bad time.In a lot of ways, C is *way* simpler than other languages.

o2ja8lp,"Some advices:\- Don't get stuck on the ""learning new languages"" cycle, SPECIALLY on high-level programming languages. It's fine if you do this for a while, but the diminishing returns become heavy after. This is because newcomers don't yet have the necessary exposure and knowledge to do ""new things"", therefore they just fall in the trap of: learn new language -> learn basic syntax -> pretty much do nothing actually minimally important (to your learning) with this language -> get bored because you pretty much did nothing -> learn new language.\- Try to diversify your initial learning over several areas of computing: graphics, distributed systems, embedded systems, operating systems, application development (web & mobile), and so on... Quick extra tip: place your effort into learning operating systems more, everything nowadays use an operating system as a basis, and therefore having at least a minimal understanding of how they work is important.\- Try spending the majority of your time in an actual low-level programming such as C. I wouldn't recommend C++ just yet, because it won't give the same effect to a beginner as C does, this is because since C++ abstracts some stuff, beginners are prone of thinking about some features as an ""API"", which is not really what is happening, and this creates the exact opposite effect of what we want, since APIs in programming are usually perceived as a black box, and you don't want a black box, you want to actually understand what is going on. Just an additional note: I'd recommend coupling low-level programming learning with your OS studies.\---------I'd take my advices with a grain of salt however, because it really depends on what stage you already are, and what type of approach you have towards your learning process. I also think it's pretty important you start recognizing early on what is holding you back, and what isn't, because believe me, it's very easy to stagnate when learning programming, and it's very hard to get out of that hole as well.",mnelemos,2026-01-30 03:08:41,7,learnprogramming,t3_1qqr5hk,False,

o32vz43,"You don't necessarily need to follow a formalized, structured system. If you're working on a project with other people, it probably makes sense to talk to those people and agree on how to format your commit messages. For example, [""Conventional Commits""](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is one example of a consistent way to format your commit messages. But for a solo project, it really doesn't matter at all whether you stick rigidly to something like this.As far as the *types* of information you should be putting in your commit messages: it should be enough to explain both what you changed and why you changed it, to a level of detail that you find sufficient. Commit messages are a form of documentation, and there's no one ""right"" level of detail for your documentation. It depends on how much time you're willing to spend on it.If you want some inspiration, you can take a look at the Linux, which generally has very detailed commit messages. Often the messages are much longer than the corresponding code changes. A Linux kernel PR won't be accepted if the maintainers don't think the commit message is clear enough, even if the code itself is fine.For instance, [this recent commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/76ed27608f7dd235b727ebbb12163438c2fbb617) has 31 lines of text (plus footers) to describe a 13-line code change. The first line contains just the most crucial details: the change affects performance monitoring (""perf"") in the scheduler (""sched"") subsystem, and it fixes a potential crash. The rest of the message goes into detail about exactly why the problem is happening and how it was fixed.Again, you probably don't need to go into nearly that level of detail for *all* your commits, especially if you're working on a project that's less critical than the Linux kernel. But while you're writing code, you should be thinking about how you would explain what you're doing to another programmer. And then you can decide how much of that explanation you want to put into the commit message.----Note also that deciding how to *describe* your commits goes hand-in-hand with deciding *what* changes to include in each commit. In the example I gave, it's straightforward to describe the commit's purpose because it's a very small, self-contained change. If the commit included other bug fixes at the same time, it would be a lot harder to write a good description.You might think that carefully breaking up your changes into multiple commits is just creating more work, but if you do it properly, it can make things easier for you in the long run.",teraflop,2026-02-02 01:44:57,6,learnprogramming,t3_1qth1ff,False,

Then again everyone has their own style— but definitely do not do `git add .` — source control is your friend, it’s one of the icons on the left hand side of VS code that looks like a merge request icon IIRC. Commit a message for each file, and make it a habit to commit frequently until you get a feel for appropriate checkpoints.Edit: `git add .` is fine for initial project template / codebase, or overall changes — just don’t work on something for several hours and then be lazy / cut corners with it. Proper documenting of ongoing and frequent changes is essential if your goal is to eventually work with a team at any level from small to enterprise. Some teams have a specific recommended standard for commit verbosity and frequency as well!Edit edit: If your mind is searching for a statement for a commit and can’t find it— you can describe what you did to any LLM and it should be able to help you.

Self-teaching + building a mental model _does_ indeed require non-trivial mental effort.One tip: When I need to read through particularly gnarly code, I like to keep notes in a separate text file or doc.I typically structure this in a 'question -> answer' kind of way, where I create a separate section for each open question or ""line of investigation"" I have. Maybe I'll also create a separate section for quick links, TODOs, snippets of cli commands to run, etc.I find having this sort of structure makes it much easier for me to stay focused, especially in cases where I feel too overwhelmed trying to mentally remember and keep track of everything.> I wonder if that is something that gets better after some time.It will -- as you get more familiar with the code, you'll have to spend less and less time digging, simply by virtue of you already being familiar with more aspects of the codebase.Even longer term, it'll get easier once you've worked on enough systems to start seeing similarities and echos. For example, if you've spend a fair amount of time working with backend and cloud infra, new codebases in the same domain will start feeling vaguely similar. There are only so many ways of reasonably structuring code after all.I'll take time for both types of familiarity/experience to grow though: it's totally expected/normal to feel a bit lost as an intern or new hire.> This is my first in person internship, so I don't know if it is normal to just stand up and walk for 5 minutes. That is what I used to do in remote internships.This is also normal. I've been programming professionally nearly a decade or so, and I also take short breaks once every hour or two. A quick stretch break, refilling my water, etc.If I'm feeling particularly stumped/annoyed, I'll often go on a longer 15-20m walk break, maybe step outside to grab some fresh air...Every now and then, I figure out how to ""enter the zone"" and manage to stay focused for hours and hours, though this usually happens when I'm writing code as opposed to debugging + investigating.

What data structures (at least: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, Stacks and Queues) are.After that, then you can go to the game engine.If you mean the whole ""getting used to your environment"" - start by following a short game tutorial, and then adding functionality to it (make flappybird, then add a coin collecting mechanic - or extra life pickups). This will teach you where things are, and how to get there. When following the tutorial, don't follow line by line, but section by section. Watch for a few minutes, and then repeat it on your own trying not to reference the video.

Think about what you want to accomplish, and quantify it. If it ain't quantifiable, explain it as a story that gives quantifiable metrics. We call these Functional & Non-functional/Quality Requirements. Define and prioritize those first. Once you know exactly what it is you want to make, start to break that thing down into identifiable entities, their components, and their relationships to everything else. Think about how the game works, and the major parts of it.* Look up SOLID programming principles, and Object Oriented Design Patterns. They are incredibly helpful in game dev, because they teach you how to arrange ideas in a way that's typically useful for simulations like games* When in doubt about how certain things work, read the docs. They are dense, but they're by far the most useful resource at your disposal.* Follow a consistent coding style. Your code should look the same regardless of where it is - this makes it easier to parse over later.

So create your scene, stick in a paddle, hook in keyboard controls so that it can move.2.

So that i can check if the right index of a number is the same as from the left, if so, return true, if not, return false.

o232wmk,"Yea I wouldn't spend big money on a bootcamp. I would try to setup a study schedule where you are programming every day however. I see you mention wanting to be proficient in AppSec and AI, then it is important to understand that there is more to this than just the language. Many times, when in comes to the language it is just the tool you use to apply logic and with that said AppSec and AI both rely heavily on the fundamentals of Computer science concepts. Discrete math, Data structures and algorithms, operating systems fundamentals, networking basics, databases, etc. With all that said, the one thing you can look at that credentializes you while teaching you all the relevant concepts is a Comp Sci degree. Especially with your stated goals. If you can't get a degree, then focus on first building the foundation for a self made CS curriculum. Appsec in particular isn't just finding bugs in front end code, it includes threat modeling, devops and other infra principles, tons of code review, database management, etc. AI security is emerging in 2 forms. The first being red/blue team tradecraft oriented security. So hacking the models through prompt injection, data poisoning, first order attacks etc. The second form is securing the models themselves, which is actually more inline with the AI/ML engineer/MLOps skillset, the best way to get into this is to pursue a traditional AI focused CS program. Notice, how everything comes back to CS fundamentals. Not assuming you want to jump into a senior position, but security isn't really a beginner focused field. In order to do security properly, you need the knowledge of an engineer and the knowledge of someone who can actually break the app and recommend remediation. Lofty goals is what keeps us motivated, but I would break down your goals in meaningful steps and a meaningful timeline. To answer what you would use to learn programming and CS fundamentals, the only course that ever stuck with me was a ""bootcamp"" I took last year for $150 from exercism. They didn't even use a real language for the first half of the course, yet the fundamentals they taught have still stuck with me today. The biggest benefit from this course however was their discord where mentors were there to help guide you to answers on your own. After that I recognized my own shortcomings when it came to algorithmic thinking. I focused on the math and discrete math fundamentals, before jumping back into doing algorithm problems to improve my thinking.

o2dyimo,"Think of a keyboard as three stacked realities:1.Physics – switches, rows, columns, diodes2.Time – scanning, debouncing, state transitions3.Language – turning switch states into USB HID reports, layers, macrosQMK is just a very thick sandwich around those three ideas.If you want to build “your own QMK,” you don’t start with keyboards. You start with microcontroller firmware and USB.⸻Step 1: Pick a microcontroller and read its datasheet like scriptureMost custom keyboards use:•ATmega32U4 (classic Arduino Pro Micro)•RP2040•STM32The key requirement: native USB device support.Before writing any keyboard code, you must understand:•GPIO configuration•Timers / interrupts•USB endpoints•Flash + RAM limitsThis is not optional. QMK hides this pain; you’re choosing to feel it.⸻Step 2: Implement a matrix scanner (this is the soul)A keyboard PCB is usually a row × column matrix.Algorithmically:•Set all columns as outputs•Set all rows as inputs with pull-ups•Drive one column LOW at a time•Read rows•Repeat fast (≈1 kHz)You will write:•GPIO init•A scan loop•A key state bitmapThis alone teaches you more embedded thinking than most app devs ever touch.⸻Step 3: Debouncing (time becomes real)Switches lie. They bounce.You need:•Per-key state•Timestamp or counter•Stable-state confirmationClassic strategies:•Integrator counters•Time-based debounce•State machinesQMK has multiple debounce algorithms. Rewriting one is a rite of passage.⸻Step 4: Build a key event pipelineAt this point you have:•Raw matrix state•Press / release eventsNow you design your own internal API:raw_scan → debounced_state → key_event → actionThis is where you can do things QMK doesn’t:•Probabilistic chording•Pressure-aware timing•Contextual layers (editor-aware, app-aware)This is where creativity lives.⸻Step 5: USB HID from scratch (the dragon)Now the hard truth:USB is the real boss fight.You must implement:•USB descriptors•HID report descriptors•Polling interval logic•Key rollover handlingYou can:•Write USB by hand (brutal but pure)•Or use a thin USB stack (LUFA, TinyUSB) without keyboard logicThis is still “from scratch” in spirit—USB is a protocol, not magic.⸻Step 6: Layers, macros, and remapping (language emerges)Layers are just:•Lookup tables•Stackable keymaps•State-dependent resolutionMacros are:•Event playback engines•Timed HID reportsNothing mystical. QMK only organizes it well.⸻Where to actually learn this (non-obvious sources)Not “keyboard tutorials.” Those are downstream.Study instead:•USB HID specification•LUFA examples (keyboard + mouse)•Bare-metal MCU tutorials•Old AVR keyboard firmware (pre-QMK era)Then read QMK last, like reading a cathedral after learning how stones are cut.⸻A sharper insight most people missQMK is not a keyboard firmware.QMK is:•A hardware abstraction layer•A policy engine for input•A build system that normalizes chaosIf you rebuild it, don’t clone it.Design something smaller, stranger, and opinionated.For example:•A keyboard that adapts layout based on typing entropy•A keyboard that changes layers by time-of-day•A keyboard optimized for African language input patterns•A keyboard that treats macros as code, not sequencesThat’s how you go beyond “my own QMK” and into new instruments.",AltruisticSteak3952,2026-01-29 10:27:54,4,learnprogramming,t3_1qq414s,False,

The main difference is that TypeScript helps future you (or your teammates) read your code easier. All of the knowledge you learn in JavaScript is transferable. You’re not wasting time learning JS.

I will assume that in your stage of coding there are few things that keep you coding for long periods of time and at consistent frequencies *eg; Monday - Friday, 9 - 5*Find a point to motivate you to keep going, take breaks when you’re confused but COME BACK as soon as you feel it’s tolerable.

Add quality of life features6. \^Build internal tools to help with automation and testing such as a data generator.7. Improve dashboard and alerting capabilities. Check if there are any metrics you can track that will help alert you of any issues with your project. If none exists, create a metrics dashboard or try to get your team/company to adopt one from the various providers. You could even keep it simple and create a cron job on a linux server that executes a script daily to pull metrics from your logs and database to alert you of any issues.

They had to make multiple attempts and took much longer. Granted there are times I too get stuck and it takes me a bit.Turns out I have autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or audhd and at every job I leave, they have to hire three people to replace me and they still can't get the work done.They will not do it right the first time, they will not automate something if they have to do it twice.The result is that I constantly am able to get much more work done, and consistently keep getting more free time because I keep automating things.There's close to a hundred thousand people in our organisation, there are six of us like this in the company. We were specifically asked to join a new team, in addition to our regular roles, and we just solve problems no one else can understand. We automated that too.I spend a lot of time learning.Edit:Sorry, kids started fighting.

You should be aiming for code quality that *exceeds* the quality of your prior manual output, and you should always understand the details of how it all works - neither of which are very hard if you leverage the AI to do this (e.g. get it to refactor when needed, use other AI tools to review the code, ask for explanations).Most ""vibe coders"" don't do this, and that's where tech debt problems come in quickly.

Just a month ago I landed my first SWE job. There are definitely go guarantees, and it will likely take a while but its definitely not impossible. My advice would be to focus on 1. Projects: Building projects that you can talk about and show in some way, whether it be a demo of the project, a blog, or anything else. With AI you can pretty much just pick any topic you are interested in, find something that seems interesting to build and is within a reasonable scope and build it. Bonus points if its a product that solve actual peoples problems, product thinking is highly valued at startups. The goal is to show people that you have actually done stuff, and to be able to talk about it.2. Network: The most universal thing I learned after a year of searching for jobs was that pretty much everyone I knew got their job through some sort of connection and is also how I ended up getting my job, and this is doubly true in todays market. Network as aggressively as you can (not annoyingly but just a lot of people) and reach out to your own personal network. The cost is basically nothing other than maybe your ego, and the upside is tremendous, you never know who could be the one that has the connect, and people are very often happy to help. Definitely still apply to companies but don't spend too much time on it especially if you aren't getting much positive feedback. Your first job will most likely be from just knowing the right person (networking) and actually having something to show for your skills (projects).

I keep $100k in hysa just for a layoff scenario - it took 5 years to accumulate, which was tough at the time, but my anxiety level was greatly reduced. This hysa stack is seperate from stocks/bonds/401k/529/real-estate etc - those are not your emergency fund. Some people say $xxx in cash is too much - but thats not my problem. This is what I need for my mental safety net and you may need more or less for yours.My last layoff, I got $20k severance and 2 months where I was paid salary but could spend the time searching - and I luckily got a job lined up before the clock ran out. The time before, it took me 2 months to find a job, but severance was only $10k. So I had to dip into my savings, despite unemployment checks. You should look up the weekly max unemployment benefit for your state and factor that into your plan. TLDR: Layoffs are inevitable. Stressing and extra effort will not save you from it.

o2mneie,"Traditional engineer here (chemical, not that it matters)... turns out, USA vs. Europe area engineering or not that makes little difference. It looks like, checks the replies, a lot of software developers are just toxic regardless of where they live. A lot of you all are really arguing about stupid shit. Software development isn't a zero sum game, for US developers to win, EU doesn't have to lose, and vice versa.Do we chalk this up to people just being young? Do European posters in /r/cscareerquestions ALSO skew young and NOT actually employed as software developers, just like the US counterparts?Anyways, unlike many people here, I regularly during the course of my work, engage with large teams of European engineers. Primarily engineers from Ireland, Poland, and Germany. Ireland is unique, in that it also has a large diaspora of engineers from OTHER European countries. These have included multiple engineers from England, Spain, and France, and Architects from Ireland, Italy, and England.Two things that have helped dramatically, are: Persistent and clear communication. Both parties need to be patient, and be ""clear"" with their communication. English will be the lingua fraca, but all English is not the same. Focus on using COMMON, more likely to be known, phrases, words, etc. Avoid idioms that someone not from your country isn't going to know. It's REALLY common for native speakers/writers to go crazy with this and communicate in a way that is very difficult to understand. Simplify it down. Assume positive intent, if something SOUNDS off, it's probably a bad translation. Every language has it's own difficulties in translation to English. Above all else, patience by BOTH parties.The other, is absolutely when working with counterparts in other cultures, you HAVE to learn and understand what their leadership and accountability paradigm is, relative to yours. Do NOT assume it is the same way, at all, to yours. How people are led (do people DEFER to leadership, or INFORM leadership), how people are mentored, how people are held accountable, differs WILDLY between cultures; and, even within that culture, particularly in Poland I see big differences between junior and senior engineers. I suspect in that country there's a divide there too; if I had to guess, it's roughly the 15+ and above vs. the newer peeps. But, I don't fully understand, despite how much polish interaction I get.With that last one, comes ASSUME positive intent. Assume they WANT to get the job done, and done well, and seek to understand how and why they're behaving the way they are. A metaphor I like to use borrows from the old American story about the cherry tree and the axe. If ""Culture A"" was going to cut down a tree, and had 10 hours to do it, how many hours would they spend sharpening the axe?"" The polish would sharpen the axe, and a backup axe, for 9.5 hours. The Irish? They cut it down last week. My point? The spread between preparing for the act, and doing the act, varies wildly, and can be a VERY common source of frustration ALL around.Anyways, good luck.

Contracting companies put in a bid, one gets the contract, and then they have a cutover date when they will take over.Stupidly, many seem to think they can do the same job with half the people, half as qualified, find out they can't and then they need qualified bodies at a discount price.That's where you come in!

Once you have a few years experience there, look for jobs back home with contracting companies or actual companies themselves that support point of sale devices for merchants, do a few years of that.Then you have software, hardware, and point of sale support and you can do some social networking with local tech support companies and you might have better luck back home.The problem that I encountered when I was trying to break in, is I was competing with all these 40 year old people with 15 years experience that were moving back, and I just couldn't stand up against them.Now as it turns out where I am it is super rural, good help is hard to find, I found a great job, 20 min from my door to my desk, and it is a nice town; so I stayed, but I prefer a more rural setting.

I don't think that says that much about you. And for that matter, often times, issues with deadlines is not an individual dev problem, but a management problem.> And more than once, I had to (not by my choice, but it did sort of help once) go on weekends to catch up.I know the pressure can be hard to avoid, don't work weekends. It's common that deadlines slip and stuff takes longer than expected. It shouldn't generally be a ""work extra"" thing, particularly not for no extra pay. From a practical standpoint, I understand it if your job is on the line (the economy and all), but resist the pressure under normal circumstances.Overall, sadly, intern positions on solo projects aren't that uncommon, yet are obviously bad for the intern. Mind you, you also don't fit the typical case of an intern, as you are actually a new grad. I think the biggest thing to get used to is the idea that it's okay for work to not be finished. You're not actually being paid by task. And yes, solo projects are strictly worse for a new person (or arguably any person) in pretty much every way (hard to get help, isolating, more likely to have incorrect estimates, etc).

I know salaries are disparate between Canada/US but once you're making 150k+ you start to feel like you have all the things you need and more to live a happy live in a HCOL city in Canada. My friends and I are mostly in the 29-33 age range and are starting to think about where they'd like to settle down. They don't want to raise a family in the U.S. They don't want to be tied to a tenuous visa situation down south.TL;DR I think people that chase the money always will. But generally those people in my cohort jumped ship much earlier when it was easier to right out of school. Now we're all well employed making 150-200k in Toronto and don't see the need.,McKnitwear,2026-01-30 17:27:09,50,cscareerquestions,t3_1qrbmtw,False,

o2oodld,"In my opinion,You sound like me, 18 years ago. I kept chasing the dream and kept burning out and crashing. I wish I had been less stubborn and willing to listen to a mentor.I would recommend making the game development a hobby, make it for androids, and make it to fix specific table top game editions, like D&D.But I found that the more I worked at the fun, the less fun it was. Turns out I have a.d.h.d. and autism and if I had been able to be medicated through school, I would have been unstoppable.I was pretty bitter trying to find work in 2008-2011 in video games while learning and programming in C++ for ""the game"" I had in my head. Then once I would know what ""the game"" was, I would do some research and find out that someone else had the idea and had already done it.That's when it hit me, the ideas are a dime a dozen, and everyone has them; it's being able to make it into a reality and get it to market faster than the competition that gets the money.The secret, kookily enough, was watching the movie ""the secret"" and saying to myself ""If I am always saying that I am burned out and there are no jobs, then that is my reality"". So instead I said ""I am a positive person, pleasant to be around, I love people, and there are lots of jobs I would enjoy (each of those was a lie)"".I just had that mindset and I just flipped the job search rules on its head and I just applied for everything that looked interesting. I had one resume, one cover letter, a few letters of reference, and then I just ""cold job applied"", or ""shotgun approach"". I just stopped looking at the job, the description, the requirements, and instead of stressing about if I qualified for a job or tailoring my resume and cover letter for one hour and then applying for one job in two hours, I did a blanket google search, opened up the top ten results in tabs, and just went through uploading my resume and cover letter to sites and applying for as many jobs as I could. Some were an email, some were uploading documents, some were transcribing into their web fields, so some took a minute to apply to, some took 20 minutes. I just applied and applied and applied.I ""knew"" everyone else was going to be tailoring their resume to the job, so instead of me doing that for each one, I wrote the cover letter like it was a personal conversation between friends and I sold myself as an amazing worker and someone they wanted on their team.I'd been applying for about a day before I got a call for a job where they were looking for a permanent full time position (but I didn't know that cause I hadn't really read the job listing). I had a 2 year technical diploma and had just finished my 3rd year of a bsc in computer science, I was on summer break...So I went to the preliminary interview and fucking nailed it with my positive attitude and my honest answers of ""I don't know what that is or how to do it, but I honestly don't know what I am doing with most things. What I know how to do is know when I don't know, I know how to look something up, and I learn fast"".They ended up hiring me for a summer rather than any of the other full time applicants that they had. I fucking love automation and I get bored easily. It was a tech support job for a software development company, so everytime I answered a question, I templated the response. There's really only 20 questions anyone could have about this software, and I knew what they were cause I had been doing templated responses from May to July.In July I asked to get some screen recording and captioning software to make some tutorial videos; I made basic, intermediate, and advanced video tutorials, published them, and the calls stopped.I had automated myself out of a job, and then I went back to school and finished my fourth year.I had a competitive job offer from them half way through the year, full benefits, to come back and work for them. It was a great company, it got acquired during covid, but I did basically the same thing for them for 3 years before moving on.I just kept looking at something that had to be done more than once and figured out how to automate it.The moral of this story is sometimes you have to run before you can walk. Successfully selling yourself and taking initiative to do your job and improve everything, rather than just collecting a cheque allowed me to develop a specific set of skills.I work for a much bigger company now, ""work"" is a strong term. I do tech support and am on a team with other people where we get sent problems no one can figure out how to fix. We figure it out, fix it, and automate it.I never would have figured that out without actually doing it.",I_IdentifyAsAstartes,2026-01-30 22:06:02,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1qrg9a0,False,
o2oj6r7,"I have, but not anything I think is impressive. I’ve made a very short choose your own adventure style text based web game, I’ve worked on some games in game maker back when I was in high school but I don’t currently have access to what I made since it was for a class on the school’s computers, made some simple Scratch games as well as designing a board game in that same class back in the day. For related art stuff I’ve made some animations recently (2D hand drawn digital animations) such as a basic looping character walk cycle from one angle and a few other simple animations, and I’ve also drawn some 2D digital art for a very brief unfinished game demo group project in university too but I didn’t end up doing any of the code for that one. I’ve also made the very basic typical low quality snake game almost everyone does at some point. Also I found out I kinda suck at 3D animation and rigging in Blender.I think I’m probably more interested in the creative aspects (game design/mechanics, visuals, story/writing, characters) than actual coding but maybe I haven’t worked deep enough into the actual coding parts to really know for sure. I think maybe everything I’ve done so far is too surface level to really have a clear picture currently.

ADHD does run in my family and I have a brother who was formally diagnosed, and every time I look into the symptoms of both ADHD and autism I relate to a lot of it. My only worry is the possibility that having formal diagnoses could lead to issues if I want to move out of the U.S. or cause discrimination based on having that on my medical record (more worried about autism as opposed to ADHD for that knowing how autistic people often get mistreated, seen as incompetent, and infantilized).",OssifiedAngel,2026-01-30 22:24:41,1,cscareerquestions,t1_o2oodld,True,

o2h16s5,"Day-to-day work isn't necessarily going to have much to do with deep AI in most big tech orgs, especially if your target is within the realm of full stack. Full stack is frankly usually frontend leaning w/ some backend (think frontend who needs to deal with BFFs due to GraphQL or SSR), and ""full stack dev AI stuff"" isn't really a thing, in the sense of multiple specializations in one person. More typical is ML people dabbling w/ backend-ish things (often poorly) and other traditional roles (backend/frontend/etc) interfacing with each other through API contracts, which is just bog standard software engineering.LC is useful to the extent that you get to practice certain types of coding skills and patterns that CRUD/glue code development doesn't necessarily expose you to, but it isn't strictly necessary if you deal with things like graph traversal or memoization in their glorious raw forms (aka not relying too much on libs to do DS&A-ish things) on a semi-regular basis.

o2igo0s,I disagree that full stack dev AI stuff isn’t a thing - a lot of people are integrating gen AI into their applications usually with RAG and vector DBs being low hanging fruit.

You generally still defer to ML people if there's data set training or what have you etc.And like I said, IME full stack isn't really a know-everything role in practice, candidates for these roles simply don't have that level of depth.

o247kt4,"We have done that before, but the circumstances are a little strange. For one thing, we are replacing someone who we really liked, but jumped ship after a few months because they got a better offer. Manager is feeling gun shy. Also, the second person is really, really good on paper. They both have the technical skills, but the second person has direct experience in our industry at the highest scale possible. So even though they’re not available for two weeks, we’re willing to wait to interview them.",Slggyqo,2026-01-27 23:48:35,1,cscareerquestions,t1_o246oj0,False,

o39etz9,"I'm in the same town as Anduril HQ, definitely is a HCOL, is not as expensive a SF Bay area but in the last 2 years some residents that rent have been priced out, the rent increases are shocking. But with that TC you will be fine, it's a really nice weather, safe and clean area, seems they are moving to Long Beach.It's admirable what the founder has achieved and the success he has had but I don't like his politics and purpose's narrative, seems extreme and too beligerant.There is an Anduril sub where you can ask more Qs.",SrDevMX,2026-02-03 01:05:38,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1qucdvl,False,

o39dg22,I say it’s worth it. Try to keep your expenses low and you’ll have an extra million dollars in savings in a few years.,culcheth,2026-02-03 00:57:44,1,cscareerquestions,t1_o39cdgg,False,
o390ytf,Tbh bro it happens. I would just move on. I bombed an interview a few weeks ago and couldn't explain how to consume an API in Angular. I just forgot since I haven't used it in a while and wasn't expecting the question. I bombed some other questions too. Ofc they rejected me. Now you'll be even more prepared for the next one.,xXChr0nicX420Xx,2026-02-02 23:49:35,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1qu9quf,False,
o3925e6,"Feels like the cards are all on the table. They said they want someone strong in React, you're presumably not that strong at it. They probably already got the gist from the interview, and it'd generally be pretty unusual for a thank you email to sway that impression.With that said, you can write whatever you want in that email. If struggling w/ technical questions was the highlight of the session, there's probably not much you can say to salvage the situation, but if it was a case of you fretting over an imperfect performance while there were other topics where you felt you did well, you could maybe harp on those to reinforce your strengths.",lhorie,2026-02-02 23:56:00,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1qu9quf,False,
o31migt,"This is spot on and something I wish I'd understood earlier. spent my first year obsessing over whether to learn Vue or React while my friend was making bank building wordpress sites for local restaurants The ""perfect code"" trap is real - clients literally cannot tell the difference between a $50 theme you customized well vs something you built from scratch, but they can definitely tell when their contact forms dont work or the site takes 10 seconds to load",FabullousMirth,2026-02-01 21:39:58,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1qtbd0i,False,
o32xoy7,"From my experience jumping into all sorts of gig jobs with different stacks, including stuff outside of web dev, the non technical parts cannot be glossed over. Getting enough momentum to make a good income with freelancing, takes the order of years. I had enjoyed most of the projects I got into, and most clients were easy to talk to, but there's so much you gotta plan and do ""off hours"" just to keep the money and future money rolling in. The sales part is probably the toughest for most programmers trying to go freelance. Without this you'll never see growth. I don't think scouting for sales prospects and building leads is for me, but that's okay, it's not for everyone.",TalesOfSymposia,2026-02-02 01:54:31,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1qtbd0i,False,
o31n981,"Exactly, the same happened to me. With my developer ego, I always thought native code was faster or more scalable, but I ended up spending hours debugging things that I could’ve delivered three sites with a simple page builder in the same time. You can still get really solid results with WP without relying on plugins by customizing your theme, so it’s not about cutting corners. Now I save native code for projects that really need it...Glad we’re on the same page.",OkMetal220,2026-02-01 21:43:35,1,cscareerquestions,t1_o31migt,True,
