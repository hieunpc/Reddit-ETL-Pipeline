There's simply so many more people with those skills today then there was 10-15 years ago.10-15 years ago, finding someone who could code was more difficult than today, so companies took whoever they could find and gave them a good salary to do a lot of tech work. As smart phones and social media and e-commerce were still relatively new and starting to boom, these companies were just getting off the ground and needed someone, anyone, who could code. Those folks wore many hats in their job.5 -7 years ago, as more people graduated college with CS degrees or did online bootcamps in hopes of getting these coding jobs, these companies found that they could be more selective in hiring. Okay, they found plenty of people who can code, but how many of them can code and interpret all this data we have? Thus the hiring direction narrows the scope of candidates.In the last 5 years, we again see so many people getting CS degrees, learning to code, bootcamps etc. that companies can again be even more selective in their hiring. Okay, they found plenty of candidates that can code, can interpret data, and have AWS experience, now can we narrow the list down to candidates that have specifically our industry experience?

I've had catfishers interview then a different person onboards. It happens, we just need to be better at detecting and stopping it. There will always be people who lie their way into jobs though. Just last week I interviewed a guy who seemed to be using AI to craft his answers. Although some answers were obviously not scripted, and he seemed to know what he was talking about, he still seemed like he was using an AI interview tool. After talking to some of the recruiters familiar with his region of the world it was apparent that this was VERY common and candidates felt they had to do it to stay competitive. We had a follow-up interview where we told him that we all use AI tools in out jobs and that we can't fault anyone for using them, but we wanted to hear his answers unassisted. We made it clear that it was OK to say ""I don't know"" or ""I don't understand the question"". The interview went much better. There was some language barrier and he didn't understand all the questions as asked, but when clarified he was fine and gave good answers. When he didn't know something he said so. It turns out his resume was real, he did know what he was talking about. I think going forward we will address the use of AI, let them know it's ok for some aspects of their job and even for helping them interview. We also need to get good at asking the right questions.

o2a1koq,"I prefer to build streaming first. It's not about the speed for me. First, it's about control and localizing failure. To use your examples; If I break up the CSV putting each row in it's own message, process each row one at a time, and one fails, that row fails, not the whole CSV. That way I know exactly where the problem is and my users have access to the data that is not wrong while the issue with the failures gets handled. Slapping a CDC implementation gives me a stream of all the changes to the relational database not just the end state when the incremental job ran. If the load drastically increases the streaming system gives me a buffer without having to scale my workers unless the load sustains past my data latency requirements. I've seen incremental jobs like that lock up a worker using all the memory because it was suddenly getting back much more from querying the relational database than it had been designed to handle. It couldn't process anything until those workers got scaled up.Second, I think you pointed out something with the fact that you're doing streaming on one system and batch on another. You now effectively have two different types of systems you're maintaining. If you go Kappa architecture as opposed to Lambda architecture you only have one type of system and that simplifies your operational overhead. Even if streaming is harder to operate, you end up ahead. I've never personally found a streaming system more operationally difficult but people do. If you're only going to have one kind of system, I think it's easier to put a batch of work on a streaming system than to try and micro-batch your way to approximating a streaming system.Lastly, and this is more personal, I like to think of data pipelines in a functional programming or even unix shell scripting model.

Instead .replace operations you use assignement. Strings and datetime gets some changes as well as categorical types. Some changes with pd.read_excel as well. Slicing and a lot of your operations need to be explicit now instead of implicit. Whats going to bite you the most is numpy rather than pandas here.Second Answer:Use polars + pandas, especially once you get everything setup in arrow types, its a seamless transfer of the dfs; while working with my team I use polars for the heavy stuff like merges, concats and stuff.

Once you have an initial chunk of code that does what you want, parameterise it and stick it in a function. Then write some tests for it, ideally. A parameterised notebook is not all that different from a very lengthy function. You just want to separate the code in your notebook into functions so that each function is doing a single thing and returning/producing a single thing.It will be slower at first because you're rewiring your brain to use a new process and interface, but you'll get faster and the benefits can be great if you're doing anything that's a deliverable and you want some quality assurance.

I don’t know if its right - only time will tell:-1 - get really good a defining and documenting for AI and business. How do I get an Agent to accelerate my work via context and not code. How do I show others the value I’m generating via acceleration of skills and effect using LLMs. Outcomes are all that count - 99% success but no value to business or customers doesn’t count as a win. 2 - the technology moats will come down. Oracle tech stack isn’t going to be a thing in 2 years. You’re a plumber of data and the stack/implementations matter less as the coast of replacing them is coming down at a huge rate. Tech debt suddenly has way lower interests rates. 3 - get good at big data again. Small stuff is gonna be usurped - that’s light work for a LLM. Big data is going to be hard because of cost and time. Start with YouTube - it’s a mess of influencers and hype men but there is some gold in there. Microsoft have a bunch of free GitHub learning on AI, ML, Big data on their repos. https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners is one. But they gave many. One thing to remember - the AI coding hype cycle has been around for 2 or so years of any value. You are still smarter than AI for sure. It can just type and think faster than you.

o29kh4v,"Agreed with other comments that this comparison doesn't make much sense, but just to go into a little more detail as to why...BigQuery and Athena are both serverless cloud offerings. BigQuery abstracts away storage *and* compute. Athena abstracts away only compute, as you need to connect it to your object storage, but fundamentally, it's at least a little similar as an offering. You're not managing infrastructure with either of them, and they'll scale up parallelization to whatever level is necessary to ensure you get query results back in a reasonable amount of time. Because they're both built on serverless billing models, costs are very high on a query-by-query basis, but this can still be competitive in a real-world scenario if you have relatively low daily utilization.Compare that to DuckDB, where you're using dedicated hardware with an embedded, columnar database. It abstracts away nothing - you're providing the hardware for storage and the hardware for compute. This is radically different. It works well at small scales, and because you're managing everything, it's great for heavy utilization and is extremely cost-effective on a query-by-query basis. It's also not distributed at all. Once you scale up past what a single machine can handle, you have graduated from DuckDB and need to move to something that can distribute the workload and handle scale.Fundamentally, they're different tools solving different problems. So when you run a benchmark with 20 GB of data, you're using a very small scale of data that DuckDB is built for and which BigQuery/Athena are not. Because there's no downtime in benchmarking, you're also simulating what is effectively 100% utilization, the least favorable scenario for a serverless billing model. Of course DuckDB is going to end up looking good.The way to meaningfully compare them on cost, at least, if you were for some reason trying to decide between these different options, would be to look at a simulated full month of usage. The hardware you're running DuckDB on costs \~$1500 for a month on EC2, or maybe \~$7500 in up front hardware costs if you have it on-site. You'd need to run \~1700 queries a day on BigQuery to get a similar monthly bill, or \~13500 of the narrow queries on Athena. You could certainly cut your hardware costs for DuckDB by a lot for this workload, but also, are you running 13000 queries a day?",InfluxCole,2026-01-28 18:52:46,4,dataengineering,t3_1qon39x,False,

The main python asset imports those helpers and then executes the actual logic of batch processing the extraction and loading to our datalake (hive configured).For transformations, we have mostly moved away from python to sql since we can directly query external tables created from our hive datalake. But we still sometimes use python for the first layer where the data is weird file formats (like grib, netcdf, etc.) that require special processing - in such cases we read the files, convert to a dataframe, and then materialize it in our dwh. Our data platform's own built-in python materialization automatically handles incremental strategies and variable injections.There are also very rare cases where data needs to be processed in a way thats not possible with sql - for example decoding airport weather reports like metar/taf, which require special python libraries to decode.To answer your question about frameworks - we write functional code with very minimal object-oriented programming. For my team the rule of thumb is that a single python file/asset should contain all the logic tied to a single data entity/table/model. We never use notebooks (unless for quick local testing and adhoc stuff). In some cases, we extract different data from a single API endpoint, so for those cases we create a separate agent/helper to connect to the API and configure the parameters - this is the only case where we use a bit more oop.",uncertainschrodinger,2026-01-27 07:02:32,7,dataengineering,t3_1qo49nt,False,

You might also consider adding in some basic orchestration to this project just to demonstrate you’re able and to understand how orchestration is handled.

o2fm7bs,"Hi, a few things to consider.\- Data Talks Zoom Camp uses GCP, whereas Data Engineering by Joe Reis uses AWS. Even though the cloud technology you use doesn't matter much to learn the concepts, it's still better to start with what you are interested in. \- Zoom Camp is semi-structured and felt all over the place with some GitHub content, YouTube videos, past Cohort links, etc. For someone like me, it's very easy to deviate and lose interest. \- Joe Reis's course is well structured with a lot of optional material and paired with the Fundamentals of Data Engineering as the course's textbook. The assignments follow a similar structure to other Andrew NG's courses. Not too tough to pass. But, still a lot to explore and learn. \- ZoomCamp is free but uses a sponsored orchestrator. The deeplearning course uses Airflow, which is considered standard. Of course, there is Dagster and a few other tools gaining traction. So, this is not too significant either. \- ZoomCamp is tweaked and updated every year. But the DeepLearning course stays the same. But since it's a very recent release, it still covers the most popular tools and concepts, such as Lakehouse architecture, dbt, text data processing for AIML workloads, etc. \- ZoomCamp has a strict deadline to get the certificate. You will still achieve it if you start now. I assume the score weightage is mostly on the capstone project.

A lot of the videos are reiterating a lot of content from his book (Fundamentals of Data Engineering). It goes over a lot of the soft skills that a good DE needs, but less so on the technical side. His class spends a lot of time within AWS and you do pick up some skills with it, so it's not too bad, but I don't feel like it was sticking with me after the class was done.Personally, do a few of the DataTalks zoomcamps - it has you writing and doing more than the other courses. And since the zoomcamps can occasionally miss some steps, it will force you to either interact with the other students or hone your research skills in order to make things work correctly.Lastly, you can go back through the DataTalks github and look at previous cohorts - they change up their tech stack some.

You already made a partial ""list"" in your post. And then implement these one by one. Does not matter if you make a UI first, a database first or a backend/API first. Then it is just however you test that the thing works, it differs. With database you have to use SQL queries. With API you have to use REST calls (unless you use something other besides REST). etc. The order does not matter in your case.Yes, there is a system design and architecture and such in real life projects and some things do have an order, but you are just figuring out how to implement a thing and how a stuff works. Do not consider how the things are done in the real life. Before you haven't made a working app.And yes, there are many decisions before you write a single line. The same way there are many decisions before you lay the first brick when building a house. You can't just lay bricks anywhere you want or however you want. Software development has a planning phase. But this is where the splitting it all into pieces and putting into a list comes in. Why I mentioned it in my first paragraph. Create a list of achievable micro-goals and start implementing these one by one. Your app is an ""app"" (e.g. a mobile app)? Cool. Pick some totally random tutorial for getting the most barebones mobile app up and running. If it is not an ""app"" as a mobile app but a web application then pick a simple ""Hello world"" web application tutorial, to get it to return ""Hello world"" when run. If your application has a graphical side then get whichever ""canvas"" type working first. And then just add features on that canvas.",mandzeete,2026-01-26 08:10:39,5,learnprogramming,t3_1qn9sxt,False,
o1smrq0,"“Measure twice, cut once.” A few hours of planning out your architecture, pipelines, UI, etc can save you days or weeks of refactors down the line. Once you’ve done that. Others have suggested specific design document formats but I think the most important thing is to have something you can use to guide your programming. It should be detailed and specific enough that you could hand it to an experienced programmer and they’d have enough information to start implementing.I’d also suggest having a concept of an “MVP”, or “minimum viable product”. What’s the absolute minimum set of features that constitute a version of the idea that you’d be happy with? Start with that, add the rest of your ideas afterwards.I personally find that it’s easiest to start with something that I can actually see working, so for example in your budgeting app you can start with a page that displays your budget overview. Where does the budget information come from? Don’t worry about that yet, just add some hard-coded numbers. Once you’ve done that pick a number that you want to be “real” and build that, hooking it up to the UI. Now you have one real field and a bunch of fake ones. Pick another field to actually implement.

o1sv0a4,"Some of the methods I have seen over time: * Identify then build the core functionality first. * Build an MVP.* Write down sentences that are simple statements about the process you are trying to automate.* Write down the user journey.* Take a sheet of paper and outline all the objects. * Take a sheet of paper and outline all the functions.What it all comes down to is that you design at least part of the app before you code the app, although often it is also a process that goes back and forth. The other day I was coding a game and about halfway through I realised that the graphics library I was using was too slow for the game I was making. I had to swap to a different library and luckily (this time!) my code did not contain many assumptions about how the graphics work, so the swap was relatively pain free. **Write down sentences that are simple statements about the process you are trying to automate:** E.g.: * The app tells me how much money I have left. * I enter something I have bought.* I enter something I wish to buy.* What I have bought has a name and a price.You can think of these as questions you need to answer. If you were the budget planner for a large organisation, there would be questions people would continuously ask you. If you wrote those down and for every question you wrote down how come you know the answers, you would have the beginnings of a system.Real processes used by real people can tell you a lot about what your app must be able to handle. If you start with ""I would like a steak cooked by a Michelin level chef"" you are probably going to get there slower than if you start with ""what goes into a really good steak and who can tell me this?""**Identify then build the core functionality first:**If you want to start a website that can handle a billion requests per second, start with the code the takes then dispatches the requests (load balancers). For a much quieter website you would probably tackle other tasks first.If you want to make a game in which you fly a space ship, fight pirates and trade goods, make sure the ship handles well (i.e. the interface in which the user spends 95% of their time). Figuring out what the core functionality is though can be the real brainteaser.If there are parts of your app that are a known quantity (i.e. others have already solved this bit and documented their solutions) and parts that are not, the latter might be a good candidate. What is your USP, what makes your app stand out from the others?Example: [how the video game Lemmings was designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5-lH3lZqrg) (YT, 4 mins).",brankoc,2026-01-26 11:32:51,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qn9sxt,False,

I've been assured by every exec ever that anyone can build apps with LLMs now... /sAssuming we're talking web applications, after I've got the spec/requirements down I've always liked to start with the data. So I will usually design database schemas to 3NF and write the DDL. I can then use this to bring up a database instance. Then I write a quick DML seeding script. Then I put together a server application in whatever language I've chosen. I've been around a while so I've written a good few auth/perm systems so I have code for that in JS/PHP which is usually what I'm using. Then I work on the back end API, adding things I need as I go (e.g. job queues, caching, etc.) Finally, I put the client together (personally my least favourite part, maybe why I do it last if it's me doing it). There's usually no reason you need to do back/front in any particular order and it's common to do them in parallel too (different teams etc.). I do think that starting with the data, which flows through the entire app, adds a certain clarity and certainty to things, but really anything goes if you don't mind lots of going back to revise.My ""plan"" is usually my thinking beforehand and any diagrams I've doodled, as we don't create formal design docs as part of our process. We gather requirements, write software, document the result. I will put effort into writing a technical design doc if I'm handing it off entirely though. I basically short-circuit the written spec part if I'm also the implementer.For a personal project, I think the answer is to just think, and make whatever notes/doodles you feel are necessary. How do you want to distribute/deliver it to users? What data is needed at what point? What interactions? How do you want interactions to go? How do you want it to look? Do you need common things that a framework would be able to provide? Etc.Things that you haven't considered will usually present themselves. Things you have considered will change.

o1p9rob,"> it demoralizes meFirst up, school has misled you on how easy it is to learn new things. They didn't mean to do it, but they did. What do I mean by that? You spend years slowly spiralling your knowledge and understanding of a topic over years, probably for 12 or 13 years at the minimum. As such, when you are introduced to a 'new topic', it's 98% old knowledge. It is built on structures where a lot of the new thinking is given to you and slowly removed bit by bit until you are doing it yourself. This teaches you are taught that learning isn't really too hard, and you should be succeeding almost immediately before moving to the next topic. When you learn something novel it's not a slow progression over years, it's probably a logistics function of logistic functions for each topic. That is, the initial concept is pretty easy, then it becomes hard as fuff where you feel like an idiot for ages, but you eventually learn the concept and it gets easy. But, because you are constantly learning, at no point do you ever feel like a master, or even competent. I firmly believe that 'good' programmers are people who accept that they will always struggle stuff that they are just learning and can realise exactly how much they've learned. So, what's the lesson for you?- Accept that you might need to take smaller steps, and that's okay. - After you learn something, make your own version of the questions/problems, and solve them as well. If you can't do that, go back to their questions and just change one small thing (like a variable) and write down what you think will change when you run it and then run it. Document if it runs the way you thought, and if it doesn't, keep playing until you get it. Then move to two things, then as many things as you can. - Think back to other things you've learned and ask yourself if you can incorporate those things as well, if so (and you probably can), make your own versions of those problems. You'll likely find that giving yourself that space to learn how to solve those problems will mean that the next step will be easier.",AUTeach,2026-01-25 22:00:10,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qmlfi8,False,

That said, if you did do changes to your code without these before, you can improve code quality without. I am saying this, because it can seem that you are not allowed to improve code quality before you learn about two or more different things. (But since unittest is build into the standard library, maybe give it a try and write some simple tests for the functions you change!)\- ""but I’m worried that even then it will still feel messy"". Yes, it will still feel messy, but thats just the first step, that enables the next ones. Its a journey and while the goal ""tidy code"" can be helpful as motivation it can also be overwhelming. \- Talking about ""proceeding in steps"": A simple technique that can help is identifying sections in code, lines that belong together. Give these sections a comment saying what the section does. Then try to pull out that section into a function. The function name now can take the task that the comment had: It tells what happens, without the need to reading the whole function. Try to make the function only rely on the parameters you pass to it instead of ""global state"" (also called a ""pure function""). This makes the function easy to test and to understand. This might not always be easy, but at least check if its possible. \- There are a lot of helpful texts there – [https://refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru) is a good online resource, Fowlers book ""Refactoring"" is also pretty helpful. Initially read them as inspiration, like browsing a cookbook, don't force yourself to use the methods immediately.

o27trby,"One of the things I like to do is not to factor into ""substeps"", but more like ""next steps"". Taking a big function and then making functions out of it often means that you're just switching between different functions, but have the same complexity. That's often actually worse.Breaking things down into ""input, process, output"" helps dramatically, especially if you can then extract the ""output"" to a separate method/object. If your big function makes a call to an API, does something with it, makes a call to another API, etc? Try to separate at those boundaries, or push things to the end. A useful pattern can be to gather up all of the changes you want in your function, and then apply them at the end.One strategy I've often used is to ""chop the tail"". What that means is finding the very last thing the function does, and then creating a new function at that point, taking all of the data it needs as parameters. You can then work through the function as a whole. This differs from the ""substep"" method because you can, when you make that final call, basically forget about what happened before that. If you call that last function with the right parameters, then the previous function was correct.

Took 1 year to find first IT job, 2 years to find first dev job. I was in similar shoes and my advice is what i've done.>I started posting on Twitter and committing to GitHub, but obviously nobody is watching. I don’t know if I’m supposed to keep doing this until someone magically finds me or if I’m doing it wrong.Is networking just talking to people online? Is it internships? Is it Discord servers? LinkedIn? Meetups? Or is it just something people say for the sake of saying? Networking is getting out and talking to people, not shooting messages into the avoid and hoping someone looks at your social media and goes ""this kids a genius"", thats not networking.You need to find meetup groups in your area and start attending, meetup.com. This is a good way to get out there but with networking, you get out what you put in.If you just go, attend, and don't talk to anyone, no ones going to know who you are / what you are doing tech wise and what you're looking for. So if you aren't socially outgoing, start working on that.>I kind of feel like I wasted most of college procrastinating. Now I’m doing DSA and web dev, but its late-very late and I know it. Also I’m from a tier 3 college and people keep saying if you’re from a tier 3 college you basically HAVE to network or no one will even know you exist, so no one will give you a chance.I had similar experience, didn't do internships, didn't really hit my stride until my senior year of college when things started clicking for me and i felt like i was finally getting it. So the issue is jobs currently want experience / proof that you have some semblance that you know what you are doing. You're not going to like this but my suggestion to you is to work for free for a while.You can either keep shooting resume's into the void for months / a year plus on end hoping for the best or you can get the experience you need to set you apart from your peers at similar points in your career.Sure, you'll find the rare hiring manager that says ""i dont care about experience, i just want them to be curious"", in reality a lot of hiring managers are kind of dumb, don't know what they want, and just pray they don't hire an idiot and the best way to do that is to find someone that has proven experience.Assuming you can build / deploy an app (i tutored college students online and you'd be surprised at the number of students who could barely build something in their senior year much less know how to deploy it), I would start with chamber of commerce website for cities near you that you'd be willing to drive to if necessary. So call it a 25-50 mile radius.From there, look for non-profits and call up their volunteer coordinator and see if they have any needs / opportunities to build software / automate something that they don't have the money/expense to spend on. Off the shelf software / monthly subscription based software isn't as expensive as it was when i graduated these days so maybe they are more inclined to pay for services these days, but you'd be surprised the shoe string budgets some of these nonprofits operate on.Often times they are taking paper applications and manually retyping it back into a computer which wastes time. They setup temporary shelters and take intake on paper where if they had a laptop there, they'd cut that part out.Look at rec leagues in your area and see if any of these rec leagues have a need for software to manage teams/schedules/rosters.

o21lfnq,"I learned C from books because I am old. ;) But more seriously: check the library for an intro to C textbook. Every one I've ever seen was at least a good intro.I wouldn't be too worried about being embarrassed in labs about beginner mistakes; that's what class is for. If you already knew C, the class wouldn't be helpful.Relative to other languages, it helps to understand C's memory model, because it's a lot closer to what actually happens under the hood in the computer and getting confused about it is the source of a lot of errors. So, in C, you have two places data is stored in memory: the stack and the heap. The stack is where any variables in your functions live. If you say `int number = 5;`, that puts a `5` on the stack (hey folks who actually know C: yes, I know about registers, keeping it simple to start with, yeah?). Generally, stuff on the stack lives there until the function returns, then *everything* on the stack for that function goes away. That's all the variables you declared in your function and everything passed into the function (all the stuff passed into a function, the function gets a copy of).The heap is where longer-lived stuff goes. You get a chunk of heap by going `int* pointer_to_number = malloc(sizeof(int));`. That gives you some int-sized chunk of memory somewhere, and what `malloc` actually returns is a *pointer* to that memory. Now, `pointer_to_number` is a variable (on the stack) that holds an address of something in the heap. You can treat the pointer like a number (if you try to print it and tell print ""it's a number,"" for example, it'll just be the memory address where the data is stored). If you want to modify the data on the heap, you can go `*pointer_to_number = 13;`. The star there means ""I want to mess with the stuff pointed to, not the pointer itself."" If you wanted to change what the pointer points to, you could go `pointer_to_number = pointer_to_some_other_number;`. Note the lack of a star.Now here's the place where people get messed up most often: C has no way to know when you're done with the memory `malloc` gave you. It needs *you* to tell it that. So when you're all done with the memory you got handed, you call `free(pointer_to_number);`. That will say to the memory manager ""Hey, that pointer you malloc'd me awhile back? All done with it; something else can use that memory."" If you forget to do that, when your function returns and the variables holding the pointer go away, the pointed-to memory can't be found anymore and you ""leaked"" it; that memory is stuck with a 'used' flag on it and nobody else can use it.The other thing about C is that it's a language with few 'guardrails' and makes it very easy to screw up the memory model or machine state. If you call `free` twice on the same pointer, you probably just break the memory manager and it'll do screwy stuff in your program from that point forward (modern operating systems give every program its own copy of `malloc` itself so you can't break the *whole computer's* state that way; worst-case-scenario, you can always quit the program and when it terminates all the memory it was using is properly given back to the operating system, including anything `malloc`'d). If you `malloc` a small amount of memory and then try to cram something big in there, C will cheerfully write the big thing past the end of the memory you reserved and clobber whatever's in the next chunk of memory. If you take a pointer to something on the stack (using the `&` operator) and then try to hold onto that pointer and then return from the function where that stack-thing lives, it'll get freed but your pointer will still be around and now it's pointing to the wrong thing. And probably the biggest foot-gun in the language: strings are just pointers to the first character of the string, so if you `malloc` some memory to hold a string and then forget now much you malloc'd and write a longer string than will fit in that memory, you will rip right into some other data in memory squirting random characters into it and you'll have a bad time.In a lot of ways, C is *way* simpler than other languages.

The Tanenbaum is probably the most famous, that's ""Computer Networks"" by Andrew Tanenbaum.There are also many great college courses covering computer networking with all of their lectures and assignments posted online. Simply going through one at your own pace may be a great way to get an expensive education for free (excepting the benefits of being able to ask questions). Good example: [https://sp26.cs168.io/](https://sp26.cs168.io/)One thing to be aware of: writing HTTP servers quickly starts to involve parallelization and running multiple threads, and then it becomes partly about memory sharing and memory management, and then you're learning about mutexes, and pretty soon you'll find that learning networking quickly begins to overlap with learning systems programming and operating systems.

There is where things like SOLID principles come in, such that applying those principles in your code design would generally make your code more robust.For example, suppose you wanted to implement abilities.You can certainly create every skill as its own class for example. An AttackSkill, a GuardSkill, a FireballSkill, and so on, such that when you execute a skill, your code can handle them uniformly and if certain skills have some unique properties, you could just override some parent logic and it probably just works.Or perhaps you might decide you only need a Skill class which takes an ID that references a table that describes the properties of the skill itself (eg: damage formula, animation, use conditions, etc).Both approaches are valid, and certainly allow you to add new skills to your game without too much extra work.If your game has complex skill interactions, it may be necessary to implement every skill defined by its own subclass because you have special logic for all of them. Perhaps you might come up with a custom ""skill effect"" syntax where you write them out in a text file and the game simply interprets it as you go.There is no particular right answer.

I see you mention wanting to be proficient in AppSec and AI, then it is important to understand that there is more to this than just the language. Many times, when in comes to the language it is just the tool you use to apply logic and with that said AppSec and AI both rely heavily on the fundamentals of Computer science concepts. Discrete math, Data structures and algorithms, operating systems fundamentals, networking basics, databases, etc. With all that said, the one thing you can look at that credentializes you while teaching you all the relevant concepts is a Comp Sci degree. Especially with your stated goals. If you can't get a degree, then focus on first building the foundation for a self made CS curriculum. Appsec in particular isn't just finding bugs in front end code, it includes threat modeling, devops and other infra principles, tons of code review, database management, etc. AI security is emerging in 2 forms. The first being red/blue team tradecraft oriented security. So hacking the models through prompt injection, data poisoning, first order attacks etc. The second form is securing the models themselves, which is actually more inline with the AI/ML engineer/MLOps skillset, the best way to get into this is to pursue a traditional AI focused CS program. Notice, how everything comes back to CS fundamentals. Not assuming you want to jump into a senior position, but security isn't really a beginner focused field. In order to do security properly, you need the knowledge of an engineer and the knowledge of someone who can actually break the app and recommend remediation. Lofty goals is what keeps us motivated, but I would break down your goals in meaningful steps and a meaningful timeline. To answer what you would use to learn programming and CS fundamentals, the only course that ever stuck with me was a ""bootcamp"" I took last year for $150 from exercism. They didn't even use a real language for the first half of the course, yet the fundamentals they taught have still stuck with me today. The biggest benefit from this course however was their discord where mentors were there to help guide you to answers on your own. After that I recognized my own shortcomings when it came to algorithmic thinking. I focused on the math and discrete math fundamentals, before jumping back into doing algorithm problems to improve my thinking.

o19oojb,"Yes and no.There's several layers to this question and your intuition to be sceptical is correct, but there's some small things in between.First: on the entity level, there are no ids. On the entity level, you only talk about relations between entities, not how you model that in Java or in the database. This distinction is important precisely because the materialisation may end up completely different than the logical view.Next, ownership. Ownership is a special case relationship that usually isn't really fully expressed in ER lingo. What we mean is: the owned object must not exist without exactly one owner. The owner controls the lifetime of the owned entity and must delete it or move it to a different owner if the owner is deleted. The reverse relationship may be of a weaker kind. Most many-to-one relationships are just to look something up in the parent, but in many cases you can throw those out by not having the logic on the child element.For real teams and tournaments you wouldn't have an ownership here because teams can outlive the tournament. Both would be full business objects that can exist independently.Now, that's the logical entity view, but you still have to materialise that in Java and the database. And that's where the trouble starts. If you simply give both Tournament and Team a slot of the respective other type, you can not handle them atomically any more. You need to create both and then link them. You need to break up the links before you delete them. This gives you all manner of nasty chicken-and-egg problems when dealing with constraints and temporal integrity of your data, so we usually avoid it where possible. It's even worse in the database, because now you can't but referential constraints on your data any more - again, because it needs to be in an inconsistent state for a very short time.It's even worse in languages with a ref-counted garbage collector. There, the GC will simply count how many times an object is referenced by others and so these circular references will leak memory if not broken up manually. Luckily Java's GC is not ref-counted, so that's one problem less.What you usually do for your specific problem is to move logic away from dependent entities. If teams cannot exist independently and you need information of the tournament, then the logic that acts on them should take the tournament and the team and sit outside of your entities as some sort of service actor.That of course would mean that any api endpoint working on players would need all three ids, which is stupid. Luckily that's where the separation of entity and database model helps us. Because one-to-many relations are usually stored inverted in the database anyway, in the database each team knows its tournament directly. In the entity view it does not. So instead of calling an accessor in Java to let JPA fetch the relation, you take a tiny detour and ask the database to look up the tournament (likely through a native SQL or similar query method anyway, but the thought counts!). That way your entity model can model ownership unidirectionally while the database can do what it does best.",aanzeijar,2026-01-23 17:01:59,2,learnprogramming,t3_1qkuhox,False,
o1aif82,"At the moment, it's hard to give solid recommendations on how to best structure your data. We don't know what operations you want your program to support (what 'verbs' you want). This in turn makes it challenging to figure out the best way of representing your data (what 'nouns' you need).I think this is a common trap for beginners: you start with nouns, trying to create a 'model' of some real-world scenario you're looking at. But instead, you should start with the 'verbs' you need and work backwards to figure out what you need to build to support those actions.Anyways, without further context, in this scenario I'd probably set up a SQL database to be the source of truth for your teams/players/etc -- maybe sqlite to start, to keep things simple? I would then run sql queries to perform steps like 'grab a list of all players belonging to team X during tournament Y'. There are two advantages to this:1. This side-steps your problem, since you can grab data in exactly the shape you need for each distinct operation, instead of being locked into one specific one. (In this case, your `tournament -> {teams, players}` shape)2. More generally, it gives us maximal flexibility in cases where my verbs are unknown.If you want to stick with your current structure, I would perhaps consider changing Tournament no longer store 'Player' objects and instead have those be stored under 'Teams'. The 'Tournament' class can then implement helper methods that iterate over teams to return an iterator or list of all players.Though granted, this is not perfect either, since a team could potentially belong to multiple tournaments, and a player could belong to multiple teams over time... To support this in full generality, you would most likely end up creating your own 'querier' abstraction -- basically a database, or something conceptually similar to it. So, we're back at square 1.> Is avoiding bidirectional relationships between domain entities generally considered best practice in this case?Bidirectional dependencies are usually suspect, yeah. It's not always a problem, but it's usually a sign that some common functionality could be refactored out, or that the 'shape' of the data is not quite clean. Having to keep both directions in sync is a bit cumbersome and potentially error-prone, and it's better to design our code to avoid having to do it if possible.> Is it more idiomatic to allow Team to hold direct Player references and rely on invariants to maintain consistency, or to keep entities decoupled and move cross-entity logic into a service/manager layer?If the data is fully immutable -- never changing after it's first created -- I'd probably be ok with allowing both Team and Tournaments to hold player references. To make this work, you'd want your 'Tournament' object to be a fixed snapshot of a specific point in time instead of the source of truth and handle updates separately.But if it's mutable, then I would prefer to avoid having duplicate references to reduce the odds of human error, where you accidentally break some invariant. (After all, the best invariant is no invariant.)That said, it's sometimes useful to have duplicate references in cases where it would materially simplify your algorithms or improve performance. But we would need to understand the desired verbs of your program first before exploring this path.",michael0x2a,2026-01-23 19:17:13,2,learnprogramming,t3_1qkuhox,False,

You start with microcontroller firmware and USB.⸻Step 1: Pick a microcontroller and read its datasheet like scriptureMost custom keyboards use:•ATmega32U4 (classic Arduino Pro Micro)•RP2040•STM32The key requirement: native USB device support.Before writing any keyboard code, you must understand:•GPIO configuration•Timers / interrupts•USB endpoints•Flash + RAM limitsThis is not optional. QMK hides this pain; you’re choosing to feel it.⸻Step 2: Implement a matrix scanner (this is the soul)A keyboard PCB is usually a row × column matrix.Algorithmically:•Set all columns as outputs•Set all rows as inputs with pull-ups•Drive one column LOW at a time•Read rows•Repeat fast (≈1 kHz)You will write:•GPIO init•A scan loop•A key state bitmapThis alone teaches you more embedded thinking than most app devs ever touch.⸻Step 3: Debouncing (time becomes real)Switches lie. They bounce.You need:•Per-key state•Timestamp or counter•Stable-state confirmationClassic strategies:•Integrator counters•Time-based debounce•State machinesQMK has multiple debounce algorithms. Rewriting one is a rite of passage.⸻Step 4: Build a key event pipelineAt this point you have:•Raw matrix state•Press / release eventsNow you design your own internal API:raw_scan → debounced_state → key_event → actionThis is where you can do things QMK doesn’t:•Probabilistic chording•Pressure-aware timing•Contextual layers (editor-aware, app-aware)This is where creativity lives.⸻Step 5: USB HID from scratch (the dragon)Now the hard truth:USB is the real boss fight.You must implement:•USB descriptors•HID report descriptors•Polling interval logic•Key rollover handlingYou can:•Write USB by hand (brutal but pure)•Or use a thin USB stack (LUFA, TinyUSB) without keyboard logicThis is still “from scratch” in spirit—USB is a protocol, not magic.⸻Step 6: Layers, macros, and remapping (language emerges)Layers are just:•Lookup tables•Stackable keymaps•State-dependent resolutionMacros are:•Event playback engines•Timed HID reportsNothing mystical. QMK only organizes it well.⸻Where to actually learn this (non-obvious sources)Not “keyboard tutorials.” Those are downstream.Study instead:•USB HID specification•LUFA examples (keyboard + mouse)•Bare-metal MCU tutorials•Old AVR keyboard firmware (pre-QMK era)Then read QMK last, like reading a cathedral after learning how stones are cut.⸻A sharper insight most people missQMK is not a keyboard firmware.QMK is:•A hardware abstraction layer•A policy engine for input•A build system that normalizes chaosIf you rebuild it, don’t clone it.Design something smaller, stranger, and opinionated.For example:•A keyboard that adapts layout based on typing entropy•A keyboard that changes layers by time-of-day•A keyboard optimized for African language input patterns•A keyboard that treats macros as code, not sequencesThat’s how you go beyond “my own QMK” and into new instruments.",AltruisticSteak3952,2026-01-29 10:27:54,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qq414s,False,

This search code can be done in very few lines of code - like, less than 20 - but it requires some non-beginner techniques, like recursion.

o241mr9,"> Is there a way along those lines to make both access and insertion O(1)To answer this specific part of your question: no, I'm not aware of any data structure that does this.One reasonably efficient way to support both operations is to use a [counted (augmented) balanced tree](https://tildesites.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/cs231/fall11/Lectures/10-augmentedTrees/augtrees.pdf). Basically, you can take any balanced *search* tree implementation (e.g. red-black trees, AVL trees, B-trees etc.) and give it a couple of straightforward modifications. First, you get rid of the ""sorted"" aspect of the tree, and change it so that whenever the tree is rearranged, elements just stay in their original insertion order. (This means you give up the ability to efficiently locate an entry by its value.) And second, you add a field to each node that tracks the size of that node's subtree.This allows you to perform both random-access lookups by index and random-access insertions in O(log n) time. Going from a node to its predecessor or successor is still O(1) amortized time, so iterating through the list in order is still O(n).",teraflop,2026-01-27 23:18:02,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qosorb,False,

US at least is extremely business friendly and if you buy the right business this can make you a very good living and if you are able to improve it/expand you may be able. to sell it in the future for a lot more as well.

You're trying to learn by doing the test over and over again until you pass, rather than taking the class. Not only is that a highly inefficient way to pass the test, it also means you're not going to learn the material on the way..> And I'll have to do two of these in under an hour?!?! Am I really just this completely awful at the job I had for so long, in the field I'm stuck in?Unpopular opinion: Yeah.Algorithms and data structures are an integral part of our craft. Just because we can often get away with not paying due attention to them doesn't mean that produces quality results, or that there will never be situations where they don't matter.If you were an accountant, I would expect you to be able to do so e basic math, whether all of your actual work was fine with the aid if a calculator or not, too.Furthermore, it's a test. It doesn't aim to, or need to, be a perfect representation of your work day. I would ask you to look for the video of Gordon Ramsey being able to butcher a chicken while blindfolded. Other than a stunt done for TV, it is a test of his raw skills. And even though few chefs will ever find themselves having to perform that particular task, I'd trust anyone who can do it more than anyone who can't.The good news is that any competent chef should be able to learn to perform this trick fairly quickly and easily. So, if companies decided that this is what chefs should do to get hired, no real chef should have a problem. (And, therefore, the test would work as expected: Filter out the vast majority of really bad chefs. That it also filters out some number of decent chefs that just can't be bothered with the parlour trick is not an issue for the restaurant.)",okayifimust,2026-01-29 07:58:52,10,cscareerquestions,t3_1qq1vea,False,

You should be aiming for code quality that *exceeds* the quality of your prior manual output, and you should always understand the details of how it all works - neither of which are very hard if you leverage the AI to do this (e.g. get it to refactor when needed, use other AI tools to review the code, ask for explanations).Most ""vibe coders"" don't do this, and that's where tech debt problems come in quickly.

o2c3rfh,"I graduated in December 2024 with a CS degree, some mediocre (at best) school projects, zero internships, and no idea how to navigate the job market. Just a month ago I landed my first SWE job. There are definitely go guarantees, and it will likely take a while but its definitely not impossible. My advice would be to focus on 1. Projects: Building projects that you can talk about and show in some way, whether it be a demo of the project, a blog, or anything else. With AI you can pretty much just pick any topic you are interested in, find something that seems interesting to build and is within a reasonable scope and build it. Bonus points if its a product that solve actual peoples problems, product thinking is highly valued at startups. The goal is to show people that you have actually done stuff, and to be able to talk about it.2. Network: The most universal thing I learned after a year of searching for jobs was that pretty much everyone I knew got their job through some sort of connection and is also how I ended up getting my job, and this is doubly true in todays market. Network as aggressively as you can (not annoyingly but just a lot of people) and reach out to your own personal network. The cost is basically nothing other than maybe your ego, and the upside is tremendous, you never know who could be the one that has the connect, and people are very often happy to help. Definitely still apply to companies but don't spend too much time on it especially if you aren't getting much positive feedback. Your first job will most likely be from just knowing the right person (networking) and actually having something to show for your skills (projects). Good luck, and message me if you have any other questions I think my experience has made me somewhat of an expert in the subject lol.",Fast_Nefariousness26,2026-01-29 02:11:23,25,cscareerquestions,t3_1qplarw,False,

What would be better though, if possible, would be to get a new job entirely.Most people move jobs for a salary increase, but another big part of it is the ability to sort of ""start over"" from step 1. Obviously if you're coming in as a senior engineer or something they'll expect you to onboard a bit faster, but you'll have that opportunity to start off asking those clarification questions and gaining that deep understanding without feeling like you're desperately behind. I've talked to other engineers about this exact feeling before and while some people boil it down to things like ""imposter syndrome"" the cold hard truth is usually that you actually aren't good enough at the moment. There have been critical mistakes made early on in your career that have stagnated your growth as an engineer and sometimes the best thing to do is simply acknowledge that you're in a position where growth is no longer possible and move on.Aka, you can try and fix the soil or you can just plant your seeds somewhere else. Both options are perfectly valid, but I've found that most people find it easier to improve with a small do-over period. It's a daunting prospect though I won't lie.Keep in mind this only applies if you want to be one of the giga-nerd seniors who seem to solve every problem and know every code solution. There's nothing wrong with just doing your job. Not everyone wants to grind it out and become an SME. You can also take your knowledge and look to pivot into management now that you're a senior. Less technical and more people heavy if that's your style. I just think you'd benefit from a new perspective is all.",No_Reading3618,2026-01-27 20:51:40,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1qnwwjl,False,

I'd recommend looking for contract work for projects in resource extraction areas. Think big mines that have 2000 computers that need to be maintained and also upgraded every few years.Having your degree (?) means you will have no issue with the software side and you will be able to learn the hardware side better. Once you have a few years experience there, look for jobs back home with contracting companies or actual companies themselves that support point of sale devices for merchants, do a few years of that.Then you have software, hardware, and point of sale support and you can do some social networking with local tech support companies and you might have better luck back home.The problem that I encountered when I was trying to break in, is I was competing with all these 40 year old people with 15 years experience that were moving back, and I just couldn't stand up against them.Now as it turns out where I am it is super rural, good help is hard to find, I found a great job, 20 min from my door to my desk, and it is a nice town; so I stayed, but I prefer a more rural setting.

Seek out contracting firms and recruiters, there's one on Michigan named Blue Chip. I'm sure your state has something like it.Finally, contact any careers department at your college.

The same way being the cream of the crop of marketers can be lucrative but it’s not for everyone. And as markets condense, squeezing out many, you’re unfortunately left with few roles, with cheaper pay, and likely more cause for nepotistic hiring.The difference is unemployment rates are sky high for CS atm, less jobs, and more applicants from senior positions from layoffs at big named places. So you have juniors and mids competing with seniors for lower paid roles.

No, you move before it affects your life personally.

Contracting companies put in a bid, one gets the contract, and then they have a cutover date when they will take over.Stupidly, many seem to think they can do the same job with half the people, half as qualified, find out they can't and then they need qualified bodies at a discount price.That's where you come in! You get to go pee in a cup and see if you can manage to get to a drug test without being drunk or high, and if you can, you get to go replace keyboards that aren't broken, screens that work, and generally throw out a lot of good equipment that ""nobody wants"" because someone else used it for a month.Once they figure out you can think, you will get called to ""blue screens if death"" where you turn on the second monitor and wonder why they are still running windows XP with all this corporate data, and in the network.You will get calls to figure out what is wrong with the computer that has some error on it that no one can tell you what it is, it says ""no ram detected"", but they can see the RAM in there, so it should be working, right?Don't forget the calls to unmute the executive microphones, dial phone numbers on touch screens; and turn on computers everyone said were on, but they were off (even though the blinky lights by the phone cable in the back are on).Make friends, hop jobs, hop contracts, (always sign the contract for the job you want regardless of what your current boss says they will give you, you can always decline of the boss comes through {but they won't}).After you've been doing that, look for work in your neck of the woods doing point of sale support and general IT for contracting companies.When you finally find the job you want and get, great, you will have lots of experience.If you are lucky enough to work at a place that has commute and they bus the workers in, bring a laptop and work on personal projects on the bus to and from work.",I_IdentifyAsAstartes,2026-01-29 07:47:46,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1qq10hb,False,

o1rnp6m,"Your resume has significant room for improvement I have some recommendations that could make a major difference in how recruiters perceive your candidacy.The most critical issue is your experience section. You have too many bullet points per role (standard is 3 to 5 maximum but since its one company around 5 is okay, maybe 6 if it’s really really worth it), and more importantly, they lack substance. When you write something like “Diagnosed systemic product-line defects, implemented robust fixes,” you’re not telling recruiters anything useful. What defect did you find? What made your fix robust? What changed as a result? Right now you’re describing tasks instead of demonstrating impact.Every bullet point should follow a simple structure: what you achieved, how you did it, and ideally with numbers to back it up. Instead of listing what you did, show what happened because you did it. Compare “Implemented automated testing” to “Cut deployment time from 6 hours to 45 minutes by building an automated testing suite in Jenkins that caught 80% of bugs before production.” One is forgettable, the other proves you deliver results.Your summary section needs to go entirely. It takes up valuable space without adding value, and it creates a wall of text that makes recruiters skip to the next resume. Remember, most people spend under 10 seconds scanning your resume initially. Every line needs to earn its place.With that space freed up, add more projects. Keep a rotating collection you can swap based on the role you’re applying for. Tailor them to highlight relevant skills for each position. Your current project description is far too vague and you’re missing an opportunity. If university teams are actually using what you built, name them specifically. That transforms a generic claim into proof of real-world impact.If you want to preserve some of the context your summary provided, move your skills section to the top. This immediately tells recruiters what you bring to the table and helps them understand everything else they read through that lens.Your formatting also has problems. Company name, job title, and dates should all be on one line for ATS compatibility. Include months with your dates, not just years. Separating projects from education will also improve scannability and make both sections easier to parse quicklyHope I don’t come off as too harsh.

I was getting ready to switch careers a few years ago and then decided not to after the market turned for the worst. I still lurk this sub sometimes in case things change.Right now my teaching career is actually peak. I’m so experienced that nothing phases me anymore. I know my curriculum like the back of my hand. I don’t even need to plan anymore and can just walk into the classroom with nothing but a topic I’m supposed to teach and I can instantly deliver an engaging lecture on it. I have a huge arsenal of assignments that I can use to match my lessons. Most of the assignments are auto graded and my workflow allows me to not take any grading home at all. The kids are good, never give me any trouble, and generally speak highly of my class. I make 115k doing roughly 1300 hours a year and will get a fat pension when I’m done so I don’t have to really save for retirement at all.HOWEVER.The first 7 years were absolutely brutal. That’s the period of every teacher’s career regardless of how smart or talented you are that you just have to grind out 9-10 hour work days 6 days a week during the school year just to keep your head above water. There’s no way to avoid it. Nobody tells you what to do, which is a good thing until it isn’t. Your main motivator to actually work this hard is that if you don’t actually deliver a good lesson, your classroom management goes to shit. No matter how good the kids are, if you start disengaging them or showing up unprepared, kids will eat you alive. They lose respect for you very quickly so you’re putting in the hellish hours just to make sure that you’ve timed everything out to perfection and that every moment is interesting (don’t forget your competing with TikTok brains these days).Oh and you likely won’t be able to teach all AP CS or whatever you’re interested in. You’ll likely have to teach 2 or 3 separate courses over the 5 classes you’re given, which means you double/triple the amount of planning you need to do for no extra pay.It’s an absolutely exhausting job that turns into a still exhausting but easy job after you’ve put in the first few years of hell.",vwin90,2026-01-24 21:10:24,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1qls87u,False,

I bartended previously, and tripled my income when I accepted my first job. fwiw I graduated in 2022 when the job market was more favorable - it still wasn't easy back then, and it is *much* more competitive now and it is actually very hard to enter the industry.That said, there is opportunity in this field, but you should know that it is extremely competitive and difficult to enter, and the work can be very demanding. When job hunting for my first role, being a mid-life career changer played to my advantage because I was up against 22 year olds with no attention span and no adult workforce experience, so I was an easy choice against them. Being in school was actually fun, I made great relationships with my professors. But the job itself? Not at all what I expected it to be. I love computers and I love building things, I like writing code and I like problem solving, I taught myself PHP when I was in high school and I got a 4.0 when I got my CS degree. The reality? This job is mostly meetings and paperwork and politics and all of that corporate doldrum, paired with high expectations for intellectual output from deep task work that you are expected to somehow find time for between all those meetings (or do at home after hours). You know that feeling when you were in school and it was exam day and your brain felt like jelly at the end? I arrive home every day feeling like that. This is only my experience, and I am only 4 years in at this point and this is anecdotal, but honestly I am actually considering switching careers again. Others surely have had better experiences. But for me- the job is insanely stressful, the constant pressure to meet a perpetually raising bar and always learn new things, the horrendous demoralizing job search process, the on-call expectations and non-existent work life balance boundaries, the corporate politics hunger games, the cognitive dissonance of contributing to immoral corporations, the inability to escape AI, the constant anxiety of pip or layoff and the stack-ranking... the list goes on. My financial life has improved considerably, but my health in literally every other way has gotten considerably worse. I would love to take a more relaxed lower-paying job, but can't find one. I know that people love to say that engineers don't know how good they have it unless they've done manual labor or been in other industries, and I do think that is true in many ways. The money is insane if you can land a job at big tech and can be life changing, and it is true that many engineers seem to have no clue that they are rich and that this salary is not normal. But also, I was a service industry worker for over a decade, so I have perspective on being at a low income person and, well, I actually think I was healthier and happier and had it better back then. This is not sustainable but I feel like I cant leave because I don't think I'll have opportunity to make this kind of money again.

Worth checking out since you're already in spam mode anyway but need better targeting and customization. Beyond tools tho, get someone to review your resume.No-name school doesn't matter as much as you think if your projects are solid and your resume isn't getting filtered out by ATS for dumb formatting reasons.
