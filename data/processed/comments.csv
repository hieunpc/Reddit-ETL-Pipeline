o4swe8s,"Been in data since 2012. Few observations:What changed completely:- Infrastructure abstraction. In 2017 we were still debating Hadoop distributions. Now most teams never think about cluster management.- Analytics engineering emerged as a discipline. Beauchemin predicted DEs would need more SQL, but underestimated how much the transformation layer would specialize (dbt, semantic layers, etc.)- The 'modern data stack' hype cycle. Lots of point solutions that promised to solve specific problems, then consolidation as everyone realized 47 tools was too many.What stayed the same (unfortunately):- The gap between 'we have data' and 'we understand the business domain.' Still the hardest part.- Pipeline maintenance burden. Different failure modes now (API rate limits vs disk space), same percentage of time spent on it.- Stakeholder expectations vs data quality reality.What's genuinely better:- Getting started is 10x easier. A junior can have a working pipeline in a day instead of weeks.- The tooling for testing and observability actually exists now.- Version control for transformations is standard, not exotic.The 'Downfall' article was prescient about platform engineering eating some DE work.

What gets annoying with this, is we don’t want any of these intermediate models taking up space in our warehouse, so we have to use a custom post-hook on any end-state models to clean up the upstream intermediate models. It would be really awesome if you integrated this automatically. Let us use intermediate as a materialization strategy, and have them be autodropped once an end-state model finishes.

o3wwr5r,"A few forces are pushing modeling out of the center:* Storage and compute keep getting cheaper, so the pressure to model everything 'correctly' up front is lower.* Dimensional modeling isn’t valuable by itself. Its real value is allowing systems to adapt as business meaning changes over time, and that benefit is easy to defer.* Tech debt is real, and under delivery pressure the cleanup backlog rarely wins. Even when modeling could be part of the design, timelines usually cut it first.* Storing source data indefinitely is becoming common, which makes replaying historical transformations feel like an acceptable substitute for managing change semantics.* Data teams are increasingly embedded in business units. Without a central steward, consistency across domains erodes even when the same underlying data is reused.* AI increases speed and lowers the cost of repetitive work, which further shifts effort toward shipping and iteration rather than integration rigor.* The idea of a single source of truth still matters philosophically, but if leadership doesn’t care when numbers don’t line up exactly, it’s hard to justify enforcing it.The common thread is that modern data systems are optimized for reversibility rather than correctness. Cheap compute, infinite retention, replayability, and AI assisted iteration all increase tolerance for semantic drift. Dimensional modeling still addresses that problem, but its value only materializes when the organization is forced to care about consistency over time. Modeling is rejected in favor of these other mechanisms which isn't a better approach but it does align with the systems that are readily available.",123456234,2026-02-06 15:15:13,37,dataengineering,t3_1qxifq4,False,

Are you just writing one off queries on raw data to populate them? In my experience ad hoc reports are a symptom of a lack of good models (and pipelines that build those models) going into your BI tools. If that’s the case it’s a pretty easy sell to your line manager that building a proper pipeline would mean dashboards get built faster and have way more reusability.If you’re the solo data engineer, then you’re the sole authority and the only one who can explain why it is a problem. Have you raised this with them? If you’re just complying with the requests of things they think they want to see, then they’re gunna be stuck in a loop of forcing through ad hoc things - because it’s all they know.You mention being an excel support desk too - this definitely shouldn’t be happening - spreadsheets can be avoided in almost all cases these days (with some exceptions).

o3zggge,"My POV is someone who is closely following the work happening in iceberg, arrow, ADBC, data fusion, etc. These are technologies that are making data tools more interoperable and standardized which is what open here refers to.—-So back to my point: The majority of the disagreement here comes from how people are defining “open.” This doesn’t mean open source. If you pay attention to the current developments, it’s about open standards and moving away from “proprietary interfaces” to tools and formats that can talk to one another and in general, enable much more efficient data transfer. These two alone unlock many downstream applications!As a small example: warehouses bundled storage, compute, and proprietary file formats together. That’s where the lock-in came from. If your data lived inside a proprietary format (like in Snowflake), you were effectively tied to that engine.The thing that’s really exciting and evolving is the maturation of standardized components of technological primitives that many modern tools use today. Open table formats like iveberg and delta, arrow (as a shared in-memory format), ABDC for super fast data transfer ,and newer engines like duckdb and data fusion all are working towards the same future. They’re all open source, want to converge to open standards, and if used together, enable an “open data infrastructure”. Which means the engine you use for AI/ML, real-time applications, and BI can all be based on data that lives in one storage layer and yet, can be run in any compute engine. Developers can live in a world where you can work towards running local dev in DuckDB and prod workloads in Snowflake. Minimizing vendor lock-in to me is just the a small side-benefit.Vendors are still vendors. Nothing about this means tools like Fivetran+dbt are suddenly open source. The idea is that they operate on top of this new infrastructure that is less restrictive than the old warehouse model for the technological benefits, but also allows them to compete with Snowflake/Databricks/etc at a completely different angle. If engines are swappable, these big platforms lose a lot of their architectural leverage. Now the power and thing to control is the stuff outside of that (I will let you think through that part as an exercise haha). All of this to say, I try not to take anything with face value.

""what do these fields probably mean and what types should they be"" gets you 80% there way faster than playing detective.for actual pipeline dev i've been using claude code to scaffold ingestion jobs. not shipping the code directly but it's good at recognizing patterns for common sources like REST APIs or SFTP drops. still review everything but cuts initial dev time.what hasn't worked: trying to be clever with dynamic schema evolution. sometimes you want the pipeline to fail loudly when something breaks, not silently adapt and cause problems downstream.if you're on databricks, check out unity catalog's AI stuff for metadata enrichment. more governance side but still useful.",drag8800,2026-02-10 08:15:07,14,dataengineering,t3_1r0rt35,False,

Sometimes, teams decide to go with small improvements like standardizing ingestion and transformations, while sometimes they decide it’s a good point to redesign the whole stack.Where does most of your time go today, getting new data into the warehouse, or shaping it into something usable for reports?Thank you",Independent-Arrival1,2026-02-08 01:40:42,4,dataengineering,t3_1qyrqkz,False,

o4n3jm1,"Nice catch, that's because it is very similar. I actually informed pgoslatara (dbt-bouncer owner) [here](https://github.com/godatadriven/dbt-bouncer/discussions/501) . Cool guy!It tries to improve on multiple fronts ,mostly user experience (e.g. hyperlinks to problematic files, init command, pretty output , some SE better practices and of course leverage Rust speed and binary size), which are explained here: [here](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/faq/), in the 'How does dbtective compare to similar projects' dropdown. One of the improvements I wanted required a completely different architecture and [Rust traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html) were the perfect candidate.The simplest explanation of this architectural change is by example, comparing dbt-bouncers [`CheckModelDescriptionPopulated`](https://godatadriven.github.io/dbt-bouncer/stable/checks/manifest/check_models/#manifest.check_models.CheckModelDescriptionPopulated) rule (which only applies to models) with dbtective's \`[has\_description](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/rules/description/)\` rule, which can apply to all eligible dbt objects, for example \`sources\`, \`seeds\`. \`macros\` or anything that can be described (in the \`applies\_to\` setting). So in \`dbtective's\` case, one rule can be used to expect descriptions on multiple objects, leaving less work for the user.With this in mind we can set defaults that make sense (e.g. it makes sense to describe a lot of things so the default \`applies\_to\` setting contains literally all objects that can have a description field for the has\_description rule), but we can also easily remove or add objects if the project requires it, using the applies\_to configuration.These defaults I would like to eventually leave to the community or be fixed by asked the right questions in the init command.

Databricks/Spark SQL is currently very capable - it took a while to get there, but most things you can do on other platforms are there now. You said you need good RBAC - Databricks uses standard sql permissions and now has very good fine grained permissions including constraints and expectations for data quality assurance.

Use-cases that require real-time streaming take quite a lot of design and iteration to get right.That being said, Flink helps you much more than Spark for real-time. State management is much cleaner, and you have much more control over the streaming pipeline. Also, it's so nice having real streaming and not ""micro-batches"".In our case, Flink was used by a software engineering team. They use Java, as it was the language they already used.We then tried to adopt it with a Python DE team. Turns out, PyFlink is quite limited, and does not really offer the power you would want from Flink.

I'd say without a doubt you made the right choice to focus on SWE over DS. The thing you actually get in DS is about Statistics-with-programming and how to properly employ research against data. All good things, not really what we're concerned about with DE. 2. Since you're in SWE and looking at design patterns, keep in mind what it would be like if the only thing you had to care about was the data inside the objects. A lot of folks coming from a SWE background focus on the abstract object versus what is contained by the object. To move to DE you have to care a lot more about the latter. 3. Things that will be evergreen in DE: python, SQL, databases, warehouses, data modelling (although the meaning of this varies person to person, company to company, much to my chagrin). Focus on these. Python at an expert level (focus on the data packages. Polars, Duckdb. And DB packages. Pscyopg, etc.), at least 1 RDBMS 1 NoSQL and 1 DB system you're just interested in, SQL to an expert level which will give you passable knowledge for most Warehouses as well. 4. Tools that will be evergreen in DE: Airflow, Docker, GitHub, K8s. TOML/YAML as well. DBT is very good to know as well. 5.

o514svl,"The way that I have ended up managing Data Infra in a couple of roles now is by being able to rapidly produce a prototype. You'll want to pick up, and use regularly, systems like Docker and Kubernetes. Even for your own small data projects. This will introduce you into that world where those things are heavily used. These are also cloud-agnostic meaning no matter what service provider your future employer(s) use you'll be squared on this front. In the same vein are things like VPCs and general networking which I spend more time debugging than anything else in DE/DataOps. After that you can get into the specifics of particular platforms. As far as practicing is concerned: Start with `docker`. Learn the ins and outs of taking arbitrary python code you have and stuffing it into a container. Learn how to find images, how Dockerfiles work, run into the issues so you can troubleshoot them. Then see what it takes to incorporate tools you may be using to develop your code into the dockerfiles. Things like `uv`. If you can have one system managing both your local dev and your container builds you have less points of failure to troubleshoot. Then grab `k3s` for local development. This is, notably, ""actual"" kubernetes. That is opposed to things like minikube which are ""kubernetes in docker"". Nothing wrong with that, but when we're talking about ""rapid"" prototyping, k3s is as close as it gets to just managing raw k8s on your local system. You'll probably immediately want to grab `helm` as well. Read up on `k8s`, `k3s`, `helm`, and `kubectl`. Play around with trying to get your docker containers that do things or expose things up onto k3s locally. See what it takes to setup `postgres` on kubernetes, and how to expose it so you can communicate with it externally.Outside of those things, which are more typical of `self host first` shops, you can likely find playgrounds around specific tech. I believe `databricks` recently opened up a playground of sorts. Snowflake may as well, but I don't honestly remember. Google on `GCP` used to give you like $300 in credits, plus they have the open BigQuery datasets you can mess around with. I think all of these things are secondary or tertiary things to focus on though, as they are mostly provisioned and managed for you from an infra standpoint. It's not bad to see what the platforms look like behind the scenes, though!I find Data infra specifically very interesting.

o4g8f1g,"Howdy. Twenty-five-year-professional, thirty-eight-year passionate programmer here. I think you're feeling the right feelings but you might lack context.I used an LLM this weekend to knock out some database code. We have models (sqlalchemy talking to a Posgresql database), ORMs, and then GraphQL interfaces to fetch that data. So I had a collection of A's and I needed new collections of B's and C's and the interfaces for them. I described the problem to Copilot, and it did the work for me by creating new files, each of which was a 90% rewrite of an existing file.You see the problem already. ""Why do you have to rewrite 90% of a file to do something as simple as 'a collection, but for a new type of data?' Because our abstraction is bad.But here's the thing about software engineering in a professional setting: *the abstraction is always bad.* We are, forever, solving real problems real people have, balancing correctness, speed, and maintainability. As a programmer passionate about the profession, I want to push maintainability *all* the way to maximum.I am not paid to do that because it impacts speed. So we write enough abstraction to do the job and we limp it along until it becomes too burdensome to maintain.You see code as art. And it is! I love creating a beautiful abstraction that cleanly describes and solves a problem. I do my best to write that code in my hobby-time outside work. But problems in the real world are not clean, they are often ill-described, and the deliverable solution is, as a result, messy and tricky to maintain. We can and do refactor, but not until we're *very* sure that the problem domain is so well-defined that hiding it behind abstraction to make it less verbose and error-prone will be worth costing us the flexibility of writing everything long-form. You don't write clean code to solve the problem every time because you don't even have a clear picture of the problem you're trying to solve. But each possible solution clarifies the problem and gets you closer. And LLMs, it turns out, are *great* at recognizing fuzzy patterns and applying transformations based on that.If you treat code *only* as art (which you can choose to do!), you'll get paid like an artist. I'm not gonna tell you not to.But solving real problems for real people usually requires writing mountains of bad code fast. LLMs are great at that. They're also surprisingly good at fast analysis of bad (overly verbose, redundant, ill-fit to the problem domain) code and creation of more code fitting the pattern. Which means someone's real problem gets solved faster.No surprise people are gravitating towards that, because people have problems and want them solved.My advice to you is to keep the passion. The algorithms *are* beautiful. Code *is* art. And, as you've already observed with your peers, letting the AI spit something out you can't understand and putting it in production is just the Sorcerer's Apprentice enchanting the broom to carry water and then letting it go.But... Your mastery of craft will take you further *with* AI because you can use it to write code faster than your fingers can, and that gets real solutions into real people's hands faster.And programming and computer science is about the algorithms, but software engineering is about solving the problems human beings have right now.Good luck out there.

So if an AI generates results that are only 10% significant, a human can review them and find lots of good stuff. But if we blindly use AI results that are only 10%, 50%, or even 90% accurate, we're liable to get nasty surprises 10%, 50%, or 90% of the time.So my take is that blindly putting AI on autopilot has its problems, but using it as a search tool to find results we wouldn't normally find on our own is not so bad, provided we review all its results.",SpaceAviator1999,2026-02-09 18:18:33,14,learnprogramming,t3_1r07bq2,False,

Basic is such, well, a basic language that it read so much like english and i could just, as a 3rd grader without a compuer, read the book and follow the programming examples, and I picked up basic programming just by doing that, just as if one reads a book about math and learns math.I mean how simple is:10 PRINT ""What is your name?"" 20 INPUT $NAME 30 PRINT ""Hello, "" + $NAMEI didn't even know until a year later in 4th grade that the home computer we had had basic installed on it (QBasic specifically) and I could actually write these programs. By then just by reading the book i understanded it as simple as basic algebra.You really do have to start with spending some time reading code and trying to make out what it does before you jump in. It's not so much about what the code is, but 'why' the code is. What is this code trying to do? Why did they write it that was as opposed to some other way you have seen?

Which is true but it's also the least interesting reason they exist.Think of it like this. Right now with functions, you're passing data around like handing a folder to different people in an office. ""Here, calculate this."" ""Here, validate that."" Works fine. But the folder doesn't know anything about itself. If you change what's in the folder, every function that touches it might break and you won't know until it does.A class is giving the folder a brain. It knows what's inside it, knows what you're allowed to do with it, and can refuse things that don't make sense.Now that's great and all but let's think about this from a real world problem... say you have three types of reports. With just functions you end up writing process_sales_report(), process_inventory_report(), process_hr_report(), duplicating logic every time. With a class you define what a Report is once (it has data, it can be processed, it can be exported) and each type just fills in its own specifics. You swap behavior without rewriting structure.The honest answer to ""when do I actually need them"" is probably not for small scripts. But the moment you have two things that are similar but not identical and you're copying functions and changing variable names, that's the signal.

There is a lot of setup, saving of files, formatting a report/GUI & overhead to a script that does this.You get it working and it's great.Then - someone says ""Make it work against Timu"" or eBay or some other shopping site.If you wrote linear functions - all the special code that deals with how Amazon displays & stores things is all throughout the code. It takes days or weeks to find all the spots in the code to convert to Timu.But if you had used a class to deal with Amazon - all the logic to deal with the Amazon web site is in a single class.

o43ifda,"You got some very good explanations already.OOP makes more sense with larger projects, not with smaller, one off ones.Yet, I always like to use something tangible, something everybody knows: a playing card and consequently card games.Let's look at a playing card (e.g. a Poker Card):A card has (the attributes/properties/fields):+ A suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades)+ A rank (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, Ace)+ A face (the image)+ A back side (another image)+ A state (face up, face down)+ Maybe, a numeric valueWhat can a card do (the methods):+ Display itself - face or backside depending on the state+ Report its suit and rank (again depending on the state)+ Be flipped - face up to face down and vice versa - the state changes in that methodWith the above, you have a (more or less) full description of a card. If you leave the suits and ranks out to be filled later, you even have a *generic card* from which you could derive different cards, e.g. Poker Card, Uno Card, Skip Bo Card, and so on.In card games, you are always dealing with a *Deck* that holds a number of cards.Again the attributes/fields:+ the actual cards - a collection (list) of Card instancesAnd the behavior - the methods:+ A deck can be shuffled+ Cards can be dealt from the deck+ A deck can report if it is empty+ A deck can be initializedHere, you see that the deck doesn't need to know *anything* about the exact card type to function. The only time it needs to directly deal with the exact card type is during initialization - here, it can be filled with a set of Poker, Uno, etc. cards.You can then move on to a *Player* who has a *Hand* and determine their attributes and methods. Then, a *Discard Pile* (if needed), open cards, and so on.If you define all these classes well, you don't need to change much code (apart from the initialization of the deck) to produce various different card games, as the actual *business/game logic* will be completely separate from the cards, deck, players, etc.The *reuse* factor is one of the most important parts of OOP. You do not need to rewrite much code if you want to use your classes in different use cases.

o445nem,"> Struggling to see the point of classesDon't overthink OOP. Classes are just a different way of looking at code and data.> I end up solving everything with functions. Functions call other functions, and the project works fine.Great that is exactly how any program work. There is no other way actually. The difference is how you look at functions together with data. You may actually code in an OOP style without ceating any classes at all. It all depends on what functions use what data. If you pack a set of functions together with a set of data and limit other functions from this data then you're basically coding in an OOP style.> If functions get the job done, what problem are classes really solving?Classes are useful because they tie data and code together in a very visible and safe way. With a class you can create a group of data and functions that work together and you can protect the data from changes from other functions outside of the class. You can also make the data work as one unit or object and tie operators to the object making it easier to use. This may seem trivial in a small program but in a large program with hundreds of files you can isolate the use of data and you don't need to check all files for usage.> This has become a big hurdle for me because almost every take home assessment or practice project I see either requires or strongly expects the use of classes, and I just can’t seem to wrap my head around how or where they fit.This is not difficult. Just look at the problem from a data point of view. What information is needed and belongs together. This pack of data is a class. What relations does the data have with other data. How many of each are there. What changes to the data is needed, these are the functions, or methods in OOP, that take the data as one parameter.Hope this helps you on the way.",Sbsbg,2026-02-07 17:49:58,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qyg54i,False,

o49yaqp,"This is one of those opinion based things so people may disagree but here is my list.1. Learn to communicate well! This include written and verbal communications. Frankly in college this was a huge challenge, more difficult than just about all other courses I took. In the corporate world it can be more important than really understanding what you are doing. Yes that is sad.2. Learn to navigate at least two Operating Systems from the command line. This includes multiple tools that these OS'es deliver.3. SCM! Yes git and github are extremely popular these days but in the corporate world you use what they currently have set up. So understand the hows and whys. 4. Docker might not be a thing, in fact there are plenty of jobs that never touch the web. As a programmer you may need to target platform specific applications. So don't dismiss native app development. This Reddit seems to be very web development focused but people need to know there are many jobs where programming skills might be leveraged.5. If you are not doing web development learn the default IDE for the platform you are working on inside out. With modern IDE's this can take as much time as learning Python. This especially with AI integration. So if you are programming a Mac, that means learn XCode, if you are programming a PLC. that might mean RSLogix. 6. Which brings up AI, learn to leverage it as a programmer to improve your productivity. This is entirely different than trying to implement AI features in an application.7. Learn Python even if Python might not be your primary development language.8. Speaking of Python, spend some time with C or C++ at the command line. This should be covered in the first few classes of a good CS program. The reason here is that understanding how compilers, linkers and such, work is important, especially in the future when the IDE breaks. Command line development might not be the norm these days but understanding how an app is built is still required knowledge.9. Keep you math skills up. You may go years not needing a particular math skill in your programming career, then one day somebody asks for a specific statistical result. Yes there are reference manuals and text to refer to but in all honesty rusty algebra can really trip you up. Some people believe mathematical thinking and practice helps keep you programming skill honed, I don't know about that, what I do know is removing rust can really set you behind.10. Someone else mentioned typing, this is actually huge. I literally learned typing in high school well before I could even get access to a computer much less buy one. Yes this was a teenager looking towards his future - shocking. In any event it is a skill that makes the job much easier.11. Take an assembly language course as part of your college education. The point here is not to become an embedded programmer but rather to get insight into how processors work. In the past a good CS program required one quarter of assembly, in that case done on a emulator. These days you could just as easily buy a small microcontroller system and learn there.12. I touched on this above but when it comes to computing systems, the world is much bigger than delivering web apps and in some cases these alternatives pay much better. So don't dismiss these alternative paths in IT that may or may not be programming heavy. Examples: Security, embedded programming, industrial automation, platform apps, network management, compiler development (because most languages suck), interpreter development (because Python has been taken over by mad men), API and SDK development, test and validation, SQL (databases) and so forth. Others can add to this list, ultimately this should be an FAQ someplace. 13. Have a well defined minor. Lets face it programming as a skill by itself is not going to be a huge career driver. Rather it is how you apply those programming skills to solve problems. While a weak example if you are doing web development a minor in business might be a big plus. If you are going to be involved in embedded as stronger background in electronics can be helpful. If you want to work in the optics industry a strong physics background should be considered. Actually a strong physics background can help for many paths in a programming career.There you go a bakers dozen. I suspect the most important point above is to avoid this idea that programming means the web.

That code doesn't change so you only need one copy of it.

The *object* is the concrete implementation of the class. (Think of it as the *class* being the blueprint for a catalog house and the *object* being the actual built catalog house). The *class* only *describes*/*defines* the general setup, while the *object* fills it with data.There is another thing to consider: The implementation of OOP differs vastly between programming languages to the point that it is not even directly comparable (just take JavaScript, Python, and Java - completely different implementations of OOP). 1. In terms of programming an object is an instance of a class. - It's the *data/state* (fields/attributes/members) coupled with the *behavior* (methods) of a specific class (type).2. The binary data is scattered - the methods are stored in one place, and in one place only, no matter how many objects you create. The *state* (fields, attributes, members) are stored somewhere else, typically, but not necessarily, in contiguous memory blocks, individually for each object (apart from the exception of `static` members that also only exist once in memory). This is a very efficient approach as the data is usually a lot less than the methods.3. It is not actually that different. In some languages even structs can have methods - so the line blurs depending on the language. In a way, structs (as the structs in C) are the predecessor of classes.4. Methods are functions that belong to a class - it's basically just terminology. When a programmer talks about *functions* they mean *unbound functions* that exist outside the context of OO. When they talk about *methods*, they always talk about ""functions"" that are bound to classes and that only exist in the context of OO.The difference between function and method is: `len(string)` vs. `string.length()` - the former is a function that exists outside the context of classes and objects, but can accept an object, and the latter is a method that exists in the context of the `string` instance of a class.It's like ""please draw me a fish"" (""draw"" being the function and ""fish"" being the argument) and ""fish, please draw yourself"" (""fish"" being the object and ""draw yourself"" being the method called).",desrtfx,2026-02-10 15:51:39,15,learnprogramming,t3_1r13f94,False,

The C language had not even been written at this point. All of the boundaries that you're imagining were gradually defined over the next half century, and they are all domain specific.

o4n11hn,"I don't know Rust, but I know C++, so I'll explain it in that syntax, but the concepts are universal.I warn you that if you look at objects too low level, the concept itself dissolves. Consider: class person { int weight, height, age; public: void jump(int how_high), run(int how_far); };In memory - whether it's on the stack or the heap, it going to lay out in memory per byte something like: [w][w][w][w][h][h][h][h][a][a][a][a]This is the same as if it were a structure. Objects are programming concepts - when you get down to the machine, it's all bytes - bytes for data, bytes for addresses, bytes for offsets, bytes for instructions...As for the functions, that gets compiled into the program binary, just like any other function. The syntax dissolves at the assembly level - to call the interface, you have to build a stack frame and push your parameters. One of the parameters is going to be the location of the object instance in memory - the hidden `this` pointer. So just as you have to push how high to jump, you also need to push who is doing the jumping. Again - the machine just sees program instruction sequences - bytes, and more bytes, and more bytes.Yes, you can directly replicate what the compiler is going to generate for you with a `struct` and a function that takes a pointer, but why? The syntax is there to facilitate what you already want to do in a more concise manner.But also, programming constructs are MORE than just syntax. C++, Rust, ANY language is more than just a high level assembly. The language defines the confines of what these things are, and the compiler is allowed to exploit everything else. In other words, stated more concretely - C++ has a SHITTON of Undefined Behavior, it's kind of notorious for it, but that's a GOOD thing, because everything the language doesn't say, the compiler can exploit for optimization. We want as much of that as possible, and then we can wrap those dicy corners with the standard library so you don't have to deal with it directly.The hard part is cultural - getting people to use the facilities provided and stop writing raw imperative code that gets them into trouble.> What is an object in terms of programming? An object is a user defined type, that models behavior, by encapsulating state, to protect it's invariant.So an `std::vector` is always implemented in terms of 3 pointers. The invariant is that those pointers are ALWAYS well defined. There is no intermediate state that YOU the client can ever observe. You also don't actually know how the vector is implemented, and you don't have direct access. You defer to the vector to enforce its invariant, and it's behavior is well defined through its interface. When you hand program control to the vector, it can suspend it's own invariant - say, to reallocate, but that invariant is reestablished before it returns control.So objects have a certain level of autonomy and agency. They know what to do, they don't need you to tell them how to do their job. It's why you employ classes in the first place, because that encapsulation keeps your program more correct and consistent.> How does the binary data and the methods in the class get managed at low level? Does the data get scattered in one place? Or it's just managed by pointers? Frankly it doesn't matter. No programming language gets that specific, because it's not portable.> How is an instance of a class that has no methods in it different from a struct type variable?Technically there is no different. Idiomatically, a class models behavior, and a struct is a tagged tuple. It's a conventional difference in meaning. Classes make for terrible structures. A car has some state, about the position of keys, dials, doors, etc, and the interface will open and close things, speed up and slow down... But NONE of that is dependent upon the make, model, or year. Those are variables that are independent. The same car can go by different names and makes. Is that a Subaru BRZ or a Scion FRS? Trick question, they're the exact same car made in the exact same factory as a joint project between the two companies.So if anything, you bundle your car model with it's pedantic properties in some sort of tagged tuple or relational or table structure.> How is a method different from a function that does some operations based on different values of its properties?At that low level, there isn't a difference. But any language and implementation can make the difference more significant. A free function and a public structure, you can do anything you want, and while you can do everything strict and correct, there's nothing preventing me from writing my own function that fucks everything.

o4z527d,"Like the others say, the structure is fine, especially for a program of this size. There are some things that you might wind up doing differently over time, especially in bigger projects. Which is to say, they can be considered overengineering for a program of this size & scope, but overengineering otherwise small programs can also be a decent way to learn about those engineering practices.*Avoiding ""magic"" numbers*: Your `else` case for the difficulty rating is meant to result in `easy` mode, but this can drift apart. If you decide to give `easy` mode 4 tries for example, then you need to update that number in two spots. There are a couple of ways around that, like storing the numbers in constants, e.g. `const int EASY_MODE_TRIES = 3;` and then using the constant rather than the literal number, and/or having an extra parsing step where you wind up doing something like an extra function that ends on `else { cout << ""Something…""; return EASY; }`, returning something like an `enum` of the valid difficulty ratings, or even a struct. Error handling and parsing user input can be kind of big topics with lots of options.But generally, magic numbers are a hazard for code maintenance, because it very often turns into questions like ""why is it _this_ number? can I change it? what happens if I do?"" and some constants with names and rationales go a long way to alleviate that.*More functions*: Generally we break code up into what's hopefully logical chunks. Often to avoid repetition, but also sometimes just to break up long reams of code into something more like a condensed sequence of subtasks. Opinions vary on how long a function should be allowed to get. My opinion is something like trying to be able to fit the entire function on the screen (but also not trying to bend over backwards to follow the rule), which I think is a fairly common middle-of-the-road opinion.There are also a whole bunch of C++ concepts and best practices that you'll kind of have to pick up over time; one that may be good to get you to look into as soon as possible is ""[const correctness](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness)"".",syklemil,2026-02-12 13:17:14,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r2p4i0,False,

The important thing is to not tell us what the code tells us, because here's the thing - typically such comments and code disagree. So who's the authority? Which is right? The code?

Perhaps your next lesson will introduce functions to you, and this will dry up. std::transform(difficulty.begin(), difficulty.end(), difficulty.begin(), ::tolower);There is a bug here. It's really technical and subtle, and I don't fully understand it myself, but the [reference documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/tolower.html) warns you this is unsafe, that you need to write a function that casts your character type to `int`. random_num = rand() % max_num + 1;This is the same in every branch of your difficulty condition. Just hoist it out and write this code once, after the condition block. std::getline(std::cin, guess); // Take guess as string user_guess = std::stoi(guess); // Convert string to integerToo many steps! Streams know how to extract integers! Your problem is interleaving extraction with line grabbing.The rules of extraction are:1) Ignore leading whitespace2) Start grabbing characters3) Stop at some delimiter character. Leave the delimiting character behind, in the stream.The rules for line grabbing are:1) Grab characters one at a time2) Stop when you find the delimiter character, discarding it.So imagine first extracting an `int` - something like `"" 123\n""; the stream purges the leading whitespace, grabs ""123"" and leaves ""\n"" behind. Now you line grab, and what happens? We grab ""\n"", which is our delimiter, and we stop.So the thing to do is know when you're switching between the two, and `ignore` the newline as necessary. int x; std::string s; std::cin >> x; std::cin.ignore(); // Purge after extraction, before getline std::getline(std::cin, s); std::getline(std::cin, s); std::cin >> x; // No purge necessary after getlineAnother thing you should be doing is checking your streams. A stream is implemented as a ""user defined type"", which are made from `class`, `struct`, `enum`, and `union`. One of the things you can do is ""overload"" almost any of the language operators. That's how `operator >>` and `operator <<` - the bit shift operators, are made to work as stream extraction and insertion - they're written as functions that work with stream types. And when you learn to make your own types, you can write your own stream operators for them without having to modify the stream class itself - the pattern is extensible.Continued...",mredding,2026-02-12 15:35:47,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r2p4i0,False,

That obviously looks a little weird.I determined the cause of this was the fact the function I was calling to get the model wasn’t new model and was a shared reference or a shallow copy of a model. Now this were a copy constructor would have been very handy, but it didn’t seem to have one nor did the model class have the copy method implemented. I ended up writing this kinda ugly piece of code using reflections to solve it. It only needs to run once as it caches the model, so it isn’t too bad performance wise, but the code is ugly.

o4oziu0,"First thing to know: there's no such thing as a copy constructor in the Java language. It's not a built-in concept. It's just a common pattern for doing stuff. If you have a constructor, and use it to create a new Whatever that should be just like some other Whatever, that's a copy constructor. The Java language does have a related and more built-in thing, which is called ""Cloneable,"" but you can and should mostly ignore it.What exactly is a copy constructor? It's any constructor for class Whatever that takes a parameter of another Whatever and tries to make this new Whatever exactly like the other Whatever.When should I actually use it in real code? Whenever you want there to be a new thing that is a separate thing from another thing but has the same value. ""Make a copy of this thingy"" is a very common, basic operation in a lot of situations.what problem does a copy constructor solve? It lets you make copies. There are lots of ways to solve that problem, and copy constructors are one of them. Other ways involve factory methods, cloneable, and just creating a new thing and setting all of its properties with setters() for the new thing and getters() for the old thing.",captainAwesomePants,2026-02-10 21:59:32,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r1bztr,False,
o4pxgsa,"Copy constructors are functions that need to be executed to create a valid copy of an object.For objects like integers, their copy constructors are trivial - just copy their bit pattern to new memory location and you have a copy of the original.But this is not generally true for all objects. Some objects really do need to run some code to make a valid copy, because they internally manage some resource. As a simple example, consider a list. The list object itself usually doesn't directly contain its elements. It contains some kind of reference to separate memory which stores the elements. That memory is a resource it has to manage. Stuff like allocate new memory when you insert elements, free the memory when the list itself is being destroyed, etc.If you were to just create a bitwise copy of the list object, now you'd have two list objects, which are expected to manage the same memory, probably not knowing that the other one exists. This would lead to some serious memory safety bugs. What you actually need to do, when you want to create a real copy is to run some code that allocates the new memory for the second list, and copies over the elements.

And at that point basic DSA and other stuff you've learned may look like kindergarten knowledge to you but from most lectures I've attended I can tell you that the base is absolutely crucial. If you can figure out the proper data structure(s) for your system/sub-system, the algorithms will follow without you having to explicitly design anything beyond business logic operations. And one of the most important statements I've learned is that whenever you're building something - a small project, a system, a library, an api, etc. think of it as ""Everything is a __"" where the __ is basically a morphable entity that you design from scratch. And the entire system can essentially be considered a single unit of that entity, even though it's made out of the same entity in smaller scales. This is where programming paradigms help alot. For example in Java, everything is an object. What is an object? For that you must know the details of OOP - which is just another programming paradigm. I can recommend https://roadmap.sh/ for a quick progress tracker as it covers the majority of this sphere.Lastly, having a mathematical mind is crucial to programming, because getting desired results from any given problem through programming can be achievable via brute force in the worst situations. But solving a problem in an optimized manner requires a ton of math and math oriented thinking. Because taking shortcuts and cutting corners is what makes your code precise and fast. This is where your knowledge of DSA can be applied in smaller scales - competitive programming problems from sites like Leetcode are extremely helpful and will give you a good grasp of what to do in most situations.",ReedxC,2026-02-10 07:54:05,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r0t9ne,False,

Sometimes the tooling available feels a bit like using a pair of wrong-handed scissors, some languages feel like they're full of [cow tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_tools), and that feeling will vary across people.

Many tutors and computer science professors have already developed an algorithmic mindset, so they often dive straight into teaching specific languages and syntax. In doing so, they sometimes overlook the root of the challenge: learning how to think like a coder.In my opinion, when you're a beginner facing a programming problem, you should first grab a blank sheet of paper and ask yourself: 'How can I break this down like a cooking recipe?'For example, if I asked you to write a function that returns a boolean based on whether a number is prime, you could map it out like this:>Function isPrime(n):>If n≤1 then:>return False>If n=2 then:>return True>If n is even then:>return False>For i from 3 to SquareRoot(n) with a step of 2:>If i divides n then:>return False>EndFor>return TrueOnce you’ve done that and you’re confident in your logic, go ahead and write the code in the language you're learning. If you get stuck on the syntax, just look it up. Remember: syntax is just a matter of practice and habit. The real hurdle is training your brain to think algorithmically.It might seem a bit silly to use pen and paper for a simple function like this, but I promise you that after a few weeks, you’ll develop a real knack for deconstructing problems.

You end up wiring libraries together without understanding failure modes, limits, or trade-offs. That is not machine learning competence.Start by separating Python from machine learning. Python is a tool. Machine learning is applied mathematics.First phase: foundations.You need linear algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues), calculus (derivatives, partial derivatives, gradients), probability (distributions, expectation, variance), and statistics (hypothesis testing, bias/variance). Without these, concepts like gradient descent, regularization, overfitting, or loss functions are opaque symbols. Use textbooks, not shortcut videos. Expect months, not weeks.Second phase: Python as a numerical language.Learn Python only to the level needed to express math. Focus on:Core syntax, functions, loops, list/dict comprehensionsNumPy for vectorized computationMatplotlib for visualising functions and error surfacesIgnore ""Python for ML in 10 hours"" content. It trains imitation, not understanding.Third phase: machine learning from first principles.Before touching scikit-learn, implement algorithms yourself:Linear regression from scratchGradient descent manuallyLogistic regression with your own loss functionk-means without librariesIf you cannot derive the update rule on paper, you are not ready to code it.Fourth phase: libraries.Only after the above should you use scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow. At this point libraries accelerate work rather than replace thinking. You should be able to predict model behaviour before running it.Rules to follow:Avoid tutorial playlists that jump straight to neural networksPrefer courses that derive equations before codeIf math feels uncomfortable, that is the signal you are on the right pathExpect frustration; ML is not a ""learn a library"" skillBottom line:Machine learning is mathematics implemented in Python.

o4sh4bk,"""Refactoring"" isn't a magical tool that'll fix bad code - I honestly don't get why it is being taught like that, or even why someone would think that.Refactoring is simply a set of tools that you can use to more or less automatically restructure your code, if you want it to be written in a different way, like if you have one big function you want to split up in multiple different ones, if you want to rename variables, or change the input-parameters of a function across all uses. That is what refactoring is - it isn't something you can wave around that solves your weird memory-allocation scheme into something more professional.Anyways - first you plan how the code should be structured, you probably need to diagram something for this, as you won't be able to remember. You plan which classes you need, and which methods they should contain, what those methods should receive and return, and so on. You decide if some methods should perhaps be closer together in a single class, to keep coherence high, and you decide if some should receive fewer data-structures (or objects) to keep coupling loose ...Also, you make sure that you have valid tests that can run for both the un-refactored and the refactored code - if not, you write them along the way.Also, create a new branch for all this work, as you'll without a doubt break something!Then you begin - usually the steps are somewhat like this, but there's never a perfect recipe:1. Split functions and methods up into smaller parts2. Create additional classes and connect them3. Move functions / methods to their new classes4. Change globally available variables to locally where needed5. Change method parameters and/or return values - perhaps introduce new objects to be received and returned.Between each step you test, and once the tests pass, you commit - then go on to the next step.That is basically the way. Refactoring *never* makes the code ""better"" or ""faster"" from the computer's point of view - it is usually still the exact same lines of code that runs, but they are structured better from the programmers' point of view, so that they'll have an easier time implementing new features and changing functionality!",peterlinddk,2026-02-11 12:49:27,3,learnprogramming,t3_1r1uk7i,False,

We HATE loss, so we're susceptible to things like the sunk cost fallacy. So to save some of the cost you've put into this code base, to minimize your losses, you try to make a minimal change. It's usually not robust enough to be a total solution, it's a hack or bandaid.

I have 37 years of mistakes to inform my design decisions without having to consciously think about it - that's called intuition. This may be new code, but I've already made up my mind about it 20 years ago, when I had to learn that one thing the hard way... So refactoring is so hard because your system is too tightly coupled and does not tolerate refactoring. All software systems have their limitations, nothing is infinitely extensible or refactorable or perfectly decoupled. The difference is how far you can go before it starts looking like bandaids or hits the hard wall that you need a redesign.One form of refactoring is short-sighted, where what you have is ""over-fit"" (borrowing from my data analyst wife), too tightly coupled, not flexible or extensible, it only does exactly what it was designed to do, and how. So what you end up doing is redesigning the thing with YET ANOTHER over-fit solution.Another form of refactoring is well seasoned. You design with flexibility in mind. This can be a hard sell even in the industry, because it can seem pointless at the time if the others think this is a well understood and fixed area. So good code is actually needlessly decoupled, because you end up tripping over it eventually, and you'll be glad you have that flexibility built in. It's stupid until you end up needing it. It's extra and unnecessary complexity until you end up needing it. It's needlessly expensive (premature optimization) until you both need it and discover the performance didn't matter here, anyway.And that's a dangerous one - performance, people will die on that hill, but then you become over-dependent on the performance of that segment to makeup for the failings of other, ""justified"", sloppy and expensive code. Well now you have to break this thing, and you lose the performance, and it's not itself a big deal, but it does expose the weaknesses of other code. And rather than fixing it, there's more bias to ignore it and blame other parts, put the burden on them to make up for it.---Continued...",mredding,2026-02-11 15:50:58,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r1uk7i,False,

But the data itself is behaviourless.Java even introduced new class type specifically for that: Records - only data and there's no way to add methods.,ShoulderPast2433,2026-02-09 14:06:49,3,learnprogramming,t3_1r02yay,False,
o4g11h4,"This is very good, and I concur with the bulk of it. I think there's good reasons that Golang and Rust lean far more towards a model of ""These are the shapes of data structures and we describe them and then write functions to act on them"" (with a syntactic sugar to do method calls) than their predecessors. I'd also like to add one more thought in this space: as software engineering has cared more and more about the network and shipping data between execution domains, coupling data to behavior has fallen grossly out of favor because **behavior is local to an execution engine and data is not**. If my data is wrapped up in a class instance and I have to ship it over the wire, I now have to peel the ""shippable"" data from the ""unshippable,"" i.e. any dynamic method pointers, vtables, or other mechanisms to specify what class this is an instance of, and that's annoying. If your data is in a bog-standard language-supported generic structure, you can ship it to a bog-standard language-supported generic marshaller and be done with the problem of getting it on and off the wire.I think I'd like to tune your thoughts a bit, because OOP conflates a couple of goals and we might want to talk about how we toss the bathwater without the baby.**Encapsulation and interface boundary**: You mention the challenge of ""re-opening"" a class to add new behavior. Some languages allow that! It's generally considered an anti-design. The reason is that being able to wall off code and say ""You can touch this via this mechanism and no other"" is a feature that enables large, decentralized teams to collaborate better by hiding details. If I hand you a Date object with methods, you do not need to care how I'm implementing the methods (with the tradeoff being the only things you can do with *my* Date object are the ones the interface exposes). This leaves me free to change my implementation without breaking you (maybe; see Hyrum's Law), and that's extremely important for being able to iterate to a solution because we almost never know how to write the best solution the first time. The humble `string` is actually my favorite example of this; crack the actual implementation of strings open in many high-level languages and you find that they're fascinatingly complicated (implementing things like caching and memory-reuse on string copy and substring so that the programmer doing the most obvious things with strings doesn't immediately torpedo program performance). If programmers touched the string internals directly, it would make using strings in those systems a nightmare. Golang has interfaces and structs instead of classes and objects, but it also has the rule that you can't write a function that acts directly on the contents of a struct if you aren't in the same module as the struct so that developers can't write code that depends directly on another developer's implementation without consent.**Discoverability**: So I have a struct. What can I do with it? How do I find all the functions that could be applied to that struct so I don't reinvent the wheel? In OOP, the answer is simple: the methods on the class and the parents of the class. In the data-and-functions paradigm... Good luck!It's not quite that bad. It *was* when computers were slower and smaller, which is one of the reasons I think OOP took off when it did. Nowadays, with a language with good static typing and an LSP, you can find all functions that take a given data type as an argument (even grep will work in a pinch, although you'll have to do your own composition analysis). But OOP gives someone a big leg-up on the discovery problem by imposing a paradigm of how code is sorted.Though I highlight the above, I concur with OP: **you don't** ***need*** **OOP to get those things.** It's just worth noting that when you throw OOP out, you're throwing out a paradigm that tries to give you those things for free (well, for cheap... The documentation engines I've seen for Java factories kind of give the lie to the notion that OOP ""solves"" discoverability).

o4g53gd,"ECS is not OOP. OOP doesn't require the deep hierachies that some people write.It's like saying C is dead because GOTO is bad. You just don't write your OOP to have deep hierarchies. If you haven't been doing that for 20 years now, you don't know anything about the trend in the OOP languages.And ""Refactoring"" (published in 1999) and ""Refactoring to Patterns"" (published shortly thereafter) give you the tools to collapse Type Hierarchies (or create them).So if you hear ""deep type hierarchies"" then you know you're listening to a person that doesn't know the field, or has practiced it only like it's 1992.Design Patterns (if one reads the first three chapters) clearly states that the patterns are supposed to cover a wide range of commonly-encountered problems that have commonly used solutions.

OOP is about message passing - which you've missed entirely, OOD is about object modeling, which is orthogonal to OOP and entirely at your discretion - I don't use it. Objects don't couple behavior with data, they couple behavior with state. You can use OOD to model data. You conflate objects with types, and your arguments are mostly about types. You misunderstand aggregation vs. composition. Your conclusion is confused, because ECS is an architecture you can implement regardless of your paradigm.You do have one valid criticism of OOP, and that is due to the agency of the object. Each object is an island of one, which for batch processing is bad, and for stream processing is worse. While you can make a character object and a string object - to get adequate performance, you can't composite one in terms of the other, so you get a scaling problem that composition in FP solves.While I still say stick with FP, I can also say the difficulties you have suffered from OOP is due to your misunderstands.

People learn programming through programming, through experimenting, through playing around, through failing, through breaking things, through fixing. In that line, I'll leave my [comment from yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r0wwoi/problem_with_watching_youtube_coding_tutorials/o4lz1x9/) from a related thread.If you haven't done that yet, played around with the code, experimented, you have done everything wrong.> Everyone says “build projects”And in that sense everyone is 100% correct. You have to build projects.Yet, your (like most beginners'/learners') understanding of what is a project is wrong. Every single thing *you* program is a project, even if it is just `print(""Hello World!"")`. That's how you learn. You have to start with small and simple projects (see the [FAQ - projects by learnt subject](https://github.com/desrtfx/SkillGradedProjects)) and start there. You have to grow your projects with your skills and your skills have to grow with your projects.You don't start writing the next Photoshop, or Word. You start small and simple.Even the programs I just mentioned started way smaller than they are now. Word initially was just a better Notepad with formatting. All the features we now know of it developed over the decades that it already exists. My first version of Word was 3.0 under MS-DOS and then it was just a bit more than Notepad is today. It had formatting, it had pagination, it had already some limited spell checking. It didn't do much else at that time. Table of Contents, document fields, etc. came a bit later, over time.----Stop *watching* tutorials and start *programming*. Experiment. Play around. Try things.

JS just borrowed the name and the bracket syntax. Don't overthink the taxonomy though — what matters practically is that they're ordered, indexed, and have O(1) access by index in most engines.

o52mw72,"Arrays in JS are closest to what’s called an “ArrayList” in Java. The use of a contiguous memory layout, as well as enforcement of homogenous contents, are both secondary aspects of what makes something an array. An array is an ordered data structure which has (close to) constant time access to its contents by index. It’s better to think of these data structures in terms of the performance guarantees they provide for different operations than to try to focus on their implementations. Implementations can involve all sorts of hairy performance optimizations which obscure the intent of the data structure.The weird thing about JS arrays, and ArrayList objects compared to something like C or Java’s primitive arrays, is that they allow the data structure’s size to efficiently dynamically grow. The other weird thing about JS arrays is that they can be sparse, but that’s something you hopefully will never have to deal with. To be pedantic, it’s pretty common for arrays to “hold” heterogenous contents in languages other than JS. I use scare quotes because arrays of objects generally don’t hold objects themselves, but rather pointers to those objects. In languages with subtyping (like Java) the pointers may indeed point to multiple different types of objects as long as they are all subclasses of the array’s declared generic argument.

o4v8jwg,"I'm not entirely sure what I should picture under ""robot sumo competition"" but I have a bit of experience in foundational robotics in my CS degree.To answer your questions: Yes, you can use a camera and a bunch of methods to recognize things. OpenCV is a widespread standard image processing library. You can do C++ but I honestly would say the adapter to Python would probably be a bit more easier to handle because you can use Python for ML stuff as well if you want to, even if Python isn't exactly the fastest.One of the problem you really need to figure out first is to determine the boundary of the problem. What do you mean when you say ""front"" and ""back"" of a robot?If the competition has defined features of a robot, you can use that to determine what constitutes front and back. Using standard or advanced image processing algorithms are going to be an option in this case.A very straight-forward case would be if the competition requires every robot to show some sort of marker for the front facing side. You can use some variant of HOG (histogram of oriented gradients) or if its more complicated SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) to get a decently robust feature detection for the front-side and then deduct that the absence of that feature plus something else like rotational tracking will be the back-side.You can also try the Generalized Hough Transform (although that one might be a bit too slow for pictures with too many pixels).All 3 algorithms are implemented in OpenCV I think (although if not, you can certainly just build them yourself using the OpenCV toolkit).But If robots can look arbitrary and you cannot say that there is some sort of fixed recognizable features, the detection is going to be tricky and OpenCV will not solve your problem. In the latter case, I would honestly consider resorting to machine learning. Retraining CNNs for classification can yield pretty decent results. You would need to have a decently sized training set of images of competition robots fronts and back. You would then do the pre-processing in OpenCV and then pass it on to the model or if you have something integrated like from Nvidia's developer suite, maybe use their stuff.The problem with the ML approach is that you need a decently powerful compute platform on your robot. Even if the majority of computation happens at training phase, processing and then prediction still takes decent amount of compute power. Small embedded systems with a good GPU to handle matrix operations are necessary while not being power hungry monsters.Your other question is a bit vague: What do you mean ""friend or foe system"" for ""recognizing yourself""?",theusualguy512,2026-02-11 21:00:06,2,learnprogramming,t3_1r273ye,False,
o4w9e90,"Yes, this is definitely doable, especially with an overhead camera where you control the environment. The simplest way to detect front and back is to add asymmetric markers to each robot, like a colored patch on one end or distinct shapes, so orientation can be inferred from the contour or marker positions. For friend or foe, you can give your robot a unique color pattern or fiducial marker and track that specifically, which avoids relying on pure shape detection.Since you are new to CV, I would start with basic color thresholding and contour detection in OpenCV before jumping into anything fancy. Real time performance in C++ should be fine if your frame size and processing pipeline stay reasonable.

o4o5lnx,"Got it!1. Any type of problem will help you as a programmer. You really can't wrong here. At some point you might specialize, but right now you just need experience using programming to solve any problem at all. 2. Honestly C is an old language and not many working programmers today would choose it unless it was a very niche thing. The main reason is that C programs are relatively tricky for things like memory management and concurrency. C also doesn't have many features that modern languages have. That is actually why I mentioned Rust, which meant as a kind of modern C replacement. Rust is similar to C, but it has many cool features and still is very fast and runs ""close to the metal"" like C does. * The general answer to the question of ""what is good to write in C (or Rust)?"" is: anything that has to run very fast and/or in limited environments like embedded systems (eg raspberry pi) * a different answer could be a math-heavy problem. Something that uses a lot of data and does a lot of calculations on it very fast.3. Creating your own language is a great thing to try.

I guess my advice to think about what you wish existed.5. Finally, I would not worry about ""knowing what you need to know."" When I started with my problem I knew nothing at all. You will learn what you need to know as you go step by step through the problem you're trying to solve.

Even then, someone working on operating systems might fall C high level and exclusively refer to assembly as low level.It’s hard to tell what languages people are referring to specifically when using these terms, but the presence of a garbage collector does seem to be a fairly consistent indicator of an indisputably high level language (JS, Python, Java). C and C++ might go both ways.Side note: interpretation vs. compilation is not a property of the language but rather its implementation. Some languages do both.

o50gsix,"Generally, high vs low level, and interpreted vs compiled are 2 completely different aspects of a programming language. The definition of high and low level languages has shifted over the years as we have developed more and more languages. But strictly speaking, a high level language is any language that abstracts away any specific hardware details. This means that pretty much every programming language falls into the category of “high level”, with the exceptions of assembly and machine code “languages” (if you could call machine code a language). This means that even languages like C, are considered a high level language. This is because when you write C, you do not need to consider the specific characteristics of the hardware your code will be running on. As long as a compiler exists for a target system, your C code will run largely the same on any system (assuming whatever libraries you use are similarly supported). I would say that your professor is largely correct, using this historical definition of high and low level language. However I would add the asterisk that some projects, most notably Linux, have plenty of source code written by humans in assembly. In this case, the assembly is still source code, but is still a low level language since it is dependent on the hardware it will run on. (In large projects like Linux, this often looks like writing the same functionality multiple times in assembly for each target hardware system. So while C code largely only has to be written once, you may find multiple implementations of the same functionality in multiple assembly languages)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_languageHowever, this distinction has somewhat shifted over the years and people some times use more relative terms like “high*er*” and “low*er*” level programming languages. These refer to how close or far to the hardware your language is abstracted away. So this means that while C is technically a high level language, it is often perceived as “low*er*” level than something like python. You’ll even see some people say that C is generally a “low*er*” level language. However these distinctions are largely semantic and don’t have much real meaning, especially when you’re first learning. I would not get caught up on these.The difference however between an interpreted and compiled language is completely different, and also in the modern day, much more complex. Generally speaking, an interpreter is any program that takes as an input some source code, and executes it without first compiling it to machine code. (Ripped from the first line on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing))) A compiler is then any program that takes source code in one language as an input, and outputs code in another language. However, almost always, this looks like translating a higher level language, into a lower level language, typically from a strictly high level language, into a strictly low level language (like C -> assembly).So the 2 concepts are somewhat related, but there is no exact relationship between them. Modern compilers and interpreters are much more complex and have many stages that translate source code through many different levels of abstraction. And, modern programming languages have started blurring the lines between what is seen as higher level and lower level.",gman1230321,2026-02-12 17:16:25,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r2ycob,False,
o50rjck,"> A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.- Alan PerlisThis is a moving target because it depends on what you're doing. C is a high-level language in many contexts. C++ and Rust can be low-level languages in many contexts.A crucial point that I like to make is that good libraries can make a language ""higher level"" if they provide good abstractions, and the lack of good libraries can make even a very high-level language low-level in the sense that you have to roll your own abstractions.If your language doesn't have good Unicode support, and you need to deal with Unicode, it's a low-level language. OCaml's stdlib doesn't have a good regex library. That stuff matters just as much as, if not more than, the implementation details of how code gets compiled to machine code.",POGtastic,2026-02-12 18:06:51,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r2ycob,False,
o50sef1,"Low level languages are coupled to the machine, it's architecture, it's instruction set, and are often inseparable and non-portable.Machine code itself is low level - almost as low as you can go, just short of micro-code and physical wiring.Assembly is higher level, including symbols, directives, macros, constants, comments... but by definition its statements correspond 1:1 with machine code instructions. You might write a `mov` statement, but which specific instruction you get is dependent on it's parameters.High level languages target abstract machines and are portable. C++, for example, targets an abstract, byte addressable stack machine, two's compliment signed integers, little-endian, etc. So byte offset and bit manipulation on up - calling conventions, etc, all that is beyond the language, and must be defined by the implementation. So if your machine is word-addressable, the compiler has to translate byte addressing into words in some way.Languages can affect architecture; C++03 is THE DEFINITION of the x64 Itanium ABI, and is standard for the hardware, which was designed around it. That doesn't some how lower the level of the language on that particular platform.So it doesn't matter if the language is compiled or interpreted. You can build an interpreter around a virtual Turing Complete stack machine that runs an assembly.

You can technically but it’s not a callable object which is what you’re actually asking.So I can’t make a List or an Array and inside of that array put a function… I also can’t pass them as a parameter to be the input into another totally separate function. In Dart or JS and most modern-ish languages a function are treated as an object just like any other data like a var or a const, so you can manipulate them the same exact way.So if I have a function that does something to an array of numbers, an then sends those numbers out to be updated in real time, it’ll have specifics like who’s logged in, and who’s looking at what. It’ll be a huge function. But I may want to manipulate that data in a certain way before that function executes and send those numbers out.Maybe I want the numbers converted to a different currency, or rounded, or cut off any number below X or above Y, so I make my function.CoreFunction forEachItem(nums, SpecialBehaviorFunction5) and then the rest of that function.I may have 14 different “special behavior functions” that I’m going to use, and that gets passed to this core function 5000 times a minute.So this makes writing and compositing the code way easier and way easier to think about as well because I don’t have a ton of classes or function sitting around scattered.

The pointer for the array stores the address of the very first element in the array - and here is where the ""0-based"" array indexing comes from. Since the elements are stored in a contiguous memory block and have a fixed size depending on the data type, it's easy to figure out where the elements are: `base address + (index * size)`. You know the *base address* - the pointer, you know the *index* - the element you want to access, you know the *size*, which is determined by the data type. That's it.Pointers are extremely useful, but more modern languages (or more modern implementations of languages) often *hide* them away from the user so that they don't have to deal with them.

It's not 100% related to your end goal, but a cheap and easy starting point. Arduino Starter Kits (including the actual Arduino system) are in the range of $50 to $100 and you get lots of hardware (sensors, LEDs, motors, etc.) to play around with.Maybe, ask also in guitar or synthesizer related subreddits, or in the embedded ones, like /r/esp32, /r/arduino, /r/esp8266, /r/nodeMCU, and so on. /r/vsti and /r/synthesizers with their related subreddits could also be viable resources.Also, my general advice would be to focus on *learning programming* first, and there, since you will need C++ use https://learncpp.comWe normally don't suggest C++ as first language as it is a difficult language to get into.

You thus use a setter that has validation built in so you can't set it to whatever you like. Later you then prevent yourself (or someone else) from accidentally writing an incorrect or impossible value. 2. Keeping code lean:Sometimes variables might only be internally used in the class. I might not need to know specific information, in those cases just setting the variable private prevents it from showing up in your IDE and or documentation, keeping things leaner3. Magic numbers: Magic numbers (or magic strings) are plain numbers in your code. Say you want to give a spefic tag or ID to something, and you write 'var = 5;'. The '5' could be turned into a variable and made private. This to reduce magic numbers, and allow easier modification later. (hand in hand with #2) 4. Coding standards/consistency:The common pattern of private variable with a public getter/setter is used for lots of reasons (including above) Because of this sometimes it sorta makes sense to just apply this to variables that might not really benefit from the approach, just to keep your API consistent.",Mystic_Haze,2026-02-08 17:37:15,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qzex97,False,

You could create a helper function to do the filtering everywhere the Getter is used, but you run the chance of someone forgetting. The better solution is to handle it in the Getter itself.

Where it is needed in languages that don't have it, you see idioms like ""pimpl"" etc. to hide things, but they also introduce runtime overhead. It's nice to have compile-time enforcement without runtime cost. It can be very handy when refactoring not to have references to member data everywhere too.I've tried not to lecture on encapsulation because you can find that anywhere online.Side note: it's rarely useful to use private over protected.

Your requirements are specified by the professor and do not change. *At worst*, the professor will provide an additional assignment that requires you to build upon your existing work (and this is steadily becoming rarer because we continue to lower our standards in CS programs).2. Maintenance of the project lasts for approximately one term, at which point your code goes into a folder with all the other projects, never to be touched again.3. The only people who will use your code are yourself and maybe some groupmates.So - fixed requirements, short timeframes, with no customers. Let's change that.---People dispute exactly when the C++ standard library became ""the standard library,"" but cppreference says 1992, and that sounds pretty reasonable. This breaks all three of the above items:* Its requirements change over time because the platforms and operating systems that people use will change. * The maintenance time is indefinite (34 years and counting, and despite the hype over Rust on this site, extremely likely to be another 34 years and counting).* Billions of people depend on it, however indirectly (literally everyone with a web browser).If you read the code for, say, `std::istream`, you're going to find A Gigantic Mess. You care about none of that. You care about the [public methods specified by the standard](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream.html), which should not change.

o4oc2cs,"> Do you think AI is just a bubble that will eventually burst? It's actively bursting and this is a very hot conversation going on right now. With the new year, people are really dissecting annual reports of publicly traded companies, and after ~5 years of this bubble, no major player has reported a positive ROI on AI software integration. Not one.We're seeing ~$22 billion in technical debt created by AI, because the slop they generated can't be understood by people. This is important, because the industry is finally really coming around to understand - you can't hold AI accountable.If a corporation loses shareholder value, causes damages, or kills people, C-levels and employees can be held personally accountable. There was a time I was responsible for 60% of all option trading on Earth, can you just imagine the concrete shoes I'd be wearing at the bottom of some lake right now if I allowed AI to speak on my behalf? Where did all the money go? I dunno, Boss; I asked the AI and they don't know, either. How does this work? I dunno, Boss, the AI made it, and every time I ask, it remakes it in a different way...We're also seeing the employment pendulum swing the other way. That technical debt we've accrued so far is going to take a decade to un-fuck, and we're still going with it, so there will be work for the rest of MY career...And things lag, so there's still a feeling of uncertainty that everyone is acting on, and employers are taking advantage of that while they can by offering low wages since it's still a saturated, employer's market. As the employee market dries up, those salaries are going to pick back up. That things are actively changing isn't a secret, if you know where to look and who to ask.> Or will AI simply raise the entry-level requirement for junior engineers?I'm not quite sure how to interpret this one, yet. Businesses thought they'd replace junior level work with AI, but that means entry level positions would be essentially senior architect roles, basically what you're suggesting - and how can you do that without the experience?So AI has caused some damage, and there will be a gap in employee demographics as we took a whack at 5 years of college grads who didn't find their footing in the middle of this bungling market experiment. They'll all be off into other markets, or set back from missing 5 years critical experience. If you've invested 5 years into something else while this market figures its shit out, you're probably better off sticking to that, rather than finally kick-starting a late career.> I see that companies are mostly hiring senior engineers these days, but if there aren't enough junior engineers, who will they hire are seniors in the future? ( sorry if this sounds silly ) That's a very real question, and the answer is they're going to pay out the ear for the mistake, in the long run.Companies are hiring seniors for two reasons:1) Trump. He's a bad actor, a Russian asset; he has grifted and pilfered this government and economy, intentionally destroyed it in ways that cannot be explained by economics or incompetence alone, and he's such a wildcard, that everyone is just buckling down and hoping to survive this administration, until we can get back to ""business as usual"". And to conservatives and authoritarians of the regime who disagree - you're evil.2) Corporate interest rates went up from 0% 3 years ago, and then the massive layoffs started happening. It wasn't due to AI. Zero interest corporate loans are federal subsidies to grow the economy. You fork off a subsidiary of your conglomerate, spend the money, develop the tech, and when the money runs out, you fold the subsidiary tied to the loan - taking the debt with it. But the parent company keeps all the IP. This scheme is over for FAANG, but not for smaller corporations - so expect some underdog success stories.> how will software work envolve in the future?AI won't go anywhere. But like outsourcing to a Sally Struthers country for pennies on the dollar, you don't outsource anything actually important. It has to be able to fail to deliver, or do what it's supposed to, and that has to be OK. It can be an aid, if it can generate simple code that is faster to verify than it is to write. It'll be useful for refactoring, permuting, generating (but not implementing) protocols, other things.> What should we learn to day to avoid getting stuck in the future?Stick to the fundamentals.

I assume the TV can read and play the videos, bur it might have a very basic interface.If it an Android TV you might be able to install Kodi, create a smart playlist and randomize the videos from there (bit they/someone would still habe to load up Kodi, I'm not too familiar with all its features but it can be a bit complicated by itself)The other option is to use a single board computer like the Raspberry Pi. 3b or 4 later versions come with more RAM options but yoi don't need much to play videos.You could setup that to continuously play a bunch of videos with python. Controlling the playback with an on-screen UI moght need more complex software but if no control is needed a simple script might work.The raspberry pi doesn't normally have power controls though so it will be continuously playing even when the TV is off.

o4ua6a2,"So are you suggesting that when testing, you're not entering your first condition when you think you should?Well, that implies your score is greater than 0 and less than 100. if(!(score > 0 && score < 100))Mind you, both 0 and 100 are typically valid percents, your code excludes them. Your condition should probably be: if(!(score >= 0 && score <= 100))This is greater-than-or-equal-to and less-than-or-equal-to. You could simply further with an inversion: if(score 100)This is probably what you were thinking of, and it didn't work, and you didn't realize you needed a logical OR instead of the logical AND, so the inversion seemed to mostly work.You should also move your check for `score` directly under the input for `score`. WHY would you input a grade if the score is wrong? The two variables are independent and you're going to quit anyway. Quit early.That also means DON'T declare your grade variable until AFTER you validated your score input. The variable doesn't need to be in scope where you're not using it.Some other bits:This: cout <<Implies this: using namespace std;Don't do that. Prefer to use the longer form. We're not programming on punch cards, so we're not trying to save on just a couple characters. Typing quickly becomes the insignificant part of the job. The rule is - if you know exactly what you want, then specify it exactly. Namespaces are not just a ""simple"" organizational indirection, it has some frankly arcane effects on how the compiler resolves symbols. A ""collision"" isn't oh, I named something in my own code `cout`, guess I'll have to rename it... No - a collision is when you correctly compile against the wrong code, and the program correctly does the wrong thing. Usually you won't even notice these bugs at first. They're insidious as fuck.I don't know if you've covered switches yet, but that would simplify your grade letter check: switch(std::toupper(LetterGrade)) { case 'A': case 'B': case 'C': case 'D': case 'F': break; // All the letters above ""fall through"" to here, where we break, because there's nothing to do. default: std::cout << ""Invalid letter grade""; return 0; }Prefer to use brackets around scopes: if ( score < 60) { std::cout << ""Failed the homework assignment""; } else if ( score >= 60 && score <=69) { std::cout << ""phew...barely made it, D""; }This is a common source of bugs. Most languages, scoping is a hard requirement, but we inherit from C, which was trying to save space on punch cards, so... We're stuck with a syntax that tolerates very error prone implied scoping.Also, if you have an `if/else` chain like you do, always prefer to have a final `else` statement. You can achieve this by inverting your code. Test for an A first, on down, and everything 60 and below is implied as an F - there's your final `else` clause. Coding standards for critical systems code often requires this, if you ever want to get into that. cin >> score;Always check your inputs: if(std::cin >> score) { do_stuff_with(score); } else { error_handle(std::cin); }`operator >>` and `operator <<` both return the stream. The stream can be evaluated as a `bool`, it's built into the type (this is something you can do in the future with your own types, it's called operator overloading, streams overload the cast operator to `bool`). This is equivalent to FIRST extracting to `score` AND THEN calling: if(!(std::cin.bad() || std::cin.fail())) {The stream is stateful - it stores the result of the previous IO attempt, so the stream can tell you if the last operation succeed or not. You could also write: std::cin >> score; if(std::cin) {So the state persists with the lifetime of the stream, and IO operations can change that state.So if the stream returns `true`, then you have a `double` value stored in `score`. If it returns `false`, there are rules about what `score` would be, what state the stream is in and what you can do about that, but you didn't get user input, and you already have to know the state of the stream BEFORE the extraction to know even TOUCHING the `score` is safe and defined behavior... Mostly, for these exercises, if the stream is false, you just terminate the program.Output streams can fail, too, but the bugs that come from that are usually less insidious. Input failures can lead to Undefined Behavior (UB), output failures lead to no-ops.Also, u/SpaceAviator1999 was incorrect about some of the details regarding streams and flushing. I'm not going to pick apart the nuance of what he said, it's better to just disregard it all entirely - what he's talking about isn't your problem.",mredding,2026-02-11 18:16:44,6,learnprogramming,t3_1r22c25,False,

One thing I can tell you from your post is, stop trying so hard to chase the next level. I have seen this trap from so many different people (my self included), from juniors to staff+. I have seen people get bitter and go “I’m doing the same work as this other person, why I’m I X and they’re X+1?” But almost always, there is something that is really holding them back. I worked with one mid level once who was extremely bitter that they were not promoted to sr yet (the left amazon as a sde1 or 2, applied as a sr to my current company under the impression that they’d get promoted to sr quickly, and then quit 3 years later as still a midlevel). They were extremely difficult to work with honestly, and mostly because of that bitterness. They couldn’t take an ambiguous piece of work and deliver it. You had to really hold their hands to get them to deliver code. And it wasn’t even because they didn’t know what they we were doing, they did. It’s because they were so focused on proving themselves as sr, they fought against every single plan and needed to fight every little suggestion. They wouldn’t take any feedback, seeing feedback as a ding against their capabilities. They’d write “clever code” that was hard to read and often had edge case bugs, and if you mentioned it during a PR, then they’d just complain to the manager that I’m holding up the review. They’d publicly call out their manager when there was a decision that was made that they disagreed with. These behaviours are what held this person back, and it’s the same kind of behaviour that I’ve seen over and over again. Often times, just focusing on what’s on your plate and delivering outstanding work there is all you need to do. And then you have a convo with your manager and say “I’ve been building great stuff here, and I want to make it to the next level, give me more work please.” Promos are often not done by just your manager, they are done by a committee. You need a manager who is both respected and willing to back you for promo, and other managers who know your name and not willing to fight against your manager to their people. If you piss of another team by being difficult, then you can be that manager is going to bring that up and it’s going to hurt you. You need to be open and collaborative with others.

If a company wants to be somewhere, they'll lease property. If a company doesn't want or need to be somewhere, they'll let leases expire. And then everything else falls into line with the leases.10 years ago, every smart CFO advocated very long leases to reduce lease rates. Now that companies have been shown that they don't need people onsite, every smart CFO is recommending that the company only renew very essential leases and let the rest expire. This is a corporate finance tectonic shift on par with switching to defined-contribution retirement plans (late '90's) and switching to unlimited PTO (late '00's).If you like working there, make yourself as valuable as you can. It still might not make the difference, but it usually does. If your boss can say about you to their boss ""I can't succeed without this person"", then you are usually safe. That's your goal...if you want to stay there.And in a few years when your company's leases expire, then leadership will say that they've discovered or realized that WFH is a vital part of work life balance or whatever stupid way they have of justifying what is ultimately a financial, lease-centric decision.",jimmy-buffett,2026-02-11 23:18:55,16,cscareerquestions,t3_1r2aupk,False,

But all the jobs I'm getting are in series-B startups, and they are completely incompatible with being a parent to a child with high needs. I actually tried, but things are just so unstable now. I got fired from a job after about 10 months despite busting my ass on it, and then the next job I found, I got laid off in about 8 months.Tech careers are so all-consuming, and if you want to run a family while in one, it means you're spending a ton of money on daycare, babysitters, after-school programs, summer camps, cleaning, and meal services. You can't turn on and turn off these things at will. Like I get my kid into a pretty expensive daycare that's taking 30% of my take-home, and then I get laid off... I can't just pull her from the daycare because I currently don't have an income, and then put her back in when my income stabilises. I have significant savings, but this type of uncertainty and demands means I can't actually build enough savings while I work, and my savings get depleted fast when I'm between jobs. And I'm not actually able to be a good parent if I'm constantly worried about getting fired or laid off.And AI is cool, but it feels like I'm expected to be up to date on using AI in my job, and I have to spend time outside of work to explore AI and stuff. Which I really don't have the time for. So I'm going back to school to get a teaching credential. There's a huge shortage of math and science teachers. I need something stable that offers benefits, so I'm not constantly worried about the high cost of COBRA coverage when I'm between jobs. The biggest benefit is, even if the job isn't flexible, I'm just DONE at 5pm. Even if I have to grade papers at home, it's not as cognitively demanding as being on-call at 2am when the server goes down. There are a lot of bad things said about teaching as a profession, and I personally know lots of teachers who got sick of it and quit, just as I got sick of tech and quit. But at this point in my life, it feels like a better career choice. I still love programming, and in my spare time, I am constantly coding apps, helping friends with their startups, and consulting.

o4mqy4m,"People are shortsighted and the job market in tech is terrible right now. This brings out all the doomers. AI is very hyped up as a replacement for software engineers because good software engineers are expensive to hire and AI is very good at trivial coding tasks. But there's at least one thing that doesn't make sense about the AI doomerism. If AI is really going to be so revolutionary and replace a ton of jobs, then there will be engineers who work on tailoring AI models to specific tasks and packaging them up into applications that non-engineers can use. That's something where humans need be involved in because it's not just going to be AI all the way down. AI is not able to handle everything with no human oversight. A human will need to be involved at each step - architecture design, setting up infrastructure, testing, monitoring, and translating the business needs into application logic. There are people who think that AI can handle all that and that CEOs will just be pushing a button telling AI to ""build this"" and it will be done without any human supervision or oversight. In reality we are nowhere near AI being capable of that.If anything, AI is a reason to be optimistic about the future of SWE. It's not a reason to be scared. As a developer, you can learn about AI models, training them, tweaking them, and integrating them into secure and scalable applications/products. These are skills which will stay relevant for a long time. AI might lower the barrier to developing software, but that should increase the number of software projects being worked on - not decrease them. Software development has become much easier since the field was invented. We don't need to write in low level languages most of the time. There are many well established frameworks and tools that make it easy to accomplish tasks which would have taken massive amounts of work 20 or 30 years ago. And still there are more software devs than ever because there is more software being made. So basically don't fall for the doomerism. The job market is shit right now, but it's because of the economy and most white collar type of jobs are in the same boat. We are also in the hangover phase of companies being drunk on free money for R&D and hiring SWE in a crazy frenzy.

o4tl2pd,the 6 YOE with react/ts/python is actually a solid profile. but here's the thing - a lot of companies right now are either ghosting postings entirely (never planned to hire) or filtering way harder than before because they're getting 500+ apps per role.one thing i've noticed is that reaching out directly to hiring managers BEFORE applying can actually work better than applying then reaching out. shows you're proactive vs just another resume in the pile.also worth checking if there's something weird with your resume file itself - some ATS systems literally can't parse certain PDF formats and just skip the app entirely. might be worth having someone try to upload your resume to a few ATS systems and see what comes out the other end.,OAKI-io,2026-02-11 16:19:39,9,cscareerquestions,t3_1r1rcsw,False,

o4t8wuc,"8 months with zero organic responses after 600 applications isn’t a you problem, it’s a systematic filtering issue. Something in your application materials is triggering an automatic rejection before human eyes ever see them. The fact that your network connections got you interviews proves you can perform when given the chance, so the barrier is purely at the screening stage.Six resume rewrites might actually be hurting you if each version strays further from ATS optimization. Consider this: get your most recent version reviewed by someone currently hiring in tech, not just resume writers. They’ll spot what’s causing the auto-rejections. Also, gaps on your resume or the layoff itself might need different framing. Some companies filter out anyone currently unemployed, which is brutal but realYour tech stack isn’t the problem since those skills are still in demand. More likely it’s resume formatting breaking ATS parsers, missing keywords that match job descriptions exactly, or your experience level falling into an awkward middle zone where you’re overqualified for junior roles but competing with seniors.Stop applying to undervalued positions immediately. That signals desperation and companies assume you’ll leave when something better appears. Focus on contract or freelance work to fill the gap while maintaining your search.

o3ulyxr,"Working with AI changes everyday. There’s 0 chance your company knows what they’re doing. The engineering is up to us, not a bunch of corporate stooges and their worthless ""AI up-skilling"" powerpoints. I’ll give you a basic run down of everything important I've learned in the last year:1. Write an AGENTS.md file that gives a broad view of your repository with high level details like tech stack, folder structure, etc. Also point to which docs should be referenced if the agent needs to expand further for more details. This prompt will be injected in every conversation so keep the information broad/horizontal instead of deep/vertical.2. Learn how to sandbox your agent so you can run the agent in yolo mode and afk it. The 3 most popular options are: Claude code’s builtin sandbox mode, vscode’s dev containers, and docker’s new sandbox mode for running agents.3. Learn git worktrees so you can have agents work in the background without disrupting your normal workflow or if you want to parallelize work. (I recommend not trying to parallelize too much, most work is inter-dependent and it's usually easier to just work sequentially)4. Utilize skills and have a directory full of detailed instructions for each common task you do. For example, a frontend task that goes deep into detail on how you want your frontend code to be written. Unlike the AGENTS.md file, you want these docs to be deep and detailed. The agent will use progressive disclosure and only invoke those skills when its relevant so your context isn’t overloaded5. Learn about the ralph wiggum technique. This is essentially breaking extremely long tasks into subtasks and running the agent in a loop so that it can work on atomic tasks with a fresh context each time instead of trying to one-shot it and getting its context window trashed. This will involve: - A PRD doc explaining the feature and requirements in depth. - A tasks.json file with subtasks and acceptance criteria for each task. - A notes.md file so that it can jot down any information that might be relevant in between tasks. - And finally, a bash script to run your agent continuously. - There’s some good info [here](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) along with more stuff if you google ralph wiggum.6. Standard engineering practices apply. Tons of high quality tests, linters, formatters, and strict type checkers.7. Set up a way for your agent to test changes. Whether thats setting up staging environments for backend work or setting up browser automation for frontend.8. Avoid MCPs like the plague. 99.99% of them are useless and will clog your context with useless tool definitions that the agent isn’t even good at invoking. The only mcp I recommend is this for browser automation: https://github.com/remorses/playwriter (NOT THE OFFICIAL PLAYWRIGHT MCP. The official one is trash and not optimized to preserve your context window)9. Learn your agent’s plugin system and write scripts to automate tasks that should be run deterministically.

Mid-sized DoD company as my first, second was not FAANG but it's one that i personally would say is at the same level as FAANG (or mag7) and the third and current is big tech. I wouldnt consider it the same tier as FAANG but i would say it's a tier just under FAANG. To answer the question, i tdepends. I've never worked startup but i've heard startups have similar culture. But what i will say on each company i feel like it's general for each type of company.DoD- at DoD, this was super chill. The work felt meaningful but the work was also super chill. Like i could sit on a task for a month, work 8 hour days where half the day i twiddled my thumbs and still get good reviews at the end of 6 months. I remember getting to my project and it was a year away from being ""complete"" and it took us 3 years to complete it and nobody was mad or batted an eye. It was a poorly run project because everybody just wanted to do 8 hours and go home. Nobody was really trying to go all out for them. The pay wasnt the best but it was good. I would recommend DoD to anybody who likes CS but doesnt love it to want to learn new systems, new code, etc. Just wants to get their day done and go home and not htink about work. But it'sv ery easy to get behind the times and not move ahead in your career. You will get promoted pretty quickly but wont learn much really. Nobody even sends an email after 5 pm.FAANG level - when i left DoD i wanted more pay and to learn more. It was a huge culture shock. I went to cloud services. The company i worked for was known for having work life balance but I didnt ralize cloud is where that dies. It was super competitive. A SWE2, did twice as much work as a senior at DoD did. I made good money but god it sucked. Seniors and up were so booked they had no time to help juniors. Reviews were not based on what was expected it was based on how you compared ot your coworkers. I literally got in my review, ""his coworkers do more than him"" becaus ei didnt work 60 hour weeks like osme of them. That wasnt the reason but whne most are doing 60 and you are doing 40 it shows in the work. I got laid off and honestly didnt even miss it. If you werent sending emails or getting at calls at like 8pm you were behind. It felt like you always had to be available. Big tech - i got a job in big tech and was making more than i was at FAANG. Honestly it's been great because the work is meanigful, i work for a cloud service that's big but not as big as the faang one. But because it's not as big, nobody feels overworked. For the first ime iin years i had people say ""dude it's 6pm go home"". It's a good level of feeling like youa re doing meaningful work and not feeling like you have to work 60 hours to keep up.

A lot of people believe LLMs are the silver bullet from that and can eventually replace human support agents. However banks also have to deal with a lot of regulation and tend to have a mountain of internal controls which hamstring their AI efforts.

I think most firms are flat so your title won’t change much and salary progression is usually pretty meritocratic. As far as what you do, for most engineering positions it’s working on internal libraries, tooling, execution, order routing systems. My role involving pulling market data off co-located switches/servers, so I often felt like a network engineer. We also maintained all of our own servers, so a lot of the work is around maintaining / migrating those. Not a whole lot of cloud being used due to obvious reasons for HFT. Did I enjoy it? It’s a job. I loved being surrounded by the smartest working on hard problems in a competitive industry.

But it’s not incredibly meaningful if that matters to you and I felt like my skills were becoming highly specialized—a good thing if you want to stay in trading your whole life, but the longer you stay the harder it may be to jump into a different space. For example, you won’t have any experience creating a product for real users. I do think most of these places offer some of the best jobs you can find that balance pay and work/life.

On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes.This sounds identical to what my org calls ""Solutions"". A typical solutions specialist/engineer has a CS degree from a small school or comes from a nontraditional background (bootcamp, self-taught, etc.). Required to code and know SQL, but isn't trusted to build customer-facing products from scratch. Much of their work is being responsive to customer demands; support tickets, onboarding new customers, code changes that are often formulaic / pattern repetition, etc.>They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path....and this is exactly how I sell folks on doing the work, and getting paid less for it. I pitch the variety of tasks they have, how much they can learn technically and about our products. It's not *wrong* but it's also not saying the quiet part out loud: you aren't trusted to be a *full* software engineer, nor do we want to pay for that for this position.Have people successfully transferred to a full Software Engineer position from our Solutions org? Absolutely, and I love enabling that move. But due to classic company issues, it's very hard to pay them the same as their peers vs. an external direct hire.>What I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment. EDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.IMO if you're good at what you do, bet on yourself. Don't rely on a ""down the road"" transfer/promotion. Find a company that thinks you're good *now* and is willing to give you that responsibility and compensation. Even if they think you're ready in 6-12 months they might still delay on a move because you've proven yourself invaluable to their ""support"" organization and they don't have a backfill ready.>There’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.I would ask them to go directly into a SE role instead of the support role, or else walk and keep looking.>Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?Caveat to all of the above: if you are not in the US and you live in a country where employment opportunities are scarce, you might need to toss all of my advice and take the job anyway. For example, if you live in Pakistan and are having trouble finding *any* job that is technical and pays reasonably well, this might be your best angle to transition into something better. I can't speak to your personal job market situation; my advice is based around what I know best (US labor market and you have authorization to work).",Adder00,2026-02-08 15:26:45,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1qz768l,False,

I then nearly doubled my salary by accepting a role at company B doing the kind of debug-level support you describe, and since I had significant software engineering knowledge from my first job, I excelled and was promoted to a lead and received numerous raises. Eventually while at company B I expressed my desire to move into product engineering and it was granted once they were able to find another lead to replace me. While working the debug support role (before being promoted to lead), I got an offer for a senior SWE role at a third company, but didn't accept the offer for various reasons.

Product can fit too, but switching now likely means starting junior again and slower pay growth.

Good managers are often solid engineers who care about clarity, feedback, and helping others succeed. A good next step is to take on small leadership tasks where you are, mentoring, running meetings, owning a project end to end.

It’s been pretty discouraging and I’m honestly feeling burned out from coding and job hunting.That is perfectly valid, and I think that's why you should take the manager job. Going all in on CS when you're feeling burnt out and discouraged is not the play. Up your income now, and if time permits, or you start to regain some energy and focus, you can continue on the software grind.I think finding opportunity anywhere is the key for success - up the sales at this store your paycheck grows. That's a huge incentive.

o3xak2b,"Not that I'm a dinosaur (only 27 haha), but I and many others find that the experience of doing something for work versus hobby is vastly different. You're worried about drifting away from tech, but at 21 you probably don't even have enough job experience to really know what you want to do for work. As you start to experience your work-life, you'll start to get an idea of what I mean here.Management is not necessarily for everyone, but who knows, this could end up being something you really enjoy. It could come with long hours, but it could also give you the perfect WLB such that you can ""work to live"".Anyways, there's nothing that 100% says you're locked out of tech if you take the management job. Your income is tied to your ability to sell. You could very possibly leverage your technical skillset to improve sales, in which case it is a stepping stone to later jumping into tech. Or maybe they promote you/translate you directly into a technical role if you do a good enough job since it sounds like a smaller business if you're getting a cut as large as 25%.If nothing else, it beats being burnt out making minimum wage.",SerClopsALot,2026-02-06 16:21:12,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1qxk6oj,False,

You can still code on the side and apply to jobs, but now you're not stressed about rent.For interviews when you do get them, I'd recommend preparing with mock interview tools.
