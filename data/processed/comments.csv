RAG uses a vector similarity search algorithm to look up related information and graphs rely on nodes and edges to connect relationships in your data. Basically look at how Neo4j works. They have been talking about the graph approach for a while, but barriers are how your data is organized/tagged as it's less effective the fewer relationships you have. That's not easy to establish depending on what your metadata looks like. Also massive graph dbs tend to not be that performant. You can still get pretty good results with them, especially for document search use cases or something like that. But there are also people talking about how tensor based LLMs are limited and not going to get us to the promised land and the next step might be difusion models or something else. AWS also was talking about how they are maxing out what they can do with generic LLMs in training and how they could be more effective if they had access to actual business data to train on (not going to happen). Agentic systems are the current hot thing where you can create ""tools"" for the LLM to use based on the context. Like if a user asks an accounting question, the LLM can call an accounting agent that might have textual, RAG or graph resources to answer the call.

The idea behind this Postgres offering is to bring them even closer together and make that integration as effortless as possible for developers. :)With regard to integration, the vision behind our CDC capabilities is to offer a much more native experience, something you can’t get from other services and addresses problems around standard CDC. Additionally, the `pg_clickhouse` extension will be native to this service and maintained by ClickHouse, and will act as a unified query layer for both transactional and analytical workloads.

The code usually doesn't run, and these people are completely closed off to constructive criticism, so nothing has improved for weeks. They do like to bitch about us, though. My manager came to me yesterday to tell me I needed to be more patient and to train one of these guys more. There is no training taking place, because they're not actually attempting to do what is asked of them. Copying and pasting things into and put of an LLM is not learning or trying, it's just creating slop. Ive gone over the changes that need made to a file three times now and have shown them the exact lines where changes need to be made. Something that I've told them is only a 3 line update turns into a 600+ line diff.Last week, I got on a call with my tech lead and one of these guys and went through every single line he had updated in a PR and asked him to explain his design decisions. He literally couldn't explain what the code did at all. So, at least on my team, it's a huge issue. We are hiring people that aren't competent because our leadership assumes that any idiot can generate code via an LLM, so they're hiring the cheapest idiots they can find.

Although some answers were obviously not scripted, and he seemed to know what he was talking about, he still seemed like he was using an AI interview tool. After talking to some of the recruiters familiar with his region of the world it was apparent that this was VERY common and candidates felt they had to do it to stay competitive. We had a follow-up interview where we told him that we all use AI tools in out jobs and that we can't fault anyone for using them, but we wanted to hear his answers unassisted. We made it clear that it was OK to say ""I don't know"" or ""I don't understand the question"". The interview went much better. There was some language barrier and he didn't understand all the questions as asked, but when clarified he was fine and gave good answers. When he didn't know something he said so. It turns out his resume was real, he did know what he was talking about. I think going forward we will address the use of AI, let them know it's ok for some aspects of their job and even for helping them interview. We also need to get good at asking the right questions.

o0hrah2,"I'm in a team that built everything on AWS services, with similar amounts of incoming data.It was fine at first. As long as everything was simple with a single region and incoming product, and a few people had been working on it and had direct experience with how everything was done, then the 'quirks' were kept to a minimum and everyone knew them.Then as new team members got onboarded things got harder. People had to be taught all the quirks of which role to use when creating a glue job vs an interactive notebook, they had to be shown the magic command boilerplate to get glue catalog and iceberg tables working, they needed to know the bucket that was set up for output for Athena queries. With more people working not everyone could be across everyone else's work, so people weren't familiar with how various custom jobs and scripts had been made, and because each job was its own mini vertical stack there was a lot of repeated components in infrastructure, policies, ci/cd scripts.As new use cases came on that didn't fit the mould new ways of doing things had to be added. Kinesis and firehose come in, airflow orchestration gets tasked for some small transforms while others go to glue jobs. Someone wants a warehouse/database to query, so redshift is added. Exports to third party processors are needed as are imports, so more buckets, more permissions. API ingestions are needed so in come lambda functions, with each one coded and deployed differently because nobody can see what everyone else is doing.Then finally users need access to data, and the team just isn't set up for it. There is no central catalog with everything, it is spread out across half a dozen services, and the only way to know where anything is or goes is to dig through the code. That 'worked' for the DE team, since they were the ones doing the digging, but there was no effective way to give access to everything. Every request for data took days or weeks to finalise, and often required more pipelines to move it to where it could be accessed.We're moving to Databricks soon. It gives a unified UI for DE and other teams to access the data, you get sql endpoints, you can run basic compute on single-node 'clusters', it has orchestration built in, it gives you a somewhat easier way to manage permissions, and it works for both running your own compute and giving data access. Instead of a mishmash of technologies that don't make a unified platform, you get a consistent experience.You'll just have to pay extra since it is doing a good portion of that unification work for you.If you had a hundred DE type roles it might be more cost effective to stick with base aws services, and have a dedicated team focused on dx, standards, and productivity, to cut out the managed compute cost.

I have experience with spark, orchestration, A.I. Agents, etc. Databricks can do everything you listed. It is not the best in each category. Airflow is a superior orchestration tool than Databricks Workflows, for example. However Databricks provides tools in all categories that are more than good enough.I find myself surprised how easy most things are. I usually do a POC with a G.U.I. first. Then reimplement with code, checking against the G.U.I. POC as I go. There is a G.U I. for Databricks Workflows and A.I. Agents. In general, everything seems to be as easy as possible, with good default settings. The advantage of having good enough tools in broad categories that all integrate well with each other makes life easy.Measured against AWS, Databricks is more expensive. Your company can either pay more for compute ( go with Databricks) or pay more to expand the team with specialized people (AWS). Expensive compute is cheaper than expensive specialists.Plus Databricks is moving to everything runs on serverless. In practice, I would say 80% to 90% of prod code runs on serverless. I see this improving with time.Closing remark. Databricks is a thought leader. They have made many open source software that everything else is compared to. (Spark, MLflow, DeltaLake,...). Databricks competitors run Databricks open source software. Agent bricks hosts 20+ LLMs out of the box.

We used all of the technologies you listed except data tone and only a bit of lake formation. Then we wanted to have a business facing data catalogue with lineage and there wasn’t much available in AWS. As of 2026 I would argue that is still the case. For data catalogue we used OpenMetadata. For hosting we used EKS btw.Long story short it takes a lot of development effort to put all of these technologies together and to maintain it. It works well once done and it is scalable. But if I would do it again I would use Databricks in 2026. Gets you started quickly. Downside will be cost as you have to pay for DBUs on top off AWS cost. Arguably you would need less data developers which could pay for the additional cost. I know this is a bit off a sticking point nobody wants to think about. But if you plan to use your devs to build the AWS solution then you already covered the dev cost. If you go with Databricks you may need less data devs, assuming that some part of their time is currently used for infrastructure work. If the new AWS architecture would need more devs than the argument would be that Databricks would allow you to operate with the current number of devs.If you decide to go with databricks use an open source table format like iceberg to reduce vendor locking.

Once that clicks, new tech becomes variations on the same ideas, not brand new worlds. Your PM/BA background is actually a plus.

And more and more SaaS vendors will export data directly to your warehouse, so that you don't really have to build those either. AI will be able to do a lot in terms of glueing that together. Where I think data engineers will spend much more of their time in the future is on something much more valuable, actually building data products (internal and external) that derive value from the data. Every org I've worked at wants to be data driven, but the people in the business domains have really weak ""data reasoning skills"".

o0rz224,"> We rarely see “reality” until we deploy to prod.It's completely normal to not see ""reality"" before reaching production. Unless it's highly critical and you are allowed to maintain a live copy of production in test environment, the test data is inevitably less complete. The smart and efficient solution is to have a proper analysis of the different cases existing in production, and use them to build your test data, ideally by the upstream team that is responsible for this data. Consider that it cannot be complete, try to make it good enough. Don't think you can predict all future use cases, the solution for those is proper error logging, monitoring and alerting, so you can react fast when they will happen.> In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing.Teams should be free to have their team-only development environment were they can break everything, but there should be another test environment that is relatively stable to allow downstream usage of data like you need. I think you need to talk about having such a stable test environment with the engineering management, in my experience it was mostly called ""staging"". It's not supposed to be a copy of ""production"", and it's better if it is not for information security, but it should be a good simulation of production cases to test the code edge cases (as I described above).In our case, our dev environment is our local laptops. We have hand crafted test files crafted to represent the different cases, and we are able to run full flows locally with either our tools running locally or mocking. Local allows to iterate much faster than if you have to deploy and rely on non-local tools. The unit tests and full flow tests are automated to be able to run in CICD or on request on PRs if they are too slow for systematic run. Then there is the company's staging environment that is fed by upstream teams with simulated data representative of production, and the same code and tools as production. There we can run our code in the same tool environment as production. > Upstream tables aren’t versionedWhat does this mean? If the code that creates/alter these tables is not versioned, that's pretty bad. The process needs to go through a proper CICD.

What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?Upstream table changes need to be communicated. This is not negotiable for platform stability and needs to be taken to engineering management. They need to establish a proper channel, for example: ticket (with PR links), documentation page, announcement in dedicated channel, regular meetings to plan changes and exceptional meetings for emergencies. A team should only be allowed to deploy such change once the communication process has been respected and the reception by downstream teams has been confirmed. This also means the upstream team is responsible for updating staging so it matches the change and you can properly test it in staging.",sib_n,2026-01-21 01:31:00,3,dataengineering,t3_1qifo47,False,

There are some rare scenarios where it doesn't happen all the time - like the upstream system *never* changes, or is run by the exact same team doing the ETL work. But in almost all other cases it's a complete mess.Plus there's other bad cases like where the upstream system adds a new column, you're using a solution that provides some schema evolution capabilities like Fivetran, so your ETL process just silently ingests the new column - but that new column isn't actually used by anything - and it now has 50% of your costs allocated to it from a different column everyone is using.> What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?Data contracts & publishing domain objects: * Upstream system publishes a ""domain object"" any time any field within the domain changes. A domain is a higher-level abstraction like user, customer, invoice, supplier, etc. And the domain object is typically a denormalized collection of related info. * The domain object could be published to a messaging system, which could get ingested directly, or simply redirect messages into a file on say s3. Or maybe the upstream system just writes all pending domain objects to s3 every 5-15 minutes. * And the domain object is locked down with a data contract. This contract is kept in version control, and both the source & target teams can use it to validate all data being sent & received.

Are you querying a subset of staging and/or production data (possibly sanitized) to cover edge cases, or is it a fully manufactured dev dataset/table that you run queries against?It's a small file included in the Git repo, something like 3 to 10 records. We use either JSON (easy to edit manually) or AVRO (Kafka source), depending on the source of the flow we are testing. If the test flow's source is a table, the source file is turned into the table format we use first by the test logic. Usually, data comes from staging since we already have representative but fake data there that is safe to keep in Git. It is potentially manually modified to add some cases that we need to test.> Also, just to confirm my understanding around environments: staging is what you always reference in test (and possibly dev, depending on your answer above), correct? 1. When a team member submits a PR, it is required for them to prove that their change works in staging, typically sharing a successful flow run with the different run modes (normal scheduled run, backfill, or whatever specific parameter). That's really the minimum that should be expected for any change affecting flows. 2. For any function that does not rely on integration with external tools, we require the very classic unit tests. Those take a few ms each, so they are always triggered in our CI tool whenever a commit is pushed.3. A bit more recently, we have been adding ""local flow tests"" that can be run locally on our laptop and in the CI tool. This means we can validate that the flow logic works locally, and we are able to use a local debugger, which is pretty amazing for ETL work. We can also run it on request with a comment during the PR review; the results are written in the commit status on Github. We don't run those automatically at every commit push because they have quite some overhead to set up a local flow environment (especially Spark's overhead); they take something like 30 to 90 s for each flow. This was a lot of work to create, but it is now extremely valuable. > If that’s the case, then in theory our “test” environment should fail, and alert us, whenever there’s a schema change that isn’t properly communicated. Is that the right way to think about it?For the tests to fail due to a schema change, the test data needs to have changed accordingly. For local tests, your team controls the test data, so it cannot have changed if you didn't know. Where it should fail is during the staging run, if the upstream team has correctly updated the data they are responsible for in staging and actually ran their change in staging. So, it still relies on the upstream team doing its job properly, which requires engineering management to enforce it if they are not doing it by themselves.If it failed in staging, you can check how the data changed and modify your local test data to cover the new situation. But, you shouldn't have to find it by yourself like this; the chances to miss the changes even if it is in staging are still too high, for example, if it only affects a small subset of records.So again, the most important solution is that there should be a mandatory communication channel for them to announce the change and collect the confirmation of the downstream teams. At minimum, something like a Slack message where downstream teams are pinged. With this information you can at minimum make sure your staging run goes through the change. If you have a local test, you can then directly modify your local test data and comfortably check on your laptop with a debugger what the consequence is for your flow. Ideally, there is the data contract system mentioned by others. Every schema is versioned in Git; it serves as the reference for every dependent project, and any change needs to be approved by the downstream teams in the PR. But I think very few companies have this level of maturity; even in my current company, where it is already very high considering the quality of testing I have described above, it is only partially implemented.> - Upstream Staging -> Our Dev/Test> - Upstream Prod -> Our ProdThe staging environment is supposed to be shared by all teams that have dependencies, so the integration of the different projects can be tested just like in production, except the data is a simulation. The only difference in terms of code is that staging may have the newer version of the code that is being tested. So it should be like this:- Staging environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects- Production environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projectsLocal testing is a separate environment that is defined in your Git repositories, so you wouldn't expect the upstream team to modify it, just like you wouldn't expect them to change the code you own. - Local test environment (only your teams): your test data (possibly based on staging upstream data) -> Your project -> your data- Staging environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects- Production environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projectsYour company could have another shared testing environment before staging. I can imagine a ""testing"" environment being for unstable testing; expect things to break regularly because teams will test early versions, and ""staging"" for stable testing; things should not break too much so you can test in production-like conditions. In our case, our local/staging/production is covering what we need, so I wouldn't see the point of having a 4th environment.",sib_n,2026-01-22 01:23:34,2,dataengineering,t1_o0vr660,False,

This can be done in near-real-time or small micro-batches depending on complexity. The processed output then lands in a store that’s optimized for querying or visualization, which your frontend reads from.

o03gdn8,"The most effective approach is to separate storage from indexing. You should treat your SQL server as the Control Plane and a dedicated file store (like S3, Azure Blob, or a MinIO instance) as the Data Plane. Your Python script functions as a gateway that pulls data from your various sources and subjects it to a strict validation suite before it ever reaches the ML team. Instead of raw CSVs or SQL dumps, have your script convert the data into Parquet files; this format is compressed, schema-enforced, and significantly faster for ML frameworks to load than standard text files. Once the script validates and saves the file to your central storage, it should write a record to a ""Manifest"" table in your SQL server. This record includes the file path, a unique version ID, a checksum to prevent corruption, and the results of your quality tests. The ML team then simply queries this SQL table to find the URI of the latest ""Verified"" dataset, eliminating the need for email threads and manual downloads.This setup transforms your manual 70GB bottleneck into a robust, versioned data pipeline that maintains the SWE standards of your core application.",eli_cohen21,2026-01-17 12:37:17,1,dataengineering,t3_1qf5k36,False,

ETL Pipeline: Ingest data from public APIs (maybe weather, finance, or social media), clean and transform it, and store it in a cloud database. Visualize results or build a simple dashboard to display insights.2. Data Warehouse Project: Set up a mini data warehouse using open source tools (like PostgreSQL, DuckDB, or even cloud warehouses if allowed by your school). Populate it with multiple sources and practice schema design, partitioning, and basic analytics queries.3. Batch vs Stream: Compare batch ETL (e.g., with Airflow or Prefect) and simple streaming (Kafka or just a basic pub/sub) on a dataset. Even if you use sample scripts, explaining the trade-offs is valuable.4. End-to-End Analytics: Choose a topic (like campus resource usage or student performance if you can get anonymized data), gather, clean, and enrich the data, and display it in a lightweight front-end. This gives you a taste of the full stack.Don’t worry about building something massive; depth of understanding matters more than shiny complexity.

o0e33cz,"based on what you just wrote, data engineering sounds like a fairly natural next step for you. A lot of people who get bored in senior analyst roles feel that same shift, less enjoyment from “telling the story” and more from building the systems and models that make everything work. If you enjoy data modeling, Python, and building tools that reduce friction for others, that’s already a big piece of modern DE work. Many DE roles today are less about pure infra and more about enabling analytics at scale, which fits your background well. You’re not starting from zero, you’re just moving closer to the plumbing. On the ITIL / process side yes, it’s more structured, and that can be frustrating at first. The upside is fewer fire drills and clearer ownership the downside is slower change and more ceremony. People coming from “fast and loose” teams usually struggle with pace more than the work itself, but most adapt once they see the stability benefits. As for frustrations, you’ve already named most of them unclear requirements, data quality issues, tribal knowledge, and legacy decisions you inherit. The flip side is that fixing those things is often exactly what makes the job satisfying.

For actual looping use either (1) do the loop in a driver notebook or (2) keep ADF as the orchestrator and just trigger Databricks jobs. So no, you don’t have to write everything in notebooks, but the foreach part is usually code or external orchestration.If you redesign, the main win is fewer tiny jobs and fewer cluster spin-ups.

o0ky3so,"Yeah, this is a really normal point of confusion when you move from DA work into ingestion side DE. The big mindset shift is that schemas tell you how tables relate, but they don’t tell you how data changes. Streams only show what Snowflake sees as new or updated rows since the last run, so if the source system quietly edits an old record, you’ll never see that unless you deliberately go back and reprocess it. That’s why a lot of pipelines use a lookback window (reloading the last N days every run) or just full refresh smaller tables. If the source doesn’t give you a reliable “last updated” field or CDC feed, you kind of have to assume old data can change and design around that. For tables without dates, truncating by time doesn’t really make sense. Those usually get merged by a stable business key, or fully rebuilt if they’re small enough. The “forked” tables usually follow the lifecycle of the parent record, not the ingestion date. In general, when you’re trying to understand ingestion, I’d ask “how does this data change in the source system?” rather than “how do these tables join.” Once you answer that, the truncate vs merge decisions start to feel a lot more obvious",joins_and_coffee,2026-01-20 00:54:28,3,dataengineering,t3_1qgyrpt,False,

o01r9u7,"I don’t think you’re wrong to be frustrated, and you’re definitely not the only one who’s felt this with Fabric. From the outside it looks less like “networking is unimportant” and more like Fabric being designed as a very opinionated SaaS first, and an Azure-native platform second. MPEs feel awkward because they’re basically abstracting VNET concepts into something Fabric can control end to end. That gives Microsoft tighter isolation, simpler UX for less technical users, and easier multi-tenant guarantees, but it also means every new resource type needs explicit support. That doesn’t scale well for power users who expect networking to just work like it does in Synapse or Databricks. The slow rollout of MPE types is probably a mix of security review, product prioritization, and yes, commercial incentives. Fabric clearly pushes “bring data into OneLake” patterns first, and anything that bypasses that path feels like a second-class citizen. Whether that’s intentional cost pressure or just product focus, the effect is the same for customers. I don’t think it’s a lack of technical capability so much as Fabric still deciding who it’s really for. Right now it feels optimized for managed ingestion and analytics inside the ecosystem, not for complex private networking scenarios. Until that changes, Fabric is hard to recommend as a full replacement for Synapse/Databricks if deep network control is a requirement.

o12osa4,"Short answer: yes, but not with a built-in “copy workflow” button.AWS Glue workflows can be migrated without recreating everything in the console, but it takes either an API based export or infrastructure as code.One option is to pull the workflow definition from the source account using the Glue API. `GetWorkflow` with `IncludeGraph=true` gives you the workflow structure and dependencies. From there you also need to export each referenced job, crawler, and trigger using `GetJob`, `GetCrawler`, and `GetTrigger`. In the target account, you recreate the workflow with `CreateWorkflow`, then recreate jobs, crawlers, and triggers so the DAG lines back up. This works well for a one-time move, but you still have to fix account specific things like IAM role ARNs, KMS keys, S3 bucket names, connections, and any hard coded account IDs in job arguments.The cleaner long-term approach is to turn the workflow into infrastructure as code. Glue workflows and triggers are supported in both CloudFormation and Terraform. Once modeled, you can deploy the same definition to another account with only variable changes for account specific resources. This avoids ever doing a manual rebuild again and is what most teams settle on after the first migration.In practice, if this is a one-off accident recovery, scripting against the Glue APIs is usually fastest.

This distinguishes a top quality *course* from just another *""how to create X""* *tutorial*.Once one has the foundation laid, e.g. through some proper *course*, it is time to throw away the training wheels and to start trying, doing things on their own. Use the documentation, use specific targeted articles, blogs, or even tutorials - but not the ""how to create X"" ones, rather some short, narrow, targeted tutorials that only cover some aspect of your project, e.g. if you want to do something with a SQLite database in Python, check for a quick tutorial (there are excellent ones) that teach you exactly that - how to connect to a database, how to create tables, how to query fields, etc.Changing your way how you approach tutorials also can help: When a concept, part is introduced, try to do it on your own first. Do not look at the presented code. Write it yourself. Play around, experiment. Once you have done it and it works or if all else fails, look at the code.

Moving the window one step only changes a single data point. To make the list sorted again you only need to move this specific point to the correct place. Going a bit further into potential optimizations you can also notice that if the point that's dropping out of the window (`op`) and the point that enters the window (`np`) are both larger or smaller than the current median, the median won't change and you can just replace `op` with `np` without resorting the list. Another observation is that if `op` and `np` are on different sides of the median, you don't actually have to resort everything to rebalance both sides because the balance can be easily restored by moving one element to the correct side:* `op` < median < `np`: move the smallest element to the right the median to the left of the median; this element is now also the largest element of the left. The new median lies between this element and the new smallest element on the right side.* `op` > median > `np`: Find the biggest element on the left side and move it to the right; it's now the smallest element on the right.By using those observations and moving from fully sorting the window to simply partitioning it you should be able to make updating it much cheaper because you no longer have to shift all elements between `op` and `np` to either the left of the right.",sidit77,2026-01-17 09:01:49,1,learnprogramming,t3_1qf3ex6,False,

I don't know what exactly is not clear to you. Maybe the problem is that you try to ""translate"" your code. It's probably better to not just translate it line by line but to think about what objects there will be and how they communicate. Calling a method is how that works in OOP. And they can have side effects. There are books. Some of them are bad many are outdated. The problem is mostly that they spend a lot of time on inheritance of state because it's so problematic. That chapter has to be in the book, but it should just be about what you prevent as much as possible. And beginners think because there's so much about it in the book it must be important. You probably need a type for each expression in your syntax tree. You could use an abstract class as a base that has a field for the token(s) from the tokenizer. But you really don't need this.

Then whenever you want to add, you pass the integer in the array to the function pointed to in the array. *This is called a field and a method*.This is an oversimplification.

o15xghj,"I hate to give advice without knowing you a \*lot\* better. But ...I learned programming a long time ago. My first compiled language was Fortran 77. In those days we wrote out the entire program on paper, ran through it (still on paper) assigning numbers to variables, etc, to do the best we could to simulate its operation. Why? Because the program had to be typed onto punch cards and fed into a card reader, then run usually overnight. You'd get a printout with a mass of compiler errors the next day, look at the various other reports, mark up the printout, and repeat until it ran correctly. The point of telling you this is that it took such a long time to get computer output that we did everything we could to ensure that our logic and syntax were succinct and correct before submitting a job. So we used flow charts, pseudo code, walk-through discussions, and anything else we could think of. This mental exercise made writing code in different languages relatively easy.

o156lb7,"So, my other main question is as follows but is more of a personal experience thing. That said, I still stand by my comment that if you think you are ""up for it"", then ""go for it"".This is more of a ""being on the same page"" when we are talking about system calls.Back in the day, when I did assembler programming on MS-DOS systems, system calls was pretty much the only option available. I also had to do this on some proprietary operating systems such as TMX (which was an NCR proprietary OS running on M68K CPUs).It was a PIA. Back then, in MS-DOS, the interface was pretty straightforward, but tedious.System calls are pretty basic as you are directly invoking functions that the underlying operating system supports - for example, openning, reading, writing and other file operations. Or, forking the current process and replacing the image with a new image (fork and execute). Terminate this process and other ""basic"" operations.In DOS, you setup the parameters in various CPU registers and invoked a software interrupt (INT 0x21 if memory serves).Linux is very similar.If running on Intel hardware, there is a special instruction `syscall` (added in Pentium class CPUs I believe) that is used in place of the INT 0x21, but you still have to set up the CPU registers.Perhaps have a look at this: https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/linux-constants/syscalls/#x86_64-64-bitThe CPU registers that need to be set are listed at the head of the table,Note that there are no ""graphics"" system calls - I don't know how this would work, I imagine it is some sort of IPC between your process and a kernel driver which manages the display hardware. IPC could include any combination of:* Shared memory (shmget, shmat ...).* Semaphores (semget, semop, semctl),* Message Queues (msgget, msgsnd, msgrcv...).* Pipes (pipe, mkfifo, open, read, write...)* Signals which operate like interrupts (kill, signal, sigaction...)and possibly others. But the same thing would apply, there would be some mechanism (defined by the driver) that defines how parameters are supplied and functions invoked.If you want to learn system calls (and the above is what you are talking about), you might try doing some basic File I/O using the system calls, perhaps some IPC between two processes that you create (and thus know the protocol being used for them talk to each other) - perhaps a simple command interpreter that can accept commands, fork and exec a sub process.",gm310509,2026-01-22 23:52:26,2,learnprogramming,t1_o10dihh,False,

Your loop should EITHER go until the pointer reaches some limiting address value, OR until some count is reached. For what you're doing, choose the count by comparing N to zero.* The variable names are unhelpful. What is N? By convention it looks like the array size, but it only means that at the start of the loop. It's actually the number of items remaining to be visited. And what is A? It's not the address of an array A, it's the address of an element of that array.* The empty initialization of the for loop means you're expressly designing this code to leave artifacts available for the rest of the block. Sometimes that's useful, but not here. Those artifacts are A, pointing just past the last element of the array, and N, which will by definition be zero.

o0fv71r,"TLDR: The reality is most starting out heavily lack basic DSA or basic language functionality like stacks, heaps, and virtual space. There are countless things to learn but overall I recommend advancing in DSA and don't feel rushed to know everything. Take your time deeply understanding the simple stuff. Ask questions where things are assumed and seem obvious. If you can really feel what's going on it will stick better. If you're going to Leetcode try to stay in a particular topic for a while and avoid spreading your learning too thin across many different challenges back to back.I was in and out of university for a while and in between completed Coding Dojo Full Stack Development (don't recommend), made a bunch of projects and eventually a successful app on iOS and Android. You might already know many of these topics but this is what I find useful.What I learned is that anything.js (edit I mean most .js solutions, not literally a project called anything.js lol) React, Angular, etc. these full stack web frameworks are constantly changing and new trendy APIs are always coming. Many new APIs are made when someone has some slight problem with the existing options. The right way to use them imo is to know the good general fundamentals like CRUD, validations, DB servers and back end controllers for them, MVC structures, dynamic pages and templates and when you come across some new API you must use that's the only time to get into the specifics and spend time on it - when you need to.Leetcode is good with the right mindset. You can spend too much time on topics that don't improve your skills that much or focusing on the difficulty more than what you're actually learning. Every programmer should strive to be solid in DSA. Focus on things like arrays, binary trees, string modification and linked lists. Take your time to know the little things well. Ask AI for small learning project ideas and when you don't know something syntax or language specific don't ask AI but check the documentation because there you will be surprised at when else you come across or multiple examples of using a function. Try to solve the Skyline problem. The skill level rating shouldn't get in the way of what you want to learn. If knowing how to solve that problem advances you then just take your time on it and try to have solid knowledge in the small steps. If you learn how every little part of a single problem takes all day when you could've done a bunch of random ones to feel more comfortable in the language, it's fine because the former will stick with you.Maybe do a simple learning project in hash maps, or make a multi multi level index database with JSON files and JS and see how you can optimize it. Take a JSON file with test data and make a function that splits it to 3 files where the first is an index, and the next two is part A and B. See how you can modify the function to take number of files/splits and how to split them. For learning I try to keep my attention in the same realm for a while so don't jump around too much or do a project that spreads your attention thin.Those skills will follow you everywhere you go but a new JS API probably won't help you with much else.Know the topics that are needed but programmers starting out struggle with or are frequently missed either by curriculum or not needing it in a specific language:\- What is a stack and heap?\- What is a virtualized address?\- Asymmetric vs symmetric encryption, passkey generation, basic structure of encrypting and decrypting data and how to ensure you're doing it safely.\- When to use structured SQL data or NoSQL. What are the pros and cons? You can use both in an app so what do you want strict and what should be flexible?\- Allocation for data types.Relating to networking I don't know what fundamental work is needed I haven't dealt with that much yet, but less low level topics are solutions that reduce data redundancy, but also latency which can fight redundancy, and the size of transfers all while keeping security which can also fight latency for users. We are producing and sharing data in a rapidly growing rate as the corporate world wants everything cloud based and as AI does what it do. Any little changes to make an app function just as fast and secure but with less data being transferred or stored is very valuable.

o186cqv,"I think you are falling into a trap. It is not really about X hours of project vs Y hours of exercises, etc. Learning programming is not a fitness class.Your overall approach should be:1. Learn the basics, I really mean *essentials*, of a language you like. This could be whether by YouTube videos or text tutorials or even the language's official documentation page.2. Practice, practice and practice. Build something small, iterate on it, add features to it, challenge yourself, break it, fix the errors, and then iterate again.3. Once you ***master*** the ***important skill of basic programming***, go on to learn a framework/library such as React, NextJs etc.IMHO, programming is 80% about becoming good at breaking down the problem - and your thoughts of a solution around it - into small tasks, and then translating them into machine language.And *please* don't use AI throughout this process. If AI is ""doing the job"" for you, even writing a small piece of code, you are missing the whole point and, IMHO, wasting your time. The important point is that *you* learn how to fix a problem that comes up in your code, not AI. That you learn the thought process, how to evaluate decisions, and so on.And don't worry or be self-conscious about your age. You're still young enough to learn programming.

Now not saying it’s not useful, it can be but working on a real project, seeing how smaller parts of code come together is what makes you a great program. I enjoy the theoretical side of stuff as that’s the way my brain work, but sometimes something working in theory is not practical to implement. For example, I have a few data pipelines that take a few minutes to run. There’s definitely stuff I can do to optimize them and make them run faster. But it’s just not practical and offers no real gain, this code is running overnight when I’m in bed snoring. So yeah, I could improve it and make it run two minutes faster but it comes with a cost, I’m going to have to devote time looking into a better algorithm, testing this new algorithm. And all I will do is save a few minutes which doesn’t really matter, heck if some of these code take an hour to run I’d be fine. Maybe there’s some seriously inefficient algorithm but it wouldn’t affect anything so it’s fine. Now a buddy of mine, he does programming for a major Company. When he’s measuring the efficiency of algorithms he’s looking for improvements in milliseconds. If he can get certain code to run a second faster, that would be a miraculous achievement. So for him, leet code problems are very useful because that’s all that he uses. But ask him to work on a major project from start to finish, he can’t do that because it’s not what he does. But the vast majority of programmers are not in his case where they need to worry about every little performance efficiency. There’s a number of factors to consider when writing good code, how performance efficient is the code, how readable is the code, how long does it take to deploy the code.

You don't want to distract yourself you want to decompress emotionally and let your new reality settle in, low stimulus time.Once you're ready to start hunting then you update your linkedin and get your resume together. Take your time but don't take too long, you can always update it more as you apply. Start sending out apps, I would aim for at least 50 a week. Personally I never did the tailor the resume per application and fuck that cover letter shit, but at the same time apply for places where you're a reasonable fit. Apply for startups, big tech, and everything in between. At this point you just want to pump the numbers, get your feet wet, and collect data.Track all your job apps in a spreadsheet listing out what platform you applied, what version of your resume you applied with (if you modify it), and if you were rejected or not. This will help you tailor your strategy and give you success rates to A/B test approaches against. I had about a 5-10% callback rate on cold apps and a 20% callback rate on recruiter DMs/inmail (moved past the screening round). This is a pretty solid ratio to have in today's climate.Also start connecting with a ton of tech recruiters and if you see a job with a good fit DM the recruiter directly with a short message, the job link, and your resume.Aim to spend half your day doing leetcode /system design and the other half on job apps. Always be interview ready and at the beginning take every interview you can get even if it's something you would never accept just to build your confidence.The big thing is to always rethink your approach and try tweaking different strategies to see what gets better results.

I have one guy who I respected when I started here, but he recently opened a PR for a big new feature and a huge percentage of it was AI slop. What is annoying about that in particular is that I was specifically asked for my opinion on it and to review it, and it was obvious after a few files that it was pure slop with no attention given to how difficult it would be for others to maintain. When I brought up (nicely) some of these points and wrote them with my human brain and human thoughts (as he requested me to do), he replied with some generic GPT answer. It was clear it was GPT because I copied my comment into GPT with the prompt: ""Write a response to this"" and it spit out some of the exact same sentences and bizarre words. So yes, AI has affected my job in the sense that now I am a slop reviewer, and it is showing me who the braindead people are who rely on slop generators to get their work done.

o0oijiy,"Preface: I'm currently a remote SDE at Netflix, but I'm only one opinion, others might have different views obviously.First let me point out two facts:1. Getting a call != getting the job. You are getting the cart in front of the horse a bit, so I'd highly recommend you not get too excited. It is very hard to get an offer from Netflix, I've seen jobs stay open for 6+ months waiting for the perfect candidate to come through. Also, if anyone is ahead of you in the pipeline and they accept an offer, Netflix will immediately cancel all interviews with anyone currently in the hiring pipeline. I'm not telling you this to get you down, I've just seen too many folks surprised and disappointed by this.2. Lets be honest, if you get an offer you are going to take the job. It doesn't really matter what I say after this.To answer your actual questions:>What's the catch?There's no catch. Its a good company to work for, but the keeper test is a real thing. You need to do good work to stay employed. There are people who definitely coast, but that's not common.>Are remote workers more likely to get laid off or get plateaued on their salary growth compared to the ones who go to the office every day?No. I suppose if you were the type of person who wants to go from Engineering Manager to Senior Director or something I'm betting it's a journey only to be successfully traveled with a lot of in-office ass kissing.>How’s the pay growth like in general on the base salary every year as there’s no bonus?I would say to get the idea of ""pay growth"" out of your mind. First of all, based on you saying you were at a financial company, I'm guessing that your pay will probably double when coming to Netflix. Given that, if it doesn't grow from there, would that be terrible? Netflix has terms/acronyms for how they do or don't increase pay, I won't bother spelling them all out. The TL;DR is if pay in the industry goes up across the board, then Netflix pay will go up. If it doesn't go up or it goes down (like it has for the past 3 years), Netflix pay will stay the same. You will never get a pay cut at least, but you also won't get a pay raise. In the 2018-2021 timeline people were getting huge raises each year. For the past 3 years, pay has been flat.>How well do they honor the unlimited paid time off policy? How many vacation days do y’all take every year?They honor it. I don't take a lot of time off, but that's a personal choice, but there are people on my team taking 30 days off per year easily. We don't really keep track honestly, there's no place to click some button to take time off. I just tell my manager my plans and then set my self as out-of-office on my google calendar and slack and that's about it.>How’s the parental leave policy and do they honor it wellAFAIK they do. There was someone in my greater org gone for nearly a year after their baby was born.>What do you think about the health insurance they offer?It's fine, pretty standard. The HSA plan is usually the clear winner.>Are there any signs of remote roles becoming fully in-person anytime soon?No, not at all. My org is almost entirely remote. The only rumor I've heard was from the Ads org requiring in-office, but that team is almost all ex-Meta and ex-Amazon, so who knows what those nerds are up to.",Optimus_Primeme,2026-01-20 15:28:08,196,cscareerquestions,t3_1qi2tzm,False,

But the reality is that no matter how wonderful software engineering is, it's a job which someone pays you for, and that comes with pressures and trade-offs to meet them.If it helps: anecdotally, my work has become far more interesting and far less monotonous as I've gotten more senior. When I was a junior, I was handed a lot of ""boring"" jobs too (documentation, bug fixing, maintenance, adding tests). That's not a mark of disrespect; it's just that in terms of cost efficiency and skill set, it makes sense to push the senior people into working the more complex problems, so boring tasks get handed down. It's all part of the process, and you'll come out better for it. In not too long, it'll be you handing those tasks over to juniors.As for advice: during the boring time in my career, I did a lot of side hobby project stuff in my spare time to satisfy that intellectual stimulation.

Not one. Every job I apply for has 100+ applicants in less than 24 hours. Even the ones at 40-50% of the average salary range, which I apply for just to see if they'll call back. Some of them stop accepting resumes, then reopen a month later because they didn't find a qualified candidate the first time. Then they get spammed again. Then reopen a month later.A friend of mine had a guy on his team (offshore) who never turned his camera on. Would be told in meetings turn your camera on, ""I can't figure out how, it doesn't work"".

This has further effects as well to non-tech companies that also can't borrow money as easily. They'll do RIFs which also means fewer seats for SaaS products which is another way revenue drops.

o0fon4v,"Listen, I'm sorry you got a bad internship manager.No, it's not usually that bad. Some intern managers are great, some are just mediocre, but this is unusually bad.That said, this is an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation, so here's my advice:First, do the work you're assigned, no matter how stupid or boring it sounds. Finish copying the data to Excel, email it to your manager and ask for more.If you get more, do it as professionally as you possibly can, even if it seems boring and stupid. Part of the experience of working at a company is that sometimes you have to do boring, stupid work. Doing it well is necessary for success.However, for the rest of your time, you should have two goals:1. Make yourself useful2. Learn as much as you canYou're in an amazing position right now. You have access to a whole company full of professionals, and almost no responsibilities.This is a fantastic opportunity, if you want to take advantage of it.Who cares what department you're in? Start meeting people in different departments. Tell them you're an intern on the Data Analytics team but you're not very busy and you'd like to help.It won't be hard to find someone who has some work for you.I don't recommend keeping it a secret! Tell your manager you did all of your Excel work, and that you met someone in another department who gave you a task. I highly doubt your manager will care.And of course, your goal is to learn something. Find people who are actually good at their jobs (unlike your manager) and are interested in teaching you how they do them.Having your manager give you a good review at the end of your internship is nice, but it isn't the only good outcome. Any other employee who ends up impressed with you at the end of the internship could end up being a great resource. When you apply to future jobs and give a reference, you don't have to give your manager - give some other senior employee who liked you. And make contacts with as many people as you can, and when you're graduating, contact all of them to ask for referrals.",dmazzoni,2026-01-19 06:42:25,53,cscareerquestions,t3_1qgw9t5,False,

o0fw2iw,"I would say it’s about 50-50. Take a look at the comments, you’re gonna see some people saying it’s unusual… And then some people saying it’s normal.At the end of the day, I feel like it’s 50-50, and beyond that the real question is… What are you gonna do about it?If you don’t feel like you have work… The answer is the same. Ask somebody to give you something to do. But here’s the thing… The best thing you could possibly do is make the best of the opportunity you have. As long as you do that, you’ll leave on positive terms and be able to ask for letters of recommendation in the future. That’s your end goal.So here are some ideas… Ask someone what is the most important codebase for you to investigate? What are some fundamental principles that you can look up, if you’re interested doing that person’s job? What is a problem that the company currently has that could provide value for the company if it was solved?Be sure to let people know that they can answer this in a very high-level, simple way if they don’t have a lot of time. Let them know that you’re not trying to interfere with their daily work… But more so, you’re trying to find some things to dig into and research independently. After a while if you’re at a good internship position, they’re going to give you some more useful work… but if you’re at a bad place, this is going to be all you get. Either way, though, if you take this approach, everyone will know that you tried, and you would have documented evidence that you asked C questions and got Y answers. Document everything (your questions, the answers, and the research/work you did), and write up report from your internship. Save it somewhere. Memorize a 30 second breakdown of what you did. If you do this, it won’t matter if you have three bad internships. You will seem more prepared, and experienced, than 90% of all candidates for other jobs. The real skill to legitimately learn and to genuinely get jobs is to:1. Do your best, genuinely.2. Document what you did, at every place on your résumé.3. Create a logical and truthful story about what you learned..4. Always learn, at every position, even if you’re learning about what not to do (pay special attention to proactively investigating how you can provide value… and managing yourself in a way that provides value to the company).You can do all of this systematically no matter what anyone else does. You don’t have to be a genius, and you don’t have to become a rockstar. All you have to do is to provide documentation that you work hard and are willing to reasonably spend your paid time, focusing on providing value for the people that pay you (if at all possible).The worst thing you should say about the company is, “Even though I had very little guidance, I was able to spend company time improving documentation [something you were told was important] and learning about [something you proactively researched]”You should always be looking for how this internship can provide value for you. If someone helps you provide value for the company, great! But if no one is giving you work to do, make sure you get what you need from that opportunity. This could impact how much money you make (10k-20k+ a year)… or it could impact if you get a good entry-level position.I purposely did not respond in a way that had anything to do with, how to make the company act differently. Because this is something you cannot control… You should focus on how you can behave in a way that would set you up for success no matter how the company behaves.

The issue is that you cannot actually figure that out in a reasonable amount of time, so we substitute hard questions to answer with simpler ones: e.g. can they solve this hard DSA problem, do they have experience with this framework, have they worked for a FAANG company. The actual ""signals"" of a good developer is to ask them about their previous work and evaluate their answers, ask them to read some code, ask them to write some code, and ask them to design something. You want to see if they can communicate well, work independently on some things, ask for help on others, can understand code written by others (or more recently, AI), can write functional and understandable code, and can create an idiomatic design that addresses real problems (e.g. functionality, performance, scalability, maintainability).

I see people telling you tot need to apply to 1000-1500 jobs. That’s not quite accurate. There’s some randomness to it all. The more you apply, the more you have a chance for finding something that aligns with you. But it’s not a guarantee, and some people luck out and find something sooner. - People are really bad with perspective. There’s nothing wrong with what you wrote about yourself, but there’s an issue of scale and perspective. How do you compare to all the other people currently looking? There’s no way to answer that, but it can be hard to stand out from the crowd. There will be a lot of people with similar backgrounds, better backgrounds, and worse backgrounds. You can’t control much except making yourself a better candidate and trying to give yourself as many opportunities as possible. Anyway, you have to just understand that rejection is a part of life, and it’s a part of the job search process. That’s easier said than done. Regarding false certainty, that’s just part of life. There is just a lot of uncertainty in life. If you’re a sports fan, there’s uncertainty in the outcome of a game. There’s what likely will happen, but no guarantee. Some don’t watch because of anxiety. Others watch and let the result really impact them, and others watch and move on with their lives.

o0kejf2,"There's likely a disconnect somewhere between you and your work. It could be a number of things, but from what I've heard from some people who burnt out and similar to you, they just slowly stopped caring anymore. It's usually 1 of 2 things, either you had clear goals in life and are finding yourself not getting closer to them, or you were constantly under some ethereal pressure to always deliver and been told what you were doing mattered -- but it really didn't.In the first case, it usually manifests in the form of a midlife crisis i.e. realizing you're not where you want to be and your life's almost over, which you sound young enough and are on a decent trajectory (gf + social circle/gym) to not be applicable to.The second case is clear overworking, I'm talking like 70-100 hours a week for years which doesn't seem like your case.Then lastly, there's also a sort of mix of the two in high-achieving younger folk I've noticed in recent years. Those who were mostly successful in life and then landed great gigs out of uni, constantly being told they're delivering mission critical things and are a part of something bigger. After a few years, you start to realize, if you took some PTO, missed some deliverables or just straight stopped working for more than 1 hour a day like yourself, nothing really bad happens. Work moves on, your company and coworkers move on, and really nothing you do is that critical to the business. For most, this is OK, but if you made it a part of your personality for the past 5-20 years of your life, then it could cause this divergence/burnout you're experiencing.Personally speaking, I was never really an early overachiever but knew a few in the Bay Area who skyrocketed their schooling/careers really fast and burnt out hard. I don't really have advice but it seemed like those who went through it had to soul search for a long time to get out of it (some became NEETs or worked in unrelated jobs for a few years), or just switched and coasted at a smaller company until they shifted their perspective or found something they cared about.",terrany,2026-01-19 23:09:31,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1qhjehf,False,

Big companies are all up their own ass about AI this and that, but the startup world still needs actual people.I'd say the same is true for some defense companies because their pockets are typically so deep that they will still hire people to build stuff.As for answers to your questions, I don't have any specifics, sorry. As for projects, I've put together some projects that had practical use and would be worth talking about. One idea was a file conversion script that could take medical imaging files (from ultrasounds, MRI, CT scans, etc.) and convert them into something actually usable by a normal person like a jpg/png. That took some thinking, but it's a good learning experience. Motivation for this one was personal experience in how godawful most of those systems are and how inconvenient it is for you, the patient, to see your own images.Another idea, albeit small, was to implement some of the common file compression algorithms and essentially make my own version of WinZip.

Doing some tinkering with AWS and getting familiar with their primitives would probably be one of the most impactful things you can do to increase your value in the job market, since it'll naturally open you up to lots more companies/stacks.Some thoughts inline for your other questions:> If you took a break or had a gap, what helped you come back and get hired?Get your story straight. Ideally, both your internal story (for yourself, what you wanted out of it, what you ended up getting) as well as your public story.But if you can only do one, get the public story *concise* and have the elevator pitch ready to deliver when the inevitable question comes up in the interview. You want 1-2 polished sentences about why you took the time off, what you accomplished, and how you're thinking about your return to full-time work.Practice telling the story, over and over, until it sounds natural.> Should I focus on DE roles again or pivot to backend/SWE?Remember that you also need to like the job you end up getting. ;) It's okay to focus, especially initially.If you do end up going for general backend/SWE roles, make sure to have different version(s) of your resume for those roles.> What’s a realistic plan for the next 8–12 weeks that actually improves interview outcomes?One underrated tool is mock interviews. Hire paid, experienced mock interviewers that actually have work and interview experience at the kinds of companies you want to join.Schedule at least one mock interview every couple weeks. That way, you're getting *real* feedback every couple weeks with specific guidance on what to work on.For me, right before my real interview, I also then loaded up one last wave of mock interviews to get in a bunch more practice.It gets expensive, but you should be able to make back everything (and more) with your signing bonus.> What do recruiters/hiring managers in India care about most when they see a 6 month gap?Oops... my advice is from experience in the US. Adjust accordingly. :)> Any suggestions for 1–2 “resume-worthy” projects that are actually useful (not a toy) and can be finished quickly?Paying for a training or a course certificate *from an actual credible source* can be a nice bullet point. It shows you're willing to invest in yourself, literally, and it shows you can learn on your own.Good luck! And don't beat yourself up about taking a break. It's *very* common.

I made a bad choice.I remember being alone in my apartment after college missing the chaos of my roommates and crying because I was so bored and lonely and nothing felt right. The girl I loved was still in school and she cheated one me, I had a lot of decision paralysis on what I could even do on my free time. Nothing felt good.So I researched ""Best cities to live in your 20s"" (this was 2015 mind you) and Denver popped up. I love outdoor activites, and wanted a city center where I could make friends. I wanted a fresh start. Most importantly, I did have an uncle who lived in a suburb there, and 1 single friend I could hangout with. It wasn't much, but it was enough of a safety net for me to take the leap.I changed my linkedin and resume address to say Denver.I got picked up by a recruiter, and they flew me out to a job in Denver for an interview. The culture was warm and chill, in a cool place, laid back, not overly corporate. It had plenty of other fresh grads, I could hangout with them. Beers in the fridge.

o066b6a,"I can try to give my two cents here since I am at just under 2 YOE (1 year 11 months). “Mostly frontend work; very comfortable here” — I would say that I am fairly confident in my front end work as well. When it comes to Front End work items on our board in DevOps, I am usually the one that gets handed these types of tickets since front end work is pretty much straightforward and self explanatory. “Self-sufficient, don’t need handholding” — I’ve noticed probably within the past 4 months that for this portion I am starting to be more self sufficient, but occasionally I do need support or guidance getting through the work item. For instance, I had to edit a table (database migration for C#) on one of our database tables for an application that we are in the midst of building and kind of got lost. I had to nudge one of our lead developers for some assistance, but I still occasionally do need help with more difficult problems that I sometimes run into. “Can own features end-to-end” — for this specific point, this is NOT true with me. If you really do own features end to end I expect these to be more front end feature work items, but not back end stuff. I struggle with back end work items immensely. Correct me if I am wrong please!!!“Collaborate with other teams on system design and write ADRs” — At my company, we really don’t have “ADRs”. Sure we understand the things we work on, but my company is so small that having things like this does not really benefit us. For bigger companies I could definitely see the benefit of this. My coworker who has been doing Software Engineering for 15 years wrote up the architecture design documents and database schema for a new application we are releasing soon about 6 months ago. He knew EXACTLY how to get it done, how long it would take, and how hard it would be. That’s something I totally expect from someone with that much experience. It also depends heavily on the work place you are at. Especially what you work on, how difficult it is, and if you are learning new things. I would say that from what you said in your post and comparing where I am at, we are probably in a similar spot. Now I don’t know how much you make, but I expect the next job you get (hopefully for me too) you will make substantially more. What I would work on for improving your knowledge is maybe look at more back end specific problems. I am currently working on a full stack application that calls a local database and uses REST to grab information from said database. I had a coworker who moved on to bigger and better things that told me back end development is where the big money is at.

Know who to go to ask to get information to handle some ambiguity, know when to ask team lead / senior when it's getting too big.Jr Devs seem more rare, but being able to help them or pair program and learn together to at least do the easy tickets.At least be able to take a stab at a small to medium problem and make some kind of drawing. Maybe use LLM to help and then make sure you understand what you made. Senior dev probably still modified or rejects solution.DevOps specifically just depends where you work. I found I need to know how CI/CD works and some basic to touching intermediate topics about AWS / K8 for interviews. I have only gotten the opportunity to write unit tests and update yaml files and deploy docker containers, so I can't speak there. I had dedicated DevOps teams at my other jobs.So my opinion (that may not be that accurate) is learn as you go and get your work done in a timely manner. If you have time afterwards review the work and make sure you get it.When you get to interviews though, different ball park. They want you to know (in my experience):the ability to system design large projects, solve medium LC's in 10-15 mins or a custom coding challenge, random trivia of basic to intermediate topics about your coding languages, varying levels of DevOps questions, SQL questions including asking specific syntax or make a query right now verbally or type in chat, strong behavioral stories that show impact and good team dynamics / easy to work with.. Then I got my job offer finally, and I'm potentially being bait and switched to doing lowcode despite needing to be some on paper super coder to get the job :face_with_tears_of_joy:",Super-Blackberry19,2026-01-18 16:17:21,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1qf6xt2,False,

During my year off I ran nearly every day - I ran about 2000 miles in 2022. This is one of the lifestyle changes that really stuck with me even after returning to work.* Some trips - went camping, went on a few domestic and international trips* Seriously learn Japanese - I had been learning Japanese off and on for years, but toward the end of my hiatus I lived a few months in Tokyo and attended a Japanese language school. Massively improved my skills.* A lot of reading - normal literature, not tech/business books.* Getting _more_ cats - Through an unexpected confluence of events, I adopted a third cat.I basically did not touch a computer for the entire time I was off.

I had no plan for any of this, the mental hump was huge after an entire career of never having to touch savings or investments.* Health insurance is fucking expensive - I live in a decent state when it comes to healthcare and insurance, and I had to buy marketplace insurance for the entire time I was unemployed. $1200/month for two people, for a medium-level plan. This, after spending years of paying $0 to a pittance for top-tier insurance from any employer I had.* Having a lot of unstructured time - the first couple weeks were almost surreal, waking up and having literally nothing to do.* Getting back into a ""I should probably work again"" mindset - I could have gone on for longer, though by the 12-month mark I was like ""yeahhh, I think my tech ennui has passed.""But in terms of just having all that time to myself and thinking about how it got me to where I am today, yeah, worth it.",SofaAssassin,2026-01-23 12:39:38,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1qkn42u,False,

But chances are that you just need to know how to call e.g. OpenAI API and build systems that use LLM as a service.

If all you're seeing in sprint planning is tasks getting assigned 1 points, perhaps the next interesting question for you to ponder is how do these tasks get formulated in the first place.

I billed them $500+ USD for this but not before giving them an estimate and plan. So OP, it’s criminal that your assessment is not paid. And as others have mentioned, even if you’ve done it, it’s not guaranteed that they will read, test and give feedback. And it will break you mentally after learning and building something so intensively just to get ghosted. FYI, I did pass mine and got an offer, as well as feedback after the assessment. Which is the best case scenario, paid intense work, feedback + offer. Also for context, this assessment is requested after 3 rounds of interviews.I do not recommend you taking the assessment because you’re technically not in the interview loop yet, and your worse case scenario is unpaid intense work (and not sure if you’ve done it properly since it’s your first time), no offer + no feedback.

It’s definitely harder than getting a regular job but honestly just requires a lot of preparation. The more experience you have the easier it becomes as well.My current company only really hires interns and new grads from top 10 schools, and in the case of new grads you need 1+ FAANG or similar internship as well.For intermediates and seniors though, we hire anyone who we think is experienced enough and can pass our interview.My advice to you is spend the next 3-4 years excelling at your current job as much as you possibly can, and take on as much responsibility and difficult projects as you can.When you’re ready to hop, spend about 4-6 months slowly preparing for interviews.

o0f46op,"Part of my job is mentoring the Team and Tech leads that report to me. A couple of them are 15+ years my senior, and just ended up ""stuck"" at that level. Both of these guys are very smart, great developers, and good mentors to the Junior and Senior engineers on their teams. Their problem is the same thing I've seen skilled developers fall prey to over and over again throughout my career: lack of understanding of the business impact of their job.You likely have seen this as you've done Product Owner/Manager roles, so you're already ahead of the game. At the end of the day, though, lots of developers don't want to think about what they are doing in the context of the business, either because they just want to focus on the how and not the why, or because they are afraid of dealing with something that isn't as clean and clear-cut as solving a technical problem. Both of these Leads at my company have these sentiments, despite them understanding that they need to do more.The thing that helped me advance in my career and make sure never to stagnate, was to develop the business skills that helped me understand just how my work as a developer directly impacted the business. It helped me understand what to focus on, how to prioritize work that got the most impact internally and externally, and how to communicate critical needs to business stakeholders, especially in the form of long term support in favor of building tons of shiny new features as fast as possible.Those skills have proven to be transferable in a way that mastery of a specific language or framework simply haven't. I was stuck as a JavaScript dev for the first 8 years of my career, despite moving into a Team Lead role, because I wasn't focusing on the business problems as a whole and instead acted as the tool used to implement a solution someone else came up with. It was in this role that I started to be exposed to the larger discussions around what we were building, and why, which helped me realize that if I added my own voice to the conversation, I could influence what was happening and be seen as much more valuable than a simple code monkey.This helped me pivot to other languages and frameworks, including hopping from entirely Node/Vue.js as my stack to .NET/React with no real experience in either. I could understand the business reasons for why decisions were being made, which convinced my soon to be boss to hire me and take the chance that I could get up to speed on their stack in a reasonable amount of time.Now that I am in management, I use those skills constantly, but I still actively try to code in my spare time. For this, AI has been immensely helpful! I use Claude Code daily, whether its for doing the bulk of the super basic coding that I'd probably have done with snippets anyways while I handle the complex business logic, or having it explain the codebases I have access to but don't work in and still need to help make technical decisions for. I basically treat Claude as a pocket engineer who never needs to sleep, gets way too eager and excited and sometimes needs to be reigned in, but is still clever and helpful. I've used it to help me build fully custom applications specific to my company, Claude API cloud agents that help my engineers debug their work completely autonomously, and basically just manage my day to day work life.All of this is to say that you can still work on the things you are good at, enjoy doing, and still be a coveted asset companies would fight to have. Embrace AI as a way to level up the skills you already have and fill in the gaps you're missing. If you use it as a crutch while you're learning the strategic thinking required to lead a technology company, even if you have no desire to be a CTO/CEO, you'll be able to navigate this new AI powered world while still doing what you love. You don't have to go into management to influence the direction of a company either.

o0jrw58,"The best way is really taking an interest in the discussions around what you and your team are building. This is obviously easier if you are part of an organization with a product team, but there are always stakeholders in every project. Instead of sitting back and being assigned work, ask why that decision was made. Play the junior card and your desire to learn, you'd be surprised just how many people get excited to explain why they have made a decision. Ask to shadow the discussion with stakeholders, then debrief with the other members of your team. Its important to remember that this is going to be extra work outside of your normal responsibilities, so you still need to get all of your work done or else you can lose peoples' trust. But the skill of learning from people more experienced and rapidly absorbing new knowledge is critical to succeeding long term as a software developer.Also, use AI as a coach. Even if you aren't allowed to use AI at work, you can still generally get away with telling it roughly the feature/functionality/application you and your team are building, the context of your company, and relevant tech stacks, then have it explain what it thinks are the likely business decisions. Then take that to the people involved in deciding the work that's been done and explain ""your thoughts"" and see how they line up. If you are allowed to use AI at work, instead of using it as a fancy auto-complete try to use it as a pair programming coach and have it explain why decisions and patterns may have been used. All this needs to be done with a healthy understanding that the AI very likely could be wrong, but at least it gives you a jumping off point to go confirm with somene who knows.",ShockinglyApparent,2026-01-19 21:16:09,2,cscareerquestions,t1_o0fws64,False,
o0k0mlp,"The most organic way is to insert yourself into discussions involving decisions made with stakeholders. At a more senior level, you should have the knowledge and skills to be able to look at an abstract problem and implement a robust solution. The key here is that often times engineers with those skills still act like more junior devs, simply taking orders and doing things how they are always done at the company. This is where you can approach these discussions from your side. Instead of simply taking orders, insert yourself into stakeholder discussions and talk through what they are looking for and give options on how to build what they want. You'll have to come prepared with the ability to explain what you want to implement at a level that less/non-technical people can understand. But if you keep showing up with good solutions on how to implement what people want, and can deliver on that implementation, you'll start to get invited to more and more of these discussions. Also, use AI to brainstorm and propose new design patterns for features. There's always the caveat that AI can very likely be wrong, but its a good jumping off point. Since you're new to it, just treat it like a conversation with another developer. Tell the agent when its wrong or has made a mistake and constantly give it new context. Ask it how you can improve the information you're giving it to help it come up with better answers. I am constantly getting better at working with AI agents, because I just throw problems at it and see what works. It seems kind of silly to think of it as a skill, but you really do get better working with them simply by putting in the time. I pay for the $100/month Claude Max plan and find it incredibly worth it, because I can have an idea and blitz my way through a rough implementation and decide if its worth pursuing, while also getting better at working with the agent, all in my personal time. At work, I am lucky enough to have the budget to spend a fairly sizable amount of money on Claude API tokens, primarily because I have proven the value of it to my boss, but I wouldn't have gotten there if I hadn't been experimenting on fun personal projects like my homelab server, custom websites and webapps for little hobby projects, and a healthy chunk of home automation.As far as resources go, one of the best books I was introduced to by a college professor of mine is called The Lean Startup by Eric Ries. It may be about building a startup, but the skills are extremely transferable to existing companies. Every single business needs to spend resources efficiently to survive, and understanding where you can deliver value the most is key to success. Also, I very recently discovered Lenny's Newsletter, which is a site with an enormous amount of content around Product development, Engineering, and how leaders in the AI space use AI to run their businesses and professional lives. I've just started digging into it, but its been really eye opening on how I have just been scratching the surface of using AI, and I already have several fully custom AI tools in use that I build explicitly to help me manage my teams at work.",ShockinglyApparent,2026-01-19 21:59:33,1,cscareerquestions,t1_o0hw77i,False,
