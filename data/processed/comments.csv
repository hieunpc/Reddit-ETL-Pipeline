nx2hiqn,"I think Bill is right about the symptoms; however, I think he misidentifies the cause.Modern data architecture has shifted; not because data warehousing is dead, but because it is no longer the only thing organisations need. Today’s platforms have to support analytics, data science, and increasingly AI workloads alongside traditional BI.The criticism of Databricks and Snowflake feels a little unfair; they are not trying to replace data warehousing fundamentals, they are trying to support multiple workloads. Both platforms can absolutely deliver a well-designed data warehouse if the right discipline is applied.In my experience, the real issue is people rather than platforms; there is a strong tendency to chase modern tools and certifications while neglecting core concepts such as data modelling and integration. I regularly see engineers openly say they have no interest in modelling, which I would argue is foundational to being effective in this space.So I agree with the spirit of the post; that we have lost sight of fundamentals. I do not think modern platforms are the culprit; they simply expose gaps in skills and architectural thinking that were always there.",Peanut_-_Power,2026-01-01 12:03:11,142,dataengineering,t3_1q1174f,False,
nx2oa4i,"I think the core issue here is not Databricks or Snowflake. I mostly agree with the other commentator who said the cause is misidentified. In data analytics and engineering the real problems are and always have been people and processes. Technology only enables them. What actually got us here is weak data management and governance.That said, I also partly agree with the criticism. Modern data stack tooling has reached a point where many organizations think that throwing Databricks or Snowflake at every data problem and calling it done is enough. This is especially true in organizations where IT (which should not be the owner of data in the first place) is expected to “fix” data issues. They look for technological solutions to what are, in reality, problems of processes, roles, ownership, and culture. In that sense, the frustration expressed by Inmon is very much understandable.So the concept of the data warehouse did not fail. Technology simply made it easier to avoid the hard work. Vendors and consultants sold a convenient illusion. Integration and enterprise data are not a tooling problem, they are a design choice and an organizational commitment, and a governance problem. Expecting a platform to solve that is exactly the mistake that keeps repeating itself. Blaming modern platforms for the decline of data warehousing feels like blaming a database for poor data modeling.

You can build data pipelines in declarative (SQL) or procedural way (Python).Then once you start to accumulate some data, you can use the platform as data governance tool using Unity Catalog and control who can access what or check data lineage.With sufficient amount of good quality data, you can start opening up the platform for data science team to let them train & manage ML models or create GenAI-powered application.You can further open up the platform for your Data/BI analysts team for data analysis purpose. Databricks has this AI-powered coding assistant called Databricks Assistant which can help your data analysts with SQL or Python syntax should they need it.If any of your software devs (or data scientist turned software engineer) are required to build web applications, there is Databricks Apps to let you build a web app based on popular frameworks like Flask/Streamlit or even NodeJS. Lakebase can also help if you need low-latency OLTP database for your web app.You can also open up Databricks to your business users, business stakeholders, or C-level to let them ask questions about data using Genie or to let them view dashboards. If those business users accessing Databricks directly, you can minimize the array of menu down using an access control called Permissions.

nwtian6,"Hi I work with Pydantic and dataclasses everyday and I think I can explain this well.Pydantic - mostly used when there is any input/output that needs to be validated, a good example is let's say I want to integrate with some external service, if I have to call their endpoints with any specific payload Pydantic makes sure that my outgoing data to that service will always have these fields and I can write custom rules for a Pydantic class to enforce certain conditions. Same works for if any service decides to call my endpoints, I can stop any processing to happen if request data to my endpoint is wrong.Dataclasses - used mainly for internal data transfer. An example for this is, let's say after my Pydantic validation occurs I now want to move around the fields I can set them in a dataclasses and move them around with pass by value/ reference. Now I can do this with Pydantic also but why I shouldn't. Pydantic does have an overhead when it parses the field this is very small but I've hit cases when it matters (Pydantic v2 is faster). Dataclasses are faster when I've already validated the data internal transfer is faster and makes more sense to use a dataclass when I just need to move and play around with the data. Additional point database updates I would make a data access layer which would be validated against the schema. I use SQL alchemy here for the models some people use Pydantic here too, optional honestly. This way it makes it easier to unit test too when you abstract everything and loosely coupled.

Not a big deal for a small/solo project, but at scale it can introduce unintended changes if upstream schemas evolve (new columns, renamed columns, type changes) and can impact downstream models silently.* Your models appear to be **full refreshes** (not incremental), meaning tables are recreated on each `dbt run`.

nxez9bl,"At my last job I built out a bunch of different ETL pipelines over about 4 years. At different layers of the stack there's different approaches.For custom API extractor's, I wrote the first two as completely separate. Then when I was working on the third, I started by copy-pasting stuff from the first two, looked at where things were identical and put as much of the overlapping code as I could into a library. Then I made all of our future extractors use that library. We were writing them in go so this took the form of an interface which extended `io.reader` that the custom extractor would implement.For loading, using the aforementioned library produced data in a standard format along with a schema file that could be used to generate a snowflake load statement. Then we had a single snowflake load component defined in our task orchestrator which we re-used everywhere, changing only the configuration. (We used argo-workflows as our task orchestrator instead of Airflow. I... don't recommend doing that)And then for transform jobs, I'd conceptually sort them into two categories. 1) Transforms which you can determine programmatically from some sort of metadata. This could be standard transformations you perform on every table like an upsert, or it could be parsing fields out of a JSON document based on a schema. You should generate these SQL statements with code. You can have that code be DBT macros, use code-gen to generate DBT statements, or just generate and run the SQL statements from your application. I'm not a huge fan of abusing DBT macros for stuff like this because I find JINJA to be kind of messy, but a lot of people swear by it. Probably comes down to personal preference. As for having the code that generates the SQL statements also run it, you should avoid this unless you directly benefit from detecting and implementing schema change on-the-fly. Otherwise just having a daily/weekly pull request that you generate with a script is probably fine.2) Custom business logic transformations. I wouldn't do anything special here. If it's in DBT that's enough standardizaiton.Then once you're writing custom transformations you can kind of do whatever you want.

Also, if you did a merge statement instead of a copy into (just assuming I guess) on primary key, it would probably fix the dupe issue, even if the API returned everything every time.

nxj35zd,"From a data practitioner’s perspective, IDP delivers value, but not in the glossy way demos suggest. In real pipelines, the biggest gains aren’t perfectly structured outputs, they’re time saved on discovery and triage. Analysts, data engineers, and analytics managers spend far less time opening PDFs, scanning documents, or hunting for the “right” version. Error rates improve mainly because fewer documents are missed or misinterpreted early, not because extraction is flawless. Complexity still exists, but teams get faster at deciding what matters and what needs attention, which is often the real bottleneck.For data roles, this is where a local, intelligence-driven system like VaultBook has had practical advantages. Instead of forcing everything into schemas upfront, it keeps documents intact and applies intelligence at the retrieval layer. Data analysts quickly surface related reports, prior assumptions, or historical decisions. Data scientists revisit source material tied to experiments or models without re-parsing files. Managers review contracts, specs, and analysis together in context. Because the intelligence runs locally and focuses on relevance rather than brittle extraction, workflows stay simpler. The measurable benefit is less context switching, faster recall, and fewer “did we already analyze this?” moments.

Change it from ""Schema only"" to ""Schema and data"" (or ""Data only"" if you just want inserts). That will include insert statements for your data.For views and security objects like users/permissions, the wizard sometimes skips them by default. Make sure they’re selected under ""Choose Objects""—expand the tree to manually include your View and Security options. For user permissions, you might have to script those out separately, as SSMS sometimes leaves out the explicit DENY/GRANT statements for users.Once you've done this, your .sql file should include create table statements, insert statements for your data, view definitions, and possibly some user/permission scripts. Double-check the final script to see if everything you need is there—sometimes for things like user permissions, you'll have to supplement with a bit of hand-written SQL at the end.Good luck!

nww3h12,"I'm gonna tell you something that took me way too long to figure out and honestly still pisses me off that nobody just said it to me directly when I was your age.Stop building shit to impress other programmers. Start building shit that actual people need.You're seventeen, and coded for like 6 years? Cool. I was similar. And I wasted years, like genuinely wasted them building technically complicated garbage that nobody used. I'd make elaborate systems with clean architecture and clever algorithms and other developers would be like ""wow nice"" and I felt smart. But you know what? That's just jerking off. Nobody outside of programmer circles gave a shit because none of it solved actual problems.The real turning point isn't learning another framework or getting better at leetcode or whatever (ofc that's important too at some point). It's when you stop asking ""what's a hard technical challenge I can tackle"" and start asking ""who around me has an annoying problem I could maybe fix"". And I mean really asking. Not imagining problems, not building solutions looking for problems, actually talking to real humans about real annoying shit in their lives.I wish I'd done at seventeen instead of building my tenth todo app with a new fancy tech stack. Go find someone, it can be your parents, a teacher, local business owner, literally anyone, and ask them what repetitive annoying thing they deal with. Then build the dumbest, simplest possible thing that makes that less annoying. Not elegant. Not impressive to other devs. Just useful.For an Example, my friend used to manually copy-paste data from emails into spreadsheets for her work every morning. Took her like 45 minutes. I could've built a script that parsed those emails and dumped it into a CSV in literally an afternoon. But I didn't, because that wasn't ""interesting"" to me. I was too busy implementing a custom database engine for a project nobody would ever use because I wanted to understand B-trees. See the problem? She had a real problem that cost her actual time every single day. I had the skills to fix it in hours. But I never even asked because I was focused on impressing myself and other programmers.This will humble you hard. All that clean code and design patterns everyone is proud of... Nobody cares when they can't figure out how to log in. The clever optimization doesn't matter when they just need a button that exports to Excel because that's what their boss wants. You know what's funny? Even Linus Torvalds had to learn this lesson. When he built Git, he didn't start by designing the perfect distributed version control system architecture. He started because he was pissed off at BitKeeper and needed something that worked for the Linux kernel workflow, specifically handling huge numbers of patches from contributors he didn't fully trust. Git's internals are actually kind of ugly if you look at them. It's basically a content-addressable filesystem with some scripting on top. But it solved the actual problem he had, which was managing kernel development. All the elegant design came later after people were already using it. He built for the problem, not for the architecture. That's why Git won and all those ""better designed"" version control systems nobody remembers lost.Or another time, built an inventory system with proper relational database design, normalized tables, foreign keys, the works. User wanted to bulk-edit 50 items at once. Couldn't do it because I'd built individual edit pages and never thought about bulk operations. They just stopped using it and went back to Excel where they could edit multiple rows. My database design was objectively better than Excel. But Excel let them do their actual job faster, so Excel won.You'll realize pretty quick that like 80% of what you thought was important is completely irrelevant and all the boring stuff you ignored is what actually matters. Authentication, error messages that actually tell you what went wrong, handling edge cases like what if they upload a file that's too big, making sure it works on their old laptop with Chrome from 2019, having an undo button, that's the stuff that makes or breaks whether someone actually uses your thing.This field is packed with people who started young. I've met self-taught developers who picked it up at 25 and they're way better than me at a lot of things because they focused on solving problems instead of collecting technical skills like they're achievements in a video game. There's a guy I used to work with who switched from being a chef at 28, learned to code at a bootcamp, and he's one of the best developers I know. Why? Because he spent 10 years in restaurants learning how to handle stress, communicate with difficult people, and deliver under pressure. Those skills transferred.

nx7cykl,"Most people responding in this thread are wrong. They’re coming from only their own personal experience and they don’t realize how much variation there actually is between people. I’ve taught software engineering to a couple hundred people. There is a spectrum for what you’re describing. I used to call it rabbit hole vs. fuzziness. Some people are comfortable moving on with just a vague understanding of a topic (these people are “fuzzy” on the details). Others can’t move on until they’ve understood every last piece (they get lost down the rabbit hole). Go too far on the spectrum in either direction and you have problems. In my experience with people learning programming, you run into way more people having problems because they’re too “fuzzy.” But you DO get some people who struggle because they consistently go too far down the rabbit hole — even when working on a specific project, even with a tight deadline. You should 100% address this. I have two tips:First, keep a very dynamic, organized todo list. What I mean is, before you start working on pretty much anything, you should explicitly write out high-level goals and todo items. Generally, what do you aim to accomplish? And what do you think the high-level steps are that you need to take to get there? Then as you work (and get a better sense of what needs to be done on a granular level), start to populate more specific sub todos (nested/indented below the correct parent todo). Cross todo items off as you complete them — and add more as you realize you’re missing them. You should be switching back and forth between doing the work and managing the todo list. Keep the todo list correctly organized in a hierarchy (sub todos indented below the correct parent). This process is helpful for a number of reasons, but in your case the biggest one is it helps keep you focused on the bigger picture. You’re constantly reminded how what you’re doing fits in to getting you to your initially stated goal. That way you’re working toward the goal rather than being distracted by every single thing you don’t totally understand.Keep a separate list of open questions. Writing them down can help you resist the urge to chase down all the answers right away.

nxa9ypm,"A socket is provided by the OS as a means for different processes to communicate, essentially acting like a file handle. You can write to it or read from it to send or receive data. It’s like a mailbox where the OS acts as the mailman and figures out how to transport the mail. Sockets don’t necessarily need an address - e.g. you could have an anonymous socket for communicating between processes on the same computer. In this case, it’s usually held in memory by the OS kernel until the socket is closed. Sockets can also be local-only, and are often bound to a file path so other processes can also go find the socket and send mail to your program.When you’re writing an HTTP server you *do* want an address so that others can send you mail (HTTP requests), so when you bind to a socket with a specific port you’re telling the OS “if you get any letters to this address, stick them in my mailbox.” By binding your socket to a port, you’re giving it an address that is reachable over the network. Otherwise, you couldn’t have a server that just sits and waits for requests - nobody has a way to send your program any requests!Here’s a pretty good [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/D26sUZ6DHNQ) that explains sockets simply and in better detail than many developers ever know or care to learn. In practice, you usually just need to know that it’s a stream of data handled by the OS, very similar to reading/writing files, and how that data is handled beyond that is not really your application’s business. It is helpful to know that sockets usually stay open for a while after you’re done with them (in case the other side has more data to send), and you’re limited in the number of sockets you can create, so it’s prudent to reuse sockets where possible rather than open new ones regularly.",TheRealKidkudi,2026-01-02 17:22:39,103,learnprogramming,t3_1q23wv6,False,

This is, again, something that comes with experience.As far as what technologies survive long term? Well, bash and linux scripting, javascript (specifically async), sql (on the administration and optimization side), and react state as a design pattern I feel are all key. Linux in particular hasn't changed much since I learned the basics 20 years ago.Good ideas will persist and better ideas will replace them over time. This is just how it goes.

nwnncea,"source: Professional Programmer since 1990Here are some skills which, in my experience, help keep people in demand. These are all skills one can learn, hone and master if you want.6. Learn the basics. Understand how computers works, how software works. For instance, what is actually happening when a line of code calls an api function and gets a result? Become familiar with general architectural principles/patterns to help know when to apply what, and to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different tools and frameworks. For instance, understand why certain architectures, languages and frameworks exist, and their pros/cons. Why does C matter in some cases, while in others Python or R might be a better choice? When should you use third-party libraries and frameworks, and when should you not take on extra dependencies? This leads to the next item. 5. Moving comfortably between deep debugging and a wider perspective and knowing when to dive in, when to zoom out, and how to switch quickly between the two.6. Scoping problems quickly. Recognising when you have enough information to act, and when you need to pause and go andlearn more.1. Be good at delivery. Being able to get things done and helping manage your work well. If people can trust you to get things done, they are more likely to want you on their team. Everyone takes time to get better at estimation. Practice getting better by reflecting on why sometimes things took longer/shorter and where you might need to plan better. 2. Knowing when to move fast and accept trade-offs, and when to slow down and lift quality. Knowing to trade off quality, reliability, (all the 'ilities') etc 2. Always be learning. Stay curious about new ideas and whether they make things better or worse. Spending regular time getting hands-on with new technology, techniques, processes and engineering practices matters. There is endless information out there, so be selective, but genuinely interested. Whatever your preferred medium for learning is, make sure you get a good spectrum of quality info3. Being able to step out of the code and talk to senior leaders about risks, benefits and costs. This means understanding the bigger picture well enough to help them make decisions that affect the organisation, without getting lost in detail. You have to be genuinely interested in their problems to really understand them. They will appreciate it generally.4. Bringing technical and non-technical people together to solve problems, both day to day and long term. Knowing who to involve and when is a very great skill. This can be applied whether you're in an org or working in your business for others 7. Being a heavyweight engineer. Someone with N years of deep experience and judgement, not the same year repeated N times.8. Be good at spotting trends and patterns early and calling them out so plans can be adjusted in time. This applies at every level, from yourself and peers, all the way to the big bosses.9. Being a decent person. Don't be the twat that thinks they know everything and treats others with disdain. Even if you do know more, you should treat people with respect. Some will be dicks who don't return the favour, but most people I've found just want to do good work and get on in lif. If you treat them with decency, they are far more likely to help you achieve your goals. 10. Be a producer. Most people are consumers of stuff. If you go out of your way to be a producer. This could be as simple as taking time to share your knowledge with others, or even speaking up in discussions, even to ask questions. You'll be more noticed and more likely to be in their mind when people want to get something done. Often this leads directly to getting better work and with it more impactful rewards. This is a bit of a haphazard list. And you'll see that I've not listed any particular tech. It took me a long time to transition from being quiet and technical to being more interested in the bigger picture and interacting with others more. I really wish I had this list when I was a junior. Overall, this transition, I feel, has made my software engineering much better.",inwegobingo,2025-12-30 02:05:25,12,learnprogramming,t3_1pyu6e8,False,

If you're wanting to deploy something with Docker then pick something that can run in a Docker Container, figure out how to containerize it or if it's already done try to figure out what they did to get the project container ready, look into how the container is built, and then look at the steps needed to deploy the project somewhere.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqjA04\_dpk&t=4239s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqjA04_dpk&t=4239s) You learn SQL, C, Python, HTML/JS/CSS, Networking, and Flask. Generally, you \*alone\* decide what you need to know based on the problems you would like to solve. Nobody else does. The deep knowledge beyond 'checkboxes someone told you to fill' comes from your own independent learning. To learn 'real coding', pick something in your life you want to automate, or you wish was better. That's the key. Toy projects are fine, but it is nice to make something someone can use. Say you are in a Discord server, why not make a bot that does some useful task? As you make the bot, let people test the commands, see if they identify errors. The Python classes you teach to kids, what resources do they have to learn? Wouldn't it be nice if they had a pretty website with all the information related to the course? Wouldn't it be nice if they had a Leetcode style interface to do problems at your website? Wouldn't you want to tell them, ""Hey kids, look at this website \*I made\*, let me know if there are any problems with it?""Is there any software you use you think is dated? As you make these useful projects, you get a hunger for wanting to improve it incrementally. You identify the necessary technologies to learn as you make these useful projects.if you were making my website suggestion, the learning could be like this: \---1. ""i wanna make a website. how do i make a barebones site?"" -> consult youtube, perhaps watch Harvard CS50 for an HTML introduction, watch other youtubers you like. copy down the examples the lecturers give, maybe afterwards start writing your own barebones site. when you start writing, you consult documentation for intricate questions. learning generally goes: YOUTUBE VIDEO \[brief intro\] -> WRITE CODE -> CONSULT DOCUMENTATION | Repeat.2. ""i wish the site was pretty!"" -> learn css, watch a vid on css, put it in your site3. ""damn, this code is getting messy... maybe i need this fancy react.js format to make the webpage snappier & stop repeating myself."" -> learn react.js, watch a video, start writing it, consult documentation as needed4. ""i wish the kids had a pretty editor they could write in... oooh what's this, monaco editor? i'll use it in my project.""5. ""what's this tailwind css thing i've heard about? it could make making my site prettier easy, lets try it.""6. ""hmmm... i want my site to have a backend so they can submit code."" \*google\* ""oh, what's this, Judge0 is a framework that allows me to implement a judging system for the coding problems students submit?"" ""hmm... flask is good for site backends? lemme try it out!"" \---Learn by DOING... there are 'buzzwords' to know, such as: Docker, Tailwind CSS, PostgresSQL, CI/CD, Flask, Django, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.

Something that’s bitting more than you can chew can be good. It forces you to think about modularity and separation of logic.

I don’t see much value in inventing my own Netflix or re-implementing an HTTP library, especially when AI can do that with a single prompt.Because of this, I sometimes feel like I didn’t manage to get into the industry in time — and at the same time, that the industry itself might soon look very different from what it is now.And on top of that, there’s real life: buying a home, raising kids, all the usual responsibilities.I guess overall I’m just worried about how to live this life the right way.",LaoMaks,2026-01-04 03:25:32,2,learnprogramming,t1_nxgohek,True,

AI will be/is important and will be/is generating this stuff super easy and quick, but it’s not quite that simple…..A few months ago I decided to dive into Identity in ASP.NET (basically built in .NET authentication) and .NET does so much of the heavy lifting. It abstracts all the details away, allowing you to just focus on plugging it in, creating your policies and then focusing on your business logic instead of infrastructure.However…. I sort of quickly realised, that if you don’t understand how it works internally, the abstractions don’t really help or make it any better. You still have to call the relevant methods in the relevant order, and understand what’s going on in order to get the most from it. The abstractions, just save you having to write your implementations… it’s not a substitute for understanding how it works.I see AI as the same. It’s an abstraction. We ask it to generate code, it does. That saves us time and speeds up development, but if we’re unable to understand the inner workings, we won’t be able to get the most out of it. The best way to learn is to build. So build these solutions yourself, and understand how these work not because you’ll be building these yourself in the future but because it is imperative you understand the inner workings to get the most from AI generated code….",smbutler93,2026-01-04 09:27:00,2,learnprogramming,t1_nxk99ol,False,

Even if I go deep, build things properly, and really learn how they work internally — will there actually be an employer willing to take a chance on someone without formal work experience? In many cases, resumes are filtered out automatically before a human even sees them if you don’t have 3–5 years of relevant experience.Part of me knows that building something unique, finishing a real project, and showing it publicly might be a way to bypass the traditional job search. That also takes time, just in a different way. And realistically, 6 months isn’t a long time at all — maybe even 1–2 years isn’t.So for now, I’m trying to treat programming as a serious hobby and long-term investment, and see where it leads. No matter how the industry changes, I still believe that understanding programming fundamentals will become almost mandatory, and once you have that, switching languages or technologies is much easier.I’ve also been living outside my home country for 6 years, and while things are generally fine, being a foreigner adds extra friction to everything — internships, official employment, even simple life stuff.

nwlnmze,"The best source for learning OOP is learning Smalltalk. Squeak is a modern Windows implementation. Don't go crazy learning the language like you're going to make a career of it - if you're fast at picking up syntax, you'll probably do the most learning in just a few hours. Smalltalk is a single-paradigm, OOP language. It is **THE** OOP language most modern OOP has derived from.The principles of OOP are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism; but these principles (idioms) don't *MAKE* OOP, they each exist in nearly every other programming paradigm - imperative programming has all of these idioms. These principles *FALL OUT* of OOP as a natural consequence.OOP is the paradigm of message passing. I don't move your arms for you - nor do I COMMAND you to open your umbrella, I just have to tell you it's raining. You have autonomy and agency to do whatever is appropriate in response. You could ignore me, you could open your umbrella, you could tell me to buzz off, you could call the police.Objects are a black box that can send and receive messages. In C++, standard streams are the de facto message passing interface, and you have to integrate some of it's interfaces into your implementation - for us, we have implementation level control over the details. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level feature built right in, which is convenient, which was conventional for the 50s and 60s, but Bjarne took certain issue with that - hence he made C++ the way it is.An object is implemented in terms of state and functions. Your state is typically member fields and objects. Encapsulation *isn't* about tightly coupling functions with **DATA**, it's about classes modeling behaviors by enforcing invariants in member state. Data is bulky and dumb - data doesn't DO stuff. State is an implementation detail. A car has an engine, and so the throttle has to pass a message to the carburetor to accelerate. An engine has an RPM, which is just a number. In C++, you'd mix these types and concepts, in Smalltalk even numbers are objects.Smalltalk is very dynamic and has no type safety. You can ask an integer to capitalize itself; at runtime, it can either ignore the message, or respond with a `:dontknowmessage`, or defer to an exception handler. C++ allows for type safety - another reason Bjarne invented C++, but there's a fair amount of syntax to go with it.Very few multi-paradigm languages get OOP correct. The 1990s were TERRIBLE for OOP. Eternal September came in 1993 - when more people entered comp-sci than the industry as a whole could absorb and mentor them; OOP was oversimplified to the point of being wrong, but the egotistical blind were confidently leading the blind, who couldn't have known better.As a result, you get ""C with Classes"", which is what I'd call most all of it - even in Python. It's actually a strictly imperative style that doesn't have an OOP bone in its body. Getters and setters are a consequence of the C type system, and are often seen in frameworks - but if you're not writing in C, if you're not writing a framework, they're an anti-pattern. Classes model behaviors and enforce invariants - a car can accelerate, turn, stop and start... They can't get make, get model, get year. The car doesn't use those properties to implement it's behavior. Those properties can be associated with the car in a map or table.There are many kinds of polymorphism, and late binding (virtual functions) are just one of them. Javascript has this in spades since you can just ASSIGN additional functions to instances - they are not strictly bound to a prototype. There are several kinds of static and dynamic polymorphisms - function overloading, type erasure, multi-dispatch, overlapping types, indirection...Then inheritance principally models IS-A aggregation or HAS-A composition. There are other types, like C++ has LIKE-A. While neat, inheritance is often misunderstood and misapplied - for everything you might think you want to use it for, presume you're wrong, first.---If you want a book on the subject, the seminal tome is `A Theory of Objects (Monographs in Computer Science)`. Good luck meeting anyone who has ever heard of it, let alone read it. When I tell you you'll likely never meet a developer who has the first clue what OOP is, I mean it. This is our industry's singularly biggest Dunning-Kruger.Note that Java has no de facto message passing interface. Not like Smalltalk. Not like C++. Many languages, like ECMAScript, Java, and C# are so fundamentally wrong about OOP they'll tell you that function calls ARE message passing. Absolutely insane.

But everyone SAYS this is right. There is nothing OOP about this code whatsoever. The principles don't make the paradigm, the paradigm makes the principles. In Java, you need to make messages and a mechanism for passing them between objects.You can create objects in Java, but Java isn't inherently Object Oriented. Having objects isn't enough. Fuckin' C has objects - it's explicitly in the language standard, but no one thinks of C as Object Oriented.I want you to have a chance of understanding what OOP is.You won't understand OOP until you study Smalltalk and original materials from the OOP era before the late 90s disaster.

It's one of those (mostly) low-pressure desk jobs that you do to make a stable income while you do what you really want to do in your free time. That said, it will contribute close to nothing when it comes to helping a career in game dev. The knowledge will 100% be helpful, but it won't help you get a programming job unless it's ultra entry-level (and 99% of game dev jobs aren't entry level).It is an excellent job to have for paying bills though, and depending on the environment/level of independence, it can give you lots of time both at home and at your desk to learn programming independently.

nwxfbse,"I’m assuming you’re a beginner and the software you write is not yet complex (ie just print stuff). Because I used to have the same questions when starting out years ago.Dicts and classes are different, but both can be made to do similar things (ie composing objects from scalar types).The difference is that, in most languages, classes provide neat abstraction features, like inheritance and methods, and greater control about how you can use it.Classes can be defined, shaped, and optimized however you like, while dictionaries will just be dictionaries which is optimized for doing 1 thing that is O(1) access time with acceptable storage for the key space.On optimizations, let’s say you’re modeling a square rectangles. With class, you can just define it as having 2 fields like this{ width: int, height: int }Every instance of this rectangle object will cost you 2 ints of memory space. If the int is 64 bit, then your rectangle is just 8+8=16 bytes each, and 10 rectangles will cost you 160 bytes.If you instead wish to use a hash map/dictionary to represent the rectangle with int width and height, that dictionary is probably using much more space than just 2 ints because how hash maps are implemented. If you have multiple such rectangles, it’ll waste more space pretty quickly due to having to initialize mostly empty map to store 2 values. Every insert incur further work as the program needs to hash and potentially resize the haystack or change hash function to fit more keys.Another thing to think about is a dictionary is just a hash map, so its access time is slower than just field access (it has to compute the hash value of the key, whereas with class, the location of the field value within the object is already known).Oh and another thing is with dict/map, you don’t know if you’re gonna have a value at that key unless, you know, you access it. This happens at runtime. With classes, it’s a compile error if you’re accessing the field that does not exist.Last thing is maintainability and DX - with maps, if you decide to change the “key” you’ve been using pervasively like class fields, you’re gonna have to change all occurrences of those string keys. Whereas with classes, your LSP might support renaming that field with just a press on F2. This is very useful when the codebase is huge.Use maps to store values when each key is considered sibling or equivalent to each other, e.g. mapping post codes to region names. Think of it like dynamic lists/arrays, but with key access instead of index access.Use classes to encapsulate more complex objects that you want to extend with methods and your own initialization rules, etc.I’m sure you’ll get it the more complex your program becomes.",artnoi43,2025-12-31 15:35:50,6,learnprogramming,t3_1q0f3qj,False,
nwxfs1r,"> Coming from python I keep defaulting to a dictionaryBased on the title, this seemed the likely issue.Classes essentially being wrappers for some key value pair structure is not unique to python, it does seem to show up in a few [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) language. Languages that impose strong typing can't usually get away this kind of thing.> for most cases where you need a data-holding object, do you just use a class?This is based on context. There are a few tuple syntax options. There is also a dynamic type which is pretty close to duck typing. Your basic typed options are struct, class and record. A record is a class with a lot of sugar and what I'll reach for initially.> c# the statement is so complexA code example would be good here.> I read that classes are faster in execution.Depends. Strong types allow for a lot of optimization. However, in the end, you're running functions against data.> need for all the explicit type declarationsDepends on where you want to fail. Using type declaration allow for a lot of issues to be caught at compile time. This mayn't seem like a big deal when the project is small, but... Imagine you have tens of thousands of lines of code and a pivotal object just changed structure. Perhaps a value that was once a string is now a number. That change can be tracked down easily in a typed language: the compiler will know. Without types you'll have to hope all your tests cover every point of failure for that.

nwycazd,"Classes are great bc they give you excellent compile time type and properly name checking. Python is so dynamic it doesn’t really matter, but having a statically typed compiler at your disposal catches a LOT of errors in code. It’s one of the things I actually love hate about say JavaScript. Everything is basically just a dictionary essentially (every object you can just ref properties by saying obj[“prop”]). To the point that some people want the flexibility of dynamic programming but will actually go to the effort of invoking the Rosslyn code generator to verify property names at compile time to get the benefits of both worlds. Like if you’re consuming a json file in a data dictionary you can use this feature to compile time verify property names and so forth. Personally I hate any form of loose typing bc it’s a ticking time bomb if not for you, another developer. I also hate string literals that aren’t defined in constants and magic numbers.

nwxf2xp,"So I think you are misinterpreting what a class is; a class is a language-based concept that allows you to create custom data structures that also have behavior (or member functions) attached to it. This allows you to make ANY data structure that you want that follows the rules of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Classes allow a language to be called object oriented, since in object oriented programming, the focus is on creating more and more of these data structures which when declared in code are called objects, hence object oriented programming.A dictionary is a data structure. So you can for instance create your own dictionary class implementation, though I’m sure one exists in the C# STL. So two completely different things essentially; a class/object is a programmer-implemented data structure with associated behavior(s) attached which follows the 4 laws of Object Oriented Programming, and a dictionary is a data structure that if you really wanted to you could implement that.As for your second question, explicit type declarations are very important in the programming world because they essentially allow one to know at all times a general idea of how many bytes/chunks of memory a variable is taking up, as well as help with avoiding implicit type conversions which can cause a lot of issues. You won’t see this come up much as a beginner but the second you start working on anything that’s a bit complex, you will see why this is a big deal. This was something that I struggled with when I started in JavaScript, as the dynamically interpreted types would lead to really odd behavior at unexpected times. This becomes more apparent the further you get towards the hardware; python is built upon a great deal of layers to emulate natural language to its best ability, whereas in C/assembly you are dealing with extremely explicit operations that having a byte offset could cause the entire program/system to crash. To give even more explicit control for this reason, you will later see C/C++ users will use even more strict types like uint_32 and long long or even stranger looking types to someone who has never used lower level programming languages. Also, tbh, it just helps with readability, being able to know exactly what each type is defined as.As far as running a script, anything dealing with Windows is gonna be a pain in the ass (I’m an arch Linux user if u can’t tell by my windows cynicism) but it’s what u gotta do since C# is .NET. But essentially all the stuff u did in VS is just for programmer ease of mind, but really thats just an automation tool. Hell if you want to just open up a terminal and run a script real fast all you gotta do is type dotnet run [name of program].cs And it will run it. VS generates a ton of metadata files to help with the building process which is why it’s a pain in the butt to set up but once you do it will make it a little faster.Anyways do you have any other questions?

nwxityq,"Now, why use namespaces when it’s such a hassle? Why don’t we put everything in 1 file or 1 folder and have automatic access to code written in other files?TLDR: it’s for organizing large codebase. We can separate different concerns with namespaces.If you have organized folders for other computer files/works, why not source code?You probably don’t feel the need to modularize your code into modules/namespaces because your program is not yet complex enough.Imagine if we work at Google, with millions of lines of code. And now you want to name something specific to some implementation, maybe you want to implement search result for a TV. There’s a very high chance the name “SearchResult” is probably used somewhere in there. Without namespaces, we must come up with new names every time we want something different, like “SearchResultMobile”, “SearchResultMobileWeb”, “SearchResultTV”, and so onWith namespaces, each names or symbols are confined to only have meaning in its namespace, so you can have mobile.SearchResult, mobile_web.SearchResult, and tv.SearchResult instead. All code relating to TV implementation will live in the namespace “tv”, not cluttering other namespaces.Namespaces help separate concerns, and the “import” part is explicit - you have to define wht and where you want to bring symbols outside of our namespace (eg folder, in Go) into scope, to avoid you running/compiling code accidentally (which might be malicious or just bugs).My example might not be good, but at least it demonstrates the point.My tips: Whenever you are asking why programmers do stuff the way they do, imagine you have to work with big ass codebase (100k LoC++) with incompetent coworkers, and maintain that code for years, then you’ll understand why.",artnoi43,2025-12-31 15:53:19,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q0f3qj,False,

You need to spend time thinking about that, otherwise you will program for a whole lot of bad reasons.

Im also reading how linux works on the side although I dont really understand anything in that book tbh. My plan is to finish python crash course abd then work through the big book of small python projects and do it all on my kali system in vim and implement git once im done with chapter 11 but I kinda just hit a wall and haven't been putting in the same effort for the last 3 or 4 days and am afraid im falling off. And after python the plan is sql and then networking. All the while im worried that I dont know shit about computer architecture or organization or how os actually work. I also bought a raspberry pi to dabble around with because iot is also interesting. My biggest problem with I.t. has always been that there are so many avenues that its hard to choose what to do aside from the worry if one can actually even grasp what the hell one has taken upon themselves to learn. Like what if I invest x hours, days, weeks ,months and you dont learn squat?

So if you want to use the term ""functionally retarded"", you've come to the right person. Don't worry, I'm not offended.You do not need to know a lot of mathematics in order to succeed in the field. C is not significantly more math-intensive than any other language. Things like pointers are tricky for beginners, but those are tricky for beginners regardless of whether they're good at math or not.Modulus is something that will come up in any programming language. It's usually used to determine if a number is evenly divisible by another number. It's pretty easy, conceptually. Divide two numbers. Discard everything before the decimal point. That's modulo. Like, 9 % 3: That's 9/3, or 3.0. Discard the 3. You're left with 0.0. It's evenly divisible.Now do the same thing, 9 % 4. I'm pulling out my calculator for this part. That's 2.25. Discard the leading 2. You're left with 25. Not evenly divisible. In most cases, that's as far as you'll need to go with it.

If you build a game using raylib, you'll need to learn quite a bit. If you encounter difficult maths problems, someone has probably figured out how to do it so you don't have to work from scratch, and there are plenty of good resources online to learn the harder stuff. You'll also naturally develop your math skills as you progress as a programmer.I will now offer rambling unsolicited advice on learning math based on my own experience. I believe many people that believe they are bad at math are encountering two related problems that make it difficult to identify or articulate why learning math is harder for them relative to others. The first is missing prerequisite knowledge, the second is study methods that do not work or are inappropriate for them. The exception is for some cases where neurodevelopment and learning disabilities create hard limits, however in many cases these can be managed by adjusting your study methods (as was the case for me, as I have ADHD and dyspraxia).Learning math and learning to program are very similar in that there are foundational concepts/skills you need to learn or develop in a particular order before you can learn more advanced content. When I got to university I had a lot of gaps in my knowledge; elementary stuff that compounded from my early education through to high school (which I ended up dropping out of). This conceptual debt made it harder to progress over time, while others only had to learn one new concept to solve a problem, I might need 5 or 6, which snowballs very quickly. This also made the traditional lecture -> tutorial -> homework learning pipeline ineffective because it assumes you have certain prerequisite knowledge and they cant/won't help you identify specific concepts needed to catch up.I found it much easier to learn at home following youtube videos (I highly recommend organic chemistry tutor), khan academy lessons, resources on the r/learnmath mega thread, or good textbooks with clear progression and references to related previous topics. These formats are easy to pause if something is too advanced, giving you the opportunity to go learn prerequisites as you need, before returning to the original problem. To practice I would follow videos of worked examples, print 50-100 problems to work through, then mark my own answers to find if/where I was going wrong. I'd also return to reattempt packets of questions later. Now I have the ability to not only deal with difficult math problems day to day, but when I can't I have learned how to learn to solve things. Good luck, and apologies for the wall of text!TLDR; Don't worry.

Inheritance promotes this naturally, composition can as well through factory methods if designed well. So, assuming the calling code doesn't know or need to know the difference, we can look at the tradeoffs in the interface implementation.It is not clear to me how composition supports sharing of common behavior. It seems like it would require complex rules for the ""base"" class to execute or skip common behavior based on instructions from the ""derived"" class. This adds complexity to the delegation mechanism and reduces flexibility. In this simple C++ example, `derived::foo()` has flexibility to add to or completely replace `base::foo()`.

I am not sure how this flexibility can be supported with composition - would love to learn more about that.Furthermore, this inherent flexibility of inheritance supports unique implementation requirements. I believe with composition that must be designed into the equivalent ""base"" class from the start. It is impossible to think of all the odd requirements clients may have in the future. class base { public: virtual void foo(); protected: void bar(); }; class derived : public base { public: virtual void foo() override { // derived::foo() can choose to add to, or entirely replace base::foo() // derived also has access to base::bar() at any time. } };In the end, it is best to avoid ""this or that"" thinking.

Now about the tips:-do not implement stuff until you fully understand the logic behind it. Its really hard to debug a physics engine if you dont know how the state is supposed to look at each step of the process. (If you have to make the calculations by hand for some test cases, then do it, its slow but it helps a lot with debugging)-get yourself the best way of debugging you can. Something that lets you visualize stuff like the vertices, lines, bodies, variables, etc. Do not debug by guessing whats happening.-start small, make you engine by breaking it down into its smallest parts and making sure each small part works and connects easily to the rest of the code (like legos). Using assertions helps but im not sure the general opinion on assertions.-dont be against looking at the industry standard solutions. For example, if you are dealing with colision detection, trying to make your own version instead of just looking up the already existing algorithms (aabb, gjk, sat) is most likely going to take you longer and give you a worst result. The algorithms that already exist where created by really smart people with a lot of math and programming knowledge and, unless your use case is really strange, its probably better than anything most people could come up with.Lastly, seriously, this is a humongous task, you should only make a physics engine if you either-find it fun-want to learn-your use case truly cant use any existing engine",Omniscientcammaleon,2025-12-31 22:02:25,2,learnprogramming,t3_1q08ty9,False,

Knowing what to write and build is important.

Imagine wanting to skateboard and instead of taking things slow and mastering the basics you grab a long board and set yourself downhill. How do you see that ending? I used Claud code opus 4 for 3 months with context management and barely got any utility out of the code! This is after pouring countless hours in code refactoring cleaning and restructuring to reduce slope and keep the project manageable. At one point I deleted about 80% of the entire code base without any change to functionality! AI cannot reason! It can only fake reasoning. A more appropriate denomination for the technology would be pseudo intelligence! It generates a lot of slop and then takes that slop as input to generate even more slop!

When to Split into Modules*** **The Scroll Rule:** If you find yourself scrolling up and down constantly to find a function, split the file.* **Cognitive Load:** If a file handles Database logic *and* UI logic, split them. Keep files focused on one ""domain"" (e.g., [`database.py`](http://database.py), `api.py`).* **Reusability:** If you need a function in two different scripts, move it to a shared `utils` module.**3. Patterns to Learn Early*** **The Entry Guard:** Always wrap your execution logic. This prevents code from running if you import the file elsewhere. Pythonif \_\_name\_\_ == ""\_\_main\_\_"": main() * **Virtual Environments:** Never install libraries globally. Always use `venv` (or `poetry`/`uv`) for every project.* **Type Hinting:** Start using standard type hints (e.g., `def greet(name: str) -> str:`).

If you can get your character to move left and right, stick with that for now, and when an idea that's better than having a ton of if statements comes along, you should back up your code (well, version it in GitHub), create a branch, and give it a try. The worst that will happen is that you'll learn what won't work, and you can revert your changes, and in the best case scenario, you'll learn what does work, and you'll have levelled up.Just to give you an idea: I've been programming for 43 years (since the age of five) and for about 10 years now, I've wanted to write an abstract algebra library that was clean and well-organized with property-based testing and lawful certification of objects. I have literally tried to do this about six times now, and finally, on the sixth try, I have gotten it right and it is working beautifully.The moral of the story is: don't feel intimidated. It's hard to learn what **to do** without also learning what **not** to do, and if something isn't broken, you don't have to fix it.

But you are learning, even if you stop with Python right now and jump to C# or any other language, the muscle of programming grows and sometime you will probably come back to see ways to simplify your logic.

This means:Dont -> if(true): {desired behaviour}; else: {error/stop execution};Do -> if(false):{error/stop execution}; desired behaviorThis is helpful because you can have like a header in the top of your methods with your validations or if you need to check in the middle of the method you can do it in three to five lines without pushing or nesting the rest of your code",clauevil,2025-12-30 05:33:05,1,learnprogramming,t3_1pz1fmj,False,

nwv2gha,"I have 23 years of experience. All of the below takes place in Southern California. After graduating in 2002, I had multiple job offers in the span of 3 months. Probably like 20-30 applications. I came from a prestigious school but was not (and am not) exceptional as a developer. I got fired from my first job for poor performance and had a new one lined up a month later. Interviews were a breeze compared to today. A simple phone screening, and a single 2-4 hour in person round. Maybe half the interviews I did involved some light whiteboarding.In 2006 I decided I wanted to live a different place and started interviewing for new opportunities. It was so easy to get offers. In March 2006 I had three offers to choose from after interviewing over a span of a couple months. I choose poorly and so in August I started interviewing again. And again, I ended up with three offers to choose from by the end of September.In 2008-2010, like 60% of developers at my company were laid off. I barely missed the cut because I got lucky and transferred to a strategic project just before my old team got decimated. But everyone I kept in touch with found a new development job within a few months at most.In 2018 I got laid off and had two job offers within a month. Interviews were a little more challenging than they had been in 2006 but still stupid easy compared to today. Things seem to have become so much more cutthroat since then. Now even the experienced people I keep in touch with seem to really struggle with finding new jobs.

nwv5fb9,"I dropped out of school in Jan 2000 as I was offered stock options for AutoDesk’s web start up. The first crash happened 2 months later. I’ve worked steadily since then in the industry. The **2000** one was wildly different because we didn’t communicate well on a global scale at that point. Prior to the crash, I heard stories of people making it rich in tech, but generally tech wasn’t all that well respected. The average person wasn’t using the internet for a ton. My out of college salary was 38k if I remember correctly. The prediction was the options I got would be worth 350k, which was more money than I’d ever dreamed of. (Spoiler: They were worth 0). The crash happened, the company failed, people were laid off. That part was similar to now. Everyone was just waiting for it to be their turn, comparing themselves to their peers. Fearful. I eventually took a job working for the government for 34k. Getting a job was hard. There was a fear that this internet thing was just a fad and we’d struggle to get pretty mediocre pay. Still, I wasn’t super nervous. I got into it for engineering and if all I did was write C++ Windows apps forever, that was fine at the time. For me, things started returning to normal in \~2004 when my original company had been sold and asked me to come back for 63k / year. I took the job and worked there until 2012.By the **2006** crash I felt more like a mid level engineer. The *economy* felt bad, but in my corner of the world it felt like everyone knew tech was the future. Things were still optimistic for me. There were still layoff fears, but we didn’t really have any and my company was pretty stable. What feels different to me this time? It’s been an employees market for a long time and that’s changing. I know so many people who have made more than your average doctors do. Hell, I do and I’m a college dropout. It feels to me like this could be a huge realignment if it continues. How long do I think it will last? My personal, uneducated guess is that companies will shift back to wanting engineers. At some point they’ll realize the tools can multiply their productivity (Not replace it) and at that point they’ll want more people and produce more faster. I think this will come in the next 2-3 years likely? At the same time, I think some damage here has been done. You need a job more than it needs you and I think it could take a long time for that to shift back completely (If it ever does). I don’t actually thing we’ll see the boom at the level of \~2018. Or at least I won’t. Maybe you will!In the early 2000s I saw a ton of people who got into software to “Get rich quickly”. They took an online course and called themselves web developers because they could “Save as HTML” in word. A lot of them shifted real estate agents or other jobs. I think we’ll see the bottom of the industry drop out like that again. What helped me survive? Uh. I’m a hard worker. Probably a bit of a boomer take (I’m Gen X), but I’ve always been very professional. I saw so much shit that I wouldn’t pull during the late 2010 boom era. Don’t get entitled. Don’t be a pain in your bosses butt. Entitled things: Complaining about a company offering only vegetarian food on certain days of the week.

I ended up with only 4 interviews:- Macromedia. They owned Flash and Dreamweaver which were leading internet software at that time. They were later acquired by Adobe. My interview was canceled before it was scheduled because they decided to stop all new grad hiring. - MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This was basically a defense contractor job. It didn’t work out because I wasn’t interviewed for a specific position. They did general screening. I got put in a database then never heard back. - Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Same story as with MIT Lincoln except it’s an atomic lab. - Hewlett-Packard, working in their printer division. I would have had to relocate to Boise. I turned this down even though I had no better offer since the work and location seemed too boring. I eventually got a part time job working for the university. This was supposed to convert to full time but the funding fell apart. The project was funded by tech companies who were cutting back. I ended up going to grad school instead. By the time I finished four years later in 2005 (with no PhD), the job market was somewhat better. It was not hot but more places were hiring. I got an offer to work in big tech on well known but old school software. It was pretty good for what I needed then. Salaries were way lower than now, especially when it came to stocks.

Since the context is specifically remote, suppose you went on Twitch and livestreamed solving Leetcode exercises. I did this myself once and it was enlightening. Even one audience member, because I have no idea who they are, triggers entry into somewhat of a performer mode. You know you're being perceived, so you become self conscious, much like in a real interview.Though I note it won't be pleasant for the first few trials, I suspect it would cause adaptation to this problem, and work like gangbusters. Like you'd specifically intend to work through verbalizing algorithm complexity analysis in front of an audience on Twitch to practice working thru the issue in a similar state. You can modify the idea but the core is to be live streaming solutions, in front of an audience of at least one person (max ten maybe), who you know or don't know. As a separate point, I suggest that there's multiple ways to approach becoming more comfortable, less nervous\*, and cognitively smooth during interviews. Could even work to just approach some programmers you know IRL and ask them, ""hey can I spend forty minutes explaining complexity analysis to you with examples over coffee? I'll pay for it.""

So as a CS major— be very introspective about whether you are willing to do the work you’ll need to do to get internships and jobs rn. Even if the job market gets better, it will still be just as competitive in my opinion— from here on out just the degree won’t be nearly enough. Ask yourself if you’re afraid of doing the extra work because you’re doubting yourself *or* if it genuinely just doesn’t interest you. It was the latter for me, so I switched. Lastly, look at any data your current college puts out about career outcomes, and look on Linkedin to see how people who graduated in CS from your college recently are performing. Talk to any upperclassmen you know about their struggles or successes in finding internships, because if you dont get an internship during college, the only thing thatll help you in the postgrad job search will be luck and an immense grind on applications and a project portfolio.

It will peak in the next 2 years and then we will see more of a deflating effect than a pop.My own opinion.

nx90pal,"The answer to this is a clear yes. It has little to do with whether or not AI is useful; it’s clear that there is a market for access to LLMs (even if the people who want to pay for them are wrong about their usefulness, which I’m not saying they are or are not.). Think about previous bubbles: the dotcom bubble did not mean the internet was useless, for goodness sake, nor did the housing bubble mean uh, houses were useless. In both cases, it rather meant investors had made foolish decisions about where to put their money in a mad rush to profits driven by hype. It is pretty clear at this point that there similarly just is not a path to investors making their money back given how much investment has gone into this now. However, the thing about any bubble is there’s no telling what it will take to pop. It may go tomorrow, or it might take another few years. There’s no way to know, usually. In the case of the housing bubble, you could look at when the higher rates of crappy ARMs kicked in and make a pretty solid bet things would fall apart at that point (see The Big Short) but that was a special case.You can look at the AI buildout and see, “okay, we’re building data centers like there’s no tomorrow, Nvidia’s accounts receivable is ballooning [ie, they’re allowing companies to take out debt to pay them], we keep inventing more 2008-style debt instruments to build these data centers, OpenAI and Anthropic and Cursor are completely unprofitable” and you can see that this cannot go on. But the bubble will only pop when investors lose faith in a major way, and there’s not really any telling when that will happen.

You build a camaraderie with the other workers, feeling like it's you guys vs the customers and the asshole regional manager which makes for a nice break from office politics and drama, too. When I wrapped up that work-cation and got back into software dev I felt like I had new life breathed into me. Despite my skills being a bit rusty I came back overall much better than I was before the burnout, mentally a lot sharper. Over the following 7 years I was able to nearly triple my pre-burnout salary.During the work-cation time you could also do some kind of side project that you always wanted to do like game dev, some AI project, whatever cool thing.

Also, write out the time/space complexity for your solution before checking it.After that, you can spend a little more time on the python syntax side.

I would still require a visa to live in the US, but I've had multiple points in my life where I could have chosen to move to the US permanently. I chose to move to the UK.Dublin, Paris, and Berlin don't, imo, have a better tech scene. You get a lot more jobs and variety in London. The pay also doesn't compare and you usually have much more growth opportunities in London. I speak about Dublin from experience, I moved from there to London. The other two I've mostly seen from a distance and talking to friends. Berlin is probably the one that gets closest, but the truth is that FAANGs all have large tech offices in London, they don't all have one in Berlin. Add that to the language issue (I don't speak German) and it doesn't make much sense to move there.The US tech jobs are a much more interesting problem. The Bay Area and Seattle have objectively better tech scenes, higher salaries, and more variety in jobs. My problem with both of them (but especially the Bay) is that I do not enjoy or want to live in either of those places. I enjoy living in a city where I can walk places, where there's public transport, where there's a museum, culture, and arts scene, where it's easy to travel to other countries, and where not everything is tech.NYC would be a good option, and while the salaries aren't as good as the Bay, they're still likely better than London. I think it provides a good mix, and if I were to ever move to the US I would go there. I do still not like living in the US generally though. As I said, there's certain aspects of how European cities work that I enjoy, and to add to it, I enjoy getting plenty of days off to enjoy my free time and I feel like I have more breathing room while still finding interesting things to work for good pay. Between that and the fact that I've now established myself here and I have a friend group that I'm happy with and a flat I own, I'm unlikely to want to move.Edit: another issue with the US I forgot to mention, the immigration precarity has always been an issue for me with the country and to a degree still is. In the time I've moved to the UK, got permanent residency and citizenship, many of my friends in the US haven't been able to get permanent residency status. In that period I've not really had any prolonged periods where I can't visit family or leave the country for holidays, whereas I've had friends who weren't able to leave for **2 whole years**. Most visas you can get to move to the US can put you in that situation if you ever want to turn your status into a long-term one, and you're treated throughout a lot of the process as if you're somehow doing something wrong.

When I did that, they went thru and essentially voided all gen ed requirements for my degree. So, it basically was ~65 credits, or 4 semesters/2 years for me to get a BS in CS.
