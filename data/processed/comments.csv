But then what if your data is a bunch of little jobs that come in from multiple sources, then you might want to adopt a streaming service like Kafka or redis. Each one of your data sources can publish data to the stream, then you can set up spark to consume those messages to process it. Then you can set up a notebook that will check the stream for new data and fire off a new spark job to process the data, or just quit if there's no data available to process. The notebook could also take the results and handle uploading it to the database, or make a nice graph, or whatever you need it to doI could go on, but each one of those resources has a specific use that you should get familiar with.

I used to think I’d be motivated to join a team if they used a language like Haskell, but at this point in my career, I’m not so sure - “good enough” is good enough, and I also feel like I might prefer working with other people who feel that way too (not trying to make an accusation here, just saying I’m not sure that having to strive for perfect functional purity on top of my other responsibilities is something I care to do now, though I do incorporate FP principles into my everyday coding).",Squirrel_Uprising_26,2025-12-12 11:19:16,9,dataengineering,t3_1pknjrd,False,

To me, data engineering, like cybersecurity, is a tool/technology-specific field. You need to hire people who are familiar with technology stacks. Language expertise often does not bring value to the fields. My opinion is that if you are going to learn a language for the sake of employability, it has to be Go, Java, Rust, Python, or JavaScript (Pick 3). Anything else introduces maintenance problems.I think there is a very specialized sub-section within data engineering called ""software engineer (data)"" but most companies do not hire for that role. They are solely focused on algorithmic optimization and doing proofs of concepts that border on being research. Even their proof of concept are often converted to standard languages.

Your code structure may need to be improved to separate a monolithic file into smaller individual files and rebuilt in runtime.Additionally, having good branch hygiene is important. Don't keep reusing the same branch for all changes. Open a new branch for each change and prune orphaned branches. Every new change should be based on the current state of Prod so the resulting PR should only be the specific change you are trying to make. Once the PR is merged, you should delete the branch.

But the current state of the job market makes that difficult.Next best: move internally or upgrade the responsibilities of your current role. It is worth having a direct discussion about development goals with your manager (assuming they are a reasonable person). I would also ask directly how you can move into the ""real"" dev team. The answer might disappoint you but it will help you decide on next steps.The most likely situation is that you will be stuck in your current role for a period of time. You will need to make the most of it. The upside to this is that you are directly involved in customer onboarding and therefore revenue generation, so your job is likely to be safer than the developers.To do that I would push standardisation of projects as strongly as you can. Migration inputs should follow target a standardised schema with a well defined spec for all fields. That then allows you to work on building tools to automate as much of the process as possible. For example, comprehensive validation and data quality checks, with automatically generated reporting outputs.You can follow a similar approach to reporting: standardise and automate. Push back on customization. Even if it is a potential revenue stream, customised reporting is effectively low margin contract work and will be a maintenance nightmare in the long term.

ntjzij0,"Data Vault is still very much relevant, and it has nothing to do with storage formats, compute engines, or any specific technology It’s simply a way to organize data when things change a lot, more like design pattern. It’s not meant to solve every problem, but if a company constantly brings in new data sources or its existing schemas change several times a year, and it still needs clean, consistent data to work with, Data Vault fits that situation very well.Recently I was Data Architecting in a project, where Data Vault was the solution to the client’s issues. A mid-sized company running an HR platform had thousands of clients but a small internal team, so they relied on many external tools: onboarding, contracts, bookkeeping, payments, their main app, and several new systems planned for the next year. Each tool had its own user table (some even had several users tables), and none of them matched. If you ran count(*) on each system’s user table, you got different numbers every time. Each system stored different pieces of information. Analysts didn’t know which database had the data they needed. Even when they found the right one, joining across systems caused rows to disappear, so they couldn’t trust anything.Data Vault solved this cleanly. We created a single Hub_User table that lists every user across all systems. For each subsystem, we added a satellite tables that hold the columns coming from each system. Everything is connected using the same hash key, so joins always work the same way. Analysts now start from Hub_User, and they know exactly where each system’s data lives. Nothing gets lost during joins. When the company adds another tool next year, the team will only need to add one more satellite, and none of the existing reports will break.This kind of constant change is normal in real data environments, and DV is a design pattern for that.

But we're no longer adding new features to it. See the blog I linked in my other comment - it's very explicit on this.I know that's frustrating, and I wish things had turned out differently with Synapse and I'm far from the only one who feels that way. I'll talk a bit about why we made such a seemingly asinine choice later in this comment. The tiny bit of good news is that there's a Fabric VS Code Extension for local development (the Fabric Data Engineering VS Code Extension). If you do switch to Fabric someday, it already exists there. Along with many other nice things, like Fabric Spark's Native Execution Engine to make your Spark go vroom (thus saving you time and money). If it was feasible to keep building Synapse, we probably wouldn't have built Fabric at all. Many person-years were spent trying to fix key mistakes we made in designing Synapse (and in some cases, far earlier than that) before we went back to the drawing board and built Fabric. But that meant we had to refactor or completely redesign many huge pieces of it. So the APIs are often different, the internals are often different even when the external interfaces are similar or the same, and bringing the ""same"" feature to Synapse would thus often mean doubling the work of building and maintaining that feature. Or worse, due to many of the mistakes / design flaws of Synapse often being the sorts of things we'd want to improve, or the reason Synapse didn't get such a feature years ago. So investing more into features for Synapse does not make sense; that'd be effort better spent elsewhere in the mid to long term. Like filling any remaining parity gaps (few are left, and there are fewer by the day), improving migration tooling, and so on. It's very unfortunate, it's just not something I can change without a time machine to go correct the course of Synapse in the first place.

Essentially, cron lets you schedule a script to automatically run on a schedule. For example, if you want to run the feedback loop (let's call it \`feedback.py\`) every 6 hours, you would simply edit the crontab. This is done directly in your shell by running \`crontab -e\`. Then add the following line: \`0 \*/6 \* \* \* /path/to/your/script/feedback.py\`.This tells your server to execute the \`/path/to/your/script/feedback.py\` scripts every 6 hours.

nt5sqc3,"The reason to study C is not because the language itself is interesting, or because it's especially useful for real-world programming.The reason is that C is such a simple and low-level language that it allows you to ""see"" the guts of how things actually work, instead of having them hidden from you.For instance, when you start using Java you'll immediately encounter the object-oriented programming style. You'll see things like objects, classes, methods, inheritance, etc. And from the perspective of a Java programmer, all that stuff just works ""by magic"", because the Java compiler and the JVM implement everything for you. Whereas if you think about how to implement the same thing in C, you'll be peeling back the layers of abstraction and you'll be forced to learn more about what's actually happening under the hood.The same thing applies to data structures. In Java, you can just declare an `ArrayList` that automatically resizes itself to fit the data it contains. C doesn't contain such a resizable array type, but you can implement it yourself using the lower-level primitives such as `malloc` and `realloc`. And doing that work yourself forces you to really understand what's going on. Writing something like that in C is a way to force yourself not to ""cheat"" by taking advantage of existing higher-level constructs.Even if you never plan to *use* C for any real projects, I personally believe that understanding low-level programming will help make you a better developer in the long run. (For one thing, it helps you get a better understanding of performance. In higher-level languages, the speed of a given piece of code depends largely on the behavior of many layers of abstraction that are being hidden from you. In C, what you write is much closer to what the CPU actually executes.)But having said that: as a student, I don't think you should prioritize learning C over the actual courses that you're being graded on.

A few things that genuinely helped me:\*\*The Pomodoro technique but modified for ADHD:\*\* Standard 25/5 never worked for me. I do 15 minutes of focused work, then 3 minutes of literally whatever my brain wants (scroll Reddit, watch a YouTube short, whatever). The key is setting a timer for BOTH. Your brain learns it can have the dopamine hit soon, so it's easier to focus. Gradually increase the work interval as you build the habit.\*\*Treat debugging like a video game:\*\* ADHD brains love puzzles and immediate feedback. When you hit a bug, frame it as ""I'm going to figure this out"" rather than ""ugh this is broken."" Keep a running log of what you've tried - it helps when you inevitably get distracted and come back.\*\*Use the hyperfocus strategically:\*\* When you feel yourself getting pulled into something, lean into it if it's productive. I've had some of my best learning sessions at 2 AM because my brain decided ""today we're learning async/await."" Just make sure you're not hyperfocusing on tutorial hell.\*\*Accountability buddies:\*\* Find a study Discord or a friend who's also learning. Just having someone to check in with like ""hey I'm going to work on this for the next hour"" makes a huge difference.Also about the medication - might be worth trying different options if Adderall isn't working?

Passive learning + ADHD is brutal. Short tasks > long sessions. Even 15–25 min of *doing* beats 2 hours of watching. Instead of: Understanding everything, then coding. Break and fix it. Messing up keeps the brain engaged way better than perfection. People with ADHD do better with: checklists, roadmaps, Use “solve 3 problems, then stop” rules Random YouTube + freedom = distraction spiral. Write before you code. Literally write steps in plain English: \- loop → check → update → repeat \- This reduces cognitive overload and helps you stay anchored. Tiny wins matter more: Consistency > motivation. One solved problem daily compounds *fast*.Also — meds help, but they’re not magic. Environment + structure usually matter just as much.One thing that helped me personally was switching to **problem-first learning** (very basic exercises, patterns, loops, etc.) instead of theory-heavy resources.

You could make the computer do anything you could think of.I loved games and fancied myself a future game programmer.I didn't take any classes (there weren't really any back then, where I was from)I didn't LEARN programming, like sitting in front of a machine doing lessons.

I came across some code that could extract and view the 3D models of maps and buildings in the Ragnarok data file and decided I wanted to make a program that would let you look around the map as you wanted using WASD controls.Thus RagCam was born, and it was shared in some communities.I was also able to find some code to import 3D models into the then popular 3D software 3D Studio max. I also made a system tray Desktop Toy that let you ""Store Files"" in the ""Kafra Storage"" A Kafra is a NPC in the game that you interact with to store stuff, and I made a program that pops up the image of the anime-style girl in a kid of maid outfit where you can store notes and files.When I got into pirating (ahem, ""streaming"") TV shows I wanted to get notified if there was a new episode, so I made a local site that checked for updates. I also made a scraper that downloaded (english) subtitles based on the file name.I try to make programs that intersect or tanget my interests, which include anime, games, emulation of retro consoles, and more recently AI generated images.It's really up to you to define what programming means to you,I'm an old soul, and for me programming is more than just a way to earn money or the latest technology and cool frameworks.It's an interface between me and my inner self.

It's nice and sometimes what we need to recover, but it also means lack of progress and boredom. Being frustrated and failing a lot is essential to all learning and progress. Confidence peaks at mount stupid where you know a bit of something, but not enough to understand that there's way more to it. Enjoy the high of starting to get a subject, but don't expect to stay there. Learning more will inevitably mean becoming less confident as you become more aware of multiple options and constraints. With experience you get biased about choosing and get more confident again (which is good only up to a point). Don't try to optimize by learning only relevant topics. Be curious and see where your interest takes you. It's going to be fine that on some topics your knowledge is more sketchy than on others. Every developer's knowledge is collection of whatever they happened to study and whatever they have happened to work on, filtered by whatever interested them.",Blando-Cartesian,2025-12-11 10:55:21,2,learnprogramming,t3_1pjp3p0,False,

ntg7tky,"## ExpositionI'm a lot like you in the sense that I want to understand the ""full stack"" of every system I run across. For years it has got me glued to books on computer science and on general programming topics, chatting with AI about the subject, googling, watching YT videos, etc. It has helped me gain a good basis for how things work but it has also been a way for me to avoid the really hard job of coding itself.## The ProblemWithout getting too much into meditation and casual research I've done on psychology, the basic problem is this: It's not the subject matter - programming or computer science - *it's the response to that internal state while learning the subject matter*. You need ways to switch off that self-referential egotalk. It won't go away before you start treating it and other internal feelings and thoughts as ""information"" rather than realities that are playing out or describing ""who you are"". They are chemical events, some helpful, some unhelpful. The system that spawns them is full of messy, contradictory responses to these internal events that don't always make sense. Your brain has neuroplasticity, and whether you like it or not even your identity is a construction. Yes, we all have some properties like IQ and EQ that determine some speed or efficiency of function but again those don't determine binary outcomes. The real hindrance is the ego butting in when the analytical parts are trying to do their job or those parts tiring out.I've wired my brain to be lazy, inattentive and identify myself as stupid. The identity itself and the thoughts surrounding it is a learned set of patterns. That wiring can change, the feelings it produces while under stress can change and my image of myself can change but they won't unless I keep allowing my brain to default to those pathways and don't offer it new experiences and responses to certain difficult stimuli.## The Realities of the FieldThe feeling of not knowing something or being confused will never change in this field. Your conscious response to that can and that will ultimately lead to your brain interpreting those signals differently. You'll even start to love the challenge of not knowing, if you can get out of your own way.## What to focus on - the narrow approach**Your real goal is learning to understand systems, syntax and data.** There are easier and harder approaches to this but generally I'd say **try to learn how memory works**. And learn it robustly. Study the virtual memory system, study file systems, study how different information - audio, text, graphics, device state - get modeled in memory. While there are millions of libraries, protocols and file formats, they have to all converge on the simple core truth of writing bytes to or reading bytes from memory. If you can nail this layer, write a few parsers that interpret file formats or networking protocols, you'll get a solid grasp of the simple fact that **software is just agreed upon patterns of bytes**. This won't trivialize learning libraries but it will trivialize a certain notion of ""newness"" from them - they aren't anything new. They may sit at several levels lower or higher on the software stack but they are all still just memory. ## On AI Resources are sometimes hard to come by but AI is actually pretty good for this. As long as you aren't copying code but rather asking questions on subjects that are stable and unlikely to change - how things in computer science, and the technologies that express it, work - you can get very good, very detailed answers. Plus you can go back and forth with it, trying to nail and refine your understanding. It's like taking notes with a tutor.## ConclusionSo don't be like me. Don't rush. Accept discomfort. Accept being stupid and having to ask. Think of the skill acquisition portion like laying bricks on a giant wall. You wish for a fast and glorious end result, you'll even settle for ""100 more bricks laid out today, look at that progress!"" but what you need and what you get by showing up and working every day is that one brick.

Since you like web development and you know basic Java you have all the makings of a full stack developer.By building projects to learn how to develop software the concepts you learn in school will make more sense how it applies. School does not really teach you how to develop software directly so you are going to have to learn this on your own in addition to what they teach in school.Start small and keep simple and add one small thing at a time. Work from frontend to backend to database for every feature you add. Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn when you need to learn it.This might sound crazy to some, but the often dismissed TODO application is very well suited for teaching comprehensive full stack development. You just have to take it that far.Here is an example roadmap that could keep you busy for a while.Start small, create an index.html page that has the word ""hello"" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. Fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. A calculator, an address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.I hope this helps.",Ok_Substance1895,2025-12-13 23:00:28,1,learnprogramming,t3_1pl8v9k,False,

But now an interface can also have `default` methods - which means that implementing an interface with some `default` methods, and some `abstract`, would be exactly the same as extending a class with some implemented methods, and some `abstract`.

So debugging is about finding the point in your code where it first DOES NOT do what you intended it to do. “It should be exiting the loop here - why isn’t it? Oh it should be >= instead of >” etc. To find that point you can start from the beginning and check values: “b should be 10 here. Is it?” Trace the execution flow through your code examining values as you go. At some point you will find a value that you weren’t expecting and you can figure out why it got the value it got and fix it. An alternate approach is to work backwards. Start from where you notice the error and see what your code did just before that. This typically means re-running each time you take a step back. In some cases you can also try the binary search method. Examine values in the middle of your code. If they look good the error hasn’t happened yet so split the second half into two sections and look in the middle again keep looking and splitting until you see your problem. In practice I kind of do a mix based on logical thinking… I see where the error first manifests, I think what could cause that error, I use the debugger or add print statements the check my hypothesis and either look forward or further back depending. But you can almost always find your problem by starting at the beginning and tracing through examining values.

Ditch the game-dev courses.Back in the day, there were two schools that offered a game-dev degree; they were DigiPen, and Full Sail. Both these schools are accredited, both these schools are collaborations WITH THE GAME INDUSTRY. The CEOs of both EA-US and Sony-US sat on the direction board of Full Sail.Around 2006, we were at the height of Sallie Mae robbing the American public blind, and ALL the universities got in on it. They fed peoples delusions of grandeur back to them, and offered game-dev degrees of their own. I sat on a couple review boards myself, and I'd name and shame if I wasn't going to get sued to oblivion if I did... They're robbing people blind. These programs are designed without any industry input or representation whatsoever.And by 2010, the game studios had fully reacted. These days, they don't want to HEAR ""game dev"" degree, because they know you won't know comp-sci to save your life, and you won't know game dev, either. There's still a certain respect for the two schools mentioned, but for the most part, they want a traditional comp-sci degree.In the mid 20-teens, the Department of Education started cracking down - tying federal grant money and subsidies to both graduation rates and placement success. Ineffective programs became dangerous to schools and they had to start putting up or shutting up.Well, I can promise you MOST of the schools slip through the cracks, and this current administration has declared war on education and dissolved the DoE. So I don't know WHAT you're learning over there...And if you're outside the US, I'd trust your game-dev education even less.

Get in on math classes, as much as you can from here on out.As for how your interview is going to go when you present yourself to a game studio - it's going to be almost exclusively math oriented. They're going to drill you on linear algebra, calculus, and physics at the very least. Some of it will be comp-sci oriented about algorithms, some of it will be physics, some of it will be rendering, some of it is used in game dev but you'll have never seen before because they just want to see how well you adapt to new maths - that you haven't just memorized everything. They're going to grill you over this. As for any programming part of the interview, mostly they just want to know that you know enough syntax to be dangerous: reverse a string, write a linked list.Hell, you don't need C++ specifically in your education. Java is almost indiscernible from C#, which itself is used heavily in game dev, and they all share common syntax and idioms.

nsx103x,"Tldr: I dont understand your question or what your friend is saying... because data structures and algorithms are used in literally every programming language... below is a rant clarifying what I believe is what info you're missing. At the end of the day it doesn't matterIm assuming by DSA you are referring to Data Structures and algorithms right?Those are used in every single programming language, the only difference you may be hearing about is that some languages differences and not actually related to anything about data structures or algorithms... No shade meant by this, but that is something I think someone with an AI/ML background would be familiar with so I am going to assume it's not necessarily an AI background in the sense that you an ML engineer, and possibly what you mean is more that you use AI. I only say that to preface that I'll try and explain what I mean about languages, not to cast aspersions.Anyway, what you may be hearing i suspect, especially because of the recommended languages you've received, is more related to low and high level programming languages. You know all code eventually becomes machine language, ones and zeros is the name of the game, but we dont type out ones and zeros, we use words that them selves get converted to something, then something else, then something else, then eventually something a machine can understand. In coding terms these are layers of abstractions, something ""represents"" something else, and the magic is often that you can hide complexity by having thing X not only translated to thing Y, but also do Z as well to make the statement more concise. Low level languages (like C++) are ones that you work closer to the hardware, meaning there are fewer abstractions away from giving a computer 1s and 0s. This can be a very good thing, abstractions require effort, and that means you can write code that uses less effort on the machines end and make things go fast and use less memory. However, abstractions are done for a reason, and the flip side of a low level language is that you will write a lot more code to do the same thing that another language may be able to do in a fraction of the amount of lines of code, a big pain point being you end up handling memory yourself at this level. High level languages on the other hand are abstracted a more layers up and hide the scary bits like memory management from the developer by handling it themselves, and tend to be much closer to readable human language as a result. Python and Java are both high level languages, but keep in mind that doesnt make them better or worse, just different. So why isnt everything done with a high level language if they can take away all the annoying things that exist in programming? With abstractions come trade offs, the more that your code does ""for you"" the less control you have. You dont have to do annoying memory management and consider a lot of stuff when programming in a language like Python like when its OK for your app to ""forget"" something to free up memory. In languages at this level a feature that is built in handles it for you by occasionally checking the app, and deleting unused memory and freeing it up for later, its called a garbage collector, and this does not exist at the low level, and not having it can be a pain in the ass. But what happens if garbage day is on Monday, and you forget to bring out your trash and today is Tuesday...? You are stuck with the garbage until the garbage man comes around next week, in high level languages this happens to because its not a constant process and works kind of in cycles. Low Level languages can create memory, use it, and the second its no longer needed free it up for something else to use that memory. This allows more efficiency in your code, but requires more dev work, and opens up Pandora box and can lead to an exponentially amount of new bugs or issues. If I wrote 2 programs in Python and C++ tonight, I could do it. But I promise you that my Python will without question be faster than my C++ code. Is Python ""faster"" than C++? Nope, I just am a novice at C++, I know enough to be dangerous, but beyond that 9 times out of 10 my Python is faster due to my own lack of experience with it. And if you told me to create an app in 10 hours or I will die, Ill choose Python every time because the high level abstractions lead to increased developer speed. NOT better app, NOT faster code, less of my time as a developer being used (which in theory could be used to make more code for some other project or learn something new)As far as data structures and algorithms are concerned, they are not language specific, it makes no sense to frame it that way imo. Data structures are ways to organize data. Algorithms are sequences to process data. The programming languages are like syntax in verbal languages, DSA is kinda like forming complex sentences. So there's no correct answer to your question, because it doesnt really make sense. I suppose if you goal is to learn data structures and algorithms at a granular level and really understand how the computer really handles them, a low level language will force you to really get down to that level and put the work in to learn that stuff. If your goal is to apply data structures and algorithms more than learn the granular details, a high level language is the choice. Honestly even that dichotomy isn't a super great way to put it, its just the closest way I could think to answer your question in a way that gives you something to consider. Another way to put that is that learning DSA concepts in a lower level language will expose you more closely to how a computer really uses data structures and algorithms, giving you a better baseline. However, a high level language will allow you to learn these concepts faster and more efficiently. There's no avoiding learning them, and neither path is correct. That being said... if you truly ""know"" python... to be honest you should already be familiar with a lot of data structures and algorithms, so my recommendation would be to stick with Python and fill up those holes in your skill set without having to learn these concepts and a whole new language at the same time slowing the process.

nsyfhqf,"The problem is that Java was never intended to help teach programming - it was built for experienced programmers to ""quickly"" adapt their existing code to this new language, and write applications that could run on any system, rather than just the one they themselves used.But for some reason - probably because it was free, and worked the same on every platform - it became the standard language for teaching programming, even though it requires you to understand a bunch of concepts before you can even write your first hello world program - hence all the ""jokes"" about `public static void main(String args[])` \- some of which even fairly intermediate programmers don't understand fully.And adding to that, the designers of the Java API made a lot of weird decisions in the beginning, some of which they later regretted, but can't remove even though it has later been found to be more troubles than help. Specifically the Exception handling and the huge risk of null-pointer exceptions everywhere.And it doesn't get any better that Java was never truly intended to run interactive text-terminal applications, but for some crazy reason almost every school thinks that their students should be forced to struggle with System.out, System.in, Exceptions and the Scanner - which is intended for ""scanning"" through text-files (hence the name) and not for receiving badly formatted input from the user ... So, sorry if I didn't answer your question fully, but every single thing that you mention are weird quirks of the Java language, and the way it is being taught, and I still cannot fathom why it is still chosen as a beginner language, especially when we've had Python for exactly as long, and that also runs on every single platform out there!",peterlinddk,2025-12-08 16:15:13,4,learnprogramming,t3_1phe5vo,False,

It's not a sudden ah-ha moment, but a gradual understanding unless you think about it.Learning any programming language - there is a barrier to separate the language and it's products from the system.

You can just change the if statement to check this instead: `if self.expression and self.expression[-1] in self.operators and input in self.operators:` since `bool(self.expression)` will be false, when the string is empty.In the case of `calculate`, the main two errors are `SyntaxError` (raised, for example when you try `eval("""")`) or `ZeroDivisionError`. Depending on what input is possible, `NameError` is possible (`eval(""x + 1"")`). Thinking about what errors can occur forces you to think about why they happen and how to handle them. You should definitely handle the SyntaxError and ZeroDivisionError in some way. If you really want, you can catch those 2 with corresponding error messages and then catch all remaining exceptions (but I'd not catch them and let the calculator crash if something really completely unexpected happens instead of ignoring it. This would be a bug requiring a fix and not an expected exception like the other two).Alternatively, you should have a look at [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) about eval. You might want to either sanitize the input before evaluating the expression or write your own evaluation function, as eval is risky to use.

Do you have a cool unique idea that you need to get in front of investors NOW before someone else does it? Well... maybe your prototype and your ""production ready"" app are very similar.. you'll have pissed off users running into bugs, but maybe you cross the finish line and get funding to refactor later (you wont, you will build on top of your garbage with more ""temporary"" garbage)Or maybe your code is handling how much radiation to blast a cancer patient with... Google Therac-25, one of the most famous software bugs dealing with exactly that.. If you are making something similar now, you better that testing, failsafes and a few more ""just in case are you sure this is the correct power to fire the laser"" screens in the final app are mandatory before release. Documentation even is considered a mandatory part of the ""code base"" in some projects Ive worked on, app works great without it, but future development is always an option. I know Rust teams that build out stuff quick and fast in Python and don't care about any bugs til they have something working, then they scrap their idea and treat it as nothing more than a proof of concept (suppose you could call it a prototype), and then rebuild it in Rust. They do this to get a proof of concept out ASAP and prove its worth pursuing in Python due to how fast you can do that compared to the much more cumbersome (but faster and safer) Rust. And on the flip side of all this.... you have companies that have 0 unit tests, use a custom build script that no one can read or understand because Bob who wrote the script in a 36 hour code binge one day used his own custom language he developed in high school that uses Tolkien characters as aliases to traditional syntax, and they fired him in 2008 when the market crashed but somehow the company survived and they have an app that they have considered production ready even before Bob showed up... Users somehow are shocked through their keyboard every 3rd time they log into this app and hate it, but they keep using it so the company marches on and pretends everything is great hoping, and management will fire you if it breaks while you're there, and will doxx users if they leave a 1 star review.Tldr; its a bunch of things, nothing specific. Hopefully the standards you set have testing, SPECIFIC mandatory features that need to exist first before new stuff is added, documentation, and have set things up in a way that it isn't a nightmare to maintain a year from now or when new coders show up. Thats another reason docs are important to move on from ""prototype"", being consistent with a style guide and practices you use, even if they arent what the language specifies. If you write Python and decide to use CamelCase, thats gross... but if the team style guide says so, and your code is consistent, you use it even if it's ""wrong"". And new devs joining the team will be able to follow the style guide and be productive without issue. Apps, like companies, grow and being ready for more users isnt the only important thing, you should be ready to add new devs and set them up to be productive and keep things consistent ideally. Wrote a lot and maybe seems like my comment is all over the place, but honestly thats kinda how it works.

My first few years covered computer architecture, databases, python and Java, data structures, and object oriented design (and design patterns in general)I started learning web dev with the basics, Javascript/css/html. After a couple months, I started learning frontend frameworks starting with Vue (easy-ish to pickup imo) and eventually moving to React because it is more widely adopted in the industry.Then I went deeper into backend and ops. Setting up auth, logging, APIs, and deploying the application. This part was absolutely the most difficult for me and I had a written step by step guide walking me through the process of setting up VMs on Digital Ocean and AWS where I'd have to ssh in and setup hosting and start the application. This process would have to be repeated (condensed a bit) whenever the backend application was updated. Nowadays, it is much easier to host fullstack applications but this is still good to know as a professional.Anyway, all of that was another 2yrs of grinding and I did a webdev bootcamp around the end 2020. I got my first job in 2021 (July/August). So 5yrs doing this basically full time lol But even then, programming is an ocean and I've spent nearly every day as a full time dev learning new things and improving the way I build applications. You might be able to build your Spotify clone after a year or two, but I promise that another year will pass and you will look back on it as complete garbage.

nt0fn81,"Depends. I'm not going to discourage you, but you will need to start thinking about money eventually. Earning as much as possible in the shortest period of time without taking any large risks (FAANG) is probably the best strategy. You could also build deep domain expertise in a target industry, and then get hired to work at these companies anyway, and this will probably yield a better result because you won't just be doing micro optimizations for them if you go this route. You can still do this in your spare time, but I would strongly suggest you prioritize your economic welfare first rather than primarily chasing a technical ideal. You have to find a balance, it's okay to experiment and learn niche things in depth, but you want there to be an eventual payoff if possible. For example, learning Rust or Elixir is a good investment of your time, and you'll naturally develop a network to draw from if you want to start a company or join one, but something like Common Lisp has a low probability of a payoff even if it's more fun (yes, I'm bitter). I followed my interest and got a very good career out of it, but I've also seen what happens when people optimize purely for skill. As a developer in any mid to large sized company you'll basically never be given the discretion needed to fully utilize tools designed around peak individual productivity, but the money will dull the pain somewhat.You have to develop a certain pragmatism about how you do things.

You can think of programming as artistic expression. I want beauty and elegance. I want to make the best software that I can.Along with that comes learning. Along with that comes a job, because the pursuit of my craft overlaps with people's need for software.The job is not the craft. Jobs don't pay you for beautiful, elegant solutions, they pay you for results. You have to figure out how to be a craftsman within the context of THEIR time and THEIR money to make what THEY want. You do get some push-back, though; if they hire you, they can tell you WHAT, but they are deferring to you for HOW. No one gets to tell me how to do my job, or they can do it themselves. As a junior, you get told HOW a lot, because there's still a lot of learning at the beginning of your career, but then you start developing an opinion, and eventually, it starts holding it's own. That's how you know you're ready to be a senior developer.> If you're only in this for money then you may struggle to find the motivation to continue progressing with your learning as jobs are not easy to get in this field.Who are you speaking for? Because I would say the majority of the industry would probably disagree with you. I have found very few craftsmen in my 30 years of pursuing software development. Most I've met have never given a damn, most I met literally say ""just get it done"", they say - and I've been told by them that they ""code for today"", as they see that as virtuous; that sounds to me like the goal is doing the least amount of work possible without getting fired, the least amount of work to gain status and pay, until they peak at diminishing returns.

But you don't need developers for that - almost anyone with a little bit of programming knowledge can vibe code their way through the easy stuff.It is when there are no off-the-shelf solutions, no tutorials to look up, the AI is striking out...that's when you need someone with skills. Someone with some mental fortitude to be able to work through complex problems, debug, and problem solve. Who can go looking through poorly written documentation or undocumented code. Who ultimately understands that, after a certain point, the buck stops with them - if they can't *find* a solution to the problem, they have to think through and *make* one.I think, like in an interview it is telling when a would-be developer get asked a question they've never seen before. They don't *know* the solution - but that's fine, because a lot of times you won't know the solution. So does the candidate sit down, start to think, formulate a plan, examine that plan, revise it and otherwise think through the problem until they get a solution? Or do they just shrug and give up and go ""I've never seen this problem before, so I can't solve it""?So, for instance, if a software developer wanted to know what the software developer mindset was, they wouldn't just post a question in a subreddit - they'd do some research. Find some books written by notable in the field and read them. Read some blog articles.

nts5phs,"I could be wrong, I've never worked with gmpy2, but I believe this is what's happening:`x` and `y` are never covered to gmpy2 types here, you are relying on the library to either handle the regular Python `int` and `float` types or create temporary gmpy2 type objects from them in order to do the math. The results of those functions will be gmpy2 types, but nowhere does any of this replace `x` and `y` with an equivalent gmpy2 type. This matters.The source code for gmpy2 might help understand why.`qdiv` source is [here](https://github.com/gmpy2/gmpy2/blob/master/src/gmpy2_mpq_misc.c#L162).You can skip to line 210 since the first part is if you use it with only 1 argument.The check for whether your arguments are valid is this: if (!IS_RATIONAL(x) || !IS_RATIONAL(y)) { goto arg_error; }`IS_RATIONAL` is a macro defined in [gmpy2_convert.h](https://github.com/gmpy2/gmpy2/blob/master/src/gmpy2_convert.h#L54)The function works for `mpq`, `mpz`, `xmpz`, Python's `Fraction`, `int` types, and types with the `__mpq__` or `__mpz__` conversion functions (these are for writing your own custom classes, they do not get added to existing types like `float`, so they aren't relevant here).`int` is in the list, so the argument `x` is ok, but `float` is not in that list, and `y` is a `float`, so that check fails.I believe if you write `print(test(4, gmpy2.mpq(2.0)))` this should work. The reason `qdiv` does not work on regular floating point numbers. `mpq` numbers are similar to `Decimal` or `Fraction` types in Python, storing a numerator and denominator, and as far as I'm aware they're always stored fully simplified, so `2.0` = 2/1, so as long as both arguments are integers in any of the supported types, the division operation should be simple integer division for which they have a highly optimized algorithm. Dividing by a float however is not that simple, and converting a standard `float` into `mpq` is additional work. `qdiv` is an optimized function that's trying to avoid doing unnecessary work, so it simply says ""no, you can't do this"".Because it doesn't do any unnecessary work, `qdiv` is faster, but the price is that it's more restrictive about when it can be used. If you are trying to learn this library, you should be explicitly creating variables using the gmpy2 types rather than relying on the functions to work with regular Python types and do the conversions for you when necessary.",Bobbias,2025-12-13 07:37:06,5,learnprogramming,t3_1plaqc8,False,

ntucpxu,"Anyways, I'm replying to myself just so if anyone else has this ""problem"" in the future, they can see a concise ""solution"" for this. Or at least maybe learn something.So for the gmpy2.is\_integer() part of the issue, gmpy2.is\_integer() only checks if the *value* of a number is equivalent to an integer, not if the *type* of number is an integer. Floats are still considered Floats and do not work with gmpy2 functions that only work with integers.And for the gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) part of the issue, gmpy2 really wants you to use gmpy2 types of numbers. Those are: mpz (integers), mpq (rationals), mpfr (Multiple Precision Reals, or Floats), and mpc (Multiple Precision Complex Floats)",cton999,2025-12-13 17:24:23,1,learnprogramming,t3_1plaqc8,True,
ntua9xy,"Thank you for researching and going into the source code of gmpy2. This helps a lot in understanding the qdiv part of my ""problem"". I didn't realize that using the specific gmpy2 types meant so much, but it does make more sense now. I guess somewhere in the function I can just convert python types into gmpy2 types based on inputs? I can check if an entered number is an integer, rational number, or float (or if a float is equivalent to an integer or rational) and convert them to mpz, mpq, or mpfr. I don't know, I'm still working on it.Anyways, `print(test(4, gmpy2.mpq(2.0)))` does work, but for my purposes with this code, in this example, I'll probably just take the input of a normal float 2.0 for y, and then convert it to mpz in the function.",cton999,2025-12-13 17:11:26,1,learnprogramming,t1_nts5phs,True,
ntu2xnv,"Thank you for your insight. I guess that makes sense in a way. gmpy2.is\_integer() is checking whether the *value* of a number is equivalent to an integer, but gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) needs numbers with the *type* of integer.I don't think it's a bug *now*, but the way gmpy2.is\_integer() is described in the gmpy2 docs seems kind of misleading? On the page for Multiple Precision Reals: is\_integer() → bool: Return True if x is an integer; False otherwise. Does gmpy2.is\_integer() say that it only checks value as opposed to type somewhere in the docs and I just missed it?I'm not a professional programmer by any means, but maybe the description for gmpy2.is\_integer() should include that it checks only if the value is equivalent to an integer, not type? Or maybe there should be a method in gmpy2 to check type, like the normal python isinstance? I think it'd be reasonable to think that if you saw that if is\_integer returns True if x is an integer, and used gmpy2.is\_integer() to check if something was an integer and it returned True, that it would be considered an integer while utilizing gmpy2.Anyways, ""There’s little reason to try to use qdiv in your test code"". I'm testing qdiv and gmpy2 in general because I plan to use it on other code that I'm working on that can use arbitrarily large numbers where you could set the inputs to just be integers, and I read that gmpy2 is great for large numbers and qdiv is faster than div.I was testing inputs for various arithmetic with gmpy2 and that's how I ran into this ""whole number"" float ""problem"".

ntvocb8,"That would work fine, although if you were writing real code rather than just testing things you probably want all your numbers to be in the gmpy2 types pretty much as soon as possible. Like if you were reading data from a file or user input, you should ideally convert them right away so that you ensure any math being done on them is done through the gmpy2 functions.From my understanding gmpy2 can handle converting types very well, even converting directly from strings (so you wouldn't need to first convert input from a file or user to `int` or `float` before converting to gmpy2 types).Additionally, I believe `mpq` can be converted to `mpz` as long as `is_integer` is true. I'm curious what you intend to use this for. From my understanding you'd need to be doing some pretty heavy math in order to justify using gmpy2, and there are other packages which might be a better fit depending on exactly what you're planning on doing. Packages like Pandas/Polars, Numpy, SciPy, etc. all implement their math internals in C or other compiled languages too.",Bobbias,2025-12-13 21:43:18,2,learnprogramming,t1_ntua9xy,False,

nt3suv0,"With composition the idea is not that it's easier to *write* — it's sometimes a bit more boilerplate in 1-2 places. But it *is* easier to read, and to refactor without accidentally breaking things.Having said that in your example, whether the implementation of the behavior is the same or not, composition will look similar: it will make heavy use of *interfaces*. Using Go as an example (a language that only has composition, not inheritance):```gotype Collideable interface { Collide()}type Renderable interface { Render()}type Entity interface { Collideable Renderable}type Octopus struct {...}func (self *Octopus) Collide() {...}func (self *Octopus) Render() {...}type Spaceship struct {...}func (self *Spaceship) Collide() {...}func (self *Spaceship) Render() {...}```In the example above, Collideable is an interface that describes ""anything that collides"". Interfaces are commonly described as contracts; they do not contain any implementation, but they describe that such-and-such object will have such-and-such methods.the ""Entity"" interface is defined as ""anything which both collides and renders"". In order to be considered an ""Entity"", a type would have to be both Collideable and Renderable.A type satisfies an interface by implementing all of its mandatory methods. In order to be Collideable, a type needs a method called Collide, that has the same arguments / return type as in the interface. If it does, we say the type *implements* the interface.In Go, once a type implements the necessary methods, it will automatically be recognized as implementing the matching interface(s). In the example code above, both Octopus and Spaceship implement all 3 interfaces. (In some other languages you need to do something like `class Foo implements Bar` to make the interface relation explicit).Now on to your question. Focusing on just the Collideable interface, there are 2 scenarios: Either we have a common implementation, or we don't. If we don't, then the `func ... Collide() {...}` blocks above will contain different code. If there *is* a common implementation, you can e.g. pull it out into an external function:```gofunc Collision() {...}func (self *Octopus) Collide() { Collision()}func (self *Spaceship) Collide() { Collision()}```Alternatively, you can use composition to create another Collideable object, and reuse it for the Octopus and Spaceship:```gotype Collider struct {...}func (self *Collider) Collide() {...}type Spaceship struct { collider Collider ...}func (self *Spaceship) Collide() { self.collider.Collide()}type Octopus struct { collider Collider ...}func (self *Octopus) Collide() { self.collider.Collide()}```As you can see, the above example has a bit more boilerplate, but we have successfully combined composition and interfaces to give both Octpus and Spaceship the same implementation of the Collide() method, by giving them both the same ""collider"" property internally. Both Spaceship and Octopus implement Collideable, and they do it using the same implenentation (from ""Collider"").(Note: In Go, interfaces cannot contain implementation, only a list of methods (and their type signatures). In some other languages, interfaces are also (optionally) allowed to contain default implementations of their methods. That would allow us to skip the whole ""Collider"" thing and just write the default implementation for Collide() on the interface directly. Having said that, this can be a bad idea.)",kilkil,2025-12-09 13:00:30,2,learnprogramming,t3_1phnlqp,False,
nt4lm8s,"I sometimes refactor code that uses inheritance into code that uses composition and sometimes I refactor code that uses composition into code that uses inheritance. If you think you've stumbled into a superior design that happens to use inheritance, you could consider going for it. If your discover that your design is wrong then you could refactor it into composition.If you're not sure what to do you could err on the side of composition as a best practice. But I think it's wrong to dogmatically apply it (or most best practices) in a universal fashion.If I wind up with several classes that all inherit from the top of the hierarchy in a default fashion and have almost all of the same methods just delegating to some member/field/property/attribute, and in particular if I'm conceptually referring to that class as a form of that delegated object class, it's a sign that I would probably better benefit from refactoring it to inheritance.So do Octopus and Spaceship have no explicit super class? Do you think their instances ARE entities? Do they delegate heavily to a private entity instance? You'll probably have an easier time if you model it using inheritance. That's the way I think about it.

nth5xl2,"there are various ways to look at it. At design time, sure, you usually look at 'this is a thing' vs 'this has a thing'. But there may be more to it, and often, that is a grey line. A thing can have a collision (has a?) or a collision can be a thing too, that (has-a) participants . A spaceship is not a collision, but a spaceship is a 3d point cloud that may touch another 3d point cloud and require behavior to detect that. Or maybe a spaceship has-a associated geometry/cloud/volume? Sometimes its just mental gymnastics around how your team thinks about the idea being expressed and can go either way.But there are other considerations. Collision detection is often a constantly running subsection of a game and may need to be as efficient as possible, so having it on the side in something as compact as possible may be a requirement regardless of how you feel about is-a and has-a. An array-like container of small objects with something like (pointer, ID number, something) and geometric info (what volume does it occupy) that you can do a scene-wide check against may be necessary for performance reasons even if that means pulling the data out of the bigger objects in a bizarre (from an OOP perspective) way -- this kind of thing is why some games use parallel array type concepts when normally that would be anti-OOP.And it could be a poor example. collisions are often done in passes, like center of object distance (skip if far away) followed by bounding spheres (skip if not touching) followed by simplified but correct geometry checking. That would be done the same way for all your objects; it just happens that your octopus and spaceship have different detailed geometry in the final stage but you still do it the same way, different inputs to the same function (?) in other words.The main thing I am rambling about though is that design can be a grey area at times, and you just have to make the best choice you can based off how you plan to use the information, which can be its own headache for something like the geometry of an object in 3d since you use that in so many places in so many different ways.

Getting a first job abroad will be extremely hard as an entry level, so just leave out those considerations for now. By the time you'll be ready for a remote job abroad, you'll find switching pretty easy. I know that you consider it to be a big endeavor, but trust the people telling you that as they are right. Also, if you want to be really competent as a backend developer, you need some cloud experience as well. Azure and AWS are the most used, so you'd probably want to make that decision as well and factor that into the language you are choosing. Secondly, just learn whatever feels more natural to you. Your first job will be in the language you learn now, and you want to get on the job market as fast as possible, so making it enjoyable and less cumbersome is a necessary thing to do.",Mircearaul,2025-12-08 13:14:26,2,learnprogramming,t3_1phbony,False,

nsxrqv3,"> C# is used in a narrow range of tasks.This is wrong. You're hearing this from Java developers. Reasonably, ask specific questions in both C# and Java forums.I worked in Java when it first came out. I worked in C# when it first came out. Both have come a long way since then. Amusingly, C# was initially a Java clone for MS. However, C# evolved past its DNA quickly, with Java playing catch up for a time.C# has the full support of Microsoft and tooling to match. If you work on Windows or deploy to Azure, it is the way to go. At this point, all of the backend stuff can run on Linux and supports containers like Docker.I don't know the current state of the Java ecosystem. It maintains market share, but the tooling is a little less focused. It's also notable that while the JVM is popular, the Java language has a rather tepid fanbase, with things like Kotlin garnering much more enthusiasm.I recommend C#, for the language itself, the support, the available resources, and just personal preference. When you ask someone who endorses Java, make sure they're actually using Java and not Kotlin, Scala, or whatever else is out there.

Suddenly it was in their best interest to get me official certifications (they can sell you better to clients if you have a shiny cv), so it felt like being back at uni a bit, with studying for exams etc.After that, I got to work with a lot of different projects for different clients in different industries. The projects would be anything from delivering an MVP within 6 months internally for a client/company A to being placed as a dev on site and joining the team at client/company B - contracts could range from 6 months to a year and could always be extended or if things didnt work out my manager would pull me out earlier. It was the BEST experience because I got to work wkth very many different people that taught me loads.Unfortunately, change in management + politics and the economy suddenly dried up the assignment pipeline and I was left on the bench for way too long. I decided to jump ship. I now work at a non-tech financial firm as part of their internal tech team. My team develops solutions for our non tech employees around the globe. This means many projects, some small, some big with many different focuses and tech stacks. I work primarily with people that studied computer science as a minor and kinda fell into development by chance. My role is to help professionalise their solutions. And I love it. I am not surrounded by tech mentality at all... its just finance and law. A nightmare for any brogrammer that yearns for silly valley and definitely not without its pain points. But for me its the best of both worlds, cos im still in tech, actively coding and architecting but the expectations are way lower, theres competition between finance bro and finance bro, but that doesnt affect me. Finance bros have to work Christmas but we do not, in fact we shouldn't really develop or ship anything during that time cos getting new update before year close makes finance bros very nervous haha. And now with AI in the air, our teams budget got increased, and we are encouraged to find novel ways to help make the firms employees more efficient/productive. That means a lot of autonomy to explore new tech stacks and solutions. It is genuinely fun again. A bit chaotic, but without the stress and expectation of greatness. Anyway... Just wanted to say theres better things out there. And that tech doesnt have to be too techy. Theres a light on the other side.",forgetitok,2025-12-12 05:03:01,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1pk8p88,False,

One of the largest mistakes of my career. I was promoted multiple times, got yearly 7% raises, and all that stuff so it wasn't clear that I was committing career suicide in the moment.I didn't know people working at actual tech companies to compare what was happening. 2 of my friends whet to get their Ph.D. in CS and the others I knew went to work at DOD jobs or equally shitty non-tech companies. It wasn't until I found various subreddits that I realized what was going on at actual tech companies and how different our experiences were over the years.I was even leading teams of 20 SWEs, have my name on patents, and responsible for all software aspects of the medical device. I was working with interdisciplinary teams and all that good stuff. The problem was I was learning learning one way to do things and that way was not how modern software was created. It was old school 90's style engineering company with managers that have been there since the 80's and 90s doing things that exact same way.It was top down management where they want engineers that just do what they were told and think minimally for themselves.. The company had a lot of lifers that got a job there as a new grad and just never left. If you were not a lifer then you were early in your career and was easy to take advantage of. There were very few middle career engineers with multiple jobs under there belt at the company.Once I saw the light I started telling every new grad hires on the down low that they should stay for a year or 2 and learn what they can. After that leave and get a job at another company that is more tech focused. This company would talk about how they are growing by hiring 90 new engineers in the last year, but they don't tell you they lost 80 engineers over the course of the year so it was a net gain of 10 engineers.Take charge of your own career and don't expect any company to manage it for you in a way that's best for you and not the company.",diablo1128,2025-12-08 21:52:10,28,cscareerquestions,t3_1pholi8,False,

nt1p301,"Depending on your school, things might be easy. There might be a specific track or set of classes you take (honors, AP, etc). Once you choose a college, choose a major, etc, there starts becoming a pretty wide range. People who are better students don't necessarily become better in the workforce, and people who were better students don't necessarily lead better lives. It's the same for everyone as they get older, not just CS grads. I have a cousin who is a lawyer and very successful. She's very friendly, outgoing, and good at her job. But she also says she got lucky and had a really great mentor at her first job. An old friend was a terrible student. He got a job partially by luck. A recruiter contacted him, he passed some new grad interviews (not tech), but they forget to check his transcripts. He did well enough in his interviews they took a chance on him once they saw his GPA. It worked out for him. And it's not like your first job sets things in stone. Plenty of people ""level up"" at different points in their career. A great support system is obviously awesome, but it won't always be available. And at a certain point, you're responsible for your own life and career. I've been solo a lot of my career. There are times I wish I had more mentoring. But I look at a company I used to work at. It fell apart after acquisition and leadership changes. People tended to scatter to one of three companies, all of which had people in leadership positions from the previous company. One the one hand, it's great you have a good working relationship. But it also felt weird, and there are times I wondered if people were scared or hesitant to try something new and expand their networks. I saw some places where once one of those legacy execs left, everyone started leaving. Maybe it was a sign. Maybe people couldn't last on their own. Maybe a combination. You could also argue people later in life have more at stake (I personally don't like this argument). But some people will say they have a spouse, kids, a mortgage. Do they deserve less stability and mentoring than someone fresh out of school? You'll see some experienced people post here looking for career advice. I've given people who reported to me advice that at some point that they might outgrow the company. I'm sure there are other manager-types who would prefer their team stay put, since it makes things easier for them.

It’s awesome you’re writing code still and staying sharp in dev, I agree they iOS dev is a pretty small subset of swe and a lot of us take unideal gigs at times while we keep looking. This is the way. 2. While owning a product and making it from the ground up is a great skill itself, it doesn’t necessarily scale to large scale software development. Working on a team with a lot of members where you’re all trying to keep your branches in sync with dev or main, submitting merge requests, approving them, working to extend someone else’s code (on large teams you can spend spend more time reading code than writing it). You have to work with code that’s very unintuitive to you at times. Someone else might be architecting and providing the boundaries. You have deadlines and all kinds of non coding tasks you have to keep up with, getting pulled into meetings, people asking you for help while you’re in the middle of things, you’re asked to estimate the complexity or time it takes to roll out features, you have to constantly manage risks to changing the project’s codebase both in terms of it breaking production and interfering with other people’s work. You have to learn who to bug for specific things you need in terms of red tape in your organization and it will impede your progress at time while you wait for things, etc etc, it’s quite a bit different than solo dev work. None of this is meant as a criticism, but you will not be a mid level dev on say a large or even medium sized team even if you spend 5 years programming on your own. You’ll merely be a really good junior dev probably. Those skills aren’t hard to learn either, but I would not underestimate the learning curve working on large teams if you’ve basically sat in your bedroom programming iOS apps for the last several years.ETA: obviously you have things in place to manage risks and I’m not trying to imply that you write code and send it to prod, I just am trying to in an abstract way outline some things that working in industry on a team have that you’ll have to get up to speed on.",ibeerianhamhock,2025-12-13 13:42:20,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1plj2jn,False,

That sounds like they want to keep you, but budgets may be too squeezed right now for your current paygrade. As far as I'm aware, it's unusual for a manager to give this option instead of just issuing a termination. It might be that the department's budget can fit you, at least for the upcoming few quarters, if they demote and reduce your salary. Obviously your call on whether you want to voluntarily earn less to stay with them, but you do say you're not being set up for success here.Where I live, unless it's an especially toxic workplace or you get a reasonable severance package, it's better to jobseek and make them lay you off (rather than quitting).

nt67pbt,"Sorry to hear it, this is a rough spot to be in. The biggest thing that’s going to hold you back is making it through resume screening, and without any internship or real production experience it’s going to be very hard. My biggest suggestion is to network at companies where a referral actually helps you get your foot in the door and pushes you through the automated resume system. This means FAANG+ and big tech are out the door, as a referral will hold very little weight, and even if a real person reviews it, lack of experience will likely be your down fall. Connect with as many people as you can at smaller companies - even if that’s <200 employees. It might not even be a software company. Many CS majors have a “FAANG/Big tech or bust” philosophy and see everything else as a failure. If that’s you, you must put your pride away and take any chance you can get. This is a stepping stone, not the final form of your career.The next thing is to get very good at interviewing, leetcode, and preparing for a specific companies interview. This much is obvious, but your hit rate for interviews will be low, so when you do get one, you need to maximize the opportunity.I’d also really inspect how meaningful your personal projects are. I was surprised at how much weight they pulled during my interviews/screening, and I was told by multiple interviewers it made a large impression - which also means I got grilled on them so they could verify it was real/I did it lol. If your projects are very generic, even if done well, they likely aren’t helping as much as you think. Pick something you’d really love to learn about or make - maybe hobby related - and flesh it out a ton. The more niche/specific, the more memorable. Document well, consistent pushes, make graphs of your data and put them in the repo, reference research papers that informed decisions, etc.Lastly, I’d genuinely consider if a masters is right for you. New grad applications are already hell on earth, but doing them with no internship will be a challenge and a half. A masters degree puts you back in “intern” status before you finish it, so if you put your all into the things above during intern apps, you would likely snag some. Once you’re back to new grad apps, you could have an internship(s), maybe some light research experience (even if no paper), TA positions, and a higher degree.

nu20qch,"Idk, I never struggled to find a job either… until this year. Always had backlogs of recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn, even though I never posted/updated/said I was looking for work. I think there’s a few factors at play that make the job market seem extra shitty right now.1. Layoffs/hiring freezes across big tech, and government jobs. Basically a large pool of people who would have been considered ‘Top Talent’ a few years ago are now all looking for work at once. The longer they are unemployed, the lower the standards get, so even if you are just applying for ‘Regular’ jobs, a few of the 100+ resumes in that inbox probably has ‘Google’ or ‘Meta’ or whatever on it. 2. With AI, it’s become trivial to spam out resumes, and tailor/frame your work experience to the exact job requirements. If you just earnestly apply to jobs, you are unlikely to get an interview even if you are a relatively good fit. You said ‘SQL’ on your resume. Someone else mentioned the exact distribution they use at the company. You said ‘AWS’ they said the exact AWS features and tech stack being used. Often times your resume won’t even make it past the screening stage.3. Just general hiring trends. Hiring tends to be forward looking, so I think a lot of senior leadership is really leaning into the idea that they should be able to accomplish more with the same amount of people. Instead of increasing headcount by 10% for some new project, they’ll try to push AI tools and re-org the ‘freed up’ employees to whatever new project they are working on.It’s definitely pretty rough. Even with 8+ years of backend dev and Data Science experience, I’ve applied to ~100+ jobs. One final round of interviews, no job offers, and I only got there because I had a referral. I’ve started just not bothering with jobs that list even one specific technology I don’t have experience with.I’m not saying I’m a super talented top dev. I’ve always worked at middle of the road non tech F500 companies. But I’ve never been fired or even had a bad performance review. I’d be so excited to just get the feedback ‘Yo, you didn’t do a good job solving this LC problem. Or your architecture skills and thought process isn’t what we are looking for’. But it’s just like… no one even gives you a chance to interview if you don’t BS your resume with AI.

nu1zszp,"You've hit the nail on the head. Location is a major factor.In markets like New York or Silicon Valley, you have people who have sacrificed years of their lives to prep for demanding positions, so every role that gets posted has a ton of competition. When candidates get dumped onto the market from layoffs, companies have to ratchet up the difficulty in interviews just to have a manageable pipeline.I've been involved in the recruiting for a team that is not in a tech hub. In-person work is a hard requirement, for about \~150k base salary, no stocks, no bonus. It's probably average for that area, but not particularly attractive for someone to move just for the job. We even offer relocation assistance for that role.We get maybe 20 candidates per job posting, half of which are not qualified because they need sponsorship. If we interview 10 people, about 1/2 can actually write a basic loop. We hire whoever has the best systems design interview since most people can not clear even a LeetCode easy. (clear rate for a fully passing solution is probably about 5% of all candidates that reach that stage).I really think unemployed engineers who are having trouble securing an offer for months have the wrong strategy. They should be taking up these 'easy' low paying jobs, moving temporarily, and then continuing to interview for their hotshot Big Tech and Silicon Valley roles.

I'd personally find it hard to justify using k8s / preferring availability just for this. Also, a core principle of SRE is having an error budget that you want to actually spend (i.e. having services that are \*too\* reliable is \*bad\*). I'd be a bit apprehensive to hire a senior whose recommendation is ""reliability at the cost of everything else"".## Too much human reliance""A justification in the PR, and/or""Personally, not a big fan of answers that boils down to ""let humans do this X process"". Humans are faulty, and manual processes tend to get ignored over time (e.g. people just rubber-stamping the justification).""At each stage, monitor:""This also seems like an extra toil that can be done automatically.In general, adding more bureucracy / slowing down development for the sake of needless reliability is also bad, similar to above.## Seems pretty textbookOverall, your answers give me the vibe of ""recommend the commonly recommended thing, just because that's best practice, without further thought"", like immediately jumping to k8s, specific DB, and so on.In the system design interview, I think I'd personally like to see how you think from the fundamentals and the first principle more, rather than just giving me a list of technologies immediately:- For a simple webapp, do we \*really\* need to use k8s? You're signing up your team to eat a lot of dev / knowledge cost before even hearing the full constraint of the problem.- Before jumping into the details, why not verify more fundamental things? e.g. do we need redundancy across different regions?- NoSQL theoretically scales horizontally better, but is that true in reality? In a lot of cases, there is a mismatch between theory and reality. Similar to how linked list are faster than arrays on paper for some use case, but they tend to be slower in reality due to caching performance.## Random nit'“What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.' Incorrect? I'd expect the answer to be 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS. I'd personally shrug it as nervousness / misunderstanding, but maaaaybe there's a small chance of interviewers really disliking it (e.g. ""this person has only ever deployed things on localhost"") since that's a pretty fundamental thing to get wrong.Don't beat yourself up too much though, interview fails sometimes do just happen randomly (e.g. there just happen to be unicorn candidate right after you). From the post, it seems like you're a pretty strong candidate and the interview itself went pretty well.I think the core of the issue is that a senior SRE should be someone who knows why we need to follow mainstream recommendations, and when we should not follow them. I'm not saying you don't have that quality, but I think the way you answer the interview questions did not necessarily demonstrate that due to the textbook answer and overemphasis on reliability above all.",4m_33s,2025-12-11 07:14:56,9,cscareerquestions,t3_1pjlsx3,False,

Even side projects count if they're deployed and measurable.The rejection stings, but use this experience to build a portfolio of implemented systems you can reference.

My opinion.At the beginning of your career, you're pretty much like every other CS grad, a big lump of clay that they have to teach and mold. You might get a few more $$$ due to the higher education, but not enough to offset the extra 2 years and expense of getting the MS over the Bachelor's.At the middle of your career, for dev jobs they're mainly interested in your tech experience and what you can do. They don't want the lump of clay anymore, they want the refined tool for their tech stack or subject matter / industry. So for basic dev jobs most would rather hire a person with the right experience than somebody who's never done the work they're doing but who has a Masters. Which is when you try to get promoted.For companies / leaders that are credential-focused, you'll be more of a promotion target. With the MS-CS, that's team lead or architect. With an MBA, that's management. Whether or not you're deserving of those roles is another question, but for companies or leaders who focus on credentials, you'll move ahead of peers who lack them. At the end of your career, that mid-career trajectory bears fruit.So the question is, what path do you want? If you don't know -- and it's OK that you don't know, job experience will help you figure this out -- then I'd skip the Masters for now. Because you can always get it (or an MBA) later.In \~26 years in this industry, I've never seen a person with a Masters stand out so much that I wondered why and then discovered that they had a Masters. That has happened for me with PhD's, that we give super interesting technical problems to and they come up with innovative solutions.

If you're having issues w/ lack of vocabulary/articulation, chances are that your fundamentals are lacking. You can go about filling the gaps either in a top-down way (e.g. start from what you know and work ""downwards"" into lower levels) or bottom-up (e.g. start from from C/ASM and work your way up back to high level).The former tends to be a more pragmatic form of learning. You can, for example, go from knowing about calling fetch (vs whatever is the abstraction for it in your favorite framework) to RPC/REST to HTTP spec (what different headers do, etc) or go from ORMs to raw SQL to reading about db normalization, etc.The bottom-up approach is useful for getting stronger at fundamentals, e.g. reading source code for hashmap implementations in various languages can help you understand how they actually work wrt memory layout, complexity, etc.With that said, senior level isn't necessarily about those. There's some level of importance in being able to accurately convey technical ideas via jargon, but equally (or perhaps more) important is communicating at an appropriate level for the audience (e.g. a junior vs a director). You're not really going to find resources on how to navigate this stuff, your best bet is imitate your seniors until it becomes natural.",lhorie,2025-12-09 21:59:20,16,cscareerquestions,t3_1pihedo,False,

Do 2 problems at least a night (1 hr) If you have to redo easys until you get it, do that. I would say spend 10 min on ur own on the problem if you can’t figure it out watch neetcode solution - then do it and then wait two days and try and do it on ur own and then if you forget watch the solution again. Copy and paste all ur solutions in a Google doc so u can go back to them (cause you most likely will have pseudo code next to it). Keep doing this with the easys until ir makes sense to you and you can technically explain what is happening, watching neetcode solution more than once will help you because you will start speaking technically and confidently. And then when you’re good at all the problems u previously did time box yourself for 30 min to work on the same problem - pretend it’s an interview by then u will be confident because you have done this easy problem more than once. And just repeat for mediums and hards (time box 60 min) Maybe you should also go back to the fundamentals in the language ur comfortable using (w3 schools), relearning OOP principles and other things you might have forgotten. Use ai to help you study, ask it to ask you interview question and then you write the answer or if you don’t know what the algorithm solution is doing when reviewing the solution ask it to go through each iteration. Also ask DeepSeek (ai I use) to make you a study plan. But regardless you should do hacker hour where no matter what you do 1 hr of algorithms (at least 2 problems a day).

nt6737m,"Well, one tip I have is *any* time you hear an acronym or jargon you don't know, don't be afraid to ask. Yeah you can Google it on the side, but a lot of times it's easier to briefly pause the meeting and have it explained by the person doing the talking. It signals that you're paying attention and willing to learn. I've had a lot of positive feedback about my willingness to do that, from both the business folks using acronyms I don't know and colleagues who were similarly confused but not confident enough to speak up.Honestly it sounds like you're selling yourself short a bit. I had some excellent mentors that beat in the idea of advocating for yourself in a corporate world, and being willing to make a change if the company you work for won't accommodate that.That said, I also went through a destructive leadership turnover cycle and it fuckin sucked! I was having full on panic attacks and needed to consult a therapist to get through it, and I think I've come out the other side more resilient. So do what you need to do, and if that involves seeking some professional help that's absolutely okay. My therapist likes to remind me that a significant portion of her clients are there for work related anxiety. Software Engineering is a high-stakes, high-stress career field.Oh! Also, therapy exposed that I had a sleeping disorder which caused me a lot of physical symptoms like brain fog, difficulty focusing, and memory problems.

For any concept or specific interaction between technologies I'm not 100% certain about or haven't touched in a while, I make a little sandbox on my personal computer with practical examples that I type out (not paste from google/ai) and play around with it for a day or 2 and leave some notes in markdown in the folder.Sometimes you haven't worked with a technology in depth for months, I come back to those folders in such times and its a quick memory boost, imo more than you'd get if you simply read up on it or googled a singular question.Flashcards are decent for interviews but imo not amazing for in depth knowledge.2. Intelligence can't be faked (at least when working with intelligent people), trying to sound smart isn't a cool look. The people who work with you will know how well you know your stuff in the same way that I assume *you* know how well each of your colleagues knows your stuff - usually some are a cut above the rest, no matter where you work.I think you taking the time to write this post shows you care about your knowledge which is frankly more important than how ""smart"" you are in the first place, I'm sure it's really tiring being a sole provider and most people would also have trouble finding the energy to upskill in your shoes. Not always possible, but maybe try stealing a bit of work time to read up/practice if possible, when you're less tired during the day. Best of luck! EDIT: Also, some times you just wont get a promotion - regardless of how well you do, there's many variables deciding who gets promoted - so don't take it to heart.

nu18q2x,"Yeah it's not as unusual as many believe who only ever worked at big companies.I've also started out at basically a 3 person company where the owner was an electrical engineer building hardware, a building technician installing stuff and wife doing the business part.And me as a freelancer coding stuff;)But it wasn't as bad as it sounded. Our embedded devices monitored data centers and we rarely ever had issues.My mentors were the writings of Scott Meyers, John Carmack and so on and a ton of cheat sheets (mostly effective C++ checklists) on the desk.Years later I got into a big company for the first time through Startup acquisition and we still regularly run into troubles for not following procedures.But honestly we usually can't wait for 2 months to deploy some crap if a customer wants to test it in 2 weeks.And our startup stuff isn't being touched anymore and has been running happily for years now.At the same time anytime anything is done ""the right way"", the whole web of k8s and whatnot breaks every single time right before a customer demo and nobody knows how to solve it because the people knowing the infra and k8s and the people knowing the app and the people knowing the customers and so on are completely different.At the same time our own apps that we just run pretty naively on AWS just... Run. We have one app that's used all the time set up by a former team member that I never touched. He left almost a year ago and it's still there happily doing its work.Frankly I'm pretty tired of where we ended up with all this cloud and web world glued together by hundreds of yaml files configuring hundreds of containers.And frankly, if I look back, the whole thing doesn't do much more than what we did back then in that 3 person setup only that it doesn't even have its own hardware ;). Pulling data, storing it, running analysis, showing it to the user.Yeah I know, I'm downplaying some of the modern challenges etc.That's really more an emotional Casey Muratori style rant of how something that's not too dissimilar from what we did decades ago with two people now takes teams and hundreds of services and dependencies and is just slow and bloated",met0xff,2025-12-14 20:04:53,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1pmmmfr,False,

The only ones I'm aware of that meet that kind of description (near me) would be Revature and other WITCH companies. They keep devs benched on small projects, and try to get you placed with a client so they earn a cut of your salary and you get experience. Sometimes they'll exaggerate your skills to get a bigger salary cut.Are you working on a greenfield project that the company doesn't really need, but feels is a worthwhile gamble?

I worked at a tech consulting company/digital agency, and they had someone on staff who helped the accounting team. After that person resigned, the company would ask random people for help on things. He didn't use version control.This isn't normal, but I don't think it's completely unique, as you hear stories about people who have this experience. In the old days, teams were responsible for their own IT and work, and you'd have teams spring up like this all across departments, until they brought in someone to organize everything. I should probably say ""if"" rather than ""until."" Large organizations also go through something like this, so don't feel too self-conscious. Is there are larger tech community/team in your company? A part of me wants to say you should ask about joining them, but the new manager might be a pain. You should consider looking for other opportunities, as you're probably not learning good software practices. To counter that, perhaps you can allocate time for process improvement. You can sell it as ways to allow others to do your work. So, things like version control (I hope you're already using this, right?), CI/CD, some type of wiki for documentation, a ticketing/tracking system are some good starts. Maybe some next things to consider is how do you monitor things in Production? Just look at log files? I also want to clarify something. Just because a company has this stuff in place doesn't mean they do a good job with it. During the interview process, it's on you to try to figure out if places do a good job or not. Good luck, as some places will flat out lie to you. My last job is an example.

The thinking goes: if I can’t get a job as a SWE, I’ll just *drop down* a rung or two and get one of those jobs.

If you find that requirements are changing on the fly, ask to be involved in all the meetings where requirement changes are decided/discussed.

nu2ej6h,"You never lied, so I'd think it's a non-issue. It also depends how big of an asshole someone wants to be. I was on a panel/team evaluating candidates. One candidate, who I never spoke to, was deemed argumentative by an interviewer. He told his third-party recruiter he didn't think he was, and asked for clarification. A good portion of the team took this as him being argumentative again. I tried to argue their case, but honestly, the team was full of assholes. The director from HR had a huge ego and wanted to say anyone who had been laid off was laid off for a reason, and one of the interviewers wanted to lowball candidates, especially if they had been laid off. You can't really predict how people will act. Just be honest if they reach out and ask for clarification. If they ask, and they should if they discover an inconsistencies, you can say things changed and you were never asked. FWIW, I offered up that I had been laid off during my interview process.

Agile is all about fast feedback and two weeks to a month (or longer) is too long to go without feedback. If you do shorter sprints, you do need to have much shorter ceremonies as well.If you have on-call during your sprint, you should reduce the number of stories you plan to handle that sprint. Agile is all about prioritizing things and empowering developers. So if the on-call is the highest priority thing, you as a developer should take that into account when planning out the sprint.

The spring framework is rich, learning to leverage its robust ecosystem to solve rudimentary problems is a key to success. The second thing that helped me was understanding design patterns.

I've asked before things like ""our flow of funds involves transferring money from X to Y, how might we do this in your system?"" and they go do research and come back with fancy diagrams and technical documents for me to read.I'd say early on Solution Engineers make more money, but once you get into Senior+ software engineering roles, Software Engineers get paid more. I'm sure there are outliers.If you love talking to people and presenting, maybe solution engineer is the right path forward. There's also roles like forward deployed engineer that may still write code but interacts with clients more.Maybe go on LinkedIn and find people in Solution Engineer roles at companies you admire and ask them for an informal 15 minute convo.",rootbeersharkcase,2025-12-15 00:59:51,1,cscareerquestions,t1_ntpx92o,False,

nt2bhvc,"Having been through this a couple times, my advice is to look at how much you're being paid to stay. Deals differ, but in my experience if you're going to get a compelling equity payout, retention bonus, stock grant in the new company or are seen as playing a role in the acquisition (in a way that materially benefits you) you'll probably know about it (even if not exact numbers) within a week or two. If you're not being paid anything, treat it like any new job, and evaluate it on those terms. Would you have applied for this company before they bought your current employer? Are they doing anything exciting? Are they hiring for your role + experience?Also: executive bullshit can get especially thick after deals like this. They likely do have retention bonuses or targeted bonuses for certain milestones even if you don't, and otherwise decent people have a way of rationalizing really shitty behavior when someone dangles enough money in front of them. So, if you're hearing about the 2026 roadmap, that there will be no layoffs, or other stuff that paints a rosy picture around the future, take it with a big grain of salt. They _might_ not be lying outright (or they might be!), but they may have a lot of incentive to hold off a mass exodus even if leaving would be the better move for employees.What I'm reading is that you weren't really happy before this deal, you were serious enough about leaving to have offers on the table relatively quickly after the deal, you're not super jazzed about what the new company is doing (you don't mention this at all in your post), and you're probably not going to get much/any retention $ from this (sorry, but I think you'd know about it by now). I actually had almost exactly this situation earlier in my career, bought the BS, stayed, and regretted it.

I get a front row seat to listen for our customer's requirements while in meetings with our sales rep and the common question floats ""Do you sell AI in your product?"".People are hyped for AI, that includes our business customers, and its taking great effort for us to bake AI into our product and compete on time. We're being charged more than what a big company would be charged for using AI services because our projected volume of consuming AI tokens are much smaller than big companies. Big companies are winning the competition in many markets right now as they have more resources and investments to spend with getting their AI services into the market much sooner with more precision.With that being said, we've buckled down and locked in the team with more hats to wear, haven't had a new hire in our department since the layoffs.when the AI hype is over, people and businesses will realize the valuable relationship and products that come from these small/medium businesses and come back. Once once they see gains in revenue, I believe they'll open up positions as they're confident they can support a bigger workforce once again.Another opportunity for more positions to open up with small/medium businesses is tax breaks and or more affordable AI services these businesses can use for selling AI features in their products to compete in the competitive market.",Micafire,2025-12-12 21:16:41,0,cscareerquestions,t3_1pl2h4q,False,
