Since people are going to suspect LLMs anyway, I used one to try to reorganize it.I would probably add some testing too.---# Data Engineering Pipeline Checklist## 1. Requirements First- **SLA**: How fresh? (minutes/hours/daily) Daily reporting → no streaming needed- **Impact**: Cost of being late/wrong?- **Consumer**: Dashboards, ML, reporting?## 2. Architecture**Single source of truth**: One storage layer (warehouse/lakehouse/object storage). Everything reads from it.**Batch over streaming**: Streaming adds complexity (ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills). Default to batch unless real-time is essential.**Design for backfills**: Parameterized date ranges, versioned transforms, separate raw/modeled layers.## 3. Reliability**Idempotency**: Jobs must be safely rerunnable via partitioned outputs, overwrite-by-partition/merge strategies, deterministic keys.**Orchestration**: Use Airflow/Dagster/Prefect for retries, dependencies, visibility, parameterized runs. Avoid ""cron spaghetti.""## 4. Observability**Minimum to prevent silent failures**:- Row counts/volume checks- Freshness checks- Schema drift alerts- Job duration tracking## 5. Performance**Optimize last**. Most slowness comes from bad joins, file layout, or moving too much data—not lack of Spark.**Fix basics first**: Partitioning, columnar formats, filter pushdown, avoid cartesian joins.## 6. Simplicity Rule**If your SLA is met with**: scheduler + Python/SQL + storage + basic checks**Then distributed systems add unnecessary complexity.****Use distributed systems when**:- Volume exceeds single-machine capacity (hundreds GB–TBs)- True real-time requirements (sub-minute)- Complex streaming aggregations- Multiple concurrent consumers need isolation",sib_n,2025-12-19 01:49:33,10,dataengineering,t3_1ppuky6,False,

Something lighter like Liftbridge (Kafka semantics, single Go binary, no JVM/ZooKeeper) or just NATS JetStream covers 90% of cases.On the storage side - totally agree on ""one source of truth, columnar, object storage."" We're building Arc with exactly this mindset: DuckDB for compute, Parquet for storage, S3-compatible backend.

nuwaj7a,"Hey, I can understand. About six months ago, I joined a US-based organization as a Founding Data Engineer, and initially I felt really good about the role. For the first three months or so, while building the team, everything was smooth. But after that, I started feeling more or less the same way you described. When you’re the decision-maker, from system design to the nitty-gritty details, you’re also the one who gets blamed when things don’t work out. At one point, I even felt that juniors were contributing more than me because I was stuck in a loop of wrong decisions. But that’s okay. We are engineers, and we are supposed to try, fail, and learn until something works out. It can feel overwhelming to be your own north star at the beginning. I hope you start figuring things out soon. During my own period of doubt, my CTO once told me, “I’m happy that you’re demotivated. It shows you’re serious about your work, and when things don’t work out, you feel disappointed. That’s a great engineer trait.” So you do have a great engineer trait.

Use draw.io or something like that to draw your architecture, and share that with your team before building it and review it to see if it is foolproof. Then go build your application to that architecture. Things will fall into place, and you’ll have a documented trail of why you made decisions.

What ends up happening is that all the system developers refuse to migrate to a new workflow and keeps on with their own little DB silos without sending data to the lakehosue, and the same people that used to work on the datawarehouse now have to become virtual members in the product teams to shuffle the data to the lakehouse in much the same way that they used to before. Only now they have to adhere to the product owners whims as to how they do things in the product, and how the product owner wants them to do ingestion etc. Of course this all happens in IT, and the business users who hold all of the business knowledge (how the data is used) are still outside of IT, and the datawarehouse people who could previously work with them directly are now no longer allowed to do so and have to prepare data that is WAY worse to work with for the analysts than what they had in the datawarehouse.",TaylorExpandMyAss,2025-12-14 15:01:22,42,dataengineering,t3_1pme0ww,False,

ntzq01x,"We have a central DE team and a central BI team. We haven't implemented a data mesh, though we have talked about it. A lot of the teams organically adopted systems and contractors and do own their own data. But they aren't generally technical users and there was no governance or standards. And all the data became siloed. The central DE team is working to unsilo the data. Our goal is to eventually create data standards and enforce them so the data is actually a good quality. This is a slow process, but I'm optimistic. The central BI team does seem to have a problem with scale. At my company, most of the functional users don't have BI experts and can't use PBI - at least nowhere near the quality that the BI team does. However, the BI team moves quite slowly to produce the reporting. The result is that functional teams build their own custom, low governance, reporting off the centralized data out of necessity. By the time BI develops the right tools, the business doesn't need it anymore and doesn't want to switch. My untested idea is to give the business access to easy to use cloud based dashboarding tools (like Sigma for example). Then BI provides support, underlying data models, and connectivity to non enterprise grade sources like SharePoint. In short, decentralizing everything without governance cannot work. Centralizing everything without a plan to scale cannot work. A data mesh is the tightrope that attempts to balance this.

An architecture is only as good as its adoption. There are plenty of tools, processing patterns, architectures, etc that are excellent if you have the ability, resources, and will to implement them. In reality, the vast majority of companies do not. The key is to not throw out the baby with the bath water. For every “failed” implementation of Mesh, Agile, Hadoop, etc we’ve had through the years there has been incremental progress, evidenced by the plethora of options we have today to build data engineering stacks and teams to fit the different needs of companies. For me, data mesh was indicative of a paradigm shift from the old school prescriptive warehouse to a modern democratization enabled and fueled by the cycle of real-world problem solving. Data warehouse, data mart, self serve bi, data lake, data mesh, lakehouse. It’s just an evolution of trying to solve the same(ish) problem.

So we had a ton of technical debt that accrued during our mvp/pilot because these teams where building toward a centralized architecture with NO data domains and not engaging with any of the missions.We used AWS native services and data bricks because a few of the missions already had architectures.We are 18 months in and the benefits are close but far at the same time.

nu7ux2k,"I worked at a Fortune 100 as a data leader pursuing several of the key principles defined in Data Mesh. We didn’t say we were implementing Data Mesh because few outside IT knew about it or understood it. Instead, our aim was to modernize the data platform, speed up delivery of technical solutions, and empower the business with self-service capabilities and less reliance on the IT organization.We were successful in many areas while other elements remained a challenge. For example, we migrated the two largest data platforms from on-premises, self-hosted and managed servers, to native services in the public cloud. Later, we built “lakehouse” capabilities on top of the public cloud platform. These included data governance features, automated data security, and data domains built for key areas of the business such as human resources, marketing, supply chain, etc. The benefits were quite profound. Within the first 2 years we had empowered 50+ business teams. Between year 1 and year 2 we saw 500% growth in teams able to use their data and the platform to create things that matter. Business teams recognized improved decision-making across the enterprise, increased efficiency and cost savings, accelerated speed-to-value for data product creation, and secure data sharing between teams.While we experienced success, the challenges were many. Some teams thought the changes were just another fad IT came up with. Given their prior experiences they were honestly justified in thinking that. Other teams were interested but couldn’t get their leadership to buy in or they didn’t have enough technical chops to harness their domain data on their own. They continued to rely on central IT. Other business teams were so focused on their own projects and demands they simply couldn’t make the initial shift. They asked us to come back later. A thru line that helped in most situations was having clear executive leadership support (CIO, CEO, CDO, and others). They would knock down roadblocks where needed and help provide resources when we got stuck.After 3 years in the journey one thing was abundantly clear. Technology was not the largest challenge. People and culture were. It took tremendous energy to cast the vision and bring people and teams along with us. This required persistent communication with all business teams and clear demonstration of the value of public cloud through demos, pilots, and “soft releases” of products, apps, and services. The technical teams (platforms, cloud, data, security) all became storytellers if they weren’t already. To this day I don’t call the transformation a “data mesh implementation.” But we certainly knew of and studied Data Mesh and sought to implement core principles it espoused: self-service, decentralized data domains/ownership, data governance, and a focus on data product creation within business teams.",trajik210,2025-12-15 20:37:52,2,dataengineering,t3_1pme0ww,False,

I think the use case was making it easier for engineers to get to grips with new databases or for analytics users (me) to get what they need more quickly.I have also seen some people experimenting with GenBI tools (I think looker conversational analytics).In both instances, the solutions miss the actual problem. You need very clean, very well tagged, very well modelled data. The example I always give is that if you go to the table marked “sales” and count the number of sales…. That is not even remotely correct. Years of schema evolution, changes to products, and poor engineering mean the actual number is much harder to derive. For conversational analytics, the prompts must be very carefully tuned and the AI will straight up invent things if you aren’t careful. I would not trust it in the least.For the CoSQL model, I haven’t tried to use it, but I notice that solution architects are suggesting I use it rather than curating dbt so I can use that to control our transformation logic. In that regard, it’s a complete distraction and a massive net-negative.“We don’t have working data products” is the same problem we have had for years and it’s the same problem that will make AI tools harder to implement even if they are viable, but it’s far too unsexy an issue to attract attention.I am hoping that if I can make clear the dependency that AI has on working data products it might get me the resources and tooling I have needed all along.",GrandOldFarty,2025-12-14 13:11:46,43,dataengineering,t3_1pmda5y,False,

Since a lot of human knowledge is embedded in text, this gives us quite a good basis to create large langauge models that can mirror quite a bit of that knowledge. However, large language models are not very good at doing abstract reasoning on anything other than text, which includes a lot of the work you do as an analyst by traslating some fuzzy business logics to maths, at least for anything nontrivial beyond textbook problems. You may attempt to alleviate this somewhat by providing good metadata for context, but my experience is that this doesn't really solve the problem and i very much doubt this will improve untill we get a different class of models all together as the ""more data+larger models"" approach yields diminishing returns due to sublinear scaling of LLMs wrt. data and size.Note: you should take everything i say with a grain of salt, as i am a practitioner using LLMs and my formal training is in physics, not NLP.",TaylorExpandMyAss,2025-12-14 13:14:53,14,dataengineering,t3_1pmda5y,False,

The hard part isn't the LLM at all; it's the systems and guardrails around it.If someone wants to roll their own, the pieces that actually matter are:**1) Explicit semantic layer**You can't let the agent figure out business logic because it's incapable. Metrics, joins, definitions, and edge cases have to be defined in dbt models, semantic views, or a metadata layerIf you don't, you run the inevitable risk of fluent nonsense from the LLM. (Variance will get you eventually)**2) A constrained query surface** (Especially important if you're giving the agent to end users)Don't let the model generate raw SQL and hope for the best. Restrict it to: A verified query library / A constrained DSL / Parameterised patterns. This removes a huge amount of hallucination and makes failures actually diagnosable.**3) Feedback loop/flywheel****This is** ***critical.***You need traces of every input, generated query, and failure mode so you can see:* Where the semantic layer is missing context* Which inputs result in varied rather than consistent outputs (not reliable + potentially incorrect)* Where the agent is making the same wrong assumptions repeatedlyWithout that loop, you cannot really improve the agent, but with it, you can patch gaps, clarify metrics, and improve the agent's ability over time.That’s the main stuff people underestimate when they say “just add an agent”.For full disclosure, I've ended up building this approach into a full product called Inconvo that helps teams develop their semantic layer and includes built-in query guardrails and feedback loop tracing.Also, for those data engineering teams being asked to build this for customer-facing use cases (pretty common these days and a huge ask!) Inconvo has an API and integrations so data engineers can focus on data correctness instead of auth, UI, and other historically full-stack work.**Main take:**None of this works without good old data engineering and well-modelled data; the agent just amplifies whatever assumptions you bake in.Interested to hear where others have hit the limits of this approach.",deputystaggz,2025-12-14 22:27:08,8,dataengineering,t3_1pmda5y,False,

Unlike SQLMesh-original-flavour, you don't have proprietary code; Fivetran have access to the same stuff plus a lot more resources.Remember, you _only_ get acquired if it makes business sense to them to spend the money on buying you out ... instead of on using their own engineering team to outcompete you.

Note that through the majority of the history of data warehouses the principal platforms were general purpose databases like db2, oracle and sql server.

This can provide a significant edge to performance. * Configuring your database to support query parallelism is also critical at volume. * Database constraints are just as important in OLAP as they are in OLTP - and postgres can provide a ton of value here! You may need to turn them off on massive fact tables, but you can also use them at least with summary & dimension tables. * AWS RDS has pretty slow IO, but other hosting options can provide blisteringly-fast servers. But you may need to have postgres dba skills. * All the above assumes vanilla postgres.

As this will change the comments, based on your constraints.DuckDB for olap processing, easy install on a Linux-VM, only heard great things about it. Microsoft has the free SQL Server Express for OLTP - perfect for staging area - 10 gig limit per database - so have a DB per source and ingest, you'll have 2 cpu peformance and decent ram usage (16g I think, check Microsoft's web page).So what's nice with SQL Server Express is it plays nice with your AD and talks easily to other MSSQL systems, so you can avoid flat files when flat files don't make sense.If you want history of all changes, without the hassle of CDC, flat files on a massive file share dedicated for this, you basically emulate a datalake. If this file share system is Linux, there's probably Datalake compatible open-source you can use so you can do SELECT directly on the CSV/Json/XML flat files, just like a real cloud datalake. But I haven't done it - I'm sure someone here has.In any case, Google Big Query and even Azure Datalake are not expensive. Probably on-par with dedicated hardware costs internally adding a 4TB mirrored fileshare system, when costed and budgeted over 36 months.It depends on CAPEX versus OPEX, your boss should know this.

The article explains these well. Key concept here is loading only what you need to, making it useful in situations where the amount of data is very large and/or compute is a concern.A key thing to understand would be is\_icremental(), which is a function which will return True if the model it is being applied in *already exists* in the warehouse (and is also an incremental model which is not running in full-refresh)That means anything wrapped within is\_incremental() won’t be applied the first time you run a model, or when you fully refresh it.This is what you use to compare existing records in your target with your source so you only load the new and/or updated records, depending on your strategy.You can also flip that and use NOT is\_incremental(), meaning that what you wrap it around will only run the first time the model is built (or on full refreshes). That could for example be if you have some old stale data that you need to union with on the first run, but then never need to look at again, except for the case of a full refresh.EDIT: For some clarity, heres an example of an incremental model from dbt docs.If this model has never been run before, or needs to be fully refreshed (reloaded) then `{% if is_incremental() %}` will evaluate to false, meaning that the SQL it wraps wont be sent to the warehouse. That makes sense, since `{{ this }}` will be rendered as the incremental models name. Hard to do a select from something that doesnt exist yet right? We need to compare event\_time in source with what we have loaded before, which we cant do if we've never loaded it.Once we've loaded data for the first time, the if statement will evaluate to true, meaning the WHERE clause gets put into effect. Then the models SQL will return results using that filtering, and that's what ends up getting inserted into the target table in your DWH. {{ config( materialized='incremental' ) }} select *, my_slow_function(my_column) from {{ ref('app_data_events') }} {% if is_incremental() %} -- this filter will only be applied on an incremental run -- (uses >= to include records whose timestamp occurred since the last run of this model) -- (If event_time is NULL or the table is truncated, the condition will always be true and load all records) where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} ) {% endif %}",vickelajnen,2025-12-15 06:32:11,7,dataengineering,t3_1pmwjju,False,

nu67tkw,"There’s actually a few things to be concerned with. One issue is making sure you are dealing with the proper timestamp. A lot of the examples in this space gloss over this aspect. For high water mark incremental processing you want to drive off of the timestamp representing the moment the record was written in your data warehouse/lakehouse/dbt. You do not want to rely on the application timestamp or the timestamp generated by your source system for incremental processing. For the purposes of this conversation, let’s assume `table_a` and `table_b` both represent this in a column named `dbt_updated_ts`.Another concern is persisting these timestamps in your target model. You will need to decide on `table_a.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_a_dbt_updated_ts` and `table_b.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_b_dbt_updated_ts` or doing something like `least(table_a.dbt_updated_ts, table_b.dbt_updated_ts) as source_dbt_updated_ts`. Regardless of the decision, you should *also* re-state a `dbt_updated_ts` for downstream consumers of your model. They should *not* look at your various source timestamps for incremental processing, only your new `dbt_updated_ts`And this is where the rub comes in. Now you have 2 sources with 2 different timestamps and you need to process them incrementally. A comprehensive way of doing this would be to take all the keys above the high water mark in source a and union with the keys above the high water mark in source b, union the keys together, then use that to scan both tables again to make sure you catch all the changes. Generally this is computationally expensive, although it should give the correct answer.If you are doing this to create something like a SCD type-2 dimension it gets more complicated on top of this, as you will now need to deal with the temporal aspects of your source system as well.I would warn you of this: if someone says add a lookback window, that is usually to cover some architectural sin. This should be questioned.It’s complicated and often computationally expensive to process multiple upstreams in an incremental fashion. Do not forget the maintenance cost: next month you will have an engineer who thinks they are clever and will mess with this logic and it may be ok for most cases but not certain edge cases. KISS. If you can, just materialize any model with multiple upstreams as `table` and save yourself the headache. Again, single-model HWM incremental is perfectly fine, it’s when you attempt to incremental more than one model at once where you will find pain.",raginjason,2025-12-15 15:50:18,7,dataengineering,t1_nu62qv9,False,
nu5lr9u,"You'll want to establish a single \`event\_time\` field (like the person mentioned that responded to you above) that you can use to check if a row needs to be updated by your incremental model.So if you're unioning multiple tables: SELECT id, action_date AS event_time FROM table_a UNION ALL SELECT id, event_at AS event_time FROM table_b UNION ALL SELECT id, timestamp AS event_time FROM table_cand then use `event_time` as your condition in your WHERE clause",creamycolslaw,2025-12-15 13:52:49,3,dataengineering,t1_nu5e134,False,
nu5hnle,"Depends on what you mean.If you're joining/unioning/selecting from other up stream incremental models, you don't really need to think about how they are materialized. At least I can't think of a scenario where you would need to consider that. I could also be completely wrong here, not something I've really given any thought.If you mean in the context of joins/unions within the same model, you still only really have to think about where and when you apply the is\_incremental() macro. To use the above example again (but expanded a bit), say we have some old stale data that we need to load, e.g. from some old source system, and then we're adding data from the new system on top. We still keep the same fields and everything.In this example, the first time we run the model, the first incremental macro will return false, because the model deosnt exist in our target dwh yet. The second macro will return true, since the target table doesnt exist yet. So then we will run the main query, and then union in the old data.On every subsequent run, the first macro will return true, and the second one false. So on all future runs, we will be filtering data from the new system, and disregarding the old one entirely, since no new data is being generated there.So we wrap SQL we want to compile and send to the warehouse depending on the context in which the model is running. In practice I've only used this to wrap a WHERE (most common), CTE's or UNIONs. You can also include multiple wrapped statements as below, for example we might apply an incremental macro inside our CTE's in order to make the model more performant. I find it hard to imagine a scenario where you would wrap it around a join. {{     config(         materialized='incremental'     ) }} select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from {{ ref('app_data_events_from_new_system') }} {% if is_incremental() %}     where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} ) {% endif %} {% if not is_incremental() %}     union     select         customer_id,         period,         total_sales     from  {{ ref('app_data_events_from_old_system') }} {% endif %}This means that the compiled SQL will look like one of these 2 (excluding all of the DML that dbt builds in order to actually insert the data into the target table): -- FIRST RUN RESULTS IN select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system     union     select         customer_id,         period,         total_sales     from  old_db.old_schema.app_data_events_from_old_system -- SUBSEQUENT RUNS RESULT IN select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from target_db.target_schema.target_table_with_app_data_from_both_source_systems)",vickelajnen,2025-12-15 13:28:30,1,dataengineering,t1_nu5e134,False,
nug07et,"Last paragraph imo is the big one. I have hardly met any coworkers that understand the problems that come with incrementals involving multiple tables. This means all of the incrementals they've built involving multiple tables are impossible to reproduce from scratch because those incremental tables are not being updated correctly. Had an entire database in a previous company where they would have to regularly refresh all of the datasets because of this and it would sometimes crash in the process. Absolute mess.For me, because I have the skillsets to do so, I pretty much prefer to stay away from any sort of incremental involving multiple tables and use table materializations like you mention unless I 1) really need it and 2) can implement it in a more generic way rather than a custom incremental model. More generic being something like a custom materialization or macro. For example, we have an incremental materialization that checks counts of the source query vs the incremental table by the incremental timestamp to load deltas. This makes the actual SQL in the DBT model involve no incremental logic and makes the DBT model robust to source data that sometimes updates some historical data instead of only inserting new data. If this scenario had been implemented as a basic DBT append-only incremental model (which it was before it got refactored), then the data would not match reporting from the source system.The example I gave speaks to another problem that goes beyond what you bring up (engineer that thinks they're being smart). There's also the problem that often times engineers will develop something with some assumption for how it's going to work in their mind. ""Oh, well we should only get new data for this process every day."" This is only sometimes true. I've worked at multiple companies and every company has had at least a couple of processes you might expect to work that way but don't for business or engineering reasons. For example, if you have a DBT model that involves updates from multiple tables, what happens if table A is updated later than table B? Then on the next run, you may have to update your incremental on late-arriving data from table A + historical data from table B, which leads to historical updates in your table. Of course, there's other ways to implement these things, but by no means trivial in my experience.",simplybeautifulart,2025-12-17 02:28:31,2,dataengineering,t1_nu67tkw,False,

Even sqlite.

nuba45t,"This ended up being longer than I expected. Hopefully you find this useful. There's actually a lot to your question.When it comes to designing a mart, I keep the ""analyst"" persona in mind as much as possible. This is my north star, even if I don't have analysts. Querying a star should be simple, not something full of odd case logic, analytic queries, coalesces, and the deep SQL knowledge. Save that for your transformations leading up to the star if needed.Regarding keys specifically, there are several goals I have when designing a mart. From the perspective of the ""analyst"" persona querynig the star:1. Joins (dims to facts) should be done with `INNER JOIN` not `OUTER JOIN` - this is for performance and for usability2. No records should be dropped via join - this is a quality issue, you should not be dropping revenue on the floor because your users dimension is incomplete or late for example3. Join conditions should be singular (e.g. no `AND` in join clause) in nature - this is again for performance and usabilityThe ideal query would look something like this: SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name FROM fct_sales AS f INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d ON f.customer_sk = d.customer_sk GROUP BY d.customer_nameThese goals need to be addressed in concert. To do so, you really need a lookup process instead of a hashing strategy.In order to address 1 and 2, you really need to have placeholder records in your dimension for ""unknown"", ""missing"" or ""not applicable"" customers, and your fact table creation needs to use these values as appropriate. You cannot hash your way out of this problem; you need to process your dimension (or at least your dimension lookup) first, and then process your facts. Generally this is done with a lookup table. For item 3 in isolation of 1 and 2, if your dimension is SCD type-1 from a single system then using the source system natural key seems reasonable. Once you have multiple source systems (say, customers from 2 systems) then the natural progression is to either add a `source_system` column and make sure everyone remembers to join on that as well (hint: they won't) or to concatenate your source system with the natural key. This concatenation leaves you with a string key instead of an integer key which now negatively impacts query performance.If your dimension is SCD type-2, it's worse. You are left with something looking like this, which is not obvious to analysts, performs poorly, and is error prone: SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name FROM fct_sales AS f INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d ON f.customer_nk = d.customer_nk AND f.transaction_ts BETWEEN d.begin_effective_ts AND d.end_effective_ts GROUP BY d.customer_name Usability note: Is it `BETWEEN` or did you do the right thing and make your `end_effective_ts` the same moment as the next `begin_effective_ts`? I can almost guarantee your analysts will either use `BETWEEN` or worse they won't consider the effective dates at all and `DISTINCT` the result set to get what they want. Honestly, it's doubtful that future engineers will remember which way you went with effective dates either. All the more reason to address this in your transformation while building the mart instead of leaving it to the mart consumers to remember.To achieve goal 3 with SCD type-2, you want to put a SK on the fact that represents the state of the dimension at a point in time (probably the moment of transaction). To do this you will also need a lookup, as you cannot hash your way out of this either.At this point it should be clear that lookups are the way to go. So the real question is why would you want a hash instead of an integer? To me, the answer is now obvious: integers take next to zero compute to calculate, will join more efficiently, have half a chance at clustering in a meaningful way, and are immune to collision.TL;DR integer lookups",raginjason,2025-12-16 10:42:58,2,dataengineering,t3_1pnjmno,False,

Agents get interesting when the question is variable but still bounded, e.g. “why did churn risk spike for these 20 accounts?”, “summarize anomalies by segment”, “draft an escalation note with the relevant context,” etc. The way we're thinking is that these sandboxed, curated views/tools are guardrails - the agent still does the synthesis + narrative + next-step suggestions.3. We’re also treating schema exploration as a separate (higher risk) capability. I agree that to do real analyst work, you probably need: semantic layer + table relationships + multi-turn exploration. But letting an LLM roam your warehouse is also where we foresee getting: cost blowups, accidental joins into sensitive tables, hallucination and more. One more reason we’re starting constrained: **repeatability.** For some of the agent tasks we're aiming for, it’s almost mandatory for teams to yield the same answer for the same/similar questions (or at least the same underlying definition/query) every time. So our plan for now is: **start constrained → earn trust → expand surface area (curated views + sandboxing allows us to do that)** ideally with a semantic layer + policy checks as the expansion path. If you tried doing this in prod: how are you handling this tradeoff? Do you allow wide read access and rely on RLS/RBAC + logging, or do you gate it behind a semantic model / query planner / allowlists?",Better-Department662,2025-12-17 14:56:40,1,dataengineering,t1_nuicjws,True,

What I've experimented more with is snowflake's 'cortex' ecosystem which allows you to do RBAC on curated views with semantic layers.

nuvmtdt,"tl;dr: I wouldnt necessarily advice to use Snowflake as operational database. As an analytical database, it might help you if the analysts are experiencing timeouts and/or slow queries Depends on how much data you have. Are analysts experiencing problems when they run queries on MySQL? And if they are, are you sure this is a problem related to the amount of data or could it be due to a bad-indexed db or small ec2 instance used to query?By design, Snowflake is not made to be an operational database. There is a new table format called Interactive Table, which according to the documentation is basically the way you would use Snowflake for transactional data (low-latency + high concurrency). It is, however, also written that you get best performance by querying that table with a Interactive Warehouse, which - and here's the catch - is by default ON all the time (which will sky-rocket your costs)If the analysts are experiencing slow queries, then replicating databases in Snowflake will definitely (most likely) help. In this case, I would leave the MySQL database as your operational database and replicate them in Snowflake, where analysts would only query from there (given that they are ok with some delay in the data compared to the data in MySQL). You'll spend a bit less with the AWS instances used to query data, but I'm pretty sure your Snowflake bill will more than compensate that decrease.Btw, I move data from MySQL to Snowflake doing exactly that: lambda -> s3 -> Snowflake (using Tasks) + PowerBI. Very quick to get it up and running (with a first load done with DMS), but given that lambda is not really made for this kind of task (there's a 15min hard timeout in the lambda), I'm on the process of moving that into fargate.",maxbranor,2025-12-19 15:44:03,1,dataengineering,t3_1pqncik,False,

Request came in, and as we processed the page, we'd make database requests, wait for the response, build more page, do more requests, etc. Not great. If you had a long loading page, it might takes 20 seconds or more to load.So we got async. Async was cool because now when a request comes in, I serve you a template and give you some URLs in my API to query. Each makes its own specific action and on completion does something else. Page loads in 0.5s, most of your data is there in <1s, and that one long 15-second query stalling out the old page eventually loads in when ready. Great!However, we ended up with edge cases. Your page loads a complex tab that needs data from 5 dynamic drop-downs that it also has to load data for. That's 5 requests that all get triggering in serial using async or .thens (aka callback hell), or you could hope for the best and occasionally end up with a race condition and a failed load.So we got promises. Honestly, for >90% of use cases, it just improved handling with then, catch, finally, etc. But it also enabled us to use Promise.all where we could cleanly write code, where we could call some nonsense like: function foo() { Promise.all([ getUserDropdownData(), getCityDropdownData(), getStateDropdownData(), getDepartmentDropdownData(), getSomeOtherData() ]) .then(values => { //doesn't execute until all of the above data is loaded const [userData, cityData, statedata, deptData, otherData] = values; buildUserDataDropdown(userData); buildCityDataDropdown(cityData); buildStateDataDropdown(stateData); buildDeptDataDropdown(deptData); buildOtherDataDropdown(otherData); }) .then(() => { //doesn't execute until we're done building all the dropdowns refreshTableData(); //...might have to add a 1ms timeout to grab default values accurately }) } /* disclaimer, I half tested this real quick with timeouts, may or may not work, example only */You would literally be tearing your eyes out to do that without promises; I'm talking 3-4x that many lines of code to sync all of it up. Also, with overhead, you might be waiting \~200ms for each request, so your drop-downs load in \~220ms instead of \~1000ms. Now we can cleanly make those requests in parallel without fear of race conditions, and request our table data even faster.We also got web workers; because Javascript is single-threaded it just executes whatever is at the top of the stack. If I have to do something that counts to...1 billion, that'll block the top of the stack while it counts, locking the rest of the page. If I assign it to a worker, the worker gets a separate thread from my main JS thread to do its task.And that's all I'm gonna say because I took way too long typing this.",Mike312,2025-12-16 08:45:09,9,learnprogramming,t3_1pnuj7k,False,
nub0kfo,"> Is multithreading considered “legacy” or risky now?Depends on the use case. Async doesn't help with CPU-bound work. Multithreading can.> Are async/event-driven models actually better for most scalable backends?Async is just a way to have a suspendable function. For backend, the theory is that we spend a lot of time waiting for slow IO. OS-provided threads tend to be heavyweight (e.g. every thread reserves memory for its call stack, and that tends to be O(MB) for each thread). So using them just to wait for slow IO is wasteful. If we instead move all that into userspace, we can avoid a lot of that overhead.> Or is this more about developer experience than performance?It's both, although async/await also has some downsides (mainly [the function coloring problem](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)). Some languages / runtimes (like Erlang, Go, and Java) manage to avoid the function coloring problem.> A lot of blogs and talks make it sound like classic multithreading (threads, locks, shared state) is something people are actively trying to avoidI maintain that async is susceptible to many of the same issues that multithreaded code is susceptible to, but at a more coarse-grained level. If you have shared data that is being operated on by two in-flight `async` calls, then they will interleave with each other in unpredictable ways. You still want tools to e.g. block one async function from resuming while a different async function is busy updating some shared data.Because async/await has well-defined preemption points, you're not going to have a single memory location that is being read from and written to at the same time. But you _could_ be in the middle of updating a complex structure. Perhaps it's in an inconsistent state, but you need to call an async function before you can put it back in a consistent state. That's basically the same problem that exists in classical threading, with the same solution - you want something like a mutex.There's a reason that Go and Java (with virtual threads) both have mutex types, despite both supporting colorless async. Even then, you are encouraged to use higher-level tools if you can. But sometimes, you just need a mutex.",balefrost,2025-12-16 09:09:24,7,learnprogramming,t3_1pnuj7k,False,

nu5vonj,"SQL injection happens when you are able to identify that the receiving application does not sanitize the user input or limit permissions levels before passing it to the database (application is what authenticates to the database, not the end user). Take the following as an example loophole. The common SQL injection came from login pages, meaning the application would accept a username and password from the end user, then will check the database for matching records.An example of a poor and vulnerable way to handle the input / login process would be something like`Select TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = '{input.username}' AND Password = '{input.password}';`then accepting the record returned as the 'authenticated' user. Now, lets look at how the resulting query would work for a normal input as well as a malicious input. Lets say I put in ""John@Doe.com"" as the username and ""RubberDucky"" as the password. The application would pass the following to the database`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'John@Doe.com' AND Password = 'RubberDucky'`fair enough, now what happens if i put in a username of ""Admin';--""? The application would pass the following `SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'Admin';-- ' AND Password = 'RubberDucky';`The database will return the first user that has the username of ""Admin"" and consider it to be authenticated because ' will finish my string input, "";"" would terminate the SQL command, and ""--"" comments out the rest to prevent any kind of syntax errors. that is just a very basic example. Another example i found in production (i work for this company and had permission) was they created an API that would allow you to pass in a SQL query to generate custom reports and such (HORRIBLE IDEA btw). To make it ""secure"" they used pattern matching and prevented commands like ""UPDATE"", ""DELETE"", ""\*"", etc. So as a proof of concept, i encoded my query in b64 and passed in a query that would decode and execute it to create tables, dump SQL user names, dump stored CC info, etc. I have also seen people do it in HEX Once you start spotting potential holes like this, the possibilities are endless as to what you can do.

The front end then sends the name to the back end to retrieve the stats.Let's say the backend does an SQL query on the database like ""SELECT \* FROM Students WHERE Name = '$name'"".Normally this works great. But what if I type the following:Robert'; DROP TABLE Students;Now the SQL query on the backend looks like this:SELECT \* FROM Students WHERE Name = 'Robert'; DROP TABLE Students;When that is executed, it will search for Robert in the database, and then it will wipe all the data out.Of course you can do more advanced things other than deleting stuff in the database. You can add other queries to try to extract more information than the website would otherwise allow. You can probe the database for other tables, like maybe asking if there is a list of credit card numbers. You can get really fancy like querying to see if any columns start with the letter ""A"" or ""B"" or ""C"" and so on, and if you do enough of those queries you can reconstruct the schema for the database and discover all sorts of interesting things.I wrote a simple website one that had a shell injection vulnerability. It was a great way to learn, and I felt really dumb when someone pointed it out to me, but I'm super glad they did!

This will make the sql query return true, so the login will succeed when it should fail.There are lots of other issues with this code, but that is how SQL injection can work.

If the backend also only uses interfaces to other system, then it's no an sql based attack. However, if the other system is vulnerable then maybe the injection happens there. And that's where the application has access to the database. It uses a pool of connections that will just execute any command you give it. You can make it so that certain commands are not allowed, like dropping tables, but modifying data and reading data your are not supposed to might still be possible. >how are they able to get data returned from a database with their query if they are not an authenticated user to the databaseThe application is authenticated. >and how would they even know what to inject into the SQL database to get what they wantThey often don't.

You really have to see how 90ies PHP websites were made to understand how insecure it all was.

You can't just pass ""1' AND 1; --"" and have it be inserted into ""select \* from users where username = '%s' password = '%s'"". And we salt and has the passwords, if there even are any.

Mindlessly asking AI to generate code for you teaches you nothing. But using AI to explain documentation, recommend improvements, provide examples, and break down code can be immensely valuable. There's nothing wrong with asking AI to clarify and teach. That's exactly what a professor does; to accommodate curriculum reading.What I'll do when trying to pick a new project I'd like to do and ask it something like this: ""I'd like to make an app or program that does xyz. What stack would you recommend and why?"" It'll spit back a bunch of recommendations. Then I'll pull up Google and read a bit about them and pick one. Then I'll pop open the documentation and ask the AI: ""Let's start from the beginning. How do I render zyx? Or how do I get a basic function abc working?"" Then I might ask it to explain the code and reference the documentation. I'll sometimes ask it for a list of the most common functions from the API and what they do, etc... but once AI helps me get the ball rolling I gradually transition to doing things myself. Once I understand the code the AI generated I'll apply it myself. This approach can take awhile but has gotten pretty functional at learning new skills.

nuh9agn,"It's mostly a stylistic question. Some people have learned the ""single return"" style and stick with that.Others prefer the ""return early to handle error conditions"" style, which has its advantages.Most people seem to miss that the two styles are not mutually exclusive. It's certainly possible to handle errors early without an early return. Though, it usually means that we need to do one of two ""not nice"" things stylistically: (a) we need to increase indentation for the non-error case, or (b) we need to use a goto at the error point (or throw an exception), which many people find not nice, but rarely say the explicit reason for their aversion to it.In your particular example that you cited, the early return is not really an ""error case"", though, so in this particular example, placing both the returns at the same indentation level (i.e. one within in the ""if"" branch and the other within the ""else"" branch) would make the \*intent\* slightly clearer.Now, suppose you wanted to amend the function and include some kind of ""error condition"" like for the value 0 (which is mathematically neither even nor odd). In such a case like that, then in my opinion it would be clearer to use an early return for that, since doing so ""idiomatically"" expresses the idea that this kind of situation is an unexpected or unusual case. I.e., maybe the caller made some kind of mistake by asking whether 0 is even or odd, because logically that may make no sense, so maybe it's a mistake that it was asked.Once the ""error returns"" are taken care of, the rest of the code can basically assume (correctly) that the value in question is ""correct"" in terms of logicality.

What happens if an email address doesn't match the ""`isValidEmailAddress`"" check?It's a bit easier to read, both in terms of lowering mental strain and indenting depth, if you take simple cases and pull them out like this: // Try to guess the user's first name, return a generic name if it can't be inferred String guessFirstNameFromEmail(String emailAddress) { if (!isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress)) { return ""Alex""; } if (username == """") { return ""Sam""; } if (username.contains(""."")) { return username.split(""."")[0]; } if (hasUpperAndLowerLetterMix(username)) { return username.splitBy(SplitMethod.CapitalLetters)[0]; } return username; }In the lower case, it's more of a series of deductions - you're considering your assumptions first, and it reads more like getting ""weird"" cases out of the way first (bad input, empty string, etc...).",sessamekesh,2025-12-17 09:03:30,5,learnprogramming,t3_1poqy8r,False,

For that reason, we'll have one return at the end of the function, and use a temporary variable to store the return value. You don't need to have a crazy nested if-else structure for this. Just set the temporary return variable to some value (like null) when you create it. As soon as you hit a return situation, set the variable to some non-null value.

I quit my job and went all in when we started React. Before the BootCamp, I was in tutorial hell, having done Free Code Camp, Harvard CS50, Odin Project, YouTube, and Udemy classes. I'll say that even with all that prep, the BootCamp was a firehose of information, and by the end of it, I was exhausted. I liked the classes. Most of the teachers I had were good. The Jobs class they offered was total trash IMO, but that could have been because of the teacher, who felt more like a social media influencer. That class did force me to finish my portfolio website, so it wasn't all bad. Their Discord is actively shouting out jobs. I ended up taking a few more months after class to wrap my head around React and get better at JavaScript by building projects and doing CodeWars.

nu9zyvl,"The basic idea is: every program consists of objects that have properties and do things. Sometimes they interact with each other. Sometimes they even make more objects.Then there are four ""pillars"": encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.1. Encapsulation is when an object's properties are hidden to the public, and optionally only exposed through some kind of filter. These are most commonly seen as `get` and `set` methods.2. Inheritance is when one type of object is a ""subclass"" of another (""superclass""), so every property and method of the latter also belongs to the former. 3. Abstraction is when you hide the internals of how something works, and just expose the inputs and outputs. This is far from exclusive to OOP; chances are you're already used to this. 4. Polymorphism is when you refer to the same object using different types to get different information from it. In the same ""subclass"" relationship used for inheritance, every object of type subclass is also of type superclass.That's it, that's OOP! Now practice those ideas with C++ since you know the basics of it already. It's very conducive to object-oriented programming - in fact, in college, my advanced OOP class was all C++.

nunj6hc,"Time, trial and error, and working with other programmers on a full-scale codebase.If you want a more prescriptive structure, look at some Java projects. Java has a strongly implied folder structure. Holy shit the directories: com.foo.bar.domain.entities.baz…Look at other projects and try things out. Use a nice IDE (IntelliJ) that makes it easy to refactor and move things around when you realize you don’t like how you organized it (I have been doing this the past few days).As for when to break up functions: as much as you can. Some early advice I got from an AWS engineer was: “if you want something to scale and be maintainable, it has to be made of small pieces.”Good codebases grow. Good codebases eventually become mazes. As a programmer, I try to imagine another programmer (likely myself later on) landing at this function as if being dropped in a maze: how long will it take them to understand where they are.I can’t really give them a good, complete map. But I can try my best to make it so that at each intersection (at each function), it is obvious which way to go. I can make it so that they do not need to spend time looking around, exploring, reasoning, guessing, and backtracking. A good function is understandable immediately, either:- accomplishing something simple in relatively few lines of code- or listing a series of other functions (each doing a simple thing in relatively few lines of code) like a recipe in relatively few lines of code.There are no points for being clever or obscuring what your code is doing. Boring, obvious code is good code.There are certainly times where it makes sense/is easier to just have a big long method.But I have found no predictor for how many bugs a function will produce more accurate than its length.

All of these routes are valid options and many self taught programmers were made from them.I found Udemy better fit for me because it explains the theory in videos with examples and then puts you into test with an exercise or a project (at least in the courses I had).Like others said, In programming you are going to need to read in order learn something on the go more often than not. Not from the comfort of your room, but in the office while you work for example. You won't pull headphones to watch any videos there.

Their main YT channel also has several long video tutorials and crash-courses to my knowledge.There is also lots of videos all over YouTube about most programming topics / concepts, computer science, as well as specific tutorials on projects.Second, unfortunately, reading is just a part of programming as I am sure you're aware. You're going to have to read requirements of projects and their documentation, as well as write it. You're going to have to read code and genuinely try to understand it, both the functions and the larger whole. You're going to have to read documentation of the programming languages, tools, and APIs you're using.I'm not saying that to shame you, God knows, I barely read books. But reading is very much a part of programming, from the learning to the actual process of doing.Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp are both what I have experience with. They're both solid platforms, and I'd probably complete FCC first, and then circle back to Odin Project and see about the gaps and more advanced knowledge it covers. One of the big advantages is that it is fairly unguided and gives you a set of objectives to complete. This forces you to think about what you're doing, how and why, as well as forcing you to acquire knowledge and documentation just like you would on any real project.At that point, I'd probably just try making projects. Maybe dabble in a game engine like Godot because of its lightweight nature, GDScript which is very easy to read and write, and ability to do web exports for Itch.IO. Hell you can even use it to make applications / tools, not games, but I digress.I'm just not sure what to suggest that can fulfill that video requirement, besides trying a hybrid approach. Try to at least read the highlights and general idea of a topic, and then look for some videos about it, maybe practical examples. Don't force yourself to deathmarch paragraph after paragraph, but I don't know if you can truly avoid reading either.I'm sure others know more, I mostly learned by messing around modding games, reading books, nibbling on these tutorial sites and such.

If you're building a calendar or scheduling app where the primary goal of the app was to schedule things, then rolling your own might be worth it to deliver an amazing experience and have full control over it. If it's just one tiny feature, it probably makes more sense to use a good existing library.Second, what are the costs of using an external component? Let's say I need a matrix multiply function. Adding a dependency on a huge linear algebra package like BLAS or numpy might increase the size of the build, add a new license to check, and just overall add a lot of complexity to the project. If the only thing I need it for is to multiply some small matrices and performance doesn't matter, I might implement it myself and use another library to verify that my implementation is correct.Last, is this something that needs to change/update frequently or is it stable? If it's parsing a data file that's internal to my project and not user-generated, then that code might not ever need to change. Writing some custom code to parse it might be fine because it's not likely to break.

nuxg0eo,"tl;dr: if I need something extremely complex and nothing matches my specific use case, or I need something very simple that I feel like will take longer to find, import, and localize.A long time ago when I was working on an ERP system, we needed a way to display tables, needed something to take a data set and do obvious things, like show data in cells, sort, filter, and paginate. But we also had a ton of niche cases and requirements. Sometimes management wanted a summary of the table, and it may need to sum, average, or count the number of times a certain value (or range) appeared in a column.Some cells also needed to provide a link, multiple links, or color-code text in some way. Some cells needed to reformat data in a certain way - for example, if we got a timestamp, did we need to show just the date, just the time, seconds since time, etc. One manager always wanted us to separate date and time as two separate columns for Excel reasons. Oh, yeah, and it needed to have a one-click download CSV export of the data in-browser (so, it couldn't re-send the data to the server to generate a file).Wrote one, it worked great, used it for about 8+ years and it got copied to several of our different systems. Eventually one of the juniors asked why we were using my library, and not some npm library he found that did ""the same thing but better"". My answer, after looking at the library, was that I wrote mine 4 or so years before the npm library was created according to its github history. It also didn't support all of the features, or at least not in some of the specific use cases we had. So it *wasn't* something that existed when I needed it, and it also still didn't technically do everything we needed it to do.Similarly, I'll also ""engineer"" extremely simple things from scratch if I feel like it would take me longer to find a library to do the thing than it would to write. This case was we had a dashboard for a monitoring tool that just needed to show groups of ""top 10s"", so 10 rows, each containing a bar, another bar (with a definable color) inside of it with width based on a percentage, and a text value (that could also be a link).

Something like ""as an admin I would like to be able to see a list of orders so that I can quickly see the status of current orders"". In any case, user stories are also not acceptance criteria, which are more specific things which must be present in order for a ticket to be done. Sometimes things are vague and you have to fill in details based on your understanding of the purpose of the ticket; however, if things are too vague you need to have a discussion to make more detailed ACs. ACs should cover: inputs (clicks, path parameters, query parameters, etc), authentication/authorization (which types of users can do this, what happens if it is not authorized), outputs (status codes, formats such as JSON/XML, schema), how to handle error states (bad inputs, server errors, etc.), validation, navigation (what happens after a user clicks a thing). They won't necessarily cover everything, but everything that they don't cover should be ""dealer's choice"", i.e. they shouldn't matter to the end user, if they do, then it should be in the AC.For your example:AC1: Make a GET endpoint /orders that returns a JSON response matching the schema ... AC2: It should take the following query parameters AC3: It should only be accessible from Orkes in the web service, authenticated by ...

nupbj6f,"The core idea of OOP is to associate data with behaviour. E.g. instead of having a `sort()` function that sorts a list of data based on an algorithm, your data has it's own `sort()` method, so it kind of sorts itself instead of getting sorted.On first glance this sounds very powerful, because a list of strings may be sorted differently than a list of numbers or a list of pointers. What OOP allows you is to have a list of any type, just call `.sort()` on it and the correct sorting method will be used automagically.This idea was then further applied to other things like a Date. Instead of using a library of functions and a collection of structs that the functions work on, you now get an object and have all functions directly associated with that object, so instead of writing `dateutils.to_string(date: Date, ...)` you now have `Date.to_string(...)`. In the early days of OOP this was used for code reuse through inheritance. Inheritance just means, that you define a new class and tell the computer that this class should have all the features of that parent class plus the new stuff you define and except the stuff you redefine in the new class.However, it turned out that Inheritance doesn't work well for code reuse, so nobody sane recommends it any more for that. It also turned out that it's more common to have different behaviour than different kind of data, so people started using ""Composition"" instead. Composition just means that your objects has other objects that are used to perform different kind of behaviour. For Example, you may have a class `Animal` and the animal is supposed to have different behaviour like walk, run, speak, eat. Instead of using Inheritance to create new subclasses of `Animal` and implement different behaviour, you define small interfaces `IRunner`, `IWalker`, `ISpeaker`, `IEater` (or similar) and write small classes for each interface. There might be a `Bark` and a `Meow` class implementing ""ISpeaker` and there may be ""BipedRunner"" and ""QuadrupedRunner"" implementing ""IRunner"" and so on. You then create different animals using the Animal-Constructor:```pycat = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Meow(), CarnivoreEater())dog = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Bark(), CarnivoreEater())horse = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Whinny(), HerbivoreEater())cat.speak() # ""meow!""dog.speak() # ""wruff!""horse.speak() # ""neigh!""```This is what ""Composition over Inheritance"" refers to. So we're almost back to having functions applied to data, but instead we call a method of an object that then looks up another object and calls one of that object's methods (for each individual method call).A big downside of OOP is that contrary to its promise it makes code harder to maintain, because you create a compile time hierarchy that matches your domain model and with that you create boundaries around things (objects) instead of creating boundaries around properties (e.g. positions, prices, ... ).

When I was doing my Bachelor studies then some of my course mates dropped out within the first two semesters. Some partied too much. Some had no self-discipline. Some found out that they picked a wrong field. etc. About skills more, then become proactive. Do not rely just on your courses. Participate in hackathons. Join a programming/robotics club.

nur1lr8,"Funny story I actually just answered a very similar question is the cs majors sub lol I will paste my answer here:First, if you want to study cs get a cs degree and then specialize after. From my experience and talking to professionals degrees like cybersecurity, information systems, and data science (do a stats major instead) are not as good.As for knowing what you want to specialize in I don't think there are any shortcuts besides trying stuff and seeing if you like it. Either take a class or build a project and see if it's cool. You can also research online about the different cs disciplines. If you decide on embedded systems I think computer or elctrical engineering is a better major, but it prob depends on the school.Regarding how economically cooked the different cs subdisciplines are, they honestly aren't that cooked. What's (or rather who) is cooked is the person who graduates, has no extracurricular experience, and is only interested in the doing bare minimum to get money.The truth is that cs isn't an easy path to 6 figures. You either need to genuinely like it or be very disciplined because the degree is only like 30-40% of the puzzle. Join tech clubs, do competitive programming/leetcode, build stuff, and give it your all! It's such a cool subject that touches all the sciences, math, and unifies it under this neat idea of very clearly describing a process.PS: Maybe it's just personal bias but it seems that web dev is the most vulnerable to AI. There's hella ai tools like replit and loveable that can already handle most basic-intermediate apps. Also if you want to be immune to ai get a job writing like cobol for a bank or visual basic for some unc company.Now specifically regarding some stuff you asked: You should stay general until you know what you like, at least until like you finish your first year or two of uni. You'll have enough time to skill up specifically for your interest. Focus on fundamentals and you'll be flexible enough to pivot.

AI is the latest hot thing today, but who knows what will be the next thing a year or two from now?

You would find it on your 4th iteration and return true.Let's say you wanted to do binary search instead So first step, you cut the array in half. N / 2 = 2.5, so we just pick index 2.There's a 3 there, which isn't what we want. So we compare if it's higher or lower than 4.Since 3 is lower than 4, and we know the array is sorted, then we know that 4 is in the right half of the array[4 5]. Now, N = 2So you cut the array in half again. N/2 = 1, and at index 1, there's the number 5. It's higher than 4, so we have to cut in half again[4]Now there's only one element, and it's the number we want, so we return true.You will see that we had to cut the array in half only 3 times before we found it.Binary search has complexity O(log N) because the number of times we need to iterate with respect to the magnitude of the input (in this case, the number of elements in the array) is log (base 2) of N The things that are important when it comes to big O runtime complexity is to1. Identify how you're measuring the input2. Draw out each step of the algorithm3. Determine the amount of steps you would have in the worst case.For linear search, the worst case is having to check every element. So given N elements, you perform N iterations.In the case of binary search, since you're cutting the number of elements to search in half every iteration, you only need search log(base 2) N times, plus the one if there are odd number of elements.",mxldevs,2025-12-14 18:02:02,1,learnprogramming,t1_nu078lc,False,

Run it on GitHub Pages so now it is on the Internet too. Good stuff to learn to get that far. Then add the next small thing by adding a backend server and modify your TODO application to POST tasks there instead. POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE are REST verbs you can learn about. Just print the tasks to the console for now. Once you have that working add a database and save a POSTed task to the database using SQL. INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE are SQL statements that map directly to the REST verbs and they are often referred to as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Fill in the GET (SELECT) request to retrieve your tasks, the UPDATE, then DELETE. Now your application is full stack.Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn, when you need to learn it. MDN is a great resource for the frontend and there are many great resources for whatever backend and database you choose.As you build this, you are doing all of this locally, frontend, backend, database, and committing changes to git and pushing those changes to your GitHub repo as you go. To get your GitHub Pages frontend to talk to your backend running on your local machine you can learn about CORS (allows your frontend to talk to your backend) to add that to your backend then use \`ngrok\` to temporarily expose your server and port to the internet (only works while \`ngrok\` and your computer are running).Now that you have a full stack application running on the Internet, time to learn about authentication to make it so only registered users can access your server. You will add login/logout to your frontend and backend as well as user management. More REST and CRUD stuff to add for that too.Cloud stuff is next to get all of it running on the internet. That is a later topic.Whatever projects you pick, build projects as completely as you can. Make them full stack if that is your thing.

nu4ufej,"Picture yourself in the early 1980s. There is no internet. There barely are any knowledgeable people in your area. Formal programming education is basically non existent before University.All you have is the *documentation manual* for the programming language.How do you learn?Through experimentation. You have no resources, so the only thing you can do is play around, try things. Fail. Try more. Fail again. Try more and eventually succeed.You won't learn by copying tutorial or stackoverflow, etc. code. You will only learn by creating your own code, even if that means that your solutions are maybe complicated, convoluted, and sub-optimal. Yet, they are *your* solutions. They stem from *your thought process*. This way, you *learn*.Once you have a working solution, there is no harm in looking up how others have solved the problems. This way, you can learn better, more optimized approaches. Yet, first *you* need to figure out a solution.The notion of directly looking for solutions via the internet is detrimental to learning, even more so in the current age of permanent availability of the internet, and worse, with the advent of AI. It makes us lazy. It makes us stopping to think analytically. It makes us stop investing effort, because ""why should we when everything is readily available?"". In return, it makes us stop actually *learning*. Learning means struggling. Learning means failing. Learning means debugging. Learning does not mean getting a solution from effectively a third party (no matter if Google, Stackoverflow, AI, etc.)Discipline yourself to not looking for direct solutions and even less *in code*, but to look for *approaches* to solutions. Maybe, download the documentation for your programming language and then cut yourself off the internet. Seems like a radical step, but can be extremely helpful for learning.The thought process from problem to solution is what really counts in programming, not the *implementation* in a programming language (that's the more trivial part and just a necessary evil).Once you understand how to ""think like a programmer"" things change considerably. Programming languages become less important and you learn to work on a more abstract, conceptional level.Maybe, try some programming competitions, like [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (with the accompanying subreddit /r/adventofcode) - current year is over, but the challenges are all accessible back to the very first season in 2015.

Good engineers can debug systems without seeing any of the code much less running it in a debugger.There's lots of tools to help with diagnostics, but it's the process and the experience that really make the difference. Bad engineers have the same access to logs, metrics, tools, etc that good engineers have...and yet bad engineers often can *NEVER* find a problem that a good engineer will pinpoint in minutes.And ""debugging"" doesn't just stop at software: Once you develop the mindset and practices you end up applying it everywhere. After all, building software is really about *debugging people's problems* and patching them with software. Bad engineers write bad software because fundamentally they can't diagnose the problems users are having that they are hired to fix as a software developer.How do you get there?

Even as a jr, document everything you do. Just finished a big project? Most jobs use a documentation system where you can just look up how to do things. Even a simple ""how to run this test"" can go a long way and is proof of what you did. \- When you finsih something, give yourself credit and post it somewehre or mention it in standup. This is somethign many of us struggle with, giving ourselves credit. To get promoted you want the higher ups to know what you did and how you participated in that. \- Take 10 minutes after standup to present anything or even show a doc. Again, you want to be recognizable. You want your boss to say ""OP had a good presentation post-standup that was really interesting"". \- It's better to do 5 tasks and shwo your work than it is to do 10 tasks and keep quiet. This was my biggest issue. Id do tasks but never really wanted the praise or to present it so i kept quiet. My coworkers thought i wasnt doing much and in review seasons i didnt have much coworkers to sing my praises. \- Dont be a passive engineer. A lot of engineers are good but are very passive. In stand up they dont really say they are stuck, they only say ""i continued working on X and investgiaging a small issue"". Nothing else. Nobody is going to help if you dont say ""im stuck"" and trust me engineers get more mad if you spend a week stuck on the same issue then if on day 1 you say ""im stuck"". Time is money.

nue3wly,"I can explain since I work with a said “Good Software Engineer” currently. I’ve been at my current position (my first one since outside of college) for about a year and 10 months give or take. From working there so far, I have worked with two really good engineers. Both of them have had two totally different experiences, but surprisingly, both have ended up in the same place doing the exact same thing. One of them was a self taught developer who tinkered with programming at a young age and learned many languages. Unfortunately, he didn’t pursue a CS degree because he grew up very poor but is in the works of getting one right now. This dude had many personal projects under his belt and worked extensively outside of work getting tasks at work completed. He had around 15 years of experience working with software and loved programming. He knew embedded programming really well too including how PLCs work and loved learning new things about programming. The other had a CE degree from Michigan Tech and has around 15 years of experience. He worked with embedded programming for the bulk of his career at GE Aviation. He really enjoys learning about new technologies and currently is helping us bring into the modern era an older application. This dude is my current mentor and has taught me so much in terms of how to program and ultimately, how to go about architecting and designing programs. He is a monster, he designed a completely new product from an older application at my company and reverse engineered the way it works so that it translated properly to a new language and environment. My coworkers had told him that the old project was a mess since it was written with a very old version of C++ (to most of us it was a mess lol). But he straight up in the interview said “nothing scared him”. My bosses laughed at him but he proved US ALL wrong. The thing about both of them that made them really good engineers was that both of them explicitly stated to me that all they did was “breathe and live” code. They programmed on all their free time and worked many hours outside of the usual 40 hour work week perfecting their craft. They read books, watched videos, they absorbed so much information on their free time that it clearly showed when they came into work ready to start their day. Like I feel helpless sometimes just seeing that they can take on so many tasks (especially tough ones) and my tasks I complete are mediocre at best. But the thing is, I am absorbing the knowledge they give to me.

nu20qch,"Idk, I never struggled to find a job either… until this year. Always had backlogs of recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn, even though I never posted/updated/said I was looking for work. I think there’s a few factors at play that make the job market seem extra shitty right now.1. Layoffs/hiring freezes across big tech, and government jobs. Basically a large pool of people who would have been considered ‘Top Talent’ a few years ago are now all looking for work at once. The longer they are unemployed, the lower the standards get, so even if you are just applying for ‘Regular’ jobs, a few of the 100+ resumes in that inbox probably has ‘Google’ or ‘Meta’ or whatever on it. 2. With AI, it’s become trivial to spam out resumes, and tailor/frame your work experience to the exact job requirements. If you just earnestly apply to jobs, you are unlikely to get an interview even if you are a relatively good fit. You said ‘SQL’ on your resume. Someone else mentioned the exact distribution they use at the company. You said ‘AWS’ they said the exact AWS features and tech stack being used. Often times your resume won’t even make it past the screening stage.3. Just general hiring trends. Hiring tends to be forward looking, so I think a lot of senior leadership is really leaning into the idea that they should be able to accomplish more with the same amount of people. Instead of increasing headcount by 10% for some new project, they’ll try to push AI tools and re-org the ‘freed up’ employees to whatever new project they are working on.It’s definitely pretty rough. Even with 8+ years of backend dev and Data Science experience, I’ve applied to ~100+ jobs. One final round of interviews, no job offers, and I only got there because I had a referral. I’ve started just not bothering with jobs that list even one specific technology I don’t have experience with.I’m not saying I’m a super talented top dev. I’ve always worked at middle of the road non tech F500 companies. But I’ve never been fired or even had a bad performance review.

When candidates get dumped onto the market from layoffs, companies have to ratchet up the difficulty in interviews just to have a manageable pipeline.I've been involved in the recruiting for a team that is not in a tech hub. In-person work is a hard requirement, for about \~150k base salary, no stocks, no bonus. It's probably average for that area, but not particularly attractive for someone to move just for the job. We even offer relocation assistance for that role.We get maybe 20 candidates per job posting, half of which are not qualified because they need sponsorship. If we interview 10 people, about 1/2 can actually write a basic loop. We hire whoever has the best systems design interview since most people can not clear even a LeetCode easy.

nu2ua2e,"Dev quality has always been a mixed bag. College is notoriously bad at delivering industry ready devs and the job itself takes a certain broken sort of mind. Then you had boot camps generating devs that could do one thing okay quickly. Many devs don’t have cs degrees and a lot of those guys are actually pretty solid. The tech has gotten increasingly complex. The output expectations have increased. The quality of peers has declined. Interview intensity has gone way up. There is the expectation now that ai just makes it all happen magically and that we will be eliminated soon anyways. Dollar is worth less. There was a time you could be good at one part of the stack and be paid well. Now the expectation is your good at fe, be, observability, continuous integration, testing, deployment, wireframes, reqs & documentation, etc. It used to be if the codebase was a mess or you weren’t familiar with some framework they would cut you slack of train you but less so now. It used to be a few devs in a room working through stuff. Now everyone’s remote on different continents crammed into tiny noisy apartments. You’re still supposed to manage to mentor them.  Usually most of the team has already been outsourced so they really don’t have the same skin in the game and your heads on the chopping block. The interview used to focus on your degree, likability, location, and experience.  It went from white boarding to take home test and live coding exams to leet code with ai graders kidding your voice and eye movements. Not to mention how everything’s flooded now so getting noticed / not getting duped leading up to the interview view is harder. The expectation of 2x ai productivity doesn’t account for the quality of the ai, existing code, or clarity of instructions. Then there is pay. It’s held strong in a way and even grown faster than other industries but the dollar is worth under 1/3 as much as ten years ago in terms of shelter, transportation, healthcare, and food. Then there’s the increase in domestic cs degrees coming online and the over hiring in the covid market rally which went to layoffs then to ai hiring. I’ve had 6 jobs in ten years and everyone has laid us off or been bought out.

nuypa72,"Generally its going to be YOE because the more time spent means the more problems/situations you face. Even if problems seem similar it may show up with a different constraint and you the solution you'd normally do for that problem might no longer be effective or even feasible. Basically you get an increased scope of knowledge on top of the hindsight of knowing what approaches works well in a situation of multiple approaches being ""correct"".In the example you gave the big thing is scope. You can design and architect a website or microservice but also remember generally thats an extremely small scope and more than likely is a solved problem. Like anyone could go on some system design prep site and know how to design and architect twitter or facebook or some trading site. Where the seniority in that comes in is knowing why you may want to take some approaches vs others based on needs because you've had prior experience making such calls. Often time what you think in your head or what works on paper doesn't play out the same in reality and there tends to be a lot of edge cases that are missed.What makes the big n experience so valuable is because you get exposed to a unique scale problem. Because they work around stuff so big they get to see the extreme edge cases a little more frequently even if theyll never directly work on it but just that visibility is so valuable especially to similar sized companies. But you can turn around and see big n employees might not do well at a smaller company because the breadth of tools they need to know how to use might be something they never even have had to touch or think about previously. Or that scale isnt the big issue and theres another type of problem that needs to be solved.Like if you can crank out a business/ecom site effectively without much help or guidance (this includes truly understanding the business reasons behind what your developing) you are probably a senior at a non tech non super huge scaled company.

nuw8edd,"First, this requires planning beforehand. It's no good if you're figuring out what the after-hours on-call process is while the roof is on fire. As a junior engineer, you can't decide this, but you can get the conversation going. ""Hey, what happens if...?""Second, if there is no such procedure in place, then - all things being equal - I'm probably going to the concert. If it's one I could stand to miss, then maybe I'm making an offer: Cover the cost of my tickets plus something for the trouble. Something like that. But me helping you above and beyond the normal agreement is a favor, and sometimes I'm not in a position to grant you that favor. Boundaries are important.However, I'm also going to try to be accommodating within reason. In a situation like that, I'd offer to check in when I get back from the concert. If the issue's still ongoing, then perhaps some responsibility could be handed off to me so that others can get a break. This is probably really helpful as a junior, because while you might not be the best help for the initial incident, there can often be follow-up work that is less intensive. Like someone needs to run a database query every five minutes and make sure A stays less than B, until we can get the alert automation in place. And if I'm on the primary crew and I've been at it for six hours and a junior comes in at midnight and says, ""How can I help?"" you bet I'll hand that over and get some sleep.Finally, there's also the issue of Emergency Theatre. Do we really need all hands on deck? Or do we need the appearance that we're busting our butts to get it working again? There's not much you can do about this in the moment except recognize it and deal with it later. Figure out why this is the case. There's usually some failure in the management chain - some mid-level director with more power than sense, who has to be appeased. Or maybe a high-profile customer.

At my last job I was involved in hiring, and we would always get at least 1,000 applications in the first 24 hours after posting, usually we'd end up with 3-5k. We started with a code screen, basically a couple LC easy questions, that usually got us down to a few hundred. Then we'd divvy up the resumes and mark them as reject or pass. It was a quick glance maybe 5 seconds each resume to see if they had the basic qualifications, the vast majority of those failed. Then we'd be down to \~20-50 people and we'd have our HR do a phone screen, basically ask about their basic qualifications, make sure they're interested in the job at the salary range we're offering and the tech stack they'd be working on. We rarely rejected anyone in this round but many took themselves out of the running so typically we'd be down to 10-20 at that point. Then we'd have the hiring manager have a phone screen with them. If they made it to this point they had something on their resume we liked, so we'd typically ask them about it and really drill down and ask for excruciating detail to make sure they actually did it. Spoiler alert, most people are exaggerating and/or lying about their specific contribution to a project on their resume, and it's super easy to weed out. That got us down to \~5 which we would invite to interview.Once we selected to interview them, I would then read a cover letter if they sent one, although I think a lot of other folks didn't even read them then. This is also the point I would look at their github if they had one on their resume or anything else they included as side projects. I think I was one of the few people involved in hiring who did any of that most would just look at the resume 10 minutes before the interview. Then the interview was with a few folks, we had one do a tech screen where we give them a sample problem and watch them code, change requirements and see how they adapt. One does a culture fit interview where they ask questions related to soft skills, how do you handle conflict, those types of questions. One is a business round where our product person asks them some questions related to our business and some basic logic questions to see if they can reason through product requirement type things. Then everyone meets and ranks the candidates, we come up with a consensus order, and send the offer out to the first one, if they decline send the offer to the second one, etc. It's also possible at that point that some people just get a fail so even if they're the highest rated candidate we'd rather restart the process than hire them, although that's rare most people who've made it to this stage are at least getting hired if they're the best candidate interviewing for that role who accept because as you can see it's a long and painful process and we'd rather not start over.",Inner_Butterfly1991,2025-12-18 05:42:44,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1ppbbyg,False,

Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.If you're submitting an application, you are selling yourself. No salesperson in the history of ever has tried to get their counterpart to just read the product description. They want face time, to tell the story of their product, to make an emotional appeal.Do you think they send out empty e-mails, with just the technical specs attached and the words ""for your kind consideration""? Or do you think they will use every sentence, every square inch of screen real-estate that they can get to make the other side interested in a conversation?Why on earth would anyone believe that the proven process would work differently when the opportunity you want them to grasp is yourself?For what it's worth, I currently going through my first hiring process on the employer side - I am sitting past an HR filter, so I don't even know if there were any cover letters; I wasn't giving any. But I can tell you this: The majority (of a very, very small pool) of CVs I have seen would not get a pass from me; there's too many slightly reddish flags, and as desperate as I am to work with a larger team, I simply don't have the time to allow someone to correct the misconceptions that their CV has created in the first place.But I would have read a cover letter; I would have read a slightly more detailed CV, and some of the things that tripped me up could have potentially been explained away. Who we invite is not entirely my choice, but I do get a say.And your problem is: I don't aim to be fair, I don't give a damn about giving you a chance. I care about filling a vacancy with someone who primarily has the right skills, enough experience and who I can stand having to talk to a few times a week.And if I know one thing it is this: Once we do hire someone, I lose my voice. I can't get them fired if I think they're a dud, or hard to get along with, so - for my own sake - I have to be very careful and weigh working in a team that's too small vs. working with someone I don't want to work with.And then, neither a CV or a cover letter take eons to write, or to customize for a specific position. Make your documents modular; have blocks that you can shift around if needed, and templates that you can remove or include.Believe me, I write cover letters when I apply for jobs. I have zero proof and no data to show that they work - but I really don't see a world where it's not worth the bit of extra effort.",okayifimust,2025-12-18 00:03:40,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1ppbbyg,False,

nu2uvgb,"lol, welcome to the club. No one on reddit has an easy answer for you. But, if there is an answer, this is it: Keep trying until you stumble on something out of complete luck. Well, it's partly luck. Be very aware of little problems you have or others have and constantly ask, is there a digital solution for this problem?Constantly being aware and asking that question is part of it. The other part is throwing crap against the wall and seeing what sticks. You can be surprised what winds up working versus what you thought would work and was a great idea. What you are trying to do is find the outlier event in a large distribution - and that requires many, many trials until you hit it.You'll never know if you don't test many innumerable ideas out in reality. The trick is to run these tests (as many as possible) without bankrupting your self and keeping the overhead low. One good principle to hold to is: ""what I think will work is irrelevant, what works is the only relevant thing"" - in other words, be REACTIVE and not PRO-ACTIVE. See if something might work - test it like a scientist with a hypothesis and then act based on objective observation. Good luck (you and the rest of us are going to need it...).And just accept that if you want a shot at success - you will have to endure many, many, endless trials that result in failure - until you hit the one that does not (hopefully).",StockGlasses,2025-12-15 01:08:46,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1pmua60,False,

It avoids unnecessary interpersonal conflict and reduces the risk of backlash if your manager interprets it as a personal complaint.If the other developer’s behavior does not produce obstacles that actually impede your work, it is usually best to ignore it. Spending time and energy evaluating another person’s work habits is a distraction from producing strong results yourself.**Responding to your edit:** you’re saying that when your coworkers don’t do their work, you end up working overtime and feeling pressure to meet deadlines. That overtime and deadline pressure is the real obstacle being created by their lack of follow-through.That’s understandably frustrating. The right response is to communicate clearly with your manager about project status and work allocation. When work is assigned but not completed, you should state that the project is off track, explain that tasks are being reallocated, and explicitly note either that you are working overtime to meet deadlines or that deadlines will slip as a result of the reallocation.This gives your manager the opportunity to recognize and credit your extra effort, or to see that deadlines are being missed because work isn’t getting done and needs to be reassigned. Ideally, this leads them to independently notice that a particular coworker is consistently not completing their work.If your manager does not acknowledge your overtime and instead simply pressures you to work harder, then the issue is poor management.

He didn't use version control.This isn't normal, but I don't think it's completely unique, as you hear stories about people who have this experience. In the old days, teams were responsible for their own IT and work, and you'd have teams spring up like this all across departments, until they brought in someone to organize everything. I should probably say ""if"" rather than ""until."" Large organizations also go through something like this, so don't feel too self-conscious. Is there are larger tech community/team in your company? A part of me wants to say you should ask about joining them, but the new manager might be a pain. You should consider looking for other opportunities, as you're probably not learning good software practices. To counter that, perhaps you can allocate time for process improvement. You can sell it as ways to allow others to do your work. So, things like version control (I hope you're already using this, right?), CI/CD, some type of wiki for documentation, a ticketing/tracking system are some good starts. Maybe some next things to consider is how do you monitor things in Production? Just look at log files? I also want to clarify something. Just because a company has this stuff in place doesn't mean they do a good job with it. During the interview process, it's on you to try to figure out if places do a good job or not. Good luck, as some places will flat out lie to you. My last job is an example.

While it was honestly exhausting at times, within two months, I saw my portfolio go from just ideas to five fully functional projects. This hands, on experience not only helped me gain confidence but also increased my visibility; I went from getting maybe one reply out of fifty applications to finding opportunities through networking in relevant communities.

nu5za02,"You’re not crazy for considering this, and you’re also not failing at SWE. The market for new grads has just been brutal, especially if you didn’t get a return offer lined up before graduating.Going into IT is a totally reasonable move if you treat it as a bridge, not a dead end. GeekSquad + Network+ + cloud certs can absolutely move you toward DevOps or SRE if you keep one foot in software. Plenty of people have gone IT → sysadmin → DevOps once they could show scripting, automation, and cloud work.The key is to not stop building or talking like an engineer. Keep shipping small projects, automate stuff at work if you can, write scripts, mess with CI/CD, cloud deployments, monitoring. That’s what makes the transition believable later. If you fully pivot away from coding for a few years, it’s harder to come back.Also, you’re doing a lot right already. Hackathons, freelance, startup, networking, referrals, interviews. The lack of offers isn’t because you’re weak, it’s just timing and competition. IT can give you income, experience, and momentum while the market recovers.One thing I’ve learned is that interviews reward people who can clearly explain what they’ve built and why. During interviews I’ve used StealthCoder to keep my thoughts structured on screen so I don’t undersell myself or blank, especially when my path isn’t “traditional.” That helps when you’re coming from IT or mixed backgrounds.Short answer: yes, IT can be a smart move if you’re intentional about it.

Not that there's anything wrong with enjoying better tools and environment - but careers are long and tweaking your setup isn't going to keep you motivated beyond the next few months, let alone decades.But all that said - you aren't entirely wrong. This is both a job and a career, and if you're not learning stuff or getting growth opportunities then that isn't good. You won't always have interesting things to build, but if you never get that then you're going to stagnate and that's where people run into trouble finding new jobs.You should be able to work with your manager to identify some growth areas and find some tickets where you can learn something.

Mind you, I started out working on build systems at FAANG, and it was very different than what it is today. The trick is to find platform teams that are hiring SWEs where you can build tools that take the pain of infrastructure off of the product teams.There are a lot of DevOps/SRE roles that intersect this space and are 90% config-writing (infrastructure as code), but if you can get into writing custom Terraform modules and Kubernetes controllers you'll be highly sought after. I had a recruiter recently tell me that they pay their platform SWEs more than their backend or frontend SWEs because they're more specialized and harder to find. It's not for everyone, but give it a solid try, you won't be boxing yourself in (at least this early in your career). I have specialized in this role for 10 years so I show up in searches for senior positions. Recruiters that find me for product teams will usually end up having the hiring manager reject my resume because I haven't worked on product for a decade.
