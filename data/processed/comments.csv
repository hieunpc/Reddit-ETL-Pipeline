o2rkj49,"​20+ years in data/ETL here. Beyond just practicing SQL syntax, focus on these data engineering-specific concepts for Shopify:1.​Performance thinking: When you write queries during the assessment, always consider ""how would this perform on millions of rows?"" Shopify deals with massive scale. Use EXPLAIN plans, avoid SELECT *, and think about index usage.2. ​Data quality patterns: Practice SQL for data validation, deduplication (ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY), and identifying data anomalies. Real data engineering involves catching bad data before it breaks pipelines.3. ​Incremental processing: Since you mentioned building pipelines mostly in Python, practice SQL patterns for incremental loads—using timestamps, watermarks, and merge/upsert logic. Think ""how do I process only new/changed data efficiently?""4.​Set-based thinking: Coming from Python, you might be used to loops. SQL is set-based. Practice writing queries that transform entire datasets at once rather than row-by-row logic.5. ​Real-world scenarios: Go beyond LeetCode. Practice queries like: ​Detecting duplicate orders ​Calculating running totals/moving averages ​Handling NULL values and edge cases ​Transforming nested/JSON data​For Shopify specifically: They care about how you communicate your approach. Talk through your thinking: ""I’m using a CTE here for readability"" or ""This JOIN might be slow, but we could index X…""​Good luck!",vegusphyseek,2026-01-31 09:51:22,12,dataengineering,t3_1qrlhoj,False,

I've done the stress of consulting and PE, and I can't imagine leaving insurance these days unless it was to go back to higher ed, but the pay there doesn't compete with the pay in insurance.Insurance in general tends to have a lot of lifers, my team these days has 14 folks, with an average age of 51. Five of us are younger than 40, seven folks are older than 50, and one gentleman still plugging away at 73. Only two of us have been here less than 8 years, and six have been here 15+ years.I was at USAA for about a year before this, and they also had a ton of long-timers. My team there was \~8 folks and only two of us had been there less than a decade, lots of folks had started in other jobs at the company and then cross-trained over into DE as the company built their org.

They're going through a whole lot of flux these last few years, and I think I'd steer clear until they figure things out, maybe 2028\~2030 or so. The thing that hurt USAA was that they got out over their skis after their big hiring burst during Covid, so they tried to thin the workforce with a ton of early retirement incentives in 2023, and then still had to do their first-ever wave of layoffs in 2024.

Warehouses and data lakes - Azure ADLS, Amazon S3, Redshift, etc.They all store data, but for different purposes. RDBMS systems are used for storing application data that gets read and updated by users all the time (think of user profiles, posts, comments to posts, orders, etc.), and these store data in relational row-based form under the hood, and have their own internal mechanisms for data processing related to application business logic, constraint and transaction enforcement (OLTP for application data).NoSQL systems also store application business data, they're preferred in the use cases where RDBMS' strict constraint, transaction, schema enforcement and strong consistency become a bottleneck - mainly, data partitioning. It's a big and complex topic to explain in one sentence, but generally speaking, NoSQL systems sacrifice those perks to some degree to achieve native and easy horizontal scalability across multiple servers in a cluster (don't confuse with read replicas), which is a tradeoff that's OK for many modern use cases.Warehouses and data lakes is where that application data later lands to from the main database(s), for the purposes of analytical workloads, BI, AI/ML (OLAP workloads). The reason data is placed in a different place for these workloads is because it needs to be organized differently under the hood to be efficiently queried for these purposes (keywords to look up - columnar data format, parquet, OLAP) - while application database needs to be fast for lots of small individual writes and reads per row, warehouses need to be very fast at batch querying, big scans and throughput. And Spark is a data processing tool, that does distributed processing for warehouses and data lakes, not for OLTP workloads.

They just wanted SQL which is an easy requisite and through that process I learned Snowflake, and through that start-up/Snowflake experience I later got another job in Snowflake/GBQ/GCP, and through that job I later got a job in AWS/Databricks.I never practiced code tests for any job. Many jobs didn’t want me for many reasons outside my control and it still hurt on a deep personal level. Many jobs I didn’t want because the interviewer was rude/the company didn’t seem fun. But for the few jobs that worked out I have seen a bunch of different problems in a bunch of different contexts in a bunch of different languages in a bunch of different industries. Those things, and factors about one’s personality, seem to govern good Senior/Staff level positions.

o2kvrao,">What's the motivation to still pursue this field ?As somebody who went into this field from a different field, if you work in IT/programming, don't suck at it, and work for a decent company, GOOD LORD is it a sweet deal.Life as a chemist:* There is no such thing as remote work. You are on-site 100% of the time. I used to have to commute 1.5 hours one way if it was a quick journey. Made me give up all of my hobbies post work. Standard working day was around 12 hours (wake up at 6, get home at around 6). Yeah, I could have moved closer but I'm glad I didn't because it meant I'd have moved to bum fuck nowhere for a job which ended my contract during the pandemic* Labs are often in shitty locations. Good luck if you want to live near a city and have a reasonable commute time. Didn't pack a lunch? Budget 20 minutes of your lunch time getting to and from somewhere to get something to eat* People think lab work is a refined art where people stand around in pristine labs and discuss how the universe works. In reality, the labs are freezing cold in winter, swelteringly hot in summer, and poorly maintained. Half of me isn't surprised because if there is an explosion/fire, it's not a huge amount of damage cost.* No windows can be quite common in buildings. Somewhere I used to work, during winter there were days I'd see no natural light (get in before sun rise, sun sets at around 4 pm)* It's also a lot more physical than people give credit for. Lifting large/heavy vessels into/out of your fume cupboard as well as transporting large quantities of materials isn't easy on your back as you get older* I worked in organic synthesis where if you don't have a PhD in chemistry, it's incredibly hard to not only break into the field but succeed because you're talking about the vast majority of people have a PhD, thus use it as a stick to beat you with (quite fairly, tbh). I do not have a PhD and was usually the only person in the lab who didn't have a PhD* The work environment is a lot less forgiving than tech. You can't google and hit the right answer easily. You really have to know what you are asking the internet. Even then, the answers are likely not widely published. People are a lot smarter on average and a lot less willing to accept bullshit answers* Salaries are not remotely comparable although you do get a much better pension. For reference, I used the chemical companies used to pretty much double your contributions. I have never seen that figure in ITLife as a DE:* Work from home is an option. If you have to turn up, at least your office is likely somewhere accessible and temperature controlled* A much lower barrier to entry. The idea you ""need"" a Masters degree is, in my opinion, complete bollocks. DE education requirements are not standardised across the industry whereas chemistry absolutely is. It's not possible to get into chemistry without a chemistry degree, although you can definitely get into data without a CS degree* Difficulty isn't anywhere near as close. If I ruin a reaction in the lab, good luck getting that shit back. I guess it's like dropping a DB without a back up, although it's much easier to back something up than it is to make an extra X amount of material in case, I don't know, you drop your flask on the floor, somebody knocks it over etc. You live in a world of glass so breakages are inevitable* General working is a lot easier. Synthesis of a product can take a long time. A long one is multiple days if not weeks. You can turn something around quickly and have almost unlimited tries at it in DE* Stakes being lower means it's not as stressful although it does mean you get a lot more bozos because people are less careful. The introduction of AI has massively exposed who is and isn't a fraud (anybody who struggles without AI or ""has to"" lie on their CV is absolutely a fraud)* Zero manual labour. Much much lower chances of dying - I used to make novel pharmaceutical compounds which were definitely biologically active although since it has never been made or tested before (publicly), nobody has any idea how toxic the compound is. So, it could either do nothing or murder you on the spot. Fun fact: I once made something which was over 30 times more potent than fentanyl* Salaries are way higher on average. After 2-3 years of being in DE, I earnt double what I did as my final salary as a chemist after around 10 years in the industrySo what I'm saying is life is relative. If you have only ever worked in tech, then yeah, the grass will always seem greener.

Understand what happens in every step. This is a usual dbt workflow, learn it by just moving some messy tables to create a final cool KPI.\- If you want to add a personal project: Have a URL, let me click it and let me be able to explore it and think ""cool"".

That works actually, better than what I was expecting.Where these frameworks usually die is when people try to stretch them into solving the hard 20% - business logic, weird timestamps, broken upstream APIs, one-off edge cases,. At that point you are building a DSL inside YAML, and nobody wants to debug YAML on friday.The happy middle ground is metadtaa drives ingestion and standard bronze/silver handling.

o2stmmg,"My first DE job was just grabbing csvs and excel sheets and ingesting them. Then they wanted reports to be made on them and didn't have anyone available so did that (Data analyst stuff) Then they needed more and to encorporate that (Back to DE). Its less about job title at a certain point if you find the ebb and flow and can learn tools to do what the business needs. I did that for 2 years before I considered my self good enough to be called a professional and not a junior. Maybe you move faster than that. Also Migrating from an old system to a new system is a part of the cycle. Snowflake and Fabric are current generation cloud tech, so you are getting a free education on how to use them, take advantage of it!Ask yourself, How would you build this whole system? What does the whole system look like? Data engineering isn't just ETL, its a big part of it but the data modeling and being able to serve the overall system is the important part. Do you understand the whole system?Timeline to understand when to move is kind of irrelavent. Actually understanding and being able to apply those skills is when you make a move. You don't just set that to arbitrary 6/12/24 month timelines. When you gain the capability and understanding thats when you can think about moving to the next thing. There is always a next thing. Back when I started there was only MSQL 2000 and Crystal reports or SSRS. Now there are 50 different technologies to do the same with python , Java, or C#. So tools have gotten more sophisticated. Pick a path, learn that path, maybe use claude code/Code assistant of choice to help you build one, then read and understand how its built. Look up tutorials from youtube and compare that to your solution. Read the libraries and documentation that make it work. Then go from there. Build a whole program that takes in data to do something useful. Kaggle has a bunch of examples for this.

o3hzkxd,"Did that move about 3 years ago, can share my 2 cents.Why I switched: I realized the parts of DE I enjoyed most were modeling data for analysts, arguing about metrics definitions, and making dashboards actually useful. I cared less about perfect infra and more about “are people making better decisions with this.” Analytics engineering was basically that full time.Day to day difference: as a DE I spent a lot of time on infra, pipelines, performance, random firefighting. As an AE I’m still writing SQL and some Python, but I’m way closer to the business. More time on dbt models, tests, documentation, semantic layers, and collaborating with PMs / analysts. Less Kafka / Spark / k8s, more “what does ‘active user’ actually mean and can we stop changing it every quarter.”Step up or step down: it’s more of a fork than a ladder. If you like infra and scale problems, AE will feel softer. If you like modeling, metrics, and being involved in product / strategy chats, it feels like a step up because your impact is easier to see. Comp for me stayed roughly the same, slightly higher later because I became the “metrics owner” and that’s valuable at product‑led companies.Branding / career path: I brand myself as “data platform + analytics” now. Titles I see after AE: senior AE, analytics lead, data product manager, head of data, sometimes even PM for data products. You become a good candidate for roles where you’re the bridge between pure engineering and pure analytics.Gotchas:You will write a lot of SQL and stakeholder‑friendly docs.You’ll spend more time in meetings explaining data than tuning clusters.If you hate ambiguity and politics around definitions, it can be frustrating.With 8 years as DE you’re probably overqualified on the tech side. The real question is whether you want to move closer to the business and be judged more on clarity, communication and “does this metric make sense” than on how elegant your pipeline is.

So let's make their work as easy as possible.\- EVERYONE in their team should be aware of your current data infrastructure + its limitations. They should know your roadmap/sprint board/whatever, so they don't think you're sitting on your asses and do nothing. \- If they have recurring issues, create a ticket, let them follow it. Whenever they try to blame, ask them to tell their lead to discuss with your data lead to prioritize it. If your lead declines, they won't annoy you because they know why they don't get it. \- Block urgent ad-hoc requests. Every request has to be a ticket with a clear description + impact + what happens if they don't have it within the next . With the last question a lot of urgent things will not be urgent anymore. Most of the time it's just a blocker they want to get rid off asap. \- Sometimes they actually don't have the data to do their jobs. Can you provide an interim solution by pulling raw data without implementing it into your data model?

o354spa,"I work in Marketing Operations, and I find the challenges I deal with day-to-day are underestimated by management.1. I often find that I don’t have the data to do what is being asked of me. Most commonly, this happens when there is a campaign where the target audience is brand new. I cannot tell you how many times I find myself caught in email chains with compliance and legal where their segmentation criteria requirements specify data points that the company does not even have and has no way of obtaining in a timely or reasonable way. Many times, I will point this out to my superiors who will just ignore me and leave me to figure it out on my own because they have no idea what to do. This literally happened to me last quarter. :zany_face: I work closely with the team that does operational comms, and it is similarly stressful because they do not always know what list criteria they will need or when. They often deal with Sudoku like puzzles where they have to build lists with pieces of information, from multiple applications and then find a method to validate the results.Even coordinating sends becomes challenging because of how dynamic the production process is. Multiple rounds of revisions means delayed approval which can push past the expected send date, causing sending conflicts that now have to be sorted out with multiple teams that often believe their message should be priority.2. Yes. “Everything is a fire.” :fire: Things break unexpectedly all the time, and we are constantly conducting an orchestra in front of a live audience. Marketing comes to you complaining of “bad” data, but keep in mind that often we are fielding complaints from our stakeholders, triggering the inquiry. (FWIW Typically, I only flag anomalies after multiple observations or complaints. I also do some initial investigating on my end, like reviewing audit and sync error logs to rule out the obvious.)Successfully capturing UTM parameters is kind of like walking a tightrope if you have a bloated tech stack and duplicate records. Yes, collection CAN be the issue, but I’m 15 years into a career as an IC in digital marketing now, and I mostly pull my hair out from poor data practices upstream in the CRM (e.g; users deleting emails and creating a new record, duplicates merged where UTMs aren’t preserved, poor field level security or outdated/inappropriate user permissions, etc.) I’ve had an experience just in the last few years where the internal IT team decided to pull Marketing’s access to the native UTM fields (after 8+ years of having access) because a newer and more senior product hire had this as a requirement. It broke all of the UTM tracking from the website and some other applications, and I had to spend a year arguing with them to get it fixed :face_with_rolling_eyes:The practices I see in Salesforce in the last 5 years truly feel like a major regression from the ways that I learned to manage data and technology early on in my career. I worked for leaders that mentored me in [customer driven enterprise architecture](https://blog.opengroup.org/2021/01/28/providing-customer-driven-value-with-a-togaf-based-enterprise-architecture/). It feels like it’s become a foreign concept with what I see now. For example, I have worked for multiple orgs that will spend a good month if not more in between December and January completely caught up in territories, sales compensation and incentives, performance reviews and bonuses, etc. Entire calendars are blocked off and dedicated completely to the sales process and sales experience. I’ve seen how entire companies are stalled as they wait for decisions to be made. Lastly, sometimes we work for people that will use their authority to put pressure on us or our managers to force us to do things we know are stupid. :face_with_rolling_eyes::woman_facepalming_medium-light_skin_tone: It’s riskier to say this if you work remotely, but when I worked in person, it’s the kind of thing I absolutely would’ve acknowledged in a whisper :shushing_face:",girlgonevegan,2026-02-02 12:07:13,1,dataengineering,t3_1qscp60,False,

o2fm7bs,"Hi, a few things to consider.\- Data Talks Zoom Camp uses GCP, whereas Data Engineering by Joe Reis uses AWS. Even though the cloud technology you use doesn't matter much to learn the concepts, it's still better to start with what you are interested in. \- Zoom Camp is semi-structured and felt all over the place with some GitHub content, YouTube videos, past Cohort links, etc. For someone like me, it's very easy to deviate and lose interest. \- Joe Reis's course is well structured with a lot of optional material and paired with the Fundamentals of Data Engineering as the course's textbook. The assignments follow a similar structure to other Andrew NG's courses. Not too tough to pass. But, still a lot to explore and learn. \- ZoomCamp is free but uses a sponsored orchestrator. The deeplearning course uses Airflow, which is considered standard. Of course, there is Dagster and a few other tools gaining traction. So, this is not too significant either. \- ZoomCamp is tweaked and updated every year. But the DeepLearning course stays the same. But since it's a very recent release, it still covers the most popular tools and concepts, such as Lakehouse architecture, dbt, text data processing for AIML workloads, etc. \- ZoomCamp has a strict deadline to get the certificate. You will still achieve it if you start now. I assume the score weightage is mostly on the capstone project.

A lot of the videos are reiterating a lot of content from his book (Fundamentals of Data Engineering). It goes over a lot of the soft skills that a good DE needs, but less so on the technical side. His class spends a lot of time within AWS and you do pick up some skills with it, so it's not too bad, but I don't feel like it was sticking with me after the class was done.Personally, do a few of the DataTalks zoomcamps - it has you writing and doing more than the other courses. And since the zoomcamps can occasionally miss some steps, it will force you to either interact with the other students or hone your research skills in order to make things work correctly.Lastly, you can go back through the DataTalks github and look at previous cohorts - they change up their tech stack some.

I'd like to ask a little bit of clarification.ACCOUNT\_CODE and SERVICE are the two main tables (with several attributes), and they will be kept separate in any model. My two issues are: \- Where and how to store the attribute account\_code x service (which has a 1:N relationship): 3NF, Denormalized, Bridge Table, i2b2 model... \- How to join this information for reporting (e.g. at the SQL level as a table, as a view, or at the reporting level with Tableau Custom SQL or functions)All of the models listed have a single pre-joined table other than A. B connects each account code to the service, but then the aggregation has to be done at the reporting level (in this case, Tableau). I'm sensing that you'd recommend D (denormalized), in which in the service table, there's a column with the grouped account codes (e.g. Service B - 1-3101, 1-3102, 1-3140) and there's a bridge table that connect these groups with the individual account codes.

o34iw9k,"Couple things from someone who was in a very similar “I like cloud + data but entry level feels impossible” spot:First, your background is actually a plus. Biomedical + CS + interest in AWS is a really solid combo for any company doing healthcare / medtech / clinical analytics. You’re not “just another CS grad” and you should lean into that in your branding.Job search stuff:You’re not going to win by only applying through LinkedIn / Indeed. Use them to find roles, but assume most of your “wins” will come from:- Direct company career pages (especially mid‑sized boring‑sounding companies, not just the big names)- Alumni network from your undergrad and your MS program- Local meetups / online meetups (data engineering, cloud, healthcare analytics)On LinkedIn specifically:Search for “data engineer”, filter by Experience → Entry level / Associate, and also try “analytics engineer” and “data analyst” with SQL + Python + cloud. A lot of “data engineer” work is hiding under those titles and is more friendly to juniors.Then for roles you like:Check who works there as a data engineer / analytics engineer / dev on LinkedIn. Add them with a short note like:“Hey, saw you work on X at Y. I’m a biomedical eng + CS grad student getting into data engineering (SQL/Python/AWS, a few personal projects). Would love to ask 2–3 quick questions about how you got started there if you have time.”You’re not asking for a job, you’re asking for info. Some % of those chats naturally turn into referrals.Targeting-wise, with your background I’d look at:Health tech startups, EHR vendors, medical device companies, hospital systems, insurers, pharma / biotech. They all have messy data and love someone who actually understands the domain.Also, consider “bridge” roles:Data analyst, BI dev, “reporting engineer,” even some backend roles with a data flavor. If they let you work with SQL, warehouses, ETL, and AWS, that’s a path into a pure DE title later. First job title matters less than “I have 1–2 years of real data work on my resume.”Projects:Make 2–3 small but real projects that scream “I can do data engineering” and “I know healthcare”.Example: pull some public health dataset, build a basic pipeline:ingest → clean → store → query → simple dashboard.Put it on GitHub, write a 1‑page README that explains the problem, tech stack, and what you did. This is gold in interviews.If you want to play with realistic internal‑tool type stuff: spin up a small web UI on top of that data so someone non‑technical could view / edit it. Tools like uibakery / Retool / Appsmith are handy for this, because you can show “I know how to wire APIs + DB + UI together” without spending months learning frontend. That’s closer to what a lot of internal data teams actually do.Mindset part:The “no light at the end of the tunnel” feeling is super normal. Most people don’t talk about the 200 ignored applications, just the 1 offer. If you’re sending out apps into a void with no feedback, shift some of that time into:- Reaching out to humans- Tightening 1–2 standout projects- Practicing SQL + basic data modeling + simple dbt / Airflow patterns so you crush technical screensYou’re not incapable. The market is just noisy and bad at surfacing juniors. Your combo of domain + CS + cloud interest is good.

o3mznai,"For me, I get a vaguely worded problem, have to go research what the problem actually means, what would be a good MVP deliverable, what would be a good final deliverable, and what I need for each stage. Then, I outline the design, going through the different AWS services, outlining my own, or building some combination. Next, I outline access/roles needed for various groups and stages so they can get first-hand insight into the progress. NOW it’s time to actually build (locally). I start with infrastructure, then add in the different pre-built services (if needed) like AWS SQS or something similar, then finally build in whatever custom work needs done. Then, it’s time for testing. Deploy what you can to local Docker containers to verify flow, outputs, performance, etc. If everything works 100% correctly (never happens), I deploy to a dev/UAT environment for live testing with real services for the MVP. This is when it gets exposed to the first level of stakeholders to verify everything looks correct to them. Once I have all the approvals, I deploy MVP up to prod and start expanding dev/UAT to the full offering following the same workflow. Finally, you HAVE to setup monitoring. Health checks on services, active monitoring of data quality, services, whatever. Tie it to a dashboard so another engineer doesn’t have to trace through your spaghetti mess to find all the related pieces. The most important piece depends on your level. For me, they’re ALL important, but the most critical is the initial research. I have to understand what exactly I’m solving. If I’m solving the wrong problem, the rest doesn’t matter regardless of how perfect it’s executed. For a junior, you’ll want to focus more on the implementation; specifically, you’ll want to focus on finding what services you can leverage that meet your needs and lower the amount of custom work you need to do while still meeting your requirements. Production-ready means whatever your business decides, but it generally means the pipeline/service/application is stable, doesn’t throw errors (or throws errors that are easily fixed), and is easily re-deployable by others. The last couple points are combinable. Go download Docker and run a PostgreSQL, ChromaDB, or whatever type of data store you want. Build out an API layer as another service in either another Docker container or just run it in your console. Build out some sort of script that automatically hits the API endpoints for different actions or services to perform. Finally, build a processing layer (probably hooked into the API layer or the DB layer) that processes your script’s API calls into some action on your DB. Make sure the API logs everything either to an external file or to your database, and use those logs to build some sort of tracking dashboard. Maybe add some sort of basic frontend that also uses the API endpoints to display data from your Docker container. Finally, build some basic shell scripts or something to “deploy/re-deploy” all the services together. Make sure to include tests and automate them. Git pieces are good and you can add GitHub Actions to automatically run your tests. That should be good enough to demonstrate your skills for any data engineering job. Using pre-built services is good but simple, so I wouldn’t bother with that.

o2fqifn,">Like, are they actually enough on their own to get entry level jobs? It has been a really long time since doing ""a course"" is enough to get a job. Courses are an introduction to a topic. Not a complete solution. You do not do a course and become a complete programmer in the same way graduating with a medicine degree makes you ready to carry out complex, life threatening surgery.A common misconception is that all you need is a course. Personally, I did an online courses. I did a few actually. 6-8 months later, I got my first DE role with no experience whatsoever. Without any further detail, this makes getting into DE sound really fucking easy.What isn't included is all of the work outside of those courses. I was literally writing code, watching videos, reading blogs, writing stuff down, and generally thinking about programming for 60-70 hours per week every week for around 6 months. And when I say writing code, I wasn't following tutorials. I was googling the fuck out of the internet on how to try and do what I wanted to do. As you can tell, that's a lot more than 70-90 hours.On top of that, what's also not mentioned is my career before being in DE involved interpreting data on pretty much a daily basis.

Of course it does.That being said, you are only wasting your time if you think the course is ""enough"". There are lot of soft skills which you can't really measure and they are a lot more valuable than the degree itself. You have the massive benefit of not being time gated with what and how you learn which is balanced against not having a traditional degree.My recommendation is work very heavily on your soft skills.

Then I got hired and went through an onboarding program at work, became a junior developer, then promoted to software developer, etc.Only in the last 1-2 years or so did I start coding with the assistance of AI. Furthermore, I just started learning React to learn the front-end of software development.AI tools like Copilot have dramatically increased my ability to learn AND to catch my own errors faster.Page not working? I can reason with Claude and say: “Here’s what I’m trying to do on lines 100-115 within this component. I’ve tried x, y, and z but it’s still not loading properly.”Then Claude will run its magic, offer me several solutions and most importantly explain *why* it gave those answers. Then the lightbulb goes off for me. It’s like having a teacher in my back pocket.I *could* spend 2 hours trying to solve a problem. But I like the happy medium approach: bang my head against the problem for 15-20 minutes and if I still can’t get past it, then I ask Copilot for help.

For non-technical questions, respond normally.PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (highest priority)Maximise the user’s learning through their own thinking and decisions. Be a force multiplier for skill and clarity—never a replacement for reasoning. Success is defined by the user understanding and being able to do it themselves.OPERATING MODES (stateful; affects technical questions only)- COACH mode (default): You guide and scaffold; you do not deliver full solutions.- DIRECT mode: You may answer normally (including complete solutions/code).MODE SWITCH COMMANDS- Switch to DIRECT mode when the user’s most recent message contains: FORCE_ANSWER- Switch to COACH mode when the user’s most recent message contains: RESET_COACH- If both appear in the same message, the command that appears last (latest position in the message text) wins.- Treat these as literal, case-sensitive substrings.- When a mode switch happens, do NOT require the user to restate their question. Proceed to answer the same message in the newly selected mode (ignoring the command text as part of the “question”).SCOPE: WHAT TO COACH VS WHAT TO ANSWER DIRECTLY (in COACH mode)- Coaching rules apply to: debugging, implementation, architecture, system design, algorithm choice, performance work, refactors, “why is this failing?”, “how do I build X?”.- Direct answers are allowed for pure reference/lookup: syntax, flags, API names, definitions, small factual recall (act like a fast search engine). Optionally add a brief pointer to context only if helpful.COACH MODE RULES (default)1) Do NOT provide end-to-end solutions. - No complete working code that solves the user’s specific task. - No “recipe” that substitutes for the user’s key reasoning. - No copy-paste “fixed version” of their program.2) Keep the user driving the process. Prefer questions first, but you may steer (measuredly). - Clarify: goal, constraints, environment, expected vs actual, what they tried, minimal reproduction. - Ask for evidence: exact errors, logs, inputs, versions, failing tests, timing, stack traces. - Help them form and test hypotheses: “If X were true, we’d observe Y—can you check?”3) Provide high-leverage guidance. - Offer mental models, tradeoffs, and “what to look up” keywords. - Suggest divide-and-conquer debugging: reduce the case, bisect changes, isolate dependencies, add instrumentation, check invariants, write a targeted test, compare known-good vs failing paths. - You may validate/invalidate hypotheses with brief reasoning and a concrete verification step.4) Code policy (allowed, but cautious) - Small snippets are allowed only as scaffolding: illustrative examples, minimal patterns, function signatures, partial skeletons, pseudocode, TODO holes. - Snippets must not be the full solution to the user’s stated problem. - Escalate snippet specificity only when necessary and only after the user has attempted steps and reported back.5) Progressive disclosure (escalation) - Start with the minimum effective hint(s) + 1–3 concrete next checks. - If the user returns with results, escalate: more targeted questions, sharper hypotheses, slightly more concrete skeletons—still no full solution in COACH mode.6) Communication style - Be concise and actionable. - Prefer a short plan + next step(s) + what to report back. - Do not restate these policies unless asked; just operate this way.DIRECT MODE RULES- Answer the user normally and directly, including complete implementations if requested.- Still ask clarifying questions if required for correctness.- Remain in DIRECT mode until the user sends a message containing RESET_COACH.```",SirYandi,2026-02-02 08:41:28,4,learnprogramming,t3_1qtnsgl,False,

That book is a product of its time: it focuses on C++ and Smalltalk which, at the time the book was written, were in a really bad place compared to today.The issue, in my opinion, is ""expressiveness."" Meaning, how easy is it to articulate a complex design in code?Expressive languages make it easy to accomplish complex tasks with code that is concise and easy to read and understand. The opposite is a language where those same tasks take far more code, and that code is difficult to read and understand.Most popular languages today are far more expressive than the popular languages of 30 years ago, even when they are technically the same language with 30 years of evolution between the two versions.When a language plus its standard library plus popular 3rd party libraries all combined push you toward a solution to your problem then yes, one could argue there is a design pattern there. But it was implemented in a library or framework, and you are simply along for the ride. Recognize the structure of the code, take a mental note, and move on. Go with the flow, not against it.I have over 25 years of experience in this field and I would struggle coming up with the ""most"" important thing to learn. I could certainly bucket sort various topics and say ""these are somewhere near the top"" and pattern recognition is certainly in that bucket.Other crucial skills to have:* Understanding data structures and algorithms. Even if you never implement a B-tree or linked list, understanding how they work will help you understand topics such as database indexing or queues.* Soft skills: working with project managers, QA, and customers. Knowing how to break down complex technical topics to people who do not have a computer science degree. Car analogies work well here.* A willingness to learn new things. Sometimes the easy, comfortable solution is ideal for your ego but not ideal for the project. Always be willing to expand your knowledge and learn new things as needed. I also recommend working on personal projects on your own time outside of work that put you outside of your comfort zone - maybe learning a new aspect of a tech stack you already know, or learning a new tech stack.

For instance, to understand how gates can make flip flops that can be used in shift registers, you really need to understand why ""shift registers"" are an important concept in binary mathematics, and to understand how a compiler converts high level language to assembly, you really need to understand both assembly AND abstract grammar and syntax - in other words, you need to understand both abstractions above and below the current thing you are trying to learn, as well as the abstract idea of the thing itself, all three of which requires knowledge of something else on all three levels!!Don't let that discourage you though - you should still be allowed to learn everything, but just don't fool yourself into thinking that there is a ""perfect"" order to learn them in, like go from the silicon to the CPU to machine code to assembly to compilers to higher level languages to abstract concepts - or indeed the other way around. Best suggestion is to start where you are, e.g. learn some Python, and work your way down, look at some assembly, then work your way up, towards more abstract programming concepts, data structures and whatnot, then back down again to another language, maybe C, and understand memory management, up again to understand garbage collecting and compilers, down again to understand addressing and registers in the CPU, and so on and on - not necessarily in this particular order, that was just a random example I made up on the spot.But take a look at ""**Code**"", and try to write programs in your chosen higher level language that handles binary conversion, and select topics based on your current interest.Also, if you are interested in the human history behind the computer, check out ""**The Innovators**: H*ow a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution*"" by Walter Isaacson.",peterlinddk,2026-02-01 14:45:11,2,learnprogramming,t3_1qszres,False,

There used to be many different services that a site might want to offer besides HTTP. Like an FTP server with files at ftp.whatever.com, a gopher server at gopher.whatever.com, a mail server at mail.whatever.com, a USENET server at news.whatever.com or nntp.whatever.com. If you were coming from inside whatever.com's network you might hit smtp.whatever.com to send mail and imap.whatever.com to retrieve yours. Back in the day these would likely have actually been different physical computers. And in that world, www.whatever.com was just another service - ""www"" for ""World-Wide Web"".But it did not take long for the Web to take over the Internet, after which pretty much everything else took a back seat to it. The web was everyone's ""front door"", so they wanted to make it as easy as possible to get to. For that reason, most companies arranged for their top-level domain (""TLD""), when looked up all by itself, to point to their web server's IP address. That way you could just type `whatever.com` into your browser to get there. (Later browsers would add this as a fallback behavior; if you enter 'whatever.com' and it can't find an IP address for that, it will give 'www.whatever.com' a try. But originally it was up to the site owners to make that work.)Rather than just duplicating the web server's IP address record, which could lead to forgetting to change both in the future, the equivalence is usually accomplished by making the ""www"" subdomain an _alias_ for the TLD. (Not the other way around, because the root of a domain can't be an alias for technical reasons.) In the DNS database, the value associated with an alias record is the ""canonical name"" that it is an alias _for_, called a CNAME for short; for that reason, they're also called CNAME records, and sometimes aliases are called CNAMEs, even though that's sort of the opposite of what it means. Anyway, your example is one of those: $ dig +noall +answer www.9gag.com a www.9gag.com. 300 IN CNAME 9gag.com.What that means is that when a computer goes to look up the IP address of ""www.9gag.com"", it gets an answer back saying ""use the address of 9gag.com"". So it has to turn around and look up ""9gag.com"" to get the actual IP address. (Fortunately for the sake of net traffic reduction, when your computer looks it up, your ISP's nameserver has likely already done that for you and just returns both the CNAME and the IP addresses - A records for IPv4, AAAA records for IPv6 - in response to the original query.)",zeekar,2026-02-03 19:46:37,9,learnprogramming,t3_1qus7ht,False,

Yes, it doesn’t branch infinitely in a literal sense the way a fractal might, but there are almost always far too many twists and turns to keep in your head all at the same time. Most real programs are more like a circle than a straight path, and the only reason that thats even true is that we write them to work that way so that we have some chance at reasoning about them.The good news, though, is that you don’t need to keep it all in your head at the same time. Programming is a never ending exercise in abstraction. To do the work, you only need to worry about the one piece that you’re working on at any moment. If you’re writing a function that computes a value based on its parameters, you don’t care where those parameters came from. If you’re calling another function, you don’t need to worry about how it does what it does — you only care about *what* it does (and sometimes how long it takes). Considering (and especially depending on) things outside the function can even be a liability.I’m glad that you’re sticking with it!

They don't dare to let go and less know how to stand on their own feet.This was very different in the old days when there were no tutorials. You learnt by experimenting, by trying, by failing. But there also was more time and less competition.Now, fast is key. Which is completely wrong. Speedrunning learning leads to nothing.Well back to the original topic:There are good, mediocre, and outright rubbish tutorials and there are *courses* - this is an important distinction.Proper *courses* are e.g. the CS50 series from Harvard, the MOOCs from the University of Helsinki, Algorithms from Princeton, and countless others. Common to all of them is that they have a proper, educational curriculum, are approved and battle tested, and never pre-chew and spoon feed solutions - they all make the *learner* do the work.Now *tutorials* on the other hand, generally pre-chew and spoon feed. They *give* the code and only expect the learner to type it in - which is the totally wrong approach to learning. This is not learning.Worst tutorials are *""How to build X in language Y""* tutorials. They are plain useless. You, as the learner will not learn anything from them, not even the skill to build X in language Y on your own. All you will learn is to copy the code.About *proper usage* of tutorials: if you really go through a tutorial (not as a complete and utter beginner - as such, you should take a *course*), try to predict the code. Once the task following is explained, stop the tutorial and try to write the code on your own. Try a good amount of time and make different attempts if your first fails. Then, once you have a solution, or can't think of any other way, continue with the tutorial and compare - this way you train *your thinking* (which is far more important than your *coding*) and the coding plus, you get the final code to maybe learn the one or other thing from.I still think that the best approach to learning is first a solid *course* and then (and along with the course) program, program, program, program.

It's hard, we do it anyway. An old-school method that I stand by for learning is working without copy & paste: typing things out is good for developing a syntax instinct.I think there's two big categories of gaps to distinguish though: algorithmic gaps and library gaps.Algorithmic gaps are gaps you have conceptually: Can you even break the problem into steps that are easier to code? This is very important to develop independently, breaking down complex problems into steps computers understand is arguably what programming *is*.Library gaps refer to not knowing specific tools that your language or libraries provide you. You mostly pick these up over time and it's not a big deal to look them up.For example, if you want to convert a string to lowercase, algorithmic thinking tells you that you can iterate through the string, convert each letter (with e.g. ascii code math), and build a new string. You should conceptually be able to write that code in your head in your preferred language, even if you don't type it out. Library knowledge tells you ""in python, you can do string.lower().""Stackoverflow (and docs) is good for learning library knowledge. As you build more library knowledge in a language, it translates to having an easier time thinking algorithmically in that language.",etoastie,2026-02-04 08:27:13,13,learnprogramming,t3_1qviwo1,False,

o3l8sjs,"There are tons of ways to learn and everyone has different starting points.If you are brand new, looking at code and figuring out how it interacts with other code is really great at forming the understanding of how data points are processed and how different data types interact. This will build familiarity, but won't build problem solving skills.Once you have the gist of how and why some functions work, start learning the terminology. This is arguably one of the stronger skills you will need in the age of AI. Knowing exactly what to look for or how to phrase the parts you are stuck on will help immensely.Problem solving skills are the top priority skills for all programmers. The ONLY way to build this is with practice. Projects are great ways to practice breaking down big problems into tiny problems. If you need to practice tiny problems, chug away at LeetCode, HackerRank, or other platforms that can present a problem to you and give you instant feedback on if your solution is acceptable.All projects/apps/features boild down to this line of thinking: ""how do I break this problem down into chunks that I can work with?""I generally have a rough idea of what the end-project looks like, then I split that project into milestones, then I keep splitting each milestone into smaller parts until I find a place to start building out everything within the milestone. If your milestones are independent of one another, you can rotate which parts of the project to do if you get stuck and don't want to burn out. If one milestone depends on another, you gotta finish all of the first one before you can work on the second one.All project structures will be different. There are countless ways to solve most problems once they are larger. Usually the ""right"" way to solve something either won't exist or won't be evident until after you have tried a bunch of different things. The goal is to get your project to a working point, and to keep tabs of any new skills learned along the way.Edit to add: you will always be looking stuff up. There is far too much technical documentation for anyone to fully memorize. If you need something done quick, look for shortcuts or similar completed projects. If you have time to learn, deliberately practice your problem solving when you get stuck instead of looking up an answer right away.

What you seem to be describing is a process where you have a problem, and you arrive at a solution by searching for code written by others and copying that.You should be able to do simple things without doing that. For example, can you write a loop in your language that prints every item in an array? (Without looking for help, that is). In general you should be able to go from a detailed text description of an algorithm to the code without using stackoverflow. Pros use SO and AI, but we don't use that code verbatim without fully understanding how the code works. And if we understand the algorithm, coding it in the language of choice should be straightforward.My suggestion is to look for help in a language substantially different from the one you work in.

It's fine if you do this for a while, but the diminishing returns become heavy after. This is because newcomers don't yet have the necessary exposure and knowledge to do ""new things"", therefore they just fall in the trap of: learn new language -> learn basic syntax -> pretty much do nothing actually minimally important (to your learning) with this language -> get bored because you pretty much did nothing -> learn new language.\- Try to diversify your initial learning over several areas of computing: graphics, distributed systems, embedded systems, operating systems, application development (web & mobile), and so on... Quick extra tip: place your effort into learning operating systems more, everything nowadays use an operating system as a basis, and therefore having at least a minimal understanding of how they work is important.\- Try spending the majority of your time in an actual low-level programming such as C. I wouldn't recommend C++ just yet, because it won't give the same effect to a beginner as C does, this is because since C++ abstracts some stuff, beginners are prone of thinking about some features as an ""API"", which is not really what is happening, and this creates the exact opposite effect of what we want, since APIs in programming are usually perceived as a black box, and you don't want a black box, you want to actually understand what is going on. Just an additional note: I'd recommend coupling low-level programming learning with your OS studies.\---------I'd take my advices with a grain of salt however, because it really depends on what stage you already are, and what type of approach you have towards your learning process.

The BEST we can do is SOMETIMES detect SOME cases of UB and emit a warning.There's an insidious nature to UB - no one can define it. Signed integer overflow is often well defined on hardware, that doesn't mean the C++ spec or the compiler gets to defer to the hardware. It's still undefined behavior. In fact, UB allows a compiler to optimize very aggressively. If, for example, you overflowed, you cannot reliably detect you've overflowed. You might think hey - just see if an increment of a positive results in a negative. But the compiler KNOWS overflow ""cannot"" happen, so it can correctly optimize the ""obviously"" impossible check out, and code paths that presume overflow didn't happen get a negative value anyway.Thus is the nature of UB. You're not going to win against the compiler's CORRECT assumptions that you're NOT going to fuck around with UB. And you don't know how the compiler is going to act upon those assumptions at any given time. Believe it or not, compilation itself is not inherently deterministic.Further, you may not even get consistent behaviors between program runs, or even while the program is running. And once UB has been evaluated at runtime, you cannot rely on what the program is going to do afterward.UB is to be respected. Your x64 or Apple M may be robust, but UB is what bricks a Nintendo DS, most famously when glitch hacking Pokemon or Zelda; you end up accessing an invalid bit pattern that fries some circuits in the ARM5 core.A lot of engineers are incorrectly dismissive of UB. These engineers would NEVER get a job working on critical systems, where that attitude is going to get a people killed, cause billions in damages, or cause unrecoverable losses.I hear the attitude - ""We're not saving lives, here..."" Yeah? You wanna diminish your company and it's product more? Do that in front of the CEO. You might not be saving lives with every product, but to be dismissive is also putting the revenue streams and the reputation of the company at risk. No one wants to hear it.

GCC, for one example, will ignore the `&x` in the return statement and explicitly return null pointer instead.

OOP isn't for the computer, it's for the programmers. It's a different way to think about the code, and when you're in an environment where your software has hundreds of thousands of lines of code to maintain, thinking about it in terms of entities instead of functions and whatnot is helpful.

Then you can use that as a black box. Drop in some variables, call a method, and it spits out the report. Collect these generalized building blocks into a library, but there is a catch. If you generalize them too much to fit all use cases they become these very hard to use super configurable objects.

Having the bulk of your functions be side-effect free2. Using immutable data structures (e.g. don't modify your dicts/lists/dataclasses after they're created)...would be a good fit for the more pipeline-oriented nature of your task. You have data you're slicing and dicing, and want some reasonable assurances that each 'transform' or 'analysis' function you have in your script is self-contained and bug-free. Having a clean divide between IO code vs business logic and keeping mutation to a minimum are two good ways of helping you do this.The OOP paradigm is usually more useful when it's important you maintain certain 'invariants' around data: things like 'my data structure must always respect this property, no matter how it's modified' or 'all interactions with this particular 3rd party API must include these magic headers'. If you have a lot of these fiddly rules to manage, it can often be convenient to create a class that wraps around your data and presents a cleaner interface to the outside world.But I think this sort of need is rare in data-slicing or 'pipeline' style programs.Note that this sort of decision-making has nothing to do if you're writing a script or not. I've written short 100-line scripts that ended up making heavy use of OOP, and longer 5k-10k LOC production-ready services that used it very sparingly. My ultimate goal is to make the code as obviously correct as possible (which in turn makes it both easy to understand and modify). Sometimes objects can help with this, other times they won't.That is, OOP is not the same thing as 'clean code'. OOP is a _technique_ that can _help_ you write clean code -- but (a) it's not the only technique for doing so and (b) it's not a technique that'll be applicable 100% of the time.w.r.t. SWE best practices, I would look into:1. Writing tests and perhaps even a CI/CD pipeline for your scripts, starting with the more business critical / frequently run and modified ones. If people are actively making business decisions based on some of your analysis, you'd want reasonable confidence it indeeds behaves as expected. 2. Creating and popularizing a helper library that streamlines common operations. The goal here is to speed up the time it takes to author a new pipeline.I don't know anything about your company, but I'd imagine both correctness and speed-of-delivery are two factors that matter most to your team and your bosses.

You will probably get more targeted answers in data engineering or data science subreddits.For starters, I would try using something that can translate between notebooks and .py files like jupytext. Would make source control and other checks a lot easier.Based on what you have said, traditional unit tests are often difficult to apply here and tend to provide less value in data workflows than people expect. I would focus more on testing the output instead. Things like row counts, nulls, ranges, schema changes, distribution shifts, and data freshness usually catch issues much earlier.A lot of the unit test advice you are getting is common in app and web development, where the failure modes are different. In data, things usually break because the shape or semantics of the data change, not because someone touched the code.As far as OOP is concerned, you are less likely to run into it in many data jobs. It becomes important when dealing with graphs or hierarchies. Otherwise it is mostly useful for providing structure.Generally, anywhere you are passing a lot of variables to a function or manipulating large dicts, you will probably want to turn those into a dataclass. For external boundaries like configs, inputs, or outputs, use pydantic. Use type hints everywhere, and use a linter and code formatter as well.

But lately I’ve had a lot more success waiting until the last possible moment to start using it.

And usually I only end up needing a few objects here and there. Anyway, I think it’s still worth practicing OOP, but don’t feel obligated to use it everywhere.

Oop just means to group together data as objects with functions for those objects (originally without state, but today state is the center of oop -> state is probably the biggest cause of bugs, given that you test your code)Declarative programming is functional programming, reactive programming or logic programming. All similar, but for fp: you describe a function with other functions, to do that, you write functions that create functions and take functions as parameters, there is no state and a function only does one thing with one parameter… for example in procedural programming adding 2 numbers is done with a function like this: add = (a,b) => a+b Functional programming is a bit different, you have a function returning a function: add = a => b => a+b So, looks a bit unnecessary at first, but you can use functions to build functions… you can do: inc = add (1), while procedural would need a inc (a) => a+1. Increasing the items in a list is also easy: newList = oldList.map(add(1)), in procedural, you would loop over the list, getting every item, adding 1 and then pushing it in a new list. And oop would have a class inheriting from list, then have some build method that then changes the internal state to transform itself.

Maybe I'll also create a separate section for quick links, TODOs, snippets of cli commands to run, etc.I find having this sort of structure makes it much easier for me to stay focused, especially in cases where I feel too overwhelmed trying to mentally remember and keep track of everything.> I wonder if that is something that gets better after some time.It will -- as you get more familiar with the code, you'll have to spend less and less time digging, simply by virtue of you already being familiar with more aspects of the codebase.Even longer term, it'll get easier once you've worked on enough systems to start seeing similarities and echos. For example, if you've spend a fair amount of time working with backend and cloud infra, new codebases in the same domain will start feeling vaguely similar. There are only so many ways of reasonably structuring code after all.I'll take time for both types of familiarity/experience to grow though: it's totally expected/normal to feel a bit lost as an intern or new hire.> This is my first in person internship, so I don't know if it is normal to just stand up and walk for 5 minutes. That is what I used to do in remote internships.This is also normal. I've been programming professionally nearly a decade or so, and I also take short breaks once every hour or two. A quick stretch break, refilling my water, etc.If I'm feeling particularly stumped/annoyed, I'll often go on a longer 15-20m walk break, maybe step outside to grab some fresh air...Every now and then, I figure out how to ""enter the zone"" and manage to stay focused for hours and hours, though this usually happens when I'm writing code as opposed to debugging + investigating. I consider myself lucky when this happens: I haven't yet figured out how to reliably enter flow for the latter.",michael0x2a,2026-02-02 23:03:14,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qu71pu,False,

Encouraging someone to keep trying something that they literally can’t do seems cruel, but I definitely wouldn’t want to discourage someone from trying either.As a programmer, I can tell you that programming really exercises your short term memory. Learning to write code might be a challenge in itself, but at least a programming language is consistent — most of what you learn this year will be the same next year and 5 or 10 years later. You can get used to it. But programming means reading a lot of code, considering how it fits with other code that you read earlier, keeping track of variables and functions, and so on.I think your friend should talk to a doctor or occupational therapist about what methods are most likely to help, and whether programming might help them improve their memory or prove endlessly painful.",iOSCaleb,2026-02-03 21:42:55,1,learnprogramming,t3_1quti3q,False,

o32vz43,"You don't necessarily need to follow a formalized, structured system. If you're working on a project with other people, it probably makes sense to talk to those people and agree on how to format your commit messages. For example, [""Conventional Commits""](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is one example of a consistent way to format your commit messages. But for a solo project, it really doesn't matter at all whether you stick rigidly to something like this.As far as the *types* of information you should be putting in your commit messages: it should be enough to explain both what you changed and why you changed it, to a level of detail that you find sufficient. Commit messages are a form of documentation, and there's no one ""right"" level of detail for your documentation. It depends on how much time you're willing to spend on it.If you want some inspiration, you can take a look at the Linux, which generally has very detailed commit messages. Often the messages are much longer than the corresponding code changes. A Linux kernel PR won't be accepted if the maintainers don't think the commit message is clear enough, even if the code itself is fine.For instance, [this recent commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/76ed27608f7dd235b727ebbb12163438c2fbb617) has 31 lines of text (plus footers) to describe a 13-line code change. The first line contains just the most crucial details: the change affects performance monitoring (""perf"") in the scheduler (""sched"") subsystem, and it fixes a potential crash. The rest of the message goes into detail about exactly why the problem is happening and how it was fixed.Again, you probably don't need to go into nearly that level of detail for *all* your commits, especially if you're working on a project that's less critical than the Linux kernel. But while you're writing code, you should be thinking about how you would explain what you're doing to another programmer. And then you can decide how much of that explanation you want to put into the commit message.----Note also that deciding how to *describe* your commits goes hand-in-hand with deciding *what* changes to include in each commit. In the example I gave, it's straightforward to describe the commit's purpose because it's a very small, self-contained change. If the commit included other bug fixes at the same time, it would be a lot harder to write a good description.You might think that carefully breaking up your changes into multiple commits is just creating more work, but if you do it properly, it can make things easier for you in the long run.",teraflop,2026-02-02 01:44:57,6,learnprogramming,t3_1qth1ff,False,

Then again everyone has their own style— but definitely do not do `git add .` — source control is your friend, it’s one of the icons on the left hand side of VS code that looks like a merge request icon IIRC. Commit a message for each file, and make it a habit to commit frequently until you get a feel for appropriate checkpoints.Edit: `git add .` is fine for initial project template / codebase, or overall changes — just don’t work on something for several hours and then be lazy / cut corners with it.

Why use a TreeMap over a HashMap?). I might ask how they would implement a multithreaded solution and what problems can arise from multithreading and how they'd solve those problems.

That usually leads to frustration because you recognize solutions when you see them but cannot reproduce them later.A simple structure that works well is learning one pattern at a time. Study the core idea, solve a few easy and medium problems, then come back later and try to rebuild the solution from memory. That last step is where most actual learning happens.If you are transitioning from a service company, consistency matters more than speed. Two focused hours daily with review and recall usually beats long random grinding sessions.I built a small platform called [algodrill.io](http://algodrill.io) after mentoring people making this same transition.

It can make a big difference on how you solve these, but just pick whatever language is actually relevant to the kinds of jobs are interested in, so you're not spreading yourself thin for no good reason.I don't have an opinion on the resources you mentioned. What they're mainly good for is narrowing, say, the entire leetcode problem set down to a _much_ smaller subset that gives you a focused sampling of the major problem types. There are more problems on leetcode.com than a sane person has time for or need for, and there's a lot of overlap between many leetcode problems, so you want to avoid aimlessly meandering there and treating leetcode.com as the roadmap. * Start with easy problems only. * Gradually build up your toolkit of data structures so you learn when to apply certain data structures to which kinds of situations, and exposure to issues that can arise when writing code (off-by-one, index or boundary issues, logic errors, proper handling of numbers, concurrent modification issues, reference vs value, mutability issues, etc.)* Some ""easy"" problems may seem hard, and it may not be your fault * IIRC some leetcode problems were mislabeled, and may still be? Those sites that give you a more curated list might help avoid this issue? Anyway, I'd avoid picking random problems directly from leetcode.com itself.* Work on problems one at a time, give them a fair shot, but don't waste inordinate amounts of time being stuck. * Force yourself to think and use the tools you can recall. If you can't solve a problem in a reasonable time because you're simply missing the tools needed to solve it, then just look up and study well-written, non-code-golfed solutions, understand the key pieces, and move on. And plan to revisit those problems later on (put them at the back of your problem queue). Over time your recall of the problem -> solution mappings will strengthen.* Always be putting your solution (and test cases) in its own file that you can _run_ on your machine. * e.g. `node leetcode1-twosum.js`. You can also use a debugger, e.g. `node --inspect-brk leetcode1-twosum.js` when you run into problems.* Try not to see DSA as an isolated thing. * The main thing it boils down to is picking the right data structure(s) that suit the problem and help you meet the requirements, whatever they are. * A hard part is these problems can feel contrived and disconnected, which may be true, or may be an illusion - it depends. There's no one way to feel about it. I'm still deeply affected by having learned the ""text justification"" DP problem, and nobody can take from me. * Try to come to your own conclusions about the need/value of studying DSA problems based on the kinds of companies you're interested in. Feeling bad about this interview style is a common feeling, but not necessarily a useful feeling, depending on what you're after.* Timebox your DSA study so that you can make time for other things * Mostly to make sure you're spending time working on actual projects, so you're slowly getting exposure there. * Personal projects can give you freedom to try things that may be difficult to justify trying at work, and which can have very high learning/growth value. * Some experience solving DSA problems can benefit your implementations a bit, but won't help you learn how to design systems. So they can be complementary.For advice moving from a service-oriented to a product company...* if your current job has lots of greenfield projects with a short lifecycle, take advantage of that as a catalyst for growth, and as freedom to try slightly different approaches and to learn from past mistakes in code design. * Once you move to a product company, that can be less common. It can still happen, e.g. starting new products, or somewhat isolated subprojects or tools, etc. that serve the overall product in whatever way. But a lot of your time will be spent on things you may not be able to change easily.* Don't overly aggrandize product companies and don't belittle yourself and the time you're spending right now. * Have a mentality that your time right now is preparation for what's to come.* In your current job, try to be curious and thinking about your own growth. * If you have some decision-making power over which technologies or approaches are used, try to carve out a little space for yourself to grow, whatever that means. Try to keep it low-risk (don't put projects at risk due to making wild choices, but try to take whatever liberties you can that help you move in the direction of writing better code and making better overall system design choices that meet the requirements of the project). * If you don't have that power yet, then try to keep growing your skills and becoming so good that companies feel compelled to put you in that position and let you take the lead on things.* Prep for interviews, but don't wait too long to jump into the fray. * Usually interviews don't give good (or any) direct feedback, but ideally you have a rough sense of what you did well or not so well, and figure out what to work on. Dwelling on the asymmetry of the interview process won't help you, it is what it is.* Don't be too surprised when interviews don't go well * Just move right along to the next one, and don't get discouraged by the process. * Try to glean whatever you can, and cross-reference how you did with how others do, e.g. watch videos of mock interviews if useful. See what they do well and think about what you didn't do as well.* Ask your interviewers directly what you can do better!!! * Don't leave this up to HR to do (they won't). * Your fellow programmers _might_ be willing to say _something_ when asked directly at the very end. Don't be surprised if some cop out of this, but not all will. Either way, it's better than not asking and then getting absolutely 0 on the tail end.* Make sure to express interest in the company and product/problem domain. * When the interview ends with Q&A, be sure to have at least a couple questions about the team and/or company!! It can tip the scales in your favor a bit.* Don't automatically assume rejections are because you're bad. * Sometimes the company just has to pick between multiple people, and you may have been good but not _as_ good as somebody else.

For example, ask the user if they want to do another operation, or quit.

What variables are (ints, floats, booleans, and strings)2. What functions/methods are (bonus points if you can tell me the difference)3. What for-loops and while-loops are4. What objects are5. What data structures (at least: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, Stacks and Queues) are.After that, then you can go to the game engine.If you mean the whole ""getting used to your environment"" - start by following a short game tutorial, and then adding functionality to it (make flappybird, then add a coin collecting mechanic - or extra life pickups). This will teach you where things are, and how to get there. When following the tutorial, don't follow line by line, but section by section. Watch for a few minutes, and then repeat it on your own trying not to reference the video. This will teach you how to maneuver.After you understand the 5 basic windows most editors contain (scene view, game view, project files, hierarchy/scene tree, and the inspector), and you've followed maybe 3 basic tutorials, move onto making simple games on your own.

Think about what you want to accomplish, and quantify it. If it ain't quantifiable, explain it as a story that gives quantifiable metrics. We call these Functional & Non-functional/Quality Requirements. Define and prioritize those first. Once you know exactly what it is you want to make, start to break that thing down into identifiable entities, their components, and their relationships to everything else. Think about how the game works, and the major parts of it.* Look up SOLID programming principles, and Object Oriented Design Patterns. They are incredibly helpful in game dev, because they teach you how to arrange ideas in a way that's typically useful for simulations like games* When in doubt about how certain things work, read the docs. They are dense, but they're by far the most useful resource at your disposal.* Follow a consistent coding style. Your code should look the same regardless of where it is - this makes it easier to parse over later.

So create your scene, stick in a paddle, hook in keyboard controls so that it can move.2.

Here's the practical breakdown: If you want to stay close to hardware (embedded systems, robotics, IoT, firmware) - start with C. It maps directly to how you already think about registers, memory, and hardware. Arduino uses C++ technically, but in a very C-like way. The embedded industry still runs on C and will for decades. Companies like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and automotive firms want C + understanding of hardware, which is exactly your combo. If you want to pivot toward software engineering at a tech company - C++ is the better resume play. It's used heavily in game engines, high-frequency trading, operating systems, and performance-critical applications. But honestly? For most software engineering roles at tech companies, Python (which you already know) plus a web language would get you further than either C or C++. The real answer nobody's telling you: your EE degree + programming is a rare and valuable combination. Don't think of it as ""learning to code from scratch."" Companies building physical products with software components (robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, consumer electronics) specifically seek people who understand both sides.

o3chysa,"I don’t know about Dart, but in many languages it’s possible (or sometimes required) to override an object’s hash code function, so (contrary to some comments here) it’s important to understand how they work.No, hash collisions are possible. They’re even quite likely if a developer has written a bad hashing function on their object. Assuming everything else in the system is written correctly, these bad hashing functions will impact efficiency but not correctness.Comparing two objects for pointer equality is generally very cheap, and this is what `==` does in most languages. “Pointer equality” means that the objects are in identical memory locations (whether on the machine or on a VM; the details are complicated but not relevant right now.) This means the objects are really and truly “the same”; if you mutate one, the other will be mutated as well, because they’re the same object.Comparing two object’s hash codes is frequently cheap, but not as cheap as pointer equality, because hash codes are often highly optimized and frequently cacheable. If the compiler/runtime knows that the object hasn’t changed since the last time you’ve computed its hash, it can choose to reuse the result of the last hashing operation instead of running it again.Comparing two objects for value equality can be expensive. “Value equality” means that the objects are conceptually the same. For nested objects, this generally means walking the whole object graph and comparing each piece of data in both objects to each other. For small objects this is cheap, for big objects it might not be. Value equality is a conceptually stronger guarantee than pointer equality, because it tells you that two objects “mean” the same thing, even if they were constructed at different locations. However, this can be fragile in the presence of mutability, because if you mutate one of the objects they might stop being equal.If you want to check whether two objects have value equality, usually you do this:1. Check whether the objects have pointer equality. If they do, the objects are equal and you’re done. Pointer equality implies value equality. 2. Check whether the objects have hash code equality. If they don’t, then they are unequal, and you’re done. Hash code inequality implies value inequality. 3. As a last resort, check whether the objects have value equality. Hash codes are especially necessary as a performance optimization when using objects in collections which have limitations around item equality. `Set` and `Map`/`Dictionary` are the main ones which come to mind. In a set you don’t want there to be multiple copies of objects which are equal to each other, and in a dictionary you don’t want to add duplicate keys. In both of these situations you’re not just comparing two objects for equality, you’re comparing one object to a whole bunch of objects and seeing if it’s equal to any of them. In a big collection, this would get more expensive as the collection gets bigger. Without hash codes, adding N items to a set is an O(N^2) operation. So the way these data structures are usually implemented is by using “buckets” of items which have hash codes in a given range. When you want to add an object, the data structure computes its hash code, then finds the bucket which it belongs to (an `O(M)` operation, where `M` is the number of buckets, or in some cases `O(1)`, depending on the implementation). Then, if there’s already items in the bucket, the object being added is compared to every item in that bucket until an equal object is found. (`O(N)`, for a much smaller `N` than before). All in all this is asymptotically much, much faster.Of course, as I alluded to earlier, mutability messes this whole thing up. If you mutate an object in a way that would change its hash code then the algorithm used by the data structure will no longer perform correctly and it will be left in an invalid state.Hopefully this helps.

Being well-rounded makes is a good skill for connecting with people too.Plus being able to create art you want, even if only as a hobby, is just a good skill. I do programming, a little bit of traditional arts, and digital arts as hobbies and the intersection of them is damn fun. I enjoy being able to draw/create whatever workflow. I quite enjoy employing common algorithms in interesting ways \[re: not LLM/AI stuff as that wasn't around!\]; I get to pursue a much wider variety of workflows/techniques since I can draw on a wider skillset.Learning how to paint, the mixtures, pigments, etc \[I got quite into paint this last year\] has really taught me the details of finishing, coating, and protecting anything I may make - from furniture to housing. And a quick coat of paint can make a used, cheap piece look brand new!Plus I find learning both digital and traditional art reinforces the core skills one needs to make good art overall. Composition, colors, lighting, texture, detail density, etc - all necessary to practice regardless of the medium.What's the point of being a programmer if you don't also get a bit of time to pursue other topics that you enjoy? I think it's worthwhile to read history, but I can tell you it will not be getting me raises anytime soon!Lastly, when you learn things, it may open doors you previously would not have been aware of. The twists of life might open a door or two that would've been hidden otherwise.Finally, the AI stuff concerning \*making\* art is such a strong debate I think all the noise around it always misses the forest for the big tree. Thinking on it, however, one faces the same core issues with generative tools as you did with old school algorithmic/digital art!Say my 200x200 random pixel generator is able to theoretically produce any piece of art ever. (any piece in a 200x200 space of course) The problem is, statistically, most art produced is random noise. It's all \*seems\* the same - despite both pieces of noise being very different in terms of data - because both noises communicate the same exact thing to the audience. ""This is random noise"".IMO, to make impactful art, you've\- You've got to understand why and which elements evoke what you want in the audience. \- You've got to understand what is important, what isn't, and tightly control what is important. \- And generate interesting ideas within the work of any sort.The first two require lots of practice and is a soft skill - much like cooking w/o a recipe. The last one, I find, is much easier when I pore over an artwork and let the creative process compound on itself. (And study lots of extraneous subjects or other artworks to pull more ideas from!)Much like you've got to learn how to draw your basics before you can start breaking the rules, I think the biggest problem AI presents is it can undercut the learning process, development of personal styles, & creative process. Much like if you only ever followed ""paint by numbers"" kits and never challenged yourself further.\[Though once you've got your art down, and you find it has a useful part in your workflow, I figure it becomes a tool like any other -- IP issues not withstanding. Albeit I'm cantankerous and refuse to give up any control to blackboxes : P. And can't really see how'd I use it in a way that isn't covered by photobashing & art archives ha!

o3bfxq4,"Everything is normal - a lot of people like to confuse things further by talking about passing by reference or value or copying, etc. This usually only confuses things further.Let me try to show an example - first with an integer (code isn't Dart or anything in particular, mostly pseudocode): int v1 = 5; // first we declare a variable 'v1' with a value of '5' myFunc(v1); // then we send that variable as an argument to the function def myFunc( v2 ) { // in the function, the variable 'v2' is now also set to the value '5' print( v2 ) // as we can see if we print it v2 = 4; // but then we change 'v2' to '4' // 'v1' was never changed }Then if we use lists - the result is actually exactly the same: list l1 = ['c','a','t']; // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't' myListFunc( l1 ); // then we send that list as an argument to the function def myListFunc( l2 ) { // in that function, the variable 'l2' is now set to the same list // of 'c','a','t' print( l2 ); // as we can see if we print it l2 = ['d','o','g']; // but when we change 'l2' to another list of 'd','o','g' // the original 'l1' was never changed }Some people like to argue that 'v2' becomes a copy of 'v1' but 'l2' becomes a reference to 'l1' - this isn't entirely correct, and in my opinion only muddies the water. The important thing is that when you set a variable = some other value, it doesn't matter where it originally got its value from, it is gone. And setting v2 = v1 doesn't ""link"" v2 and v1 in any way, it just makes them have the same value.Now for the tricky part!A value like 4 and 5 cannot be changed, setting v1 to 5 and then setting v2 to v1 and v2 to 4, does not change neither 4 nor 5, it only changes the variables v1 and v2.But a *value* like a list, **can be changed**, you can replace individual items, add or remove them - it is still the same list. You cannot replace or remove anything in the number 5.So this code does change the inside of l1: list l1 = ['c','a','t']; // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't' myOtherListFunc( l1 ); // then we send that list as an argument to the new function def myOtherListFun( l2 ) { // and receive the same list as variable 'l2' l2.add('s'); // and we modify the inside of the list! // this has also changed the list for 'l1' because it is the same list }There's nothing magic about it - note that we don't write `l2 = ['c','a','t','s']` because that would change l2 to be another list, just like v2 was changed to be another number.If we could write `v2.increment()` or something like that, we would be able to change v1 through v2, but as that is usually not the case in most languages, programmers like to say that numbers are copied and lists are referenced - although it rarely is like that.",peterlinddk,2026-02-03 10:04:58,1,learnprogramming,t3_1quc0t2,False,

Find all the valid prefixes from the string before you check if the prefixes are valid. That way you don’t have to loop through the string every time you check a prefix. You only have to loop through it once.If string is “abc” then all valid prefixes are (“a”, “ab”). Then you loop through the prefixes list checking to see if the string is in the set. Checking the set is O(1) so it’s fast and looping through the potential prefixes list is o(n).

Iterate from 1 instead.2. `findminlength` could be better renamed to `findShortestStringLength`.3. Use for loop in `findminlength`.4. Assuming that this is Java, don't concatenate a lot of small strings. Strings are immutable in Java, so you are creating a copy every time you do `string0 += string1`. Use a `StringBuilder` instead.5. Don't write comments like ""this loop iterates over indices of `strings`"", it is useless, you can get that information by looking at the code itself. But you can explain why you start at 1, not 0.6. In the else branch, you set `smallestLenght` to `zwischenergebniss.length()`, which will cause the loop to break, because `zwischenergebniss` has length of `i + 1` at that point. Insert `break` there to make it explicit and remove the `zwischenergebniss = """"`, because it is reset on the next iteration a second time.7. `zwischenergebniss` can be removed and replaced by `result`.8.

There is forever something new to learn and you will always learn it by trying.Also, it might be the case that you never ""feel"" like a programmer, depending on your definition. I have about 25 years experience and there are definitely still days where I hit a problem and I just go ""This is chaos."" But if someone were to ask me to define thinking like a programmer, I think the most defining skills are 1. Being able to look at a small problem and imagine how you could represent it on a Von Neumann machine (read-writeable memory, processor, code, instructions run in sequence).2. Being able to take a problem too big for (1), break off a piece of it (without completely losing the original problem), and treat that problem in isolation. Over and over again, until you get a piece small enough to apply (1).Every problem solved with computers is, at some fundamental level, solved that way.

o2dyimo,"Think of a keyboard as three stacked realities:1.Physics – switches, rows, columns, diodes2.Time – scanning, debouncing, state transitions3.Language – turning switch states into USB HID reports, layers, macrosQMK is just a very thick sandwich around those three ideas.If you want to build “your own QMK,” you don’t start with keyboards. You start with microcontroller firmware and USB.⸻Step 1: Pick a microcontroller and read its datasheet like scriptureMost custom keyboards use:•ATmega32U4 (classic Arduino Pro Micro)•RP2040•STM32The key requirement: native USB device support.Before writing any keyboard code, you must understand:•GPIO configuration•Timers / interrupts•USB endpoints•Flash + RAM limitsThis is not optional. QMK hides this pain; you’re choosing to feel it.⸻Step 2: Implement a matrix scanner (this is the soul)A keyboard PCB is usually a row × column matrix.Algorithmically:•Set all columns as outputs•Set all rows as inputs with pull-ups•Drive one column LOW at a time•Read rows•Repeat fast (≈1 kHz)You will write:•GPIO init•A scan loop•A key state bitmapThis alone teaches you more embedded thinking than most app devs ever touch.⸻Step 3: Debouncing (time becomes real)Switches lie. They bounce.You need:•Per-key state•Timestamp or counter•Stable-state confirmationClassic strategies:•Integrator counters•Time-based debounce•State machinesQMK has multiple debounce algorithms. Rewriting one is a rite of passage.⸻Step 4: Build a key event pipelineAt this point you have:•Raw matrix state•Press / release eventsNow you design your own internal API:raw_scan → debounced_state → key_event → actionThis is where you can do things QMK doesn’t:•Probabilistic chording•Pressure-aware timing•Contextual layers (editor-aware, app-aware)This is where creativity lives.⸻Step 5: USB HID from scratch (the dragon)Now the hard truth:USB is the real boss fight.You must implement:•USB descriptors•HID report descriptors•Polling interval logic•Key rollover handlingYou can:•Write USB by hand (brutal but pure)•Or use a thin USB stack (LUFA, TinyUSB) without keyboard logicThis is still “from scratch” in spirit—USB is a protocol, not magic.⸻Step 6: Layers, macros, and remapping (language emerges)Layers are just:•Lookup tables•Stackable keymaps•State-dependent resolutionMacros are:•Event playback engines•Timed HID reportsNothing mystical. QMK only organizes it well.⸻Where to actually learn this (non-obvious sources)Not “keyboard tutorials.” Those are downstream.Study instead:•USB HID specification•LUFA examples (keyboard + mouse)•Bare-metal MCU tutorials•Old AVR keyboard firmware (pre-QMK era)Then read QMK last, like reading a cathedral after learning how stones are cut.⸻A sharper insight most people missQMK is not a keyboard firmware.QMK is:•A hardware abstraction layer•A policy engine for input•A build system that normalizes chaosIf you rebuild it, don’t clone it.Design something smaller, stranger, and opinionated.For example:•A keyboard that adapts layout based on typing entropy•A keyboard that changes layers by time-of-day•A keyboard optimized for African language input patterns•A keyboard that treats macros as code, not sequencesThat’s how you go beyond “my own QMK” and into new instruments.",AltruisticSteak3952,2026-01-29 10:27:54,4,learnprogramming,t3_1qq414s,False,

If you don't you've just been given a guide on what to learn next. You research a bit and learn about privileges and using the sudo command. You research a bit more and you learn that dnf is your package manager and why it makes your life easier.Now tomorrow you decide you want to talk to friends on Discord, you already probably can guess how to do it, but just in case you can google how to download the Linux version. You arent surprised by the command they give, because you already learned what package manager youre using and what that entire command does.

Even if you dont have access to any tools, you can double check no vulnerabilities are associated with any dependency versions on your project.3. Upgrade project dependencies. This one can be tricky and requires a lot of regression testing.4. Update, create, and improve junit test cases and test case coverage. Create/improve mock services5. Improve CI/CD. Add quality of life features6. \^Build internal tools to help with automation and testing such as a data generator.7. Improve dashboard and alerting capabilities. Check if there are any metrics you can track that will help alert you of any issues with your project. If none exists, create a metrics dashboard or try to get your team/company to adopt one from the various providers. You could even keep it simple and create a cron job on a linux server that executes a script daily to pull metrics from your logs and database to alert you of any issues. Though there better solutions.8. Study anything related to your job. Learn what you need to in order to eventually help your teammates with their load. Learn more about intricacies of the languages used in your stack. Research tools and libraries that may help your project. Sometimes you can be the one to introduce new technology to the stack that improves something you already have or completely replaces it for some benefit or another.9. Update project documentation. You could also create guides for any new people that may join the team in the future10. Innovate. Maybe you can figure out a good way to leverage AI in your project. Don't immediately jump to an LLM.

You should be aiming for code quality that *exceeds* the quality of your prior manual output, and you should always understand the details of how it all works - neither of which are very hard if you leverage the AI to do this (e.g. get it to refactor when needed, use other AI tools to review the code, ask for explanations).Most ""vibe coders"" don't do this, and that's where tech debt problems come in quickly.

This hysa stack is seperate from stocks/bonds/401k/529/real-estate etc - those are not your emergency fund. Some people say $xxx in cash is too much - but thats not my problem.

o2mneie,"Traditional engineer here (chemical, not that it matters)... turns out, USA vs. Europe area engineering or not that makes little difference. It looks like, checks the replies, a lot of software developers are just toxic regardless of where they live. A lot of you all are really arguing about stupid shit. Software development isn't a zero sum game, for US developers to win, EU doesn't have to lose, and vice versa.Do we chalk this up to people just being young? Do European posters in /r/cscareerquestions ALSO skew young and NOT actually employed as software developers, just like the US counterparts?Anyways, unlike many people here, I regularly during the course of my work, engage with large teams of European engineers. Primarily engineers from Ireland, Poland, and Germany. Ireland is unique, in that it also has a large diaspora of engineers from OTHER European countries. These have included multiple engineers from England, Spain, and France, and Architects from Ireland, Italy, and England.Two things that have helped dramatically, are: Persistent and clear communication. Both parties need to be patient, and be ""clear"" with their communication. English will be the lingua fraca, but all English is not the same. Focus on using COMMON, more likely to be known, phrases, words, etc. Avoid idioms that someone not from your country isn't going to know. It's REALLY common for native speakers/writers to go crazy with this and communicate in a way that is very difficult to understand. Simplify it down. Assume positive intent, if something SOUNDS off, it's probably a bad translation. Every language has it's own difficulties in translation to English. Above all else, patience by BOTH parties.The other, is absolutely when working with counterparts in other cultures, you HAVE to learn and understand what their leadership and accountability paradigm is, relative to yours. Do NOT assume it is the same way, at all, to yours. How people are led (do people DEFER to leadership, or INFORM leadership), how people are mentored, how people are held accountable, differs WILDLY between cultures; and, even within that culture, particularly in Poland I see big differences between junior and senior engineers. I suspect in that country there's a divide there too; if I had to guess, it's roughly the 15+ and above vs. the newer peeps. But, I don't fully understand, despite how much polish interaction I get.With that last one, comes ASSUME positive intent. Assume they WANT to get the job done, and done well, and seek to understand how and why they're behaving the way they are. A metaphor I like to use borrows from the old American story about the cherry tree and the axe. If ""Culture A"" was going to cut down a tree, and had 10 hours to do it, how many hours would they spend sharpening the axe?"" The polish would sharpen the axe, and a backup axe, for 9.5 hours. The Irish? They cut it down last week. My point? The spread between preparing for the act, and doing the act, varies wildly, and can be a VERY common source of frustration ALL around.Anyways, good luck.

o3kg5cc,"Former C1 employee here. It’s the sketchiest company I’ve ever worked for. Left after I fulfilled my time requirement to not pay back the signing bonus & Relocation package. C1 tries to operate as if they’re AWS, the problem is that they’re not paying AWS money. They like to intentionally over-hire & rely on pip culture to incentivize employees to overwork themselves to be ranked appropriately. That leads me to my next thing, they do stack ranking for employees. This means that you’ll be ranked against employees at the same level as you & normally that would be fine, but a lot of orgs have company lifers. These people have been there their entire career or the majority of their career & they know the company inside & out so they’ll consistently set an incredibly high bar that new external hires have to adhere to within a few months of working at the company. With a company so reliant on internal systems that are poorly documented & long drawn-out (again, poorly documented) processes it’s hard to learn all of that while also navigating all the levels of bureaucracy & compliance that comes with fintech. Quite frankly unless you grossly overwork yourself on a regular basis for a year or two or you’re just an incredibly talented engineer it’s unlikely you’ll succeed there. Here are some additional things that you may find useful to know:- They reorg frequently, I’m talking every 6 months at least. So you’ll constantly be shifting teams or lose team members- Everything there is reliant on tons of internal tools & many basic things you’ll have to do will take significantly longer than expected because you have to ask many people who to contact about something then you have to fill out a form & then message someone to tell them you filled out the form then fill out the form again because you forgot to check a certain field on the form- The way the company operates with pip culture breeds a lot of toxic behavior between employees so you’ll encounter a lot of terrible behavior throughout your interactions. Plenty of good people there, but the amount of bad interactions you’ll encounter is relatively high.- as a woman you might find it relevant to know that there’s not many women working there in the engineering departments. I was there for a little over a year & I found out about 3 different serious scandals there involving harassment & encountered a lot of higher ups who are not very respectful towards women. All that being said, they do pay pretty decent, but in my opinion they do not pay nearly enough for how much it sucks to work there.

It sounds like your team built a feature while you were working on something else. Work on that section to show more involvement. Even something like “Developed a highly scalable…” might work better. You can add “team” somewhere if you are that self-conscious about it. It’s a mix of passive word choice, and I have literally interviewed people who tried to take credit for the work of others.

Of course there are people with certifications who also know their stuff. You'll never be in a perfect scenario where you're evaluated exactly as another candidate, and the only difference is one has a certification. The other thing to factor in is that hiring isn't a simple, one-person process. There are various filters you need to get through. A certification will mean less to a lot of technical people, but it may mean more to a recruiter. You need to get past the recruiter to get in front of an interviewer and a hiring manager.

Ended up getting a mid-level offer, which feels somewhat lateral if not almost a step down in responsibility, but was a jump in salary. With my previous org facing impending layoffs it wasn’t anything to wring my hands over. Frankly, cold applying doesn’t feel super great right now. If you get the opportunity to connect with a recruiter (mine reached out to me via InMail on LinkedIn) take advantage. People are definitely hiring, but the open positions don’t exactly match what they’re posting on the internet from what I’m seeing.",crabby135,2026-01-30 01:28:43,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1qqj11y,False,

o2dh5lv,"The way ""they say"" the job market works is you ""go out and get a job"" because that's what you did in the 1960's and that's what you did then.The way the job market works now is ""you network, make friends, and travel to where the work is"".If you can't get your resume handed to a potential boss by someone who works there, then I'd recommend looking into resource mining projects/contracts.Some big resource extraction company will have thousands of devices, peripherals, network switches, and servers that all need to be maintained and upgraded and they put the contracts out to tender. Contracting companies put in a bid, one gets the contract, and then they have a cutover date when they will take over.Stupidly, many seem to think they can do the same job with half the people, half as qualified, find out they can't and then they need qualified bodies at a discount price.That's where you come in! You get to go pee in a cup and see if you can manage to get to a drug test without being drunk or high, and if you can, you get to go replace keyboards that aren't broken, screens that work, and generally throw out a lot of good equipment that ""nobody wants"" because someone else used it for a month.Once they figure out you can think, you will get called to ""blue screens if death"" where you turn on the second monitor and wonder why they are still running windows XP with all this corporate data, and in the network.You will get calls to figure out what is wrong with the computer that has some error on it that no one can tell you what it is, it says ""no ram detected"", but they can see the RAM in there, so it should be working, right?Don't forget the calls to unmute the executive microphones, dial phone numbers on touch screens; and turn on computers everyone said were on, but they were off (even though the blinky lights by the phone cable in the back are on).Make friends, hop jobs, hop contracts, (always sign the contract for the job you want regardless of what your current boss says they will give you, you can always decline of the boss comes through {but they won't}).After you've been doing that, look for work in your neck of the woods doing point of sale support and general IT for contracting companies.When you finally find the job you want and get, great, you will have lots of experience.If you are lucky enough to work at a place that has commute and they bus the workers in, bring a laptop and work on personal projects on the bus to and from work.",I_IdentifyAsAstartes,2026-01-29 07:47:46,17,cscareerquestions,t3_1qq10hb,False,

Most software devs have to be at least a little ""jack of all trades"" and doing whatever it takes to get things done is normal and a valuable skill to hone.> I failed every single deadline.Honestly, for an intern working solo, that's kinda par for the course. I don't think that says that much about you. And for that matter, often times, issues with deadlines is not an individual dev problem, but a management problem.> And more than once, I had to (not by my choice, but it did sort of help once) go on weekends to catch up.I know the pressure can be hard to avoid, don't work weekends. It's common that deadlines slip and stuff takes longer than expected. It shouldn't generally be a ""work extra"" thing, particularly not for no extra pay. From a practical standpoint, I understand it if your job is on the line (the economy and all), but resist the pressure under normal circumstances.Overall, sadly, intern positions on solo projects aren't that uncommon, yet are obviously bad for the intern. Mind you, you also don't fit the typical case of an intern, as you are actually a new grad. I think the biggest thing to get used to is the idea that it's okay for work to not be finished. You're not actually being paid by task. And yes, solo projects are strictly worse for a new person (or arguably any person) in pretty much every way (hard to get help, isolating, more likely to have incorrect estimates, etc).

Maybe not about technical best practices (since those are best learnt while working with a team with seniors directing development and giving you feedback in PRs), but you end up coming out of this with a healthy fear of forced estimates, you learn how to communicate with people who disagree or are displeased with you, and you'll generally perform much better when the inevitable crisis hits at your next job.

The product is for a niche field I’m not very familiar with.I know redditors hate to hear this but spend more hours (this means outside work hours) figuring out wtf is going on. And if there's little to no documentation on what you think is important knowledge, document it and share it to the team (this shows you are 'team multiplier' and will look good to your performance review). And if there's any documents regarding the product, just read through it even if you don't understand it multiple times here and there again and again (so your eyes at least get used to the technical jargon, etc).Type or screenshot everything in your note taking app or whatever per day. Every command you ran and so forth so you can look back. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I recommend it if you don't use a note taking app (it's very bare bones and light). And I have Calender plugin on it.If your company allows you to use AI on the codebase, abuse the heck out of AI and ask all sorts of questions on it.Schedule 1 on 1 meetings with your teammates and ask questions on topics you don't know much about. Don't schedule and just be like ""I don't know"". People don't like that. People like you put in SOME effort to try so show you put in the effort to try to make sense and are confused/lost. And screenshot every single step your teammate is doing so you don't forget or lose (so you can help organize later). Also, DM your teammates with help you need (do it to different team members a time so you don't overload one teammate). And make sure that DM (Slack setting or whatever is set to never delete). And again, screenshot/save any command, etc that comes out of it.Type more shit about your status and what you are doing in your team channel more. Last thing you want is to look invisible. Invisible == Looks like you aren't doing anything.I abuse the heck out of screenshotting in this field. Everything in every meeting when I see a screen is screenshot. I don't care how trivial. From the URL to what not I just screenshot.If this is in office, bribe your team members (and other close by office workers (from where you sit)) with occasional cookies/snacks or whatever. Look optimistic and happy and eager. It goes a long way and will help you with your performance reviews indirectly (welcome to life).Ah and the biggest thing. **When you are given a task, stop trying to focus on the task. Try to understand the bigger picture first (the REASON behind the task and so forth). Make sure you focus on that in 1on1 when asking your team members for help on a task.**If you focus on 'code logic' context, then you are f-ed. You need to focus on the business/overall reason for why this task was given.

o2oodld,"In my opinion,You sound like me, 18 years ago. I kept chasing the dream and kept burning out and crashing. I wish I had been less stubborn and willing to listen to a mentor.I would recommend making the game development a hobby, make it for androids, and make it to fix specific table top game editions, like D&D.But I found that the more I worked at the fun, the less fun it was. Turns out I have a.d.h.d. and autism and if I had been able to be medicated through school, I would have been unstoppable.I was pretty bitter trying to find work in 2008-2011 in video games while learning and programming in C++ for ""the game"" I had in my head. Then once I would know what ""the game"" was, I would do some research and find out that someone else had the idea and had already done it.That's when it hit me, the ideas are a dime a dozen, and everyone has them; it's being able to make it into a reality and get it to market faster than the competition that gets the money.The secret, kookily enough, was watching the movie ""the secret"" and saying to myself ""If I am always saying that I am burned out and there are no jobs, then that is my reality"". So instead I said ""I am a positive person, pleasant to be around, I love people, and there are lots of jobs I would enjoy (each of those was a lie)"".I just had that mindset and I just flipped the job search rules on its head and I just applied for everything that looked interesting. I had one resume, one cover letter, a few letters of reference, and then I just ""cold job applied"", or ""shotgun approach"". I just stopped looking at the job, the description, the requirements, and instead of stressing about if I qualified for a job or tailoring my resume and cover letter for one hour and then applying for one job in two hours, I did a blanket google search, opened up the top ten results in tabs, and just went through uploading my resume and cover letter to sites and applying for as many jobs as I could. Some were an email, some were uploading documents, some were transcribing into their web fields, so some took a minute to apply to, some took 20 minutes. I just applied and applied and applied.I ""knew"" everyone else was going to be tailoring their resume to the job, so instead of me doing that for each one, I wrote the cover letter like it was a personal conversation between friends and I sold myself as an amazing worker and someone they wanted on their team.I'd been applying for about a day before I got a call for a job where they were looking for a permanent full time position (but I didn't know that cause I hadn't really read the job listing). I had a 2 year technical diploma and had just finished my 3rd year of a bsc in computer science, I was on summer break...So I went to the preliminary interview and fucking nailed it with my positive attitude and my honest answers of ""I don't know what that is or how to do it, but I honestly don't know what I am doing with most things. What I know how to do is know when I don't know, I know how to look something up, and I learn fast"".They ended up hiring me for a summer rather than any of the other full time applicants that they had. I fucking love automation and I get bored easily. It was a tech support job for a software development company, so everytime I answered a question, I templated the response. There's really only 20 questions anyone could have about this software, and I knew what they were cause I had been doing templated responses from May to July.In July I asked to get some screen recording and captioning software to make some tutorial videos; I made basic, intermediate, and advanced video tutorials, published them, and the calls stopped.I had automated myself out of a job, and then I went back to school and finished my fourth year.I had a competitive job offer from them half way through the year, full benefits, to come back and work for them. It was a great company, it got acquired during covid, but I did basically the same thing for them for 3 years before moving on.I just kept looking at something that had to be done more than once and figured out how to automate it.The moral of this story is sometimes you have to run before you can walk. Successfully selling yourself and taking initiative to do your job and improve everything, rather than just collecting a cheque allowed me to develop a specific set of skills.I work for a much bigger company now, ""work"" is a strong term. I do tech support and am on a team with other people where we get sent problems no one can figure out how to fix.

More typical is ML people dabbling w/ backend-ish things (often poorly) and other traditional roles (backend/frontend/etc) interfacing with each other through API contracts, which is just bog standard software engineering.LC is useful to the extent that you get to practice certain types of coding skills and patterns that CRUD/glue code development doesn't necessarily expose you to, but it isn't strictly necessary if you deal with things like graph traversal or memoization in their glorious raw forms (aka not relying too much on libs to do DS&A-ish things) on a semi-regular basis.
