Don't spend your time up front getting certifications and understanding all the of the tech. Spend your time finding the best people who already know it and ensure they are the ones leading individual pods of work. 2. Once you have that in place then spend your time figuring out what are the best aspects of your process and theirs and work on adapting both into an established best practice across both. There is a reason you all bought this company and they are probably smaller and used to a lot less red tape than you might put them through. 3.

ns1ey9z,"I'm a solution architect for a consulting firm and for our clients (Financial Services), we did make a data mesh. They had mainly an old school on-premise solution which was built of multiple siloed data warehouses and depended on tribal knowledge to keep it running. I believe there was one super complicated ETL pipeline that would fail, and they only knew to restart it, until it finally ran. No one bothered to debug why it failed. A combination of older technology, and not managing tech debt because all stable data solutions wander into cost-centre territory where they only care about costs management. Anyway, onto your challenge -Multiple siloed analytics systems, some on-prem, some on private cloud, mish-mash of Azure/Microsoft based solutions and generally no one had a standard approach to data.So we architected a whole new data-mesh(-istic) approach. Hub-and-Spoke architecture built off Databricks for the Hub, bring what you want for the Spoke. Hub is your managed and governed central data lake. Spokes correspond to different domains of the business (Finance, HR, Customer Experience, Investment and so on.).More lower done, we maintain Landing, Bronze, Silver, Silver Plus (meant to hold curated/canonical model, still WIP), with the respective domain spokes having the Gold Layers.Our core idea was the data platform should be a genuine platform. Not just something to build analytics on. So now we can progress to building AI based applications, ontologies and so on without the restrictive mindset of a data platform being only to build data warehouses.For us Databricks has worked like a dream, and barring reporting (Power BI), we haven't considered needing to use it for anything else. Unity Catalog especially from this year, has been a knock-out for the use cases we have. And we still have more to implement - governed tags, data masking and so on.I would say it has been a success and the struggle is to keep innovating on it, than marking it as done and stable and letting tech debt accumulate over the years till someone else comes in and says let's make a new data platform but do it right this time. :-D",Different-Waltz-8891,2025-12-03 09:20:23,3,dataengineering,t3_1pc9m3a,False,

nraiegn,"Not a consultant but I've just been brought into a medium sized org and have been working on a Fabric PoC. Mixed experiences. The bad:- There is at times a large desync when reading and writing to lakehouses and warehouses. PySpark operation will complete and show transformations applied within a session only for the data to not match at the endpoint for... A while. No hard numbers on this but seen others talking about it. Bottlenecks development and is really frustrating. - The low code solutions are terribly inefficient. My first time testing a basic Dataflow Gen2 operation ran for way too long and had a ridiculously large CU consumption, so if you want to handle ETL processes better get dug into Spark notebooks (I've been using PySpark which is considerably faster and more performant than the Dataflow seemed, not sure how other Spark modules behave) - Speaking of CU consumption, interrogation of compute is so... Opaque. Want to see how much CU your new code block uses? You're out of luck if you've ran it multiple times for debugging and testing - there's no way to get a granular report on costing. The documentation here isn't much better. - Managing a traditional Dev -> Prod pipeline feels harder than necessary. Currently I'm running a NonProd/Prod architecture where end users only have access to a workspace with models loaded into a warehouse because as far as I can tell there is no object level security available within a workspace. There's also no way that I've found to directly write across workspaces, so I'm shortcutting my endpoint data in the NonProd workspace to a lakehouse is the Prod workspace, then using cross warehouse T-SQL to create views for the end users.The good:- For an organisation with a large investment in PowerBI with multiple workspaces and satellite teams within the business, I can see how Fabric might be a good solution that slots in nicely. In it's current state I'm not sure that it pulls ahead of any other architecture solutions. - It's an interesting playground for less technical users to 'get their hands dirty'; I see the appeal. As mentioned before however, I discounted the low code options pretty quickly so it remains to be seen how this will progress. - There is native CoPilot integration in Fabric (when set up with the right licence option in workspaces). I haven't tested this out yet but I imagine this will be useful for people in the business to ask questions and interrogate data without requiring models to be built or a knowledge of SQL or PowerBI development. Overall it's not terrible and if you're already paying for a fabric capacity you're not incurring additional costs if your capacity has headroom. For users with a less technical background I'm not sure if the juice would be worth the squeeze as every end user I've spoken to has gravitated to Dataflows for ETL work as it's familiar to them (it works like an online PowerQuery interface).

nrz4jbk,"1 and 2 heavily depend on the business needs and what the API is IMO.If this is an API that my company has access to via some contract with another company, I expect the other company to keep the data schema consistent, in which case I'd have my ingestion expect a particular schema. That way, we know right from the ingestion layer if the schema is breaking the contract and we can work to remediate. Then, the pipeline can always assume that schema is enforced and we don't need to worry about missing or unexpected data.If it's some sort of public API that can change at any point, then the approach would probably be a bit different. Just throwing something out there this isn't necessarily how I'd do it, but perhaps store as just raw JSON, then parse out the data we actually need from it, and store that in a known schema (i.e. a bronze layer feeding into a silver layer). Of course, all of this will depend on *how* the API changes, so the real answer is that it has to be handled case-by-case (e.g. if a field is added or removed, but we don't use that field anyway, then we do nothing because it doesn't matter, but if we do use it, then we need to figure out what to do in the particular scenario).3 is again sorta dependent on the use-case. If I have access to the full source dataset and it's only a few thousand records, I wouldn't bother with incrementally loading data. I *might* do something like tracking which rows are new/updated if that's relevant to downstreams in the pipeline, but again, depends on the use case.For 4, I generally prefer loading into a bronze layer (if that's what you mean by ""staging tables""). If it's easy to keep the source data, I don't really see a reason not to do so and to keep it close to the rest of the data (i.e. in the same warehouse). But there are of course cases when this is not desired (for example, if the source data is enormous and is mostly thrown away anyway, then I wouldn't want to waste the cost to store it).For 5\*, I'm not sure what you mean by a ""metadata driven pipeline"".

nrzv5lq,"1) I hardcode the schema in all but a few cases where I expect schema drift. For those cases I just append new columns and null missing ones for the incoming data set. In most cases I don't expect the schema to change so I want to know when it does since it could have impacts to downstream functions.2) Answered above. You can't remove old columns from the schema since there is old data likely using them.3) Full load if possible. My main reasons are that it's quick and if your source deletes rows without a method for getting which rows are deleted, an incremental update won't pick them up. This is very much dependent on a number of factors, so quite often a full load isn't the best option.4) If you have a need for a staging table, use it. If not, don't complicate things because it fits the design pattern you saw on a YouTube video.5) First time I've heard of this, but I read your explanation in a different comment. If you can use that pattern, go right ahead, I'm all for code deduplication. I think for a lot of people though, and certainly me, it would be far more trouble than it's worth.

When new fields are added or removed from the schema, how do you handle this? Concept 4: Staging tables. After ingesting data from API and assuming flattening to tabularI think these concepts are all related. With JSON, you can just insert the JSON payload into a JSONB field with whatever fields happen to be in the JSON payload. So flattening wouldn't be necessary. And since flattening isn't necessary, you don't have to worry about whether fields are included, deleted, omitted, etc. from one payload to the next. Just query it using SQL with the JSON features that the database provides.Querying raw JSON using SQL is still relatively new. Some databases (e.g. postgres) are excellent at it.

The aim is to stop people editing 'data storage' spreadsheets directly (each form should also be an easy thing to set up).So what have we achieved?- added some level of control over data entry- introduced BigQuery, allowing you to start defining transformations in SQL (e.g. Views, Scheduled Queries), and setting up the foundation for the future- decoupled data analysis from data storage. Data analysis with spreadsheets reading well-managed data from BigQuery is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight pattern- prepared everyone for a future where you have data entry methods write directly to BigQuery, without spooking the horses- oh, and for free your data is ready to analyse out of the box with 'Looker Studio' (free, not to be confused with Looker 'proper'), allowing you to set up reasonably nice dashboards",PaddyAlton,2025-11-30 11:57:16,61,dataengineering,t3_1paby5v,False,

A snowpipe to Load into regular staging tables can be event triggered when a new file occurs in a container of a datalake, or, you use external tables with a scheduler, then do Load into staging tables. The rest after that is 99% identical to any previous Medallion / Kimball DW setup. Snowflake charges based on credits, a combo of IO ingest and CPU crunching. It’s decently priced.

Here's a real example from a few days ago: from , select the most recent using the field. You could argue if I didn't use the LLM I would learn the syntax and not have to look it up all the time. You would be correct.3. Generating regex expressions from sample data. It's surprisingly good at this.4. I had a circular reference in a model a few days go. I knew how to resolve it, but wanted to see how the LLM would approach it. I gave it a screenshot of the UML data model and it actually did a really good, and accurate, job of explaining what the reference was, what caused it and gave a few ways of resolving it.5. OCR, but check the results VERY closely. It'll get you about 90% of the way, but I picked up a lot of small errors that on first glance looked ok.6. Basic debugging. I use the Agent in Databricks quite a lot. It's good at fixing missing brackets, forgotten imports, and basic stuff like that. More complex stuff is hit and miss so I'll usually debug those myself, but it saves me time looking for a stupid ).7. Advanced find and replace. Stuff like, 'In the attached csv, find all instances of x that are postfixed with "":2"" and replace that with :3 if the date in the valid\_to column is over two months from today.'In all cases I check the output because I know they're just advanced statistical models, but I must say I've noticed the accuracy increase in the last year or so.I probably wouldn't consider this a 'next gen workflow', it's all stuff I can do without an LLM, but it really does save me a huge amount of time.

These are things I didn’t consider stress wise when making the switch to ‘SWE’, however I enjoy the struggle of this. With DE you’re extracting data, transforming and loading it into a space where DA’s and DS can easily retrieve accurate data. The way I think about it is the DB serves as your UI and this simplifies worrying about security and misuse. Not to say these concerns don’t exist, but I don’t feel like they’re as complex to resolve. The real complexity/stress comes in taking disparate data from various systems in various formats, that’s available in disjunct timeframes and making it fit into a cohesive/canonical model that represents how the business/analysts thinks about operations.

Deadlines are everywhere. Hard-to-diagnose problems are probably everywhere, too, especially when you inherit things. Sometimes specific tools are worse for it (I've heard comments in this regard about Spark, for example).I've done this transition, albeit kind of unconsciously. It's been good. Having software background is definitely valuable, I think. It probably depends some on your stack, but I also think there is *a lot* of crossover. Especially if you consider that often it's the soft-skills that count, too.I started in general development, primarily working on an internal web-based system using .NET Core. That job started having more and more ""reporting"" work, using the same backend database, but SSRS was the frontend instead. From there, into an analyst type role, which rapidly became a catch-all ETL-developer-report-builder-platform-admin role. Last few years it has become more about ""engineering"", admin, and architecture. I'm very much enjoying it. Early on, I did miss working in code that wasn't primarily SQL (and especially wasn't DAX), and the ways in which we did it - like devops processes and dev tools. I've seen that shift where I am now, partly because team, partly because tool set with us jumping into Databricks. The inner software dev has much more cause to come back to the surface. I've been in a position to bring devops practices in. I'm thinking again about things like encapsulation and DRY. I was not the whizz-bang top-dog developer, but I picked up some good fundamentals and experience. It's helpful as a data-focused engineer. Is DE a good fit for you? Probably if you have an analytical mind, enjoy the problem-solving, and sometimes having to help discover what that problem really is.

Spoiler alert: unless you are truly working with billions and billions of rows, the right number of partitions is often small. (For example, suppose your data set is a few gigabytes/MB in size, with a few hundred thousand rows and a few hundred columns, and those columns are mostly numeric. In that case, the correct number of partitions might be as little as 4 or 5.) You can experiment with the best number. anyway, you mentioned re-partitioning the data, but you don’t mention the default number of partitions for your session. This is an important configuration parameter that you can set at the beginning of the script. I have seen Spark read in a tiny Excel file and spread it out across 15 partitions and then half of those partitions are completely empty. Obviously this is ludicrous, and slow, but Spark can do it if you don’t stop it.Also when it comes to joins, sometimes the big data set can stay put, and only the small data set needs to be reshuffled.

Say you have a large table used in two joins with two different filters on it. Spark might opt to filter then shuffle each time to minimize the volume of shuffled data. But maybe the filters overlap, so you end up shuffling more data by doing it separately and you could have saved time by shuffling once at the outset.If it is just a repartition helping, it would be some niche circumstance the optimiser doesn't handle on its own.",azirale,2025-12-02 22:36:20,1,dataengineering,t3_1pcm5gp,False,

ns0iu89,"AQE is usually good. You would default to relying on it, and only change things if something seems to have gone awry. For example we recently had it include a shuffle step to rebalance files, but we were rewriting 50TB of data and it just flooded the spill space and crashed.The old 200 default is almost never a good number. It ends up spending more time finalising tasks and spinning up new ones than it does actually processing things (may be slight exaggeration). The ideal number on a fixed-worker-count cluster is 2x the number of cores on the workers, and then higher multiples of that if you have significantly skewed data in large amounts.Even with AQE you might be able to guide it to a better plan by lining up data nicely for it. But I wouldn't necessarily worry about it until something is taking longer than it seems it should and is taking long enough that it is worth optimising.There are other approaches that can help as well. Saving intermediate results somewhere so that it can be reused without relying on cache memory being available as well as truncating the query plan. You can also focus on dropping the descriptive data and just moving keys and filter-by columns for all the major join work, create a unique composite key for each row, then send that back to the original descriptive data then re-join everything on the new unique row key.

nrwm7xu,"Disclaimer: I work in the data platform space (founder of Bruin), so take this as general guidance, not a pitch. The best option really depends on your company size, how your teams are structured, and what your current stack looks like (MSSQL 2016, lake, warehouse, etc.). Also helpful to know how you orchestrate things today; Airflow, SSIS, cron, notebooks, whatever.One thing I’d definitely think about is choosing asset-based orchestration instead of task-based. Task-based tools like Airflow or SSIS focus on tasks, not data, so lineage ends up shallow, incomplete, or manually maintained. You also get a lot of glue code that makes governance harder. Asset-based tools like Dagster, dbt, or Bruin treat data assets as the core unit, which gives you proper lineage, clear dependencies, and a cleaner way to centralize metadata and governance. If your goal is a single referential for governance, this approach saves a lot of pain later.Regarding OpenMetadata: it’s a good open-source option, but it’s not light. You’ll spend time maintaining connectors, and lineage quality depends on how your SQL is written. Glossary, business rules, RACI, etc., also take time to set up. It works well in mature teams that can own it.You can also look at metadata-first platforms like DataHub if your priority is lineage and visibility over heavy enterprise governance. Sometimes that’s enough depending on your size.Just keep in mind that no tool magically creates governance. You still need a central team, standards, ownership, and a gradual rollout.

I use duckdb’s read_blob with hive partitioning against s3 to load blob assets without needing a database for metadata. Only problem is that the read_blob fetch mechanism loads all data at once instead of just the batch being fetched. The incremental fetch loading works fine for read_parquet though. For now I have a workaround where I load all the metadata by not reading the content and then incrementally calling read_blob with a batch of filenames from the metadata at a time, but would be nice to just natively support incremental result loading to make the experience more seamless and approachable. https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-python/discussions/92",Global_Bar1754,2025-12-03 19:11:15,1,dataengineering,t3_1pd6oce,False,

E.g: denormalized data are normalized to store quality data (center of star), then denormalized (dimensions) for reporting for example. 2. Generally, it's a combination of the data management stage where we decide sources to use (maybe reliable ones) and define ""rules"", and the data architecture stage where we structure data. For examples, from three sources S1, S2, and S3, maybe we keep only S1 and S3 because data from S2 are not reliable (bad quality). Then data shapes and values from S1 and S3 which may differ at multiple points but generally unique identifier is used (like email), here is where ""rules"" are applied, for example use the email as identifier, set data with no value to NULL, if two other addresses have different values, keep the one which match the phone number, ... 3. An example is where instead of creating dimensions which is a transformation, we directly serve the data, and then flexible queries will retrieve them on demand. I hope it helps :)",dontereddit,2025-11-29 10:45:51,1,dataengineering,t3_1p9deke,False,
nrldju1,"1. Even if data is already denormalized at the source, it may or may not fit the analytical use case. Denormalized only means attributes are combined, not that the structure matches the grain or logic needed for reporting. If the current shape works, you can keep it. If it doesn’t, you transform it into whatever structure performs well-normalize first, remodel into facts/dims, or rebuild a wider table. The model itself isn’t the goal; usability and query performance are. So denormalized is different with ready for analytics. Adjust the structure when needed to make it clean, fast, and reliable.2. Multiple customer sources with different IDs and attributes usually lead to a conformed customer dimension. The goal is to unify identity across systems using a surrogate key, then merge records via deterministic or fuzzy matching rules. You track history using SCD when attributes change over time. From the conformed dimension, you can also generate shrunken dimensions when a specific process only needs a subset of attributes - reducing complexity and improving performance while keeping consistency. The key idea is: one enterprise-wide definition of customer, multiple shapes depending on analytical needs. For more details, you can read the chapter ""Integrate via conformed dimension"" of The Data Warehouse Toolkit.3. A star schema is part of dimensional modeling and works great for data warehousing because it’s simple, performant, and easy for business users to query. But it isn’t the only modeling approach. Data Vault focuses on flexibility and historical tracking when dealing with many changing data sources, while the Inmon approach builds a 3NF enterprise warehouse before data marts, or One Big Table stores data in wide-tables,... Each method has strengths and trade-offs, so the right choice depends on requirements - speed to deliver, data complexity, volume, regulatory needs.",chimeyrock,2025-11-30 20:18:43,1,dataengineering,t3_1p9deke,False,
nrqk404,"Model to answer the questions your team actually asks: conform once, then denormalize for how you query, with a real customer identity strategy.1) If a source arrives denormalized, land it as-is, then build conformed dims/facts from it; marts can re-flatten for BI. Reuse the same cleaned staging models so you’re not doing the work twice. Materialize dims/facts as tables and use incremental loads where it helps.2) For customer, create a surrogate-keyed dimcustomer and a customerxref (sourcesystem, sourceid, customersk, matchconfidence, matched\_on, rule). Do deterministic matches first (tax ID, email+dob), then fuzzy for names/addresses. Store survivorship rules for attributes, run SCD2, and route low-confidence cases to a review queue so ops can merge/split and you can replay history. I’ve used Fivetran for ingestion and dbt for modeling, Great Expectations for tests, and DreamFactory to expose a lightweight approval API for those manual merges without giving warehouse write access.3) Skip strict star when you need event streams with nested arrays, high-card time series, graphy relationships, or an ODS/Data Vault layer feeding multiple marts.Main point: keep raw raw, standardize once into conformed models, denormalize only where it serves the queries, and treat customer identity as a first-class process :)",gardenia856,2025-12-01 17:04:36,1,dataengineering,t3_1p9deke,False,
nreein8,"Your response for number 2 sounds a lot like thinking through the ERD for normalization: from the raw sources you develop a Kimball inspired normalized star schema using the higher quality inputs (which makes you wonder why you even bothered with ingesting and storing source 2 to begin with). In the case of primary keys, which join to the foreign keys of the desired tables, you have to figure out if each is a one-to-one, one-to-many, or a many-to-many relationship. If it's not one-to-one, are there any other tables that need to be joined? If so, you may find it more useful to create a set of compound keys (which could also be expressed in a singular column as a hashkey, which is my preference) - which contain all identifier columns that make each record unique. Then there's a question of data consistency - are we dealing with slowly changing dimensions or static facts? You don't want to create a key with nulls in it, but equally so you don't want to establish a new record each time a customer updates their info. So much of these considerations are determined by both the business logic at the point of collection (data source) and the desired update pattern for your tables.Getting this all diagrammed out alongside mapping out the business rules ahead of the engineering process will make everyone's work much easier, as at that point it's mostly plug-and-play to build your DDL and DML pieces.As much as I personally bristled at Medallion architecture when I was first introduced to it, I realized you can think of your raw sources as the bronze layer, the normalized star schema as the silver layer, and all downstream transformations as your gold layer. Alternatively, you can stick with the classic approach of a raw dataset, staging tables, production tables, and data marts for specific user groups if your governance plan allows for it/business needs require it. You can also mix and match with materialized views substituting for tables if they fit your needs and your platform supports them.This doesn't work for all types of data or use cases, but hopefully gives you something to work with and learn from.",Master-Ad-5153,2025-11-29 16:33:12,2,dataengineering,t1_nrd1k1i,False,

This simplifies migrations a lot.* Bruin supports start and end dates natively instead of requiring you to use custom variables.* dbt uses `ref` functions in Jinja, Bruin parses SQL directly and requires explicit dependencies.* Both supports different environments, Bruin also supports [developer environments](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/devenv.html#schema-based-environments) where it rewrites your queries transparently on the fly.* Bruin allows running Python transformations anywhere within the pipeline and runs it natively. This means you can run Python anywhere, and not limited by what Snowpark or similar platforms allow you to do with dbt Python models. * Bruin uses `uv` in the background, meaning that your pipelines will work even if you don't have Python installed, and each task runs separately in isolated environments.* Native column-level lineage in open-source and open-source [VSCode/Cursor extension](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/vscode-extension/overview.html).* Bruin allows [defining policies](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/policies.html) in code to apply your SQL statements, e.g. ""this SQL model must have an owner"" or ""it must follow these rules"". You can enforce these in your ci/cd pipelines.* `bruin validate` validates all your queries via dry-run to check if they are valid, this means invalid code never lands. * Bruin contains embedded sqlfluff for linting with your existing rules.* Bruin has an open-source MCP server to let agents build/help with your T layer.* dbt has \`doc\` macro, Bruin contains a built-in [glossary](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/glossary.html) instead.Both tools are useful in their own ways, and share different approaches, hope this comparison is helpful.",karakanb,2025-11-28 17:55:28,2,dataengineering,t1_nr8xjvb,False,

For Protobuf, if you have a descriptor set (.desc), protoc --decode or grpcurl (with reflection or -protoset) gets you readable output; with Confluent’s Protobuf support, the same schema‑id header flow applies. Redpanda Console or Conduktor are nice when you want a UI that decodes messages against the registry. Confluent Schema Registry and Redpanda Console do the heavy lifting day‑to‑day; DreamFactory has been handy when I need a quick REST shim around decoded records plus schema lookup.If you build a visual inspector, make it registry‑aware (Confluent/Karapace), handle Avro/Protobuf wire headers, accept .desc files, and show schema diffs; otherwise quick scripts will still win.",Many_Seesaw4303,2025-11-30 06:33:41,2,dataengineering,t3_1p9f4gp,False,

Yep, this is the case for every table and also this one, we can identify the PK and normally store the hash as well with it in a new column as we use it to build our data vault/silver layer on it. In case a PK exists, we compare the hash of the concat of all columns except the PK.2. For this specific table we would do a initial load from 2015 to today if we would build the table now and then starting from tomorrow we would load a full year back every day. When loading, we would then compare only records going one year back as otherwise the query would close all records between 2015 and the 28th of November 2024. 3. Yeah, considering Iceberg here! Played with it and the ""timestamp"" function really makes it way easier to go back then playing with the valid from/ valid to date columns. The only thing i can't get my head around is. When we would use snapshots instead of SCD2, then i assume it would be something like:\- Initial load - All rows ranging from 2015 - today with snapshot date today (\~12 mln rows)\- Every day after today - All rows for the last 365 days - snapshot date of that specific date (\~1 mln rows)It adds 365 mln. rows in a year and when i want to know the last version of a PK on a specific date i would need to partition by and order by the PK to get the latest version. Thereby, if a record gets deleted in the source system there's no way to mark it in my append only db without making a SCD2 kind of script that fills in a valid\_to or is\_deleted flag. i'm probably wrong but the snapshot system seems to be best fit in cases you know your source system will never delete anything.",Crazy-Sir5935,2025-11-28 11:05:04,1,dataengineering,t1_nr4o5zk,True,

If records are deleted in source ( in the last 366 days) and you want to remove it form snapshot, it is also possible via Iceberg.

It all comes down to your needs, if you have only a couple of standard sources / destinations, you can use a pre-built no code tool, even though i do not like tools that have a vendor lock-in with no open source option. But i am a developer, so for a DE team that has no dedicated software engineers, they may be an option, but keep in mind that those tools usually are hardly extendable, so if in the future you come across an exotic datasource that you cannot read with them, you have to build bridges (like python scripts as an intermediary step) that write the data into a database from which the tool then can read and so on...My recommendation: If you have dedicated software engineers, use something like dlthub, if not, you may consider something like windsor.

To me this isn’t about blocking marketing or “never letting them make technical decisions.” That’s gatekeeping, and it usually creates more tension than it solves.Marketing people are adults. They can understand trade-offs and deal with consequences just like everyone else. The real problem is usually not who suggested a tool, but who actually owns the process and the outcomes.If ingestion is owned by the data team, then the data team should make the final call. If marketing owns the workload and carries the operational risk, then they can make the decision. Just make ownership explicit and you avoid the “how could you allow this?” gaslighting scenario entirely.Also, you don’t want to become the “no person” who rejects every tool non-engineers propose. That kills collaboration. Better approach is:1. define the owner 2. list the requirements 3. evaluate trade-offs together 4. let the owner decideSometimes a no-code tool is the right choice.

nrrlwee,"Sorry, this will be a bit long, but I think it might help.Quick disclaimer: I’m one of the founders of Bruin, an asset based data platform similar to dbt and Dagster, so I’m obviously biased. But I’ll try to keep this rooted in how things actually work in the industry.The difference you’re seeing between infra-heavy Zoomcamp projects and more “software-engineered” Python repos isn’t a real contradiction. They represent different layers of the stack. Zoomcamp is trying to give you a broad picture of what you *might* see in a real team. Not every company uses Terraform or Docker, but many do, so the course touches those pieces early. Later, the focus shifts more toward dbt/Bruin-style asset based work, which is how a lot of modern data pipelines are actually built and maintained.In practice, most companies mix both approaches. The orchestrator (Airflow, Dagster, Bruin, etc.) handles scheduling and execution. The actual transformation logic usually lives in asset definitions: SQL models or small Python transforms with clear dependencies. When that logic becomes more complex or gets reused, teams extract it into a proper Python package with a src/ layout, tests and versioning. So the “tool based” approach and the “modular Python project” approach are not alternatives; they stack on top of each other.The industry is moving toward asset based workflows because they offer a clearer dependency graph, builtin testing, ownership, lineage and easier debugging. That’s why tools like dbt, Dagster and Bruin are becoming common.For someone applying to an internship, the goal is not to master every tool. It’s enough to show that you can write clean Python, understand Docker at a basic level, have touched one orchestrator, and can describe your work as a data flow. A simple infra-driven project plus a small, well-structured Python module is already strong.If you can show that mix, you’re in very good shape for junior roles.",PolicyDecent,2025-12-01 20:12:10,2,dataengineering,t3_1pbmo3x,False,

nrbnz04,"My background:I graduated with a master's in CS about a year ago. I'm still looking for work, but part of this was my own doing for not doing a technical internship while I was in school and not doing more personal projects (I want to teach as a 2nd career, so I tutored/did teaching jobs for CS during my summers. At the time tech was still stable, so I did not think I had to do a technical internship. You live, make choices, and you learn). I'd think about first why you hate CS and why you have negative feelings about it. For people I've tutored, usually their hatred for CS was resentment for not pursuing their passions, feelings of frustration for not understanding the material (often trying to do the work alone), math phobias, not connecting with the material, or a mixture of those reasons. All extremely valid reasons and reasons often reliant on your environment (bad profs, depression, lack of community, etc). Before you decide to jump ship from CS, be extremely honest with yourself. Did you give CS your full effort? This means if you had the time, did you attend Office hours, talk to your professors, try to talk to peers, go to tutoring (if you could afford/uni offered it), join CS clubs, etc? If the answer is no, then something was holding you back from giving it a full shot, so you need to figure out what that is and if it's within your control to get past it. Some people, even with the best tutors, need more time to learn STEM subjects than the 4 years expected out of uni- this is completely normal, but may not be a financial option for all students (which is an unfortunate position to be during later years of uni and will require some tough decisions).If you have managed to stay in your CS program this far without acidemic probation, then you likely understand *some* aspects of code, but too many knowledge gaps are there to make you see the big picture (which in CS is important, its when everything begins to click). With enough hustle, I think you can salvage the rest of your degree and make it through- but this will require complete humility to get there. You making this reddit post in full honesty about your knowledge gaps makes me think you might be able to do it. Next steps would be scheduling meetings with your profs, get a tutor if possible, talk to your GTAs, joining study groups, etc. The key part of wanting anyone to support you in your success is to take the initiative (with humility) and be consistent (show up, do the work). I've had students reach out to me with failing grades halfway through the course with humility, and it was that act of bravery that lead to them passing the class (if they put the work in).My best advice is to find a prof you like/trust in your CS department and have an honest convo with them. I'd also schedule an appointment with career services and talk to them too (you pay a ton of money to be in uni- use your resources!!!). Ask them if there is a realistic way for you to finish your degree with the knowledge gaps or if it's for the best you switch. I know plenty of people that made CS a minor and switched to business with a technical component- there could be options you aren't aware of, but you need to have those conversations with people who have that knowledge.Even if you do switch- get that internship! It's extremely important in this job market, and the easiest way to get and prove you have experience.Good Luck! Always happy to chat further. I have personally supported many CS students to find the acidemic path right for them (even if it meant a different major) and also helped many find the fun in CS to get through it (a lot actually went from hating to loving CS).

It is better to rewrite the function, when you have a clear idea of what you were doing, it come out much clearer. When you struggle with a solution, it shows up in the codes readability, a function should look like a proof, where the reader often will think it looks like an obvious thing, even though the concept was hard and the idea was a result of a lot of work.I use the concept of ""helper"" functions, similar to lemmas to improve readibility, so that it doesn't confuse the overview of the function control flow. You will often find that helper functions can be used on a multitude of other functions, saving total amount of code. Try to keep variable names short as possible, while still be descriptive. Coordinates are just x,y,z for instance, not position\_horizontal\_x\_coord or something stupid like that. I find it ends up obscuring the manipulation you are trying to do. Write purpose of the function, and if you are doing something unusual, throw in a comment. Things can get complex, especially when using abstractions, or using stuff like linear independence to shift a problem in to an easier solution space in order to save compute time or memory space. This is something you often run in to, when doing optimization.For beginners, it is also nice to have a simple environment to test out ideas, can be stuff like python to toy with a concept, or it can be a small program independent of the larger project, that you can edit and easily see the output, instead of doing guess work.If you intend to use a library, the rule is that you need to read it first, so that you don't import thousands of lines for what could be solved with a few lines of code.",BirthdayTiny2843,2025-12-03 08:41:50,4,learnprogramming,t3_1pcy0pf,False,

Tech is arguably one of the most community oriented STEM fields out there, especially evident in it's history. Lean into this strength!I guarentee you have at least 5 classmates who feel exactly like you. Next time you go to class, talk to a few classmates and ask them if they are doing any side projects, how they feel about leetcode, etc. Do not feel discouraged if you hear a few people talk about their side projects/ease with leetcode- find comfort in being aware of people more knowledgeable than you in your community- you can learn a lot from them! Once you got enough feelers, start figuring out what you want to do with that info. Is someone working on a side project that sounds interesting? Then see if you can do something similar or ask if there is any way you can join in on it. Are a lot of students struggling too? Then form a study group together and collectively figure out what projects you can work on either together (get that github practice in) or independently. Even if you are surrounded by many people who ""have it together"", ask them what got them there and how you can be more involved. Whatever you do with the feelers, make sure it's rooted in community and doing work consistently. Personal projects have really frustrating hurdles, so you need that support system to get you to keep going.Your professors are also goldmines of knowledge too, so ask them what types of personal projects you can work on or some general guidance- literally email them to schedule a meeting.If there is one thing college gives you, it's the opportunity to connect with people (your first network). One of the best lessons I took away from college is it only takes one person to get the momentum to build a community- so if you can't find community that will help you grow, then that is a sign you need to put in the work to build it. The other big lesson I learned in college is that people really admire someone who openly wears humility and accountability on their sleeve- it builds trust and leaves room for stronger connections to grow.Whenever I have feelings of imposter syndrome kicking in with thoughts like ""I could never achieve x"", I pause and ask myself ""But why not me?"". And I keep asking why until I have measurable steps I can take to improve.Hope that helps! Even with the stuff we are passionate about, it's easy to feel lost or overwhelmed when we try to tackle it alone.

nrdidnu,"You shouldn't use Leetcode as an indicator of your programming skills. At most it is an indicator of your DSA knowledge. The real metric of general knowledge/skill is what projects you have made. Since you say you haven't made anything, the best time to start making a project is right now, whenever you have some free time to spare. Pick something you find interesting and just start making it. The hardest thing is looking at a blank editor, but once you write the first few lines (even if it's just a bunch of comments outlining the general program flow you are going to implement), you'll naturally fall into a pipe-line of problems you have to solve, allowing you to iteratively reach a solution over time. There's no shame in using google or any other forms of documentation, everyone does it, and if they don't then they're either lying or making something trivial. The only thing I'd avoid, or at least use with extreme caution, is any form of generative A.I. Ideally, you'd use it as a tool or a tutor, asking it to explain concepts or answer some questions you might have. However, in reality most people (especially beginners/learners!) fall into the trap of having the A.I. do everything for them, and essentially ""outsource"" their thinking to the machine. By that point, you may as well not waste your time, since you will learn nothing.You should also avoid falling into the trap of ""collecting"" languages as if they are Pokemon. You should be focusing on language-agnostic concepts, which can be implemented in a variety of languages (some of which will be better suited than others to whatever you're making). Of course, it's ideal to have a basic grasp of the language you are going to use, but if you're firm in your language-agnostic concepts, it will be easy to just pick up the syntax along the way.As an answer to your question, it's definitely not over. You just need to change your approach to education.

nrfk610,"There probably isn’t for a few reasons. When you look at something like mathematics, or really most subjects you take in school, you can see this level like structure where most things you learn earlier support nearly everything you learn later. Eventually you have to specialize and your field will have knowledge that is specific to it, and not applicable to other experts.I’ve found that with programming, it doesn’t really neatly fit into a nice sequence, because it’s far less sequential, and far more parallel. You learn *out* rather than you learn *up* if that makes any sense. And you advance in terms of your general maturity, rather than specific knowledge building on each other as theorems imply further theorems. The other thing is that programming sits in this place between academia and a trade, where there’s a ton of “craft” and professional knowledge that exists in the form of essentially folk wisdom transmitted via forums and blogs, not books. All that is to say, it’s harder to curate a list like you imagine, and there’s going to be way more disagreement about it when they do.Here is a list of articles about software which I think are all excellent, but decidedly mostly on the advanced side.

Their idea is to think through a problem **by** programming it step by step and making sure every step works, and refactoring the code repeatedly to adjust it for the next steps while making sure that everything works and delaying crucial decisions for as long as possible (it may even turn out that you won't have to make a decision you thought you would have to make).However, this still isn't enough because you still have to make some decisions that may turn out to be wrong in the end.

The kind that is made by someone named after the devil and featured on a youtube channel. The thing looks impossible at first, and you feel like giving up, till you spot a tiny little weakness. You won´t deduce a number right away, but you can see a logical connection. maybe it lets you eliminate a possibility, or even lead you to a completely new approach. The very best problems (and puzzles) teach you something new, but not by telling you, but by figuring out the logic because you have to. These programming problems and puzzles are rare, they are frustrating to do, almost not worth the effort, but damn, they feel amazing and you want to talk to everyone about what you learned.Most programming problems are like approachable sudoku, you see a path almost immediately, but there might be 1 or 2 hidden things in there, half of the way, where you do something new, or different. Maybe you have to look something up, but they are not frustrating, cause you already came halfway, and you are not just gonna give up now. You should be able to solve this.

nrjkx3l,"First, there’s a certain amount of “don’t go crazy with conventions” in service development. You’re receiving formatted text that your host binds to a handing method which in turn returns formatted text. Taking the long view, Rest is simply a point of view that “the http verb in the formatted text header should dictate the operation” which replaced the previous opinion which more or less said “just use post or get for that mandatory verb header and name your operation in the relative path and the name should usually match the handling method so you can find things”. Neither is wrong. People just have strong opinions about formatted text. Bonus: If you really want to annoy people, go take the position that soap with xsd-defined payloads is more precise, more extensible, and can be more secure than rest with json (it is) and that devs were simply too lazy to learn the spec. It’s a bit better now that swagger (open api) is more mainstream, but for a while rest was a real pain to consume.The next thing to remember is that your reaction is valid and you’re often going to have more tailored controller services for web front ends. These aren’t enterprise APIs. They’re part of the same logical application and are only services because the halves run on two different computers. Otherwise they would just be helper or data layer methods. We do this because chattiness and sequential service call latency is the death of web pages. So if a commonly used page needs a getMyStuff composite method that returns a splittable json payload in one hit, that’s not crazy. If you need that to be available generically, you can expose a graphql or composite endpoint that allows you to specify an object and specific children and fields.

nr50u7m,"Actually language can make a difference as does implementation. floats can be 32 bit or 64 bit compliant. Then there is the question of are they IEEE floats or something else. That being said I'm not sure if there are any FP units that do 64 bit faster than 32 bit.As for your programs, you should always ask why you need more precision. IEEE supports FP32, FP64 and FP128 as for what you are calling shorts I suspect that is language dependent and is not a floating point type. Often we are talking about ""floats"" as 32 bits and ""doubles"" as 64 bits (C++). There is also a potential for long doubles. Again in the context of C++, shorts are integer types, so shorts would almost always be faster than the floating point unit. The big but is that this can be execution unit dependent. I can't help with C# as i know zip about it, but if shorts are integers there then you might want to look into your understanding of the language. Integers and floats have two different use cases. it is important to understand that floats are approximations.So when you ask which is faster, you need to ask what hardware is it running on. GPU's can really muck things up because of special types and optimizations. One of those optimizations is what can be done in parallel. For example if the GPU (for example) 128 16 bit integer operations per cycle as opposed to say 32 doubles per cycle which is faster? What I'm trying to say here is that it depends on the specifics of language and hardware the code runs on. In the made up numbers above the processor would complete 4x more operations per cycle.Caches are a wholly different discussion. Generally shorter types means more data in cache but you also need to consider cache line length and other behaviors. If you have truly time critical code you may need to optimize for cache behavior on a specific processor. It is completely possible to arrange things (floating point operations) such that cache might not be a problem compared to integer.",spinwizard69,2025-11-28 00:24:34,3,learnprogramming,t3_1p8fwj1,False,
nr5kuv6,"on most cpu, there is a lot of conversion going on. The FPU converts all floating point type to a large type with excess bits to help reduce errors, so those floats get a double (pun?!) conversion from their 32 bit value to a 80 or 120 or whatever it is now bit value, the computations are done, and it gets converted back again to the smaller value. Integers don't suffer as much of this on some hardware, it just depends. X86 type chips for example has overlapped registers for 1, 2, 4, and 8 byte integers all in the same physical circuits, so it does not have to promote a 32 bit int to a 64 bit and back to do the computations. Also, integer circuitry \*in general\* is simpler than floating point, due to how it has to handle the exponent and base for floats while integers are pretty much simple math. I mean a multiply in binary is either a copy of the value (multiplied by 1) or all zeros (by zero) so a multiply is just steps that shift and add. A multiply in floating point is notably more complicated.I don't know the modern timings. FPUs are VERY fast. Integer math circuits are also VERY fast. But all things being equal, the extra work for floating point makes me feel pretty confident that its probably at least microscopically slower than integer math if you can actually do the same work using both types. It may take a billion plus repeated operations to show a meaningful difference when timing it, though. And repeated operations MAY skip the double conversion stuff, if you are working with the same entity over and over that would be optimized to have far less impact, so the actual task being tested matters a lot too.cache and bus stuff outside the CPU has an impact, and THERE, bigger is not better. Its a totally different conversation.Language does matter, at least somewhat. Or the compiler, and how good it is. Some less popular languages may not have the A team working on the compilers the way we have for big languages like c++ and so on, as one issue. Others stuff like interpret vs compiled can make a big difference.",Independent_Art_6676,2025-11-28 02:38:55,2,learnprogramming,t3_1p8fwj1,False,

nr57lhd,"I wouldn’t stress about this — it’s the most extreme case of premature optimization. But the AI isn’t entirely wrong, it’s just answering a question that doesn’t matter for you.Modern CPUs are optimized for 32/64-bit operations, and short arithmetic can require extra sign-extension instructions. Float SIMD (SSE/AVX) is also absurdly well-optimized compared to integer SIMD. So in a tight loop doing pure math on individual values, floats can genuinely be faster per-operation.But that’s not what data-oriented design is about. The win from smaller types is memory bandwidth and cache — if you’re iterating over millions of values, smaller types mean more fit in a cache line, fewer misses, faster overall. The AI conflated ALU throughput with memory access patterns, which are completely different concerns.None of this matters unless you’re in a game engine’s hot path or crunching massive datasets. In normal application code, you’ll burn way more time on the code smells: constant casts when APIs expect int, subtle bugs from implicit narrowing, maintaining mental overhead about which precise type lives where.Constrained types absolutely make sense for semantic clarity though — using sbyte for a deck index or ushort for a port number communicates intent and gives you some compile-time bounds enforcement.

ns1gk96,"The battleship game actually sounds pretty hard for a beginner, which you still are. My expectation would be that resources would be provided to you to help you complete the project. If there are no such resources, then it's understandable that you've turned to using a tool (AI) that genuinely can help a beginner write a moderately complex program. Though I don't use it for certain reasons, and I don't really recommend using it, I don't think there's shame in using it for this purpose.However, if there are resources available to you, especially professors or teaching assistants you can talk to, I advise you to go to them with your questions. You can also look online for help with some of the more common pitfalls.The key thing I will emphasize is that there is usually some frustration and discipline required in order to ""get"" what your program is doing (or isn't doing, if you've run into a bug). Staring blankly at the screen or turning to AI for an attempt at a quick fix won't do much to resolve the root problem, which is a lack of understanding. And to understand sometimes really does require you to step through your program one line at a time with a debugger, printing things out along the way, until you know exactly what your program is doing.If you're just struggling to get any code written, it's best to start by breaking the problem down into smaller tasks. For example, you said the game uses a 4x4 grid. My first thought would be: how am I representing this grid? Probably it's useful to know if a part of a ship is on a grid cell or if it's just water. That might lead you to the idea to represent the grid as an array of bools, where a cell holds true if a part of a ship is there and false if not. That's not necessarily ""the best"" way to do it, it's just a way. As a beginner you're not expected to come up with the best or fastest or prettiest solution, it just needs to work.It also helps to translate your ideas into plain English and then into pseudocode before writing any actual code. The jump from thoughts in your head or words in an assignment specification to real code is usually too much when you're just starting, except for the really simple things. If you go straight to writing code, you'll usually end up running into errors or bugs that aren't easy to fix because you haven't thought enough about what your program should really be doing yet. Better to do that thinking up front, write the key things down, write pseudocode that roughly represents what you wrote, and then translate the pseudocode into real code. As you get more experience you can skip/truncate some of these steps, but it's rarely a waste of time to be diligent in this way, in my experience.",Sorlanir,2025-12-03 09:36:41,1,learnprogramming,t3_1pcv7w2,False,

It is not necessary to fully master any one tool, you're just trying to signal ""Hey, I have used these tools as part of my process, and I can fairly quickly pick up different ones that do the same job.""As for questions 3 and 4 about what else you should be doing right now and how to stand out, I will first say that I admire your willingness to think ahead. On the other hand, I will also say that you should not feel compelled to do extra work beyond what is already being assigned to you at school. This is because, imo, the amount of hard work and effort it takes to stand out is not worth the payoff *if* your only goal with that effort is to stand out a little more. Your driving motivator should just be what you're interested in, especially because what you're interested in may change, which can lead to you going into a different field than the one you're currently considering, at which point any past hyper-specific work done for the purpose of standing out may not be very useful to you.That being said, projects are a good place to start. A project can be anything you're interested in: a website, a game, a tool, an extension of a school project. The important thing is just that there's some overlap between your project and the field you're interested in. For example, if you think you might want to work in embedded systems, then building a web app won't help you very much (it may still help a little, though). However, you want to be willing to devote some proper time to it -- probably at least 50 hours in total, spread out over the course of a summer or school year.",Sorlanir,2025-11-29 08:26:22,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p9g33b,False,

nro5q6p,"OOP can be a real beast to learn. It will eventually click, though. Don't go too hard on yourself and more important: take breaks, get out, exercise, do something fun. Really. Just grinding won't get you further. Your brain will just get overloaded and shut down.A little story from my experience: when Java came out, I was already programming for over a decade and was proficient in multiple procedural languages. Then, I tried Java and OOP. This was a humbling experience. I could not make heads or tails at all. The *language* was easy enough to understand, but switching from procedural to OOP didn't click at all. I tried many times and failed many times until at one point, it suddenly started to make sense. Can't even say what really did it for me.Now, my advice is to program something with it and here, I deviate from the common examples: build a *library* for card games, like Blackjack, Poker, Uno, etc. Start with modeling a single `Card`. It has a suit, a rank, a numeric value, a face, a back, it can be face up or down - the fields. The card can report its data - provided it is face up, it can draw itself (in a loose sense), it can be flipped - toggle face up/down.Then, go further: make a `Deck` that can hold a full set of cards, that can be shuffled, that can deal cards, that can tell if it is empty or not, etc.Next, a `Hand` that takes cards.And so on.Build it in such a way that you can create different `Card` types, e.g. PokerCard, UnoCard, etc. All these can use the `Deck` without modification.With such an exercise, you'll cover abstract classes, inheritance, composition, polymorphism. The benefit is that you can draw a relation between a real world object and its digital representation.",desrtfx,2025-12-01 06:28:13,6,learnprogramming,t3_1pb4hkw,False,
nro2yub,"Relax and go easier on yourself. I am not sure what university you go to or how they teach it there, but in general I don't think they teach it very well and you certainly have not had enough classes to be this hard on yourself.OOP is not just a Java thing either. You can think of it as real life and that is why it is supposed to make sense once you understand that. Classes are just descriptions of things. Objects are instances of that description.Use animals as an example. Mammals are a class that describes things with hair. So, hasHair == true. Some mammals are land animals and some are sea animals. So, where == ""land | sea"". A lion (subclass) ""Inherits"" the attributes of a mammal and adds a few more attributes like sharp teeth. So, hasTeeth == true && hasBigTeeth == true && isDangerous == true :). A pig is a mammal too and it ""inherits"" from mammal too. Some of the attributes it shares with a lion has different values. If we were to control a lion or a pig we call the ""run"" function, the lion will have a faster run implementation than the pig. ""Polymorphism"". We typically hide the implementation and field access to make code less brittle. We would not want someone binding directly to something we want to be able to change later. We make these attributes and internal functions private. ""Encapsulation"". There should be a subclass of mammal that lion inherits from named ""LandAnimal"". Now this part gets tricky because Java does not support multiple inheritance so we want to use hasA vs isA implementation. When we access the base class LandAnimal which actually has the ""run"" method which is slower in pigs than in lions ""polymorphism"" again. LandAnimal is an ""abstraction"" (or base class) of Lion (isA LandAnimal). Or we can use interfaces for this ""abstraction"" (hasA LandAnimal) interface (composition).I just wrote this from the top of my head so I hope it makes sense and is correct.I hope this helps.

I had used well known libraries for this prior, but watching his presentation gave me an insight into “how” he implemented this idea in his library react-virtualized.I went off and tried to build my own little library that could do the same. I dropped the “I’m not gonna re-invent the wheel” mindset, and instead just said I’m gonna sit here and get something working if it takes me all month. Instead of querying GPT for answers, I just broke it down into small bites. “How do I unmount something when it goes out of view? How do I detect when something is coming into view?” Etc.” In the end, my little library worked well enough for me to be super proud that I figured this out, and the amount I learned during the process was pretty wild.

nrhwjeh,">using AI coding assistants (Cursor, Copilot, etc.) as “training wheels” while I learn fundamentals along the way.Don't do this. Using AI like this is pretty much the best way to kneecap any learning a beginner does.In the beginning stages, you are honestly *training* yourself as much as you are learning - you have to build up your mind, to be able to handle the abstractions and prolonged mental effort programming requires. I find most beginners fail not because they can't find the right knowledge, but because they never get their mind ""in shape"" enough.Coding assistants can be fine for already skilled developers, people who already have the types of habits one needs to be successful. But for a beginner it can prevent you from doing the kind of hard mental work you need to be doing in order to get your brain in shape.Think of it like you're training to go on backwoods adventures, hiking and climbing mountains and trudging through forests. When you go on your big backpacking trip, sure, you'll probably get in a truck and drive to the trailhead - that's fine. But when you're starting out training and going ""I'm going to walk a few miles every day to build up my endurance"", it wouldn't make very much sense to just drive those miles every day instead and still call it training, right?Ditch the AI until you reach the point when you're smarter than the AI. AI is kryptonite for learners when they used it to do things they can't already easily do, save it until you get to tasks where you're like ""I've done this 100 times on my own, I don't need to bore myself the 101st time, I'll get AI to generate it because this task is too easy to challenge me"".",PoMoAnachro,2025-11-30 05:27:01,2,learnprogramming,t3_1p9uf6a,False,

If you don't like watching the lectures, you could just skip the video and read the lecture notes instead. Then jump into the problem sets. It's a great introductory course that does set you up well to expand your learning in different directions. Just reading documentation would be an unnecessarily hard road considering the multitudes of resources available these days. Docs aren't really a learning resource for new programmers. They're written expecting the reader to have a certain level of knowledge already. But I'm sure a quick search would bring up loads of free and paid courses, and other resources. Any source recommending CS50 will likely recommend others too. My tip as an educator, is to pick whatever you want. It doesn't really matter as long as you're making forward progress. But really try to stick to it. Consistency, and a good sleep schedule are the keys to success in learning.",Eptalin,2025-11-29 04:19:37,3,learnprogramming,t3_1p9f2is,False,

I thought I hated programming, refused to even try it until I was 30, then I found out I'm good at it and I love it (I'm a little obsessive when it comes to programming now).

There's no reason to specialize in something you hate, nor in going to college if you hate it, for a degree you'll hate working in. Look into audio production and audio engineering (that's somewhat different from straight ""music technology""). However, you're kind of giving mixed signals. If you're into music and music software, what don't you like about the music technology you were introduced to (which, presumably, uses said software)? I tried being a musician a long while back, and I loved messing with MIDI devices and all the music MIDI and editing software. I liked messing with soundboards, and I think it'd be fun to be the sound mixer/tech at concerts (for example).If the idea is: You hate college, you hate all the degrees, but you're going to get one anyways. Pick something ***you can stand***. Something adjacent to what you want to do. For example, I got a business degree with an emphasis in entrepreneurship, because I've always wanted to start a small business (and as of now, I'm building out my presence as independent contractor for full stack software engineering). Yes, the degree is kind of worthless, and no it didn't ***really*** teach me much about building and sustaining a small business, but it all starts to add up.In my mind, it'd make way more sense for you to go to a technical school for audio production. It'll be cheaper, faster, and you might actually develop a stronger interest for it.

College does not teach you mastery, only YOU can do that over time.The best way to get good at software engineering is to build projects as others have suggested. You have a great base somewhere in your head :) to pull from. Start with something small and definitely do it full stack. If you focus on frontend only you will miss backend context. Same thing the other way around. To me, those two things go together.Start small and keep it simple. Let the project guide what you need to learn next. I almost always suggest the often dismissed TODO exercise to start with since you already have some base knowledge.Start small, create an index.html page that has the word ""hello"" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, and the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. An address book, an small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from take TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skill you need to build any of these.Also, I have been doing this for over 30+ years and I pretty much only know (often remember) basic syntax. Things I have done before are familiar, but I still need to look almost everything up.Best wishes. You can do this.",Ok_Substance1895,2025-12-02 18:31:39,2,learnprogramming,t3_1pceges,False,

Are you asking if the win rate is too low to be fun, or are you asking if the program is behaving incorrectly?It's straightforward to calculate the exact probability of each possible outcome of a spin, and thereby calculate the probability of a win. One way to do this is by brute force: there are 116^3 = 1560896 possible outcomes, all equally probable, and you can write a program to count them up *without* randomness.With a little work, you can calculate the same win probability more efficiently, by avoiding repeatedly considering all the duplicate ways to get the same outcome.Of course, even if the probability of a win is 1/100, that doesn't guarantee that there will be exactly one win every 100 plays. The actual outcome is very likely to be higher or lower due to random variation. If you want to check your program for correct behavior, you can do a large number of runs (say, 10000) and then use an appropriate statistical test (such as a chi-squared test) to see where the observed number of wins falls, in comparison to the statistically likely range.I'm not a gambling expert, but I believe real slot machines don't *only* pay out if all of the symbols on a line match.

It has the specific signature you described, and here are the reasons for the questions you asked about the method signature:1. All methods are supposed to either return a value, or indicate that they do NOT return a value using the keyword `void`. Java does not expect the `main` method to return a value, which is why we use the keyword `void`.2. `main(String[] args)`: This is just the name of the method that takes a string array as an argument. This does not directly result in any user input. The Java runtime receives the user input arguments from the OS, and then passes them into `main` when it invokes the `main` method.3. The method is marked public because it has to be invoked by the Java runtime. It needs to be accessible to the outside world, it wouldn't make sense for it to be private.Honestly, I don't know if any of this explanation would make sense to a beginner.

This is where you make a decision to NOT follow a tutorial and instead look at documentation and examples to understand what is going on in these, in this instance, React applications. Every engineer uses references. It’s okay to not know things. But the goal is to understand the process, not copying and pasting to create a finished product as fast as you can to feel impressive.

Some practical stuff that actually helps.take a walk (seriously, your brain needs to defrag), rubber duck it by explaining the problem out loud, break it into the smallest possible pieces, ask for help but come prepared with what you’ve tried, and remember that struggling with something new doesn’t make you dumb , it makes you someone who’s learning. Everyone feels imposter syndrome, even the person who seems to breeze through everything. It’s your brain trying to protect you from failure, but it’s lying to you about your capabilities.

Finding slow memory leaks, building dev tools to address some inefficiencies, analyzing and addressing performance issues, optimizing our horrendously slow CI, devop stuff, etc. I still use ai for these harder problems but it involves a lot more human coding and intervention.

If you have a professional network / connections, they are your best resource for getting past all the noise created by AI resumes and all the tactics that HR / recruiting departments are using to thin them out.A friend at another company said they just fired an offshore guy who they later found out had 6 jobs at the same time.

Thinking of pivoting.You need to pivot in place at your next employer, rather than try to pivot between jobs. It won't work, you have no experience in the role you're applying for. My advice would be to try to be your next team's Scrum Master, if they don't have one. Get the certs for that, get some experience, then look at pivoting again to Product Owner or TPM based on your preference.FYI these \^\^\^ roles are getting even worse for cold applications because all the offshore that can't code (or get their cousin who can code to do the interview for them) get scrum / PM certs instead. Every cert class I teach / attend has a disproportionate number of offshore attendees, most of whom couldn't create a dashboard in Jira to save their lives.Not to be irrationally negative about offshore but there's so much noise in the system right now that it's hard to match US workers to US jobs.

I have a good friend who has his masters and teaches regular and advanced history / social studies for highschool students, and he's had some uncomfortable insights about AIFor the first time since we've really been recording this information, my friend has been seeing an inverse bell curve; meaning the average score is no longer in the middle ~70%, there are two polar opposites: students that care and are trying, scoring 90%+ and those who just don't give a shit at all. So to give the younger generation some credit, there is a big group of students that see what tik tok and AI are doing to their attention span and are determined to succeed in spite of that. But there just as big of a cohort that are straight up turning off their critical thinking and letting AI take the wheel.Because critical thinking, making decisions really is the skill AI threatens to take away the most. Most of these failing students just refuse to put in any effort that requires them to think beyond a surface level.So to reiterate, this is genuinely new. This is different. Previous technologies like the Internet certainly changed education, but a huge emphasis was placed on digging beyond surface level Wikipedia details. Today AI can (appear to anyway) do that digging beyond for you in a few prompts, and the skill to research and analyze information just gets thrown away by a startling number of people",FriscoeHotsauce,2025-12-01 16:11:05,16,cscareerquestions,t3_1pbca1r,False,

nrrufvb,"Current SWE (SRE), former Support Engineer.In my experience, Support Engineers are great in theory but in practice the number of truly good Support Engineers is very low.The common anti-pattern with Support is 1. customer complains about something via chat/email > 2. support person copy and pastes customers problem into a dev ticket > 3. now dev has yet another ticket thats probably vague and not actionable out of the box > 4. dev asks support person questions which they relay back and forth to customer until resolution. I call this the **”Carrier Pigeon model of Support” (tm)** and it’s terrible - customers are left thinking “why am i talking to this support person instead of the dev” and devs are left thinking “why is this person making my job harder”. It’s inefficient (latency due to relay) and ultimately makes everyone frustrated. Not falling into this antipattern is hard - customers will pester you (because they want cases solved faster), sales people will pester you (because they want their customer happy), and product/dev people will ignore you (because you’re bothering them and they have More Important Things (tm) to do). What a good Support Engineers does is equal parts social engineering (how do I get this person to help me when it’s not necessarily in their interest) and technical skill (troubleshooting whatever problem the customer has). Generally, I see the following in good Support Engineers:- They learn how to ask good questions - good questions are asked to the right person, in the right way, with the right information in such a way that *makes it as easy as is possible for the answerer to give a response*. Good Support Engineers ask for help from devs in a way that makes it easy to help them.- They manage expectations effectively - sometimes the customer should not be expecting an “urgent fix” for something that is at best a P2 feature request. Good Support Engineers set proper expectations with customers and only let customer urgency bleed onto Devs when its’s warranted.- They are self sufficient and proactive - good Support Engineers leverage resources, the access they have, and their troubleshooting skills to get information. They don’t bother devs about every single question. Thats not to say they never bother devs, but they try to dig up information on their own.

nroczm1,"I’m just a SWE 1, but I like to think I have a healthy relationship with AI coding right now. I use it for work daily, but I originally learned and got to where I am without AI.I mentor for lots of college hackathons and I see so many students like you, who are completely reliant on AI to code, and fail spectacularly. It is an **insane power move** (HAHA) when I pull up to a mentee, immediately close ChatGPT or ask them “how do you close cursor?”, skip over all the Google AI overview when I google stuff, and debug their thing “raw” old school and fix it either in 1 glance or in half the time they’ve been stuck in an LLM prompting circle.My advice? Learn without AI. AI is a force multiplier imo, it turns say a level 1 engineer into a level 2, and a level 10 into a level 20. The moment you let things go, you stop leveling up. There is a significant difference in quality and speed between “code me an api for an app” vs “implement an API with these exact 5 routes, implementation steps, pagination, specific auth middleware, database, other layers, and other architectural and security concerns/requirements.”TLDR: better you are, the more effective it will be.“Learning without ai??? That’s impossible.”Yeah yeah, I hear you. You want to be spoon fed everything relevant now. You want it fast and customized. You’ll be better reading and learning without AI, but yeah yeah, it will take longer. Remember that programming is supposed to engage your brain. But if you really want to learn with AI, which I totally get the temptation, here’s what I’ve been advising my mentees at least.It about aligns with how I learned without AI, but adapted to this new day and age:## Use AI as a guide, not as your driver.> in the past, I learned through documentation and stack overflow. I would try copy and pasting code, but it would rarely work without me understanding how it works and modifying it to work with my code.1. Let the AI guide you, not drive for you. Get off cursor or whatever. Do not auto approve changes. Review everything it proposes. Stop copy pasting ChatGPT code. Instead, read each line it proposes, understand what it does and why it does what it does. Never ever put the code in until you know what each line does. Research the documentation, the patterns, everything OUTSIDE of asking an LLM. Too many times, I’ve been burned by incredibly convincing hallucinations I blindly trust.**My company gives me Claude 4.5. I have coded with Gemini 3 in my spare time. Even then, a near top-of-the-line coding LLM isn’t perfect enough to fully vibe-trust for work and for mildly complex projects.**## Ask AI to cite its sources or give it the sources.> I learned everything by reading documentation2. If you ever let an LLM drive (rather, think) for you, ask it for QUOTED sources and links, OR plug in the relevant documentation yourself and then ask for direct quotes that inform its implementation. Then, go back and read that relevant section yourself. Only then, can you hit yes on the code. You’ll learn something, at least, while keeping some momentum and enhancing accuracy. Still—better to learn yourself and feed it what it needs rather than trust it.## Debug without an LLM> Debugging and making effective hypothesis and knowing how to test them is the best skill I’ve learned, and it’s helped me both with and without AI. Trial and error have helped build my intuition and propose ideas on why things aren’t working, and that’s built on a solid debugging strategy, tons of experience, and exploration. 3. Learn effective debugging skills. I’ve had so many situations where students debug via LLM by saying “it doesn’t work, fix it” or “it’s not smooth, fix it”. Instead, when you tell it “I identify a race condition, I’d like to refactor the code by XYZ” the LLM works actually pretty well. But to figure this out, you gotta know how to debug outside of an LLM. Sometimes, it may involve a big or novel switch in approach that an AI in its little rabbit hole cannot suggest. Also, being a code detective is the best part of programming imo, why would you offload the best part to an AI?TLDR: don’t turn off your brain and don’t trust anything the LLM says. Pretend it’s a con artist or scammer and double check everything yourself OUTSIDE of the LLM “scammer ring” scheme.",Idroxide,2025-12-01 07:36:30,25,cscareerquestions,t3_1pb4kf7,False,

Of the many questions I ask, I like to ask engineering managers / directors: ""What was the hardest conversation you've ever had with a stakeholder"". What I'm listening for in the manager's/director's response is:1. Have they ever told a stakeholder ""no"" or ""[yes, and](https://galenemanuele.com/blog/power-of-yes-and)"" (which is really just fancy ""no""). Unless they've been in leadership like ... 2-3 years ... an answer of ""huh, nothing comes to mind"" is a red flag for me. My read on that is they're very likely avoiding difficult conversations to the detriment of their team, because leadership is almost never sunshine and butterflies for everyone. Business is hard.2. What inputs lead to that difficult conversation? The team? A Jira board? An existential threat? Customer feedback? Data? Hopefully something more tangible than intuition alone.3. How did they tailor the conversation to this specific stakeholder's behaviors, values, and goals?And I often ask clarifying questions, or for them to elaborate, if I don't get 1, 2, and 3 covered in their initial response. Covering all 3 in the initial response is a big old green flag for me. I need to work with leaders who know how to ""go to bat"" for their people and advocate for what they believe is best for the business -- maybe that isn't as important to you. A big, big part of having a healthy engineering practice is telling important people ""no"" sometimes, even if they might fire you or advocate for your firing because you said ""no"".

nr1r3bt,"So, broadly speaking, disagreeing is perfectly normal and in fact is strongly encouraged in healthy teams. Crucially though, both parties have to be disagreeing in a spirit of honest inquiry. They have to be listening to what the other person is saying and understanding why they have said it. In a properly functioning disagreement you will be asking as many questions as you will be giving answers.Eventually, you might get to a point where you both fully understand each other, but do just fundamentally disagree. At this point, you will typically involve a 3rd party (another colleague, a team lead) to give a fresh perspective, and to act as a tie-breaker. If you still can't come to a consensus after that, then your only option is to disagree and commit. A senior decision maker (e.g. a team lead) will pick one of the options, and you will all agree that, even if it's not your preferred option, you will commit to getting it done on the basis that doing the wrong thing well is often better than not doing anything at all.Key rules when disagreeing:1. Authority is irrelevant. If you can't explain and justify your view, your job title of Fancypants Principal Senior Architect is meaningless.2. Listen. Listen and understand what the other person is saying. Ask clarifying questions or suggest concrete examples if you don't.3. Go for a beer afterwards. This is the importance of relationships. I can have (sometimes quite forceful) disagreements with colleagues, but it is fine because we are also friendly with each other. Grab a beer, or a coffee, or have a game of pool, or whatever, but just build that relationship so it can easily survive disagreements.Finally, YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) is a common approach in software development, and it has it's place, but when it comes to security concerns you _are_ going to need it!",HiddenStoat,2025-11-27 13:11:35,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1p807h5,False,

I know how to do something in one language, so I how can I do something similar in this new language. There are obviously some languages that are different, but logic and optimizations/algorithms will always be somewhat consistent. You're also noting one reason why people go into management or leave the field. They get sick of having to keep learning things. I've had interviews with people where we discussed AI, and some people have a nuanced opinion on it. Not everyone thinks it will take over the world. And not everyone thinks it's garbage.

By the hours, the masters gave me an extra year of work, all of which is geared towards personal development.As for getting into AI/ML labs, that's probably much harder, unless you do specific research that has industry overlap.

There is an additional interview round for MLE jobs where they ask you ML trivia like ""what it is the difference between L1 and L2 normalization"" or ""Explain K-fold cross validation"". You may or may not get to do model development in an MLE job. But you will be involved in productionalizing an already developed model.For applied scientists type of a role though. I have seen a few of my batch mates get those type of roles with just a master's degree. There are a few caveats though.1. These roles were in Amazon. In Amazon Applied scientist role is more of a SWE role than an AS role from what I observed. Most of the Amazon Applied Scientist roles are not the same as Microsoft research Applied Scientist role or Google Brain Research scientist or even Facebook AI research applied scientist roles. A lot of Amazon AS people get to churn out research papers every year. But I have seen even MLEs churn out research papers as well.2. You need to have at least 1 publication even for the Amazon AS role, when applying from outside. A thesis in the Master's program helps with that.3. The school I attended was a top 20 school for CS back when I was applying. And a few of my Batchmates are now working as Applied scientists in Facebook and Amazon without a Ph.D with just a master's degree. And these were people on H1b. Not even US citizens. Your experience might not be the same however.Also applied scientist interviews are far more mathematical in nature than SWE/MLE interviews.

nrlrmrl,"MSE-DS is not what is going to get you into a job in Cali. I'm in the MCIT and I would say that penn is very east-coast oriented. Since you have DS experience you can absolutely get a job in Cali, but it would not be because of your penn degree. Also yeah it is true that a lot of the courses will probably have overlap with your undergrad, and look at [mymcit.org](http://mymcit.org) and look at the DS reviews - they aren't great. If I were to go back, I would have applied to a West Coast school as I want to move to Cali too. This would be the optimal choice, but hey completing the MSE-DS is still going to move you forward and is not a bad decision, but just that there may be a better decision for the 3 years that you would put into completing the degree.My humble opinion: apply to an MSCS instead. Your DS undergrad combined with CS masters will make you unstoppable. It does not have to be brand name either. For example, SJSU is heavily recruited by big tech companies. So I would apply to all brand-name and non-brand name schools on west coast and see where you get in. After all, tech is not *as* elitist(unless you get into berkeley/stanford which will give you a massive advantage) as top finance/consulting. So, being on the west coast even at an average school will give you a higher chance of being hired in Cali than MSE-DS.",SnooRabbits9587,2025-11-30 21:32:19,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1pa6c4x,False,

nrhg6dz,"I am not knowledgable of the skills that are in demand in Germany, but I do hire engineers from junior to Principal level. Consistently the people I hire are able to confidently tackle a problem I put in front of them, whether they know how to or not. The last two people I hired immediately started collaborating with me on a simple real world coding challenge that they had zero exposure to before the interview. A good software engineer knows how to break tasks down into manageable pieces, ask questions, and systematically work through a problem I know that I'm relatively unusual in my interview approach because Leetcode is still out there, but all the best jobs I've had have had similar practical problem solving interviews.So, my primary advice is to work on those problem solving and communication skills. When you're approached for an interview, you should be able to reflexively start diving into how you'll tackle the problem they put in front of you.I think Azure is an excellent choice for boosting your desirability in the market. Despite spending most of my career as an individual contributor programmer, DevOps knowledge has been the thing that has helped me the most. Also, don't forget about Python's use as a back end language for building APIs. Back end developers might not be as cool as ML or AI engineers, but there's still a huge need for them. It will be far easier to find a job and demonstrate your competence as a dev.
