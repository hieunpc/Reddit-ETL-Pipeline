If average transaction amounts suddenly double, that's a red flag even if the values are technically valid.* Monitor schema changes proactively. When a new status code appears or a column's type shifts, alert on it instead of silently dropping data.* Compare against historical baselines. A 15% change in distinct customer counts might be normal growth, or it might be double-counting. Context matters.The tricky part is reducing false positives—weekend vs weekday patterns, seasonality, etc. I've been using type-specific thresholds and adaptive baselines (moving averages for high-variance columns, prior period for seasonal ones).Schema and row counts are easy; catching that a source system changed from dollars to cents is harder.

nqvym96,"This is a broad question so I will give you an broad answer.I prefer a minimal orch layer and split the data pulling from transformation layer unless you require a very complex normalisation and cleaning. So it depends. How complex the data is and how forward you go towards the insights/analytics layer? If the data is not complex and you insights to be extracted, delegate this to a modelling tool like dbt and use your pipelines to pull data only and trigger dbt to keep it simple. If data is complex requiring many normalisations or multiple sources that a simple sql cannot do, threat your pipelines like a library to process data in its context. But remember early optimisation is the evil. So its not a question of preference, is what you have to do at THIS time to keep it simple, readable and maintainable for your future self without over engineering. This rule is only yours (or maybe also for your team). Sometimes it is ok to over-bloat one or two flows because you will touch that once in a year and nobody else will or if it fails nobody will get hurt. I personally consider this and also I don't mind to have duplicated code 3x into 3 flows, so the 4th one will justify a refactor.

Because of this tendency, I think the book is important to read before entering DE *and* to revisit often in your career. Tools and techniques make it easy to lose sight of why you exist as a DE in the first place; as important as knowing the ins and outs of spark or airflow is, the business doesn't care about how you did it. They care about value and they care about cost. If you don't know that, you kind of don't know anything.

You can rebuild it from a dimensional model, but now the OBT hasn't saved you any time at all. * OBTs can't relate an event to dimensional data at different points in time. For example, see invoices from 2024-12-30 with customer, sales member, or product names as of 2024-12-31, 2024-01-01, or today. * OBTs can't show you what all the possible values are for some low-cardinality dimensional field. They only show you what appeared at that time. If you want a drop-down list of them, if you want to show metrics by all possible values, or even to merely show all possible values for each period of time for visualization consistency - you're out of luck. * OBTs can deliver worse usability - when you've got 400 columns and they aren't organized by topics - like dimensions. * OBTs can deliver worse performance - when you've got hundreds of columns with large high cardinality fields, then your columnar storage isn't helping as much as you need, and you end up building more smaller files.So, both approaches have value, but generally a OBT without backing versioned data is the weaker solution in terms of usability, maintainability, and functionality.

OBT as a fully denormalized model allows all data in a single table as it is best for read-heavy analytical queries using map-reduce algorithm (hive, hadoop) or vector queries (columnar like clickhouse, hbase).

This is most often done when rapidly prototyping in a tool like PowerBI. OBT also works better for some niche storage / warehouse types. An example of this would be Microsoft ADX which actually has very poor join performance if you have a dimensional table that may be large.

Nothing frustrates me more than getting assigned an AI merge request, or to maintain a package originally written with AI. They tend to be 10x longer than human generated ones and a pain to verify, and the AI makes tons of mistakes. I'm almost at the point of outright rejecting them.I use AI in a limited capacity as a tool to make me faster.If there's a function I don't understand, AI is usually pretty good at explaining it faster than official docs, but have to be very careful with niche systems and their complex functionality. I've seen it outright fabricate what the behaviour is in a confident way.If there's a simple one of script, AI is usually fast to write it, such as ""Write a python script to download this bucket of files then parse the json of the files to extract this field and output it"" so I can find bad values that are breaking pipelines.It's great for the little things, and outright horrible for the bigger things, and anyone who thinks it can handle the bigger things is causing more problems than they are solving and actively degrading system reliability.

This would let users see which models perform best and how they compare on real tasks.It is clear that people want this kind of transparency, so adding proper accuracy benchmarks is already in my plans.",vtsaplin,2025-11-26 00:30:10,1,dataengineering,t1_nql54ra,True,
nqsqlks,"Good point. Privacy is not 100 percent with remote LLMs though, because column names and types are sent to the model.But we also cannot fully hide or obfuscate the schema.The LLM relies on the semantic meaning of column names to understand queries.If everything is renamed to c1, c2, c3, the model loses context and cannot decide which column should represent “product” or ""customer"" or ""date"".So complete obfuscation improves privacy but breaks semantic understanding.This creates a tradeoff:• real schema means better results but slight schema exposure• fully synthetic schema means privacy but no useful SQLA middle ground is partial or selective obfuscation for sensitive fields.And of course, with a local LLM (for example via Ollama) the schema never leaves the machine, so both processing and privacy become fully local.Thanks for raising this - very helpful point.",vtsaplin,2025-11-26 00:23:13,1,dataengineering,t1_nqkket3,True,

nqv7qya,"don’t try to hand-copy 200+ tables one-by-one. Use Fabric’s data movement primitives plus an automated control loop, or avoid copying entirely and materialize only what you need.A practical pattern that works for me: (1) do an initial bulk load with a Copy job or Dataflow Gen2 that can target a Warehouse. (2) switch to incremental/CDC for ongoing sync. Fabric has a CDC/Copy job feature and you can also use Delta Change Data Feed in Lakehouse tables to capture row-level changes for reliable upserts. (3) automate discovery of new tables by keeping a metadata table or using the Fabric REST/metadata APIs in a pipeline to list Lakehouse tables and loop over them to create/update copy jobs. Community threads show people scripting this when they need to scale. About schema drift: Fabric’s copy tools can do mapping but they are not perfect at automatically absorbing arbitrary schema changes for all workloads. If you expect frequent schema churn, consider an ELT pattern: keep canonical data in the Lakehouse and run periodic MERGE queries from Lakehouse into Warehouse tables (or materialized views) using the Delta CDF or SQL MERGE so you have deterministic upserts. If you want a starting checklist: pick Copy job for initial load, enable incremental or CDC for high-change tables, build a pipeline that enumerates tables and triggers jobs for new ones, and use Delta CDF or MERGE for schema-safe upserts.

An example is at my company I am under the swe name but work on and own some DE and my org is paid very well. But we also own the data for lots of high priority ML products. I also think saying data is a cost center is just not super true. I think a lot of companies are viewing data as a service. ML teams require lots and lots of data that is accurate and growing in complexity. This requires lots of work. Most companies are putting a lot of money towards data teams now and are viewed as essential.So in terms of pay I think this is a non factor (there are more important factors like what company you work at and how fast you grow and promote).

A few thoughts that might help:\*\*General pattern that works:\*\*Process at the lowest granularity you need for reprocessing. In your case, that sounds like AP\_Number level, since you want to reprocess specific APs without touching the whole EQP.\*\*On avoiding reprocessing:\*\*Track what you've already processed with metadata (timestamp, checksum, or version) stored somewhere lightweight - could be a simple metadata table in your warehouse, or even a manifest file per batch. When new data arrives, compare against this metadata to determine what's actually new vs. what you can skip.\*\*On the Part\_Number optionality:\*\*Since Parts are optional and variable per AP, I'd process at the AP level and handle Parts within that processing step rather than trying to partition by them.\*\*Alternative approach:\*\*What if you partition by ingestion batch (timestamp when client sends data) rather than by the hierarchical data structure? Each batch could contain multiple EQPs/APs, but you'd process the whole batch as one unit. Downstream, you'd have the full data hierarchy in your warehouse with proper keys for querying.\*\*Question for you:\*\*What drives the need to reprocess individual APs? Is it data corrections from the client, or something else? Understanding that might help determine the right partition strategy.(Side note: your client moving to database storage sounds like it'll simplify this significantly - might be worth investing effort there rather than over-engineering the S3 ingestion flow)Curious what you end up doing - hierarchical data ingestion is always interesting to solve!",kalluripradeep,2025-11-23 12:05:35,3,dataengineering,t3_1p49fl5,False,

I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and then it took me 6 months to learn to walk again. When I reported back to my job when the surgeon ended my FMLA and I could prove I could descend down 2 flights of stairs in less than a minute, my office was on the 3rd floor of a 5 story building. I had to prove that in case of a fire in the building and couldn't rely on anyone to help me down the stairs. But as I made it back to work after 6 months, my termination papers were waiting for me as they had already replaced me. I say that to say that every in person interview I have ever been to in the last 41 years, I was always offered the job. I've been been to 4 in person interviews this year and none of them have contacted me after I left the building. But all 4 interviews have gone the exact same way that your interview has gone. When I sat down with other employees for a technical review, all 4 interviews with them would ask odd ball questions that had nothing to do with programming. Most of the people I had interviewed with I saw a sheet where they had to google for these odd ball questions. I'm also a back end developer and one question I was asked is how would I use a Friend Class in C#. Now Friend classes are mostly used by testers, not developers. I've never ever used a Friend class in production. But the guy asking the questions wanted an answer, I made up some answer of how I would track down a bug that was happening in a Entity Framework class and returning invalid data. I said I would use the a Friend class to inject various variables into the Framework class to possibly see where the problem is coming from. Now it would really be a lame company to work for if they were using Friend classes in production, and I would bet that they were not. But the guy interviewing me said ""Well, that isn't what we would do."" The interview then ended. The manager would return to the conference room and I would be walked out the building. More than likely it was just a gotcha question to say that we interviewed US citizens and none of them were qualified for the position so we need to apply for more H1B visa holders, or something similar.

nq2lvlt,"It's normal.There is a tremendous difference between what you can/will learn in school (which isn't much), what you'll use on the job/in projects, and what is sought after/asked in interviews. It is not even close to being the same.Treat it as a learning experience and understand that preparing for technical interviews is very very different. Remember that interviews are intentionally designed to expose what you *don't* now. Good interviewers rarely focus on what you *do* know. Interviewing is a skill and you should definitely focus on it if those skills are weak.I would actually argue that with these concepts.. the theoretical foundations have to be there, yes, but how it's applied in real world scenarios is far more important. The edge cases, the pragmatic approaches.. the theory only goes so far. And the only thing that matters here is experience. You won't really understand hashing until you've screwed it up. You only really understand securing an API until there you cause an unauthed API incident, etc. Having text book theory about all of these with no real world use is actually worse. Best to be honest and say, ""I don't understand the inner workings entirely, but this is how I have used it, and this is what I learned, found interesting, found tricky..""The other thing you nailed, was your understanding about your communication style. You need to develop clear, concise, confident, vocabulary about these concepts, it has to be second nature.Of course, any seasoned dev can google/stackoverflow/llm the answers and patch something together in a real job context. But can they think and speak on the spot and come up with a clear approach to a complex problem? Interviewers look for ""architectural sense"". Are they just slapping ideas together, or can they actually build and piece together a system, that works? Can they document and write a spec, without help?Your ability to communicate ideas, problems, solutions, and tradeoffs, as a dev is more important than your ability to code. Maybe not at first when you're getting started, but certainly in mid career, and late career, it's everything.There are plenty of resources and courses online to learn about just about everything. It needs to become an obsession on your part, to consume as much knowledge as you can AND then apply it in personal projects, over and over again, from scratch, from frameworks, from everything, until the skills are cemented. It's brutally tough, I get it. There's so much to learn and specialize into.But in this job market and hiring climate, only the obsessed, people who truly love this stuff, will make it.

I focus heavily on entities, relationships, cardinalities, constraints, and conceptual/logic design. Because of that, relational algebra, window functions, etc aren't core to the curriculum for this class.* I also intentionally keep the SQL examples **implementation-agnostic**. If all you want to learn is vendor differences, you need to look elsewhere.* For the data types videos, the goal is to give beginners enough intuition to make reasonable design decisions, not to provide an exhaustive catalog of every nuance across engines.* As for NULL semantics, that topic *is* included, but it shows up later because students need some conceptual grounding first. By the time they get there, they’re ready for a deeper discussion of null traps.* As for ""A table is used to represent a single entity"", it helps beginners learn in the 1st lesson. Nuances like junction tables are inappropriate in the 1st lesson, and are covered as the course progresses.These choices are mainly for pacing and approachability, especially for students encountering databases for the first time.

This utilizes libraries, wikipedia, internet resources, and other online databases that have content to check. Then take a person's work, and cross reference everything in your data base. It will essentially go through line by line, and then look for similarities to the library. I can only think of how to apply it to essays and papers, but it could be:1. Step 1: Start with similar words. The checker will take the piece you're working on, and compare similar words to others. If the piece you're working on reveals a high number of shared words, then it gets ""flagged"" for further examination. 2. Step 2: Take the piece you're comparing, and the other pieces of work that share some close similarities, and then reveal similar phrases/sentences. If the similar phrases ended up being long enough (multiple words/sentences), then the likelihood that it was plagiarized increases. (ie: a phrase ""too bad"" isn't going to flag it, but if someone quotes a full abstract from a scientific paper then it flags it as copied).3. Step 3: determine a way to program it to detect plagiarism vs referencing/quoting other works. You'd have to look up formatting options (like the usage of quotation marks, and other steps required to reference other notations). 4. Step 4: Iterate and reiterate the process until it becomes better, faster, or more robust. For code and math, especially on the lower scale like cs50, it's harder because a lot of the solutions for dedicated questions have 1 solution.

nqtm6sg,"Look at it from a different perspective:When you learn how to be a carpenter, do you go right to building a house to get better? No, you build a crappy chair. Then you keep building several until it looks a little less crappy. Then you build other objects and repeat the process. If you do that enough times, you'll naturally pick up other tools and methodologies that'll help you with your building. Over time, you'll be able to start building a house with your experience. You won't know what many tools are called, names of all the screws, and the best way to use everything. You just pick them up and try them out, learning as you build things..You're a **beginner** trying to build a house (Minecraft mods) when you don't even know what a hammer does (Java). Of course that'll feel overwhelming. First, play around with Java. Follow a tutorial or two about it. Maybe do a course or make something cool. There's no ""am I ready?"" You're ready whenever you say you're ready, whether that's after a 1hr yotube playlist or a several week MOOC. You'll *never* know everything about Java. Never. You can get a PhD in CS with Java and not know how to build a single project. Fortunately, you don't need to know *everything* about Java or CS to accomplish your goals. Don't let that lack of knowledge make you afraid to start building with it. You can start building things even after a simple 1hr tutorial. It would be a far cry from MC mods (little chair vs a hige house), but it's definitely enough to start your journey. I'd probably go through a beginner course utilizing Java. Udemy? Coursera? mooc.fi? Pick your poison. Anything works. [Pick one of the links at the beginning and get started](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/comments/1kla4xc/comment/ms0p7yn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).I'd probably go for the Udemy one. Hyperskill is more expensive, but it'll probably be the easiest intro to Java. The mooc is probably going to be very in-depth, and very hard, but free. Probably overkill. Coursera might have some free courses. There are many. Just choose whatever beginner Java course you can find. Whatever your choice is, just go through it until you know a little bit about Java. Your goal is simple exposure and to be able to build small little things that output into a terminal. They likely won't teach you how to build things in MC and you may be exposed to a lot of concepts you won't find immediately useful. Just get comfortable seeing code, using code, and thinking like a programmer.Don't go down a rabbit hole of things (remember the PhD comment?). Java can build practically anything, so you'd be able to learn so much without achieving your goals. Just get the basics down until you're comfortable. .Once you have a basic understanding of what Java is, go straight into learning how to mod.[Here's one resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1csh3yp/comment/l44waul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)[Here's another](https://www.mcjty.eu/docs/intro)There are a lot.Don't freak out. You won't know anything really. The above Java stuff was just getting you used to the hammer, nails, properties of wood, etc (depending on the resource, you may have built a chair or two).This, however, is the real deal. You're actually going to start building chairs, and it's going to suck and it will look like crap. You won't even know a lot of the things being talked about and you'll feel like you're at the very beginning again. That's okay and perfectly normal. You have to acquire a few more tools, but Java is the biggest learning curve and the one everything interacts with, so it's the one I recommended getting comfortable with first. Go through tutorial after tutorial about Minecraft mods, follow the beginner steps, and try to recreate things as they do it. Then try to do it again without the video, pausing each time. Then try to manipulate what you've created, or even break it. Then try to repeat the entire process from scratch until you recreate it (minus the setting up your tools part).Then move on to the next tutorial. Once you've acquired enough small skills, try to go about building a simple little thing yourself (you can even try after your first tutorial). This simple thing might be insanely hard. You might have to reference different documentation and videos to help you out. Once you finally finish it, try to improve it. Try to recreate it if you really want to reinforce the knowledge. Then move onto the next idea. Once you do that enough, you should be able to see other people's source code for their projects and be able to pick out little bits and pieces that you might want to try yourself, or research about to see what it does. Try to contribute to an open source mod or pull from their projects and play around with the code. That series of building is what will eventually get you to creating your own big ideas. People legit go through the Kaupenjoe videos (first link) without even knowing *any Java* and successfully learn how to build projects after a year. You can start that way too, but I thought maybe it'd feel better knowing a little bit about Java first (if you already don't know anything). If you're overwhelmed, skip everything I told you and go straight to that. It'll be very hard and scary, but learning to program is a marathon, not a single sprint..I can't really help you beyond that. Things take time. Don't stress about memorizing everything, being perfect in everything you do, or finding the best paths. Just progress, 1hr a day, every single day. .A painter doesn't get good after their first stick figure. They do tens of thousands of failed small attempts that build up to the occasionally solid large attempt. As they build up their skills from a ton of small, crappy projects, the eventually move onto more and more quality on each piece. Their skills don't manifest from perfecting their pain brush, getting the best pigments they can, or knowing absolutely everything they can about color theory. Don't worry about getting the best tutorial, learning Java perfectly, and being overwhelmed by all these new ideas. Just go through the first thing you see related to MC mods, that makes sense to you, and work up your skills, little by little.",Happiest-Soul,2025-11-26 03:38:21,3,learnprogramming,t3_1p63eza,False,

You will be overwhelmed, drained, annoyed and disappointed regardless. Learning is never a cake walk. You'll hit barriers and it will take effort to get over them. Programmers are just the people who stuck with it longer than others. Nothing special about them. A good way to retain what you learn is trying to apply it to your goal. Since you have one already that's excellent and a great motivator. Every time you learn something think of how you can apply it to that goal of making apps and modding Minecraft. No matter how small there is always a way to apply it. The first language is always the toughest. You're not only learning the syntax of a language and how to order things, but you're also learning computer science concepts at the same time. Once you get the concepts though you can easily transfer that knowledge to another language or project. It's like you're building a house. You need to learn how to hammer nails and which screws go where. But you also need to learn how to make a foundation and how to support a roof. So keep it up. You can't force things so take breaks and decompress and let things sink in. You won't become making apps tomorrow, but you can learn the building blocks a little bit every day or every other day or even once a week.

Find methods that don't follow this and extract into simpler methods.4.

Think about how these methods/properties might represent some entity. That said, don't get bogged down by focusing too much on OOP. Learn programming first.

I would create a static instance of the class and try to do everything with that.I finally understood that a class is essentially a ""cookie cutter"". You use it to create an object which looks like the class. Then you call the methods on that object. The reason you would want to do this is because you have multiple objects which are essentially the same, or similar. For example, take the ghosts in Pac-Man. You could write this by declaring X and Y co-ordinate variables for each ghost, but then you'd have a bunch of variables like ghost1x and ghost3y and ghost4x and so on. Think about how writing collision detection would work. You'd have to check if ghost1x==playerx && ghost1y==playery || ghost2x==playerx && ghost2y==playery.... nightmare.Instead, define a ghost class, and instantiate it four times, once for each ghost. The ghost class could include a collision detection function, to check if its *instantiation* hit the player. Now you can just write something like: if greenGhost.hitPlayer() player.gotCaught()You don't have to worry about how the calculation of the collision detection works any more -- at least, that is the theory.Have you searched for beginner-friendly OOP tutorials outside of video sites?

nqvtwa6,"As someone who’s been doing backend dev for \~11years, let me give you the advice I wish someone gave me early on:1. The real way you learn OOP isn’t by studying diagrams, it’s by modeling small real systems, giving each class a clear responsibility, and avoiding the “giant class with 20 methods” trap. That shifts your thinking from: the procedural way: “What steps do I need to do?” to the OOP way: “What objects exist in this world, and what responsibilities do they have?”2. Tutorials don’t teach design, books do. If you want actual design and not just syntax, these beginner-friendly resources are gold: **""Head First Design Patterns""**: the best intro to OOP thinking, **""Practical Object-Oriented Design""**: very readable and extremely practical, and **""Refactoring improving design of existing code""**: not OOP-specific, but teaches you to *see* structure and smell bad design3. Another underrated tip: read good OOP code. Python libraries, open source github repositories, or even frameworks.4. On the language choice: Python can teach you OOP, but it’s a multi-paradigm language, so beginners often get mixed signals. If you want the concepts to crystallize faster, something more “pure OOP” like Java, C#, or Ruby tends to make the underlying principles way clearer. Once it clicks, you can apply it in any language.And honestly, everyone writes procedural code inside classes at first. Keep going.

I know most of the terms used, I have done the relevant math manually and programmed it before. Everything fits into the models I have built in my brain neatly. Comparing this to when I first started writing ray tracers at university: I just passed linear algebra, and had no pracical experience. Everytime I read an unfamiliar word, I had to go back, and refresh my memory of that specific thing. ""How does XYZ relate to ABC again?"". The more unfamiliar words, concepts and language features you have to keep in your head, the harder it will always be for you to read documentation, or to plan and write complex code. There are basically two ways to learn this stuff: Theoretical and Practical. Theoretical covers stuff like lectures, and classes, but also online courses, reading a book or a tutorial. This can help you gain information a lot faster, since it is (hopefully) well structured and presented in a proper way to learn. Practical is things like coding, but also exercises you would do for class or for a course (or in a book). This will solidify the knowledge you gained from the theoretical part. It also forms shortcuts in your brain. After you have build the third backed with APIs, you will instantly know what to do when you start your fourth. You will have a folder structure figured out, some patterns you want to use, and how to name the endpoints. This is the type of knowledge you only get by implementing the same concept repeatadly, you cannot really get this from theory alone (and people who only got this from theory alone most often have really weird, and mostly impactical, solutions to certain problems)",Beregolas,2025-11-21 13:54:22,3,learnprogramming,t3_1p2yq3a,False,

I'd be like ""fucked if I know what'll hold"" because I don't do that kind of stuff often. But if I talk to my cousin in construction, he'll be able to tell me immediately (and probably look at me like an idiot for not knowing) because he works with that stuff all the time, y'know?The docs just tell you what the tools *do*.

There are many (many, many) ways to accomplish this, so it's hard to give a good recommendation without it.I will recommend Python for the programming language, Flask for the web framework, and Waitress for the server. Python is about the simplest language to learn, Flask provides tools for building a web service in Python, and Waitress acts as a go-between to accept browser requests, turn them into calls to your program, and send the results back again. I would also recommend Flask-RESTful (I would structure the form submission as a REST API call). All of these have very good documentation.Note that as a security measure Waitress only responds to the 127.0.0.1 interface (your local-machine loopback) and cannot bind to ports under 1024, so you would usually bind to port 8000 or 8080. For local testing or demonstration this is quite sufficient; if you want to serve pages to other machines, you would usually install nginx as a reverse proxy.Your laptop very likely already has Python installed, but it is a good idea to make sure it is up to date. If you open a command-line window and run ""python -V"" it should respond with something like ""Python 3.12.3"". The current stable version is 3.14.0, and that is the one you should be running unless there is some specific reason you can't. (On Windows! On Mac or Linux, don't go monkeying with the system-provided version.)It is recommended to start by setting up a virtual environment, to prevent something you're adding from interfering with things you've already installed. You can do this by running ""python -m venv my_app"" followed by ""my_app\Scripts\activate"". You can now install the modules by running ""pip install Flask flask-restful waitress"" and start work.Check the Flask getting-started docs; it will walk you through writing a minimal web app. Use templates; you can probably drop most of your existing html code into template files and use it from there with minimal modification and without cluttering up your code. Check the Waitress docs; they will show you how to call your app and get it running. Try to keep everything as simple as possible until you get a minimal version up and running; you can always gild it later.Good luck! :four_leaf_clover:",Veterinarian_Scared,2025-11-23 05:10:26,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p46r8t,False,
nqcxls4,"For what you are asking to do, there isn't much special about a server.Your laptop is a PC and is perfectly capable of being both the server and the client for what you are proposing.There are lots of things you can do to make it more ubiquitous- for example if you could get a static IP allocated and have it added to a DNS, you could look it up from any computer using the network name (e.g. https://www.myserver.com/).But if you can't do that (the more likely scenario) you can just look up its dynamically allocated IP address and use that instead (e.g. https://1.2.3.4/ or whatever address you are assigned in place of 1.2.3.4).More importantly if you want people to access your server running on your laptop from another computer you will almost certainly need to open the port that the server is listening on.For example, let's say you setup a ""web site"" using apache tomcat on your laptop. Apache tomcat, by default listens on port 8080 (for unencrypted traffic and 8443 for https if memory serves). So, if you opened up your browser and entered http://localhost:8080/mystery, then assuming your web app is called ""mystery"" you should see the index.html (or index.jsp) of your site.Now if you determine that your IP is 1.2.3.4 (it won't be, but let's assume it is) you could go to another PC and enter http://1.2.3.4:8080/mystery then you will likely get a ""host refused connection"" error. This is because the firewall on your laptop isn't allowing anything from the outside to get through - unless you set up the firewall to allow external traffic using port 8080 (or 8443 if you want https) to get through...Note, if you do open any ports, only open the one or two that you allow and when you are done close them. In fact I would open them when I needed them to be open and close them once I've done the demo from the other computer.There are plenty of other potential things you may need to take into account. For example, it will be much easier if both computers are in the same ""subnet"". If you don't know what that means, then just connect to the same wifi AP and hope that the configurations are such that they connect to the same subnet (e.g. try not to use a professors laptop and your student laptop - this is unlikely to be an issue as it is unlikely that there will be such configuration issues, but you never know for sure unless you try it and know what to look for when it doesn't work on some computers ).",gm310509,2025-11-23 14:08:18,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p46r8t,False,

nqdddf7,"Like any other programming problem: start by clearly saying *what* you're trying to do, then break that down into smaller subproblems or steps until it's approachable.It sounds like you want to identify *all* of the possible poker hands. Start with just one type of hand, e.g. a flush.What's the definition of a flush? It's a hand where all the cards are the same suit.One possible way of doing it is to say: ""a hand is a flush if: it's all hearts, OR all clubs, OR all diamonds, OR all spades"". And then write code to check each of those four conditions. This approach will work but it's a bit tedious.If you think about it for a second, then it should be obvious that ""a hand where all cards are the same suit"" is equivalent to ""a hand where all cards have the same suit as the first card."" So you don't need to write four separate checks for the four possible suits.And so on. You can repeat this kind of analysis for each type of hand. For some of the hand types, you will need to examine multiple possibilities, e.g. for two pair, you'll need to check the different possible cards that might make up a pair. For a straight, you'll need to check whether there's a straight with aces low (5-4-3-2-A) or aces high (A-K-Q-J-10).There are many possible ways to implement this. If you're a beginner, I would suggest that you first focus on getting something that works *correctly*, even if it's ugly or verbose, and then look for ways to simplify and optimize it.

nqdha6e,"That's a fun exercise. I haven't seen your code, but my immediate thought was how do you compare the cards? Their suits and values? So, how I would've done that is this - I'd create a Card class, so i don't have to store suit and value as a raw dictionary, instead i can assign those to a card's attributes through constructor, e.g.```card1 = Card(:red_heart:, ""Q"")card2 = Card(:red_heart:, ""7"")card3 = Card(:club_suit:, ""J"")```Also, I'd override comparison dunder methods in Card class, so that i can compare two cards like this:```def __eq__(self, other): if self.suit != other.suit: print(""Can't compare cards with different suits"") else: return self.value == other.value```And ""less than"" dunder method, so i can tell if the card has higher or lower value:```def __lt__(self, other): if self.suit != other.suit: print(""Can't compare cards with different suits"") else: return self.value < other.value```I would also wright a method to compare suits, so i can understand how cards relate to each other.And also, think about how you, as a human, identify that you have a flush, for example? You will take a look at you two cards, check their suits, ignoring their value, then you'll take a look at the table to compare those card's suits to the ones that you have on hand, and IF total amount of cards with the same suit is 5 - you have a flush!

When you write a program, there are typically a lot of libraries with commonplace code you're using (iostream in C++ for example). If like, 4/5 programs on your computer are using iostream, it kinda makes no sense for each program to store it individually, right? That wastes a ton of space. The solution is dynamic library files (these are "".so"", or "".dll"" files). A dynamically linked program will be compiled in such a way that when it needs access to a library, it will access the compiled library code at run-time from the library file instead of having it baked into the executable. Of course, you could just bake the library code into the executable as well. That's static linking, and it's common when you're writing a program for a system with limited space. It also means your entire program is all in one piece.As for dynamic/static typing, that's talking about the data being read. All data has ""types"". Data can be an integer, an unsigned integer, a character, a boolean value, a floating point number, a double floating point number, etc. and all of those are stored & interpreted differently by the computer - as far as it's concerned, everything's just 1s and 0s. How does your compiler know which is which? Two solutions:1) You just tell the damn computer what you want. This is static typing. If you want ""i"" to be an ""int"", you fucking call it an ""int"", end of story. It's what you do in C, C++, Java, etc..2) You take a chill pill, and have the compiler/interpreter guess with how the rest of your code uses that variable.

nqeetna,"To add a little more detail, linking relates to calling methods. It’s something you barely think about while coding. You just call one, but how does that actually work? Code is also stored in memory at runtime and instructions have memory addresses (line number offsets from the start of the executable file). To call a method, you create a new stack frame for it on top of the stack, set a return pointer to hold the line you are currently on, then jump to the first line of the function you called. At the end of the function, you set a return variable in the caller’s stack frame and jump back using the return pointer. So, how do you know where to jump? If it’s a method in the same assembly, that’s easy. If it’s in another assembly, you have to determine the jump address. That’s linking. Assemblies have a table of jump addresses at their start so it’s possible to read and set these addresses. Static linkers set this at compile time and if the actual assembly used differs at runtime, interesting things can happen. Dynamic linkers use a runtime to load assemblies and will resolve these jump addresses at that point. Note that virtual methods that support polymorphism have an expanded table of jump addresses by concrete type since they can overload methods. The runtime selects the jump address based on the actual type at runtime. See v-tables for more information.Typing. All memory storage ultimately has a type. It has to since types are literally encoded differently and processed by different cpu components. You can choose to set that type yourself at compile time (statically) or let the runtime take its best guess (dynamic). The later is rarely necessary with objects in languages that support ad-hoc tuples (like js grab bag objects). With primitives or collections of primitives, it’s not a good practice. With types, you want strongly typed code that lets the compiler do as much validation for you as possible. Anything it doesn’t check can still break as an exception at runtime.",Far_Swordfish5729,2025-11-23 18:48:59,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p47j6y,False,

Robotic arms have motors and position sensors. Some have integrated controllers. You may send a command to move an arm to a specific position over a certain amount of time for example. It depends on what the hardware is and how it is connected and driven.

nq8rkx8,"at a high level, there are 2 types of embedded systems. I used to work on large unmanned systems, and we used stuff like PC104 computers with serial ports. The line of code you reference in your question would be an invocation of a library function, and that library function would talk to a driver, and that driver would send voltages out the USB port that produce the required signals to tell a motor to run or an actuator to move or the like, or it might read a camera video stream or a lidar or gps output. This is not much different from coding up a laptop or something, these computers had a full operating system and mouse/keyboard/monitor support for diagnostic efforts and so on. Its 'barely' embedded, in the big picture of that world, but we made many a 'robot' (mostly, unmanned aircraft and later, watercraft) with those tools. The other level is where you do more of that hands on, sometimes actually wiring devices together yourself and sending voltages to them with some agreed upon way, often directly setting an address to a value using a C or assembly like language. I did a lot less of that, as it is slower to produce the product and a lot more weeds to get into for each individual component. For example we had one 'smart' actuator that ran code, but you had to wire it up a certain way to accept a program and then wire it up a different way to run the program installed on it automatically when it got powered on. There was extensive documentation for making that work. I would start with a simulation. keep the stuff that would be hardware isolated so you can replace it, and build a sim where you drive your robot around and have it do the things you want it to do all in just pure desktop code. Then if you want to build it, you can pick out the hardware and change out the isolated code to interface with the motors and sensors and all. We had full simulation for all our vehicles, crude but it got the job done, to test our control systems and such safely in a virtual world.

Pick something small for your first project but tie it altogether, frontend (html/css/js) to backend (java/database). You will get a lot more out of your university base knowledge this way.TODO is often dismissed as some little early learner frontend exercise. It can actually take you all the way to experienced full stack cloud developer (if you want to take it that far).Start the TODO frontend and make it fully responsive. For persistence, use localStorage (easier) or IndexedDB (harder) and create a JS ORM for persistence so you exercise these muscles. This will make it a fully functional todo list that works for that browser. From there add a backend with database. Modify your ORM to connect to the backend via REST. That will make it work in any browser (locally).Next turn it into a SaaS app with OAuth2 signup/login, member management, Stripe subscription processing, calendar scheduling, email reminders, SMS, CI/CD with automated testing and deployment.You will be able to build almost anything with the skills you learn through these TODO exercises.Start small and keep adding the next small thing to it. Add what you want to learn and let that be your guide. You will see progress as you go.Also, looking things up and figuring out how to solve problems is the main part of programming.

Set a timer for that period of time, like 30min. When it stops, you stop. Add to that initial list of things you planned to research later.You won't memorize everything (and don't need to), and often times simply going through the main material, only learning enough to continue on with said material, will help you build a foundation to reinforce the rabbit holes you'd be digging through later. If you start with the rabbit hole first, then you may wind up with collapsed tunnels as you have nothing to tether that knowledge to.

Starting with only one painting that they focus all their quality on often stunts their progress compared to those who've done a healthy mix of both. You're focusing way too much on quality. Lean more towards quantity for now.Programming is solving problems by building solutions, like a trade.

This also enables you to understand, to have a common vocabulary and knowledge base with others, even if they have a different specialization. I spezialized in computer graphics at uni. One of my best friends in networking and distributed computing. Although we barely had any courses in common after the first 2 years, we could talk to each other and explain one another what we were doing and how it works, with barely any problems. Those skill are not immediately, obviously useful. But they are necessary for computer science. And as someone who was a tutor for a DSA course: Those courses are there to give you the toolkit to reason about algorithms, analyze them and even figure out new ones if you need to. They don't teach you how to program, and that's by design. It is a different skill. Programming on the other hand is something completely different. It is a craft. The program doesn't care if you know Dijkstras Algorithm, can integrate in multiple dimensions or know the difference between average and median.

Can you learn it quicker and easier for this specific usecase? Also yes.

In either case, you're going to have to have threads wait on each other to catch up before continuing.As for what ""synchronizing threads"" means, it means what it does on the tin. Threads don't run at consistent speeds, and they run independently of eachother. This means when you run two threads, the order they finish in can vary at run time, which can be bad if one relies on the result of the other to do its job. This can also result in two threads using the same resource at the same time, even when they shouldn't - imagine two people being able to book the same seat at a movie theatre because they both clicked ""book"" at the same time.To synchronize threads, you give them a way to communicate, and that's where Mutexes & Semephores come in.Mutexes are a shared resource that can either be ""locked"" or ""unlocked"" at any given time. If you wanna use it, you have to lock it so no one else can use it. You also have to unlock it before moving on lest you fuck everyone up.Semephores meanwhile are kind of like hall passes, where mutliple threads can use the semephore at the same time, up to a threshhold; useful less for strict ordering, and more making sure multiple types of thread (ones that involve heavy processing for example) aren't running at the same time, gumming everything up to a standstill.",DTux5249,2025-11-23 07:27:47,8,learnprogramming,t3_1p4ghgl,False,

It was just simple custom RPC on top of TCP. I think a service (the Android concept) was involved for persistent connection. Android also has a service discovery API for looking for services on the network, but I only played with it briefly IIRC. There is also Bluetooth etc.Shouldn't be too hard to figure out if you want to control the functionality of your PC (or something the system exposes to programs, e.g. media play/pause/volume).

From there, you'd need a program running on your computer that you want to control that subscribes to the broker, and then does whatever ""control"" activities you need it to do whenever it receives a command. If you want to control a music player, you'd need to see if the player has some API to allow that. If it doesn't, you may need to resort to something like PyGuiAuto to simulate clicks on a UI to pause/play/next song/whatever.So, you'd need to be able to write code that can run on your phone (either a native app or a web app), and then some code to run on your computer to do the controlling. Both ends would likely require different languages as well unless you do everything in a broadly explicable language like JS.Edit: If the two devices will always be on the same network when you want to make use of this functionality, you could skip the broker and just run a typical web server on your computer. Then you could have the phone load up a web app that you write served from the computer, and the server could do the controlling actions directly.",carcigenicate,2025-11-26 14:02:09,3,learnprogramming,t3_1p78a7v,False,

Namely nursing though I may consider med school down the line.I lost my job exactly 2 weeks before my cohort started. It is not for everyone and you’ll encounter a lot of detractors both inside and outside of healthcare. My advice is to discover it all for yourself if you have any interest.Also my tech skills have come in handy. Informatics is a field that seems to have a lot of happy people in it. I’ve been offered paid research opportunities already and I’ve helped worked through IT issues on the floor.You can earn your CNA (certified nursing assistant) in a month for like $2K max which involves working for nurses doing a lot of dirty work, but I got a job directly after which pays me to go to school. I’m also earning other certs and building clinical skills. There’s even CNAs who work remotely. The healthcare system will break your heart as well as warm your heart because it’s the intersection of the best and worst of humanity. There are people who put an insane amount of effort in to help people. There are folks who sit on their ass. MBAs are a problem in that field too.Even with the OBBBA it seems like hospitals still need folks (granted I’m in a major US city) and every nurse I’ve spoken to has said “you’ll never want for a job.” I don’t think I’ll get near my old salary by any means, but I feel it’s more consistent. My interviews have been only a phone interview and unit interview which hasn’t been the hazing sessions you experience in tech.

Learning a little bit of cloud and DevOps wouldn’t hurt either, it’s pretty expected these days. So learn the basis of Azure, AWS, or GCP to the standard that a dev is expected to. You don’t need to go super into the weeds, but get an understanding of CICD Pipelines, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.This is pretty much the bare minimum knowledge for devs with a few years experience nowadays at least for web devs.Do that then study some system design methods (neetcode has videos for it as well as leetcode) and a few DSA questions. Don’t go too overboard on it though like many here will, if you aren’t trying to crack Big Tech, a good chunk of companies don’t even ask leetcode.From there just apply and hope for the best, the market is as good as it was 3-4 years ago.Edit:Biggest thing is probably to not ask this sub for advice, it’s full of unemployed people, students, and sky is falling doomers that can’t see what their weaknesses are",kingofthesqueal,2025-11-23 17:04:30,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1p448bb,False,

As far as I can tell, the improvements in LLMs have really started to slow down, and I see no reason why they shouldn't continue slowing down even more given that:* There are limits to how much energy can be allocated to LLMs; this ultimately puts a limit on how much training can be done.* We are running out of additional data to train LLMs on; this is another thing which puts a limit on how much training can be done.* Low-hanging fruit of algorithmic/architectural improvements have largely been solved (from models like DeepSeek) so there are now fewer and fewer stones to turn in this regard.* Moore's Law is dying and the low-hanging fruit of hardware architecture improvements seem to be picked by and large, meaning that hardware efficiency improvements will likely plateau. (see [https://epoch.ai/blog/predicting-gpu-performance](https://epoch.ai/blog/predicting-gpu-performance) for what I'm talking about)* Neural scaling laws which model performance are inherently increasing BUT concave down when more parameters/data are added, meaning that improvements should continue to get smaller over time; and this is not just the case for LLMs, but for any AI that could exist.On top of that, there's reason to believe that the models may get worse. Much of the data now on the internet is AI-generated and it is inevitable that a great deal of it will be used to train new LLM models, thereby causing them to overfit and degrade somewhat. Let's also not forget that the CEOs and researchers have a lot to gain by hyping up AI, so if that is what is causing to feel concerned, try to not to let it get to you; there's a long history of this kind of stuff happening when relatively new technologies emerge, but the end result has always been exaggerations.",EntranceOrganic564,2025-11-24 17:15:16,14,cscareerquestions,t3_1p5lq1p,False,

If you're targeting big tech, you're likely going to encounter some form of algorithm interview rounds. And of course, prepare for your standard behavioral questions as needed. A lot of times, these boil down how you resolve inter-personal issues of deadlines, disagreements, prioritization, etc.Outside of technical skills though, linkedin premium is probably a good place to start, though you might want to only use it for 2-3 months and decide from there if you still need it. I also think the primary thing to focus on is applying to listings early. Another side note for linkedin is to reply to recruiters if they do reach out, even if you are declining them. I believe doing so increases your profile's score/visibility to recruiters as someone that replies so you'll likely receive more recruiter outreach in the future. I don't have a concrete source on that though :grinning_face_with_sweat:",kewlviet59,2025-11-25 01:00:16,34,cscareerquestions,t3_1p5yfr3,False,

They can't tell what's impressive and what isn't, so they default to assuming it's all entry-level. Mention the most advanced courses, but cut things like ""Computer Science I/II"". A short list of courses that sound more impressive is better.The skills section needs serious trimming. That LeetCode level notation doesn't mean anything to most hiring managers. It's not an industry standard, and honestly it reads like you're trying too hard to quantify something that your GitHub and projects should already demonstrate. Same with the soft skills list. Saying you have ""time management"" is meaningless when you could just show it by describing how you delivered a complex medical AI tool with proper NLP pipelines and error detection.Your language list is creating a credibility problem. Eleven languages including VB and Prolog makes it look like you've dabbled in everything but mastered nothing. Recruiters know that's not realistic for someone graduating in 2026. You'd be better off splitting this into ""proficient"" (languages you've used in substantial projects) and ""familiar"" (things you've learned but haven't built much with). Don't bother listing languages where you're only familar that are unlikely to be relevant for the types of jobs you're pursuing to keep the length reasonable. That honesty will make you look more competent.The Task Scheduler project is actively hurting you. Your first two projects demonstrate real engineering thinking; then you list a project whose features are ""arrays, scanners, and conditional statements."" That's literally week-three CS101 material. Removing it entirely would strengthen your resume by raising the average quality of what you're showing.Your game project description has a weird gap. You did a great job explaining the design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy), which shows architectural thinking, but you completely forgot to mention what you built it in. Unity with C#? Unreal with C++? Custom engine? The tech stack matters way more to a hiring manager than knowing it was inspired by backrooms-style horror games.More generally, every bullet point should pass this test: would a junior developer find this impressive, or would they think ""yeah, that's just normal programming""? If it's the latter, cut it. Your resume should show the ceiling of what you can do, not document every step of your learning process. You'll have a bit more empty space, but that's better than getting mentally downgraded for a bad relevant to irrelevant ratio or preventing the reader's eye from catching the important parts in the 10ish seconds they're going to skim it.",AlignmentProblem,2025-11-21 10:48:13,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1p2og4v,False,

nqdekb4,"TLDR: Don’t move for less than 300-400k, Consider moving within Canada first. Canadian SWE (6 yoe) current living and working in NYC. From my opinion, it’s only really worth it if you can make significantly high salary, such that you can buy your way out of American problems. This is significantly harder for someone with a family, as your expenses will be higher and you will be impacted by more specific issues than someone who is single (Schools, Health care costs, etc). Even in a lower cost region like Baltimore, I wouldn’t move for anything less than 100-300% salary increase over your Canadian salary. If you’re really committed to this - Don’t focus on the L1-B visa, Consider TN. Apply externally to jobs in cities with tech hubs (SF, NYC, Seattle). With your YOE you should be able to get some decent high paying jobs (200k-400k). These should pay enough for you to support your family with 1 income; so even if your spouse can’t secure a visa, it’s still manageable. - Plan for potential private school expenses. Public education varies based on where you live, so either plan on paying more rent in a high income area or paying for private. - Plan for a short stay. Both L1B and TN are employer tied. So you WILL (not maybe) eventually find yourself having to come back to canada quickly if your employment ends. - The tech market is tough right now, but from what I’ve seen it’s still pretty competitive for senior level roles. Tbh, Consider moving within Canada. There are definitely senior level jobs in Canada that pay way more than 100k, you may just have to move to Toronto or Vancouver.

nqfyuz4,A lot of these aren’t actually really issues but can be if you don’t communicate them. Over 10 years ago I was in the same spot not knowing what to do. Today I still frequently get into these spots. The difference between me back then and now is I communicate much better and know how to learn. Delays? You know beforehand and you call them out when you see them coming. Giving stakeholders a heads up is good. No heads up when people are counting on you is really bad.In general though it sounds like you just need to spend some time so be sure to get AI to summarize docs for you and help you with coding as well. This will limit the number of surprises but surprises always happen. If you never hit surprises then the scope of your work isn’t big enough for you and you’re ready for more challenging work. Not communicating changes in assumptions and no requirements that were found would be a problem but people will give some leeway to new developments that were discovered. Prod issues? Everyone makes these mistakes. I caused one a few months back and even the most senior members of my team have done this too. Again if you haven’t done this then you haven’t worked enough or the scope of your work is too little. It happens to everyone. For these take charge and learn from them. Everyone makes these mistakes and can learn from them. I’m a manager turned IC again and I can say this: you want a good relationship with your manager too so play the political game. The manager is generally on your side because if you do well so does the manager. A lot of these issues can be communicated with the manager to help unblock you. Can’t give estimates right away? Yeah no one really can unless they’re super familiar with the subject matter. When your work becomes more ambiguous as your level goes up these can be more difficult.

nqrusu1,"Go for OMSCS with AI specialization. It will pay dividends in the future. The whole degree costs less than 10k. I don't see how that's a cash grab. Additionally, you can finish it in 2 years if you pick the right classes, as well as have a huge leg up in job apps (top 10 CS degrees and the alumni network) and the degree does not say anything about online so for anyone seeing your degree it's pretty much the same as the in-person one. I have seen people get jobs in the first semester dude just because they got paired with teammates who worked in FAANG or their desired role. Also one huge advantage with OMSCS is you can check out all the career fairs available in-person if you're willing to drive/fly to Georgia. It's an amazing degree with many benefits, but not enough people utilizing it.

You get credit for partial answers, ie passing some of the test cases but not all. Not sure if you'd get credit for return false and getting half credit kind of thing on the question, but that's useful to know.Maybe you get 90% done on a question and then just go on to the next.

I'm on the interview panel at my current company, and we've been seeing an increasing number of candidates that we suspect of using AI during the technical interview.Some of it is very obvious, like the guy who wrote the entire solution top to bottom without pausing to think. Others is just suspicion.I've been playing around with the idea of some kind of prompt injection or poisoning, something that might make LLMs slip up, but nothing I've tried can beat the modern thinking models. I'm also wondering if there's a software engineering version of ""delve""/em-dash, LLM Fingerprints that are very uncommon in human language but show up a lot in LLM outputs.Anyone had any success with this sort of thing?",These-Finance-5359,2025-11-24 15:04:37,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1p5bamo,False,
nqkdlj8,Ive never had a technical interview. Does the langauge I use matter? I only and i mean only know javascript as a programming language. Will an interviewer ever request a specific language or will they let me do what i know. Additionally for take homes and assessments and that wil i be expected to learn new language syntax in a short period of time? let me know your stories and or struggles!

nqlilha,"Do you have a technical interview coming up? Usually they'll clue you in on what they are going to go over. It's also usually after the first (or first couple...) interviews, so they already read your resume and talked with you about your skills, so they know what you do and don't know.I've had technical interviews when I knew literally zero of the many languages they used, they were aware of what I did and didn't know, and they asked me technical questions about the languages and frameworks I knew. They were mostly focused on my decision making (ie why would you use such a framework or library, when would you not, what are some of it's features and strengths).Ie a position with go and erlang asked me about my extensive next experience, why would you use it (forward facing web app, fast server supplied applications) and when would it not be as useful (super immediate information like real time financial information where you want it client side rather than server side). This was relevant to what the position was about (financial position basically).We briefly discussed what they used, I let them know I was aware of it and it's strengths, and that was about it. 90% of the interview was focused on system design decisions and AWS which is both language agnostic.Take homes or assessments will likely just be done in the language you're familiar with, and syntax lookup is usually allowed.Got to 4 interviews with them and waiting to hear back, but they said I did well on the technical interview.",NICEMENTALHEALTHPAL,2025-11-24 21:23:19,1,cscareerquestions,t1_nqkdlj8,False,
