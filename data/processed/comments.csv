o78tyzr,"Earlier today, I took 78 views that were created in SQL server. I need these in Snowflake (DBT really). I don't have all of the source data I need to make these and use work either so I need to identify those, build views in SQL server for the source systems that the orchestrator can query and add to the extractors. It took Claude Code an hour with almost no interaction on my part aside from approving the plan upfront. It one shotted the whole thing. All models compiled. Then I had it build a tool to cross validate the data from the old system with the new system.By no means was this sexy or even complicated work but it was insanely time-consuming. That would've been a couple days worth of work doing it by hand. Hell, just cross referencing out which source data I was missing would've been annoying and painful. I know because I did pretty much this exact same task by hand about six months ago.I spent effectively 25 to 30 minutes on the whole thing planning upfront.",toabear,2026-02-25 01:12:01,57,dataengineering,t3_1rdv80s,False,

o6ndz6i,"I don’t know the nuances of your situation, but here’s my two cents. Your manager has likely built his career and secured his position by, as you say it, running the corporate playbook. He is in meetings you are not in and has access and built in authority in a way that you do not. This gives managers a natural political advantage over their ICs - so you need to tread carefully. I would not risk overplaying your hand by going to the CTO to break out from under him unless there is a clear business need you can point to - even then this is even harder without your manager on side. I’ve worked with managers like this before, yes they suck to work with. But judging on your post and responses I think it’s very likely that your manager has marked you as someone to keep an eye on and plan against. You’ve tipped your hand by openly having conflict with them. A coup at this point will fail. This person hasn’t made it to this point just to let an IC who wants to do things their way ruin their career. If you go to your CTO and effectively say “I can’t work with this guy because he doesn’t let me operate the way I want to”, what would your CTO say? You need a better way of framing it. Also you only get one shot to pull the “change things or I’m leaving” card and you better have an offer in hand that you’d be ok taking if things didn’t go your way.",pawtherhood89,2026-02-21 19:22:20,15,dataengineering,t3_1rancoy,False,

They don't really care about new customers or cost savings, that's just how they control and direct underlings what to do. The only thing they care about is how they can directly steal even more from the company for themselves. So the only real option, as always, is to find another job.

Being dependent on a single engineer is his nightmare. You think you can take this to the cto because he smiled at you and said good work a couple of times. That’s not the case. If you wish to stay at your current place, you should stop the open conflict with your manager. Continue putting out great work, making sure you get the credit and the cto sees it. Eventually there will be an opportunity to move, either vertically or laterally. But don’t hold your breath, people like your manager often stay with a company for a long time. You’re stuck with him (and he’s with you). Your best chance is leaving while you’re ahead and have something to show for your time spent here.

Those being proper orchestrators (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect to name a few), transformation systems (Spark/Ray, Warehouses, etc), and if you wanted to, 'accessory systems' like Kafka and vector extensions to common DBs since you mentioned Postgres and ML/AI. To be clear, I don't think you ever need all of them. Each shop has, unfortunately in many cases, so many options that you'll be unable to really cover everything. If you did, say, an example of streaming some mock data (or real if you can get it) into Kafka and using the operators in Airflow to do some light filtering and dropping that in like TimescaleDB (a PG extension for time series), you'll have enough to go on to speak about the topics of orchestration, real time workflows, and useful DB system choices if you spend the time!On the other hand you mentioned the transition from Orchestrating ML workflows as a DE to going to creational ML workflows as an MLE. I don't think the transition is impossible, but I will say it's difficult. When I/my company looked for MLEs we specifically waited for very skilled candidates. Many applicants were trying to make the same transition you're mentioning but the reality is the skills are harder to obtain or practice on your own than SWE or DE skills. Hell I positioned myself to at least cross-train for it to fill the gap while we waited, but I was ultimately turned down. That's all anecdotal. MLE is a bit of a hot job right now, so you will definitely have competition up and down the skill spectrum and there are only so many positions to go around.

We have BQ and I've used PG/MySQL/Maria/SQL Server/Oracle/... so can probably help.Data types and nullability are concerns you'll need to learn and handle properly with any columnar DB, but there are also DB settings around nulls you should apply so that you don't end up with reports showing 0 where they should be null or logic that has to test for '' rather than null in a string. Data types between any two pieces of software typically require a map, so that shouldn't be a distinct concern. DDLs are a bit different e.g. `LowCardinality(Nullable(String))` but after thirty minutes of learning this should be second nature.Joins - there are many types and you should learn about the different ones e.g. left anti join, any join, global left join. If you build outputs with many (10+) joins or you join on functions you'll find the performance isn't great, but that's more of a design issue - design to (left) join on UInt64 fields. The weirdest thing to get your head around is that join order matters, which is bizarre if you're used to a query execution planner doing this for you. For heavy queries expect to specify the join engine and a few parameters to get things running just right - an LLM can give you a starting point and tuning tests, so not too hard.Table engines - Used properly this can speed things up massively and convey intent - the Set engine, for example is a great way to check if a value is good / bad without an additional join and operates near instantly.Primary Keys - not really a thing here, instead you have order by. There are table engines which should apply the primary key, but it's better if your logic sets this to be the case rather than relying on the engine itself. Expect to footgun yourself at least once here.SCD2s - can be challenge - ASOF LEFT JOIN is great in principle, but if you have a list of preferred suppliers stored as an SCD2 you'll need to order by supplier id and valid from and add a 'future' non-preferred record so that transactions after the end data don't continue to return 'preferred'Syntax: - argMax and various array functions are excellent and Claude is great at writing them - being able to refer to results from the same select can really cut down the CTE chain - if you're running on a cluster or with multi-client and orchestration, the boilerplate can get a bit OTT, but that's true for competitors tooMemory use - All columnar databases love to eat memory, expect to have nodes with 128GB+ if you've got a few tens of millions of rows of wide data.ClickPipes - not used this.",Little_Kitty,2026-02-25 13:12:21,13,dataengineering,t3_1re8djt,False,

Learning airflow, k8s, dimension modeling, lakehouse modeling, kafka, cdc, elasticsearch and many more tools would be the key factor of understanding big picture. I am not saying learn Kafka in details but learn how any message queue can be used in pipelines. Similar for other technologies. After collecting different small pieces and understanding how they operate in a system, you can move to more detailed topics like how can you use flink to distribute/optimize the ingestion pipeline etc. For experience, if you can build and manage a living system, you can implement it anywhere in company. e.g ingest some data to data warehouse, create reports with scheduled queries and deploy it on a server. If you can learn and able to show how you did these things properly in interview it means that you are getting somewhere. Imagine you started working in a big enterprise company and you have a database table and you need to show some reports on the data.

But if you are running this query only once in a single session, you are simply moving the shuffle one row above so it won't help much.If this is a recurrent query that runs every day, every hour, etc. I would suggest physically bucketing the data on disk before doing any join or filtering. Spark should be able to read the raw data, bucket it once and keep it like that for further runs. But I don't know all the details of your architecture so I'm not sure if this would be viable in your setup. Speaking of joins, do you know if it is guaranteed that one of the two views can fit into a single partition in memory? In that case, you can force a broadcast join to avoid a shuffle join, but this is only in the cases where you know more about your data than the catalyst optimizer, so to speak.

o6sj510,"Hi, I work at LanceDB but want to add a bit of detail here. Lance's file format is versioned, with the current default version being 2.0. 2.1 is already out there and is going to be the default soon, and 2.2 is also implemented and in the testing phase. The choice of file format used can impact the level of compression and performance you see, as the format is continually being improved.Re: performance, the F3 paper ([https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf)) shows numbers comparing Lance vs. other file formats and this is a good source of information (outside of the LanceDB team) in terms of scan and random access throughput (it shows that Lance is the fastest). The compression ratio shown in the paper is the worst, but the paper benchmarked against an old version of Lance (pre 2.0).From a roadmap perspective, Lance file format 2.2 that will come out soon has significantly more compression algorithms implemented, with some performance improvements as well. So more numbers will be published soon once that's out.Re: your performance observations, a) the version of the file format used matter, and b) the data types may not have the best compression ratios for that file version used. In LanceDB's internal suite, we regularly test against these modalities: long-form text, images and video blobs. For these cases, the write amplification in Parquet due to row groups is significant (which is the reason Lance was created in the first place). That said, even for conventional tabular data types (floats, booleans, etc.), Lance should perform on par with or better than Parquet, no matter the scale of the dataset. If you're getting sufficient performance out of Parquet, then well and good, in the end, what works best in practice is all that's needed!",laminarflow027,2026-02-22 16:11:20,8,dataengineering,t3_1rbcjqu,False,

The gap between what is documented & what is actually used, is a massive headache, so your head is in the exact right place.u/Johnlee01223 is totally right about the complexity, though, building a custom usage graph means parsing millions of messy SQL queries. It turns into an edge case nightmare real quick, and parsing all those logs at scale can easily nuke your warehouse compute budget.tbh, to save you from reinventing the wheel, DataHub actually has this built in natively. It hooks directly into BigQuery (`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`) or Snowflake (`QUERY_HISTORY`) and automatically translates those raw logs into the usage graph you're prototyping, mapping out column level lineage, real join relationships, and showing exactly who is querying what.To keep the compute overhead low, we use server side query pushdowns to filter out high volume bot or service account traffic before it ever hits the parser.If you're curious how the architecture works or what the output looks like, check this quick breakdown [Dataset Usage & Query History docs](https://docs.datahub.com/docs/features/dataset-usage-and-query-history).btw, which warehouse are you testing your prototype on right now?

On top of that, every tool interprets queries differently, since each has its own parsing logic and assumptions. Unless you have the first-hand control over the execution engine itself, extracting things like:* Column usage and aliasestypically means parsing user-written input (i.e SQL query) which comes with countless edge cases. So the solution you're coming up ideally has to be something that can be plugged into the compute engine itself .i.e. OpenLineage is taking this approach for collecting lineage information by integrating directly with various compute engines rather than relying solely on query parsing.I would say go for it and no one had a good solution for it yet afaik. Ultimately, the value comes down to what kind of usage graph you're building and how it leads to actionable insights.

But it can be fun to dive in, and play Sherlock Holmes.I would start simple, and forget about the 350+ pipelines. Start by diving into the easy places to get a head start and list all the problems you've found to kind of semi-cover your ass and set expectations:* Sporadic errors* Data loss on type conversions, * Lineage tool needs to fed better data or it is useless for this purpose.I would write something up, saying that the first 2 points must be fixed in order to get reliable result and success. How far have you found the first 2 points in your flow? If it is near the end, get some colleague to focus on fixing this, while you audit numbers earlier in the pipeline. Get someone else to fix it anyway, you focus on auditing data at other places.The 3rd point about lineage tool is not relevant yet. If you don't find a few clear errors that fixes stuff down the line, and you must go detailed through almost all flows as your last resort, the lineage tool *must* be improved and to be relied on. That is probably probably not a small task in itself, and there's likely a reason it is superficially setup as is.As for the actual data hunt; you most likely have already done so, but compare the 2 curated tables. If they are identical you know to whether to go forward or backwards in your flows for errors. If you need to go back in your flows, make an audit somewhere in the middle between the source and curated tables of going backwards. Does data match, does transformations makes sense. Then you do the same, figure out if you need to go forward/backward again. Audit somewhere in the middle again so you don't go through all steps. Break down your audit spots, and focus on 2 to 5 KPI's and the data they rely on. Document your code to easily reproduce the check at different spots for that part of the data, so you can show others.And make those others quickly check you're on the right path, and that they agree you compare the proper data, so a misunderstanding does not lead astray.Depending on urgency and resources available, I would show findings and clearly point out, that it doesn't make sense to compare and audit those KPI's if you can't trust the data in the first place. Suggest a plan, split up the tasks. Whether you are solo or can get help from team mates, don't do a bit of data loss fix, and then some audit, and then some check on sporadic errors, back and forth, etc. In all 3 tasks there's a bunch of rabbit holes to dive into, and I at least had trouble keeping a mental overview on the project itself and its progress while jumping from rabbit hole to rabbit hole. Almost fixing almost all problems at once, so the puzzle pieces suddenly match perfect at the same time hasn't happened for me, at least. And it sounded like a simpler setup than yours. Now it became quite long, TL;DR, break stuff down, audit certain data for certain KPI's midway though the flow, and midway from last checkpoint, etc. Focus on specifics tasks, don't do everything at the same time, and then you've got this, as long as you don't let yourself get bullied on timelines.

Before you worry about tools like Burp Suite, the single most valuable thing you can do is build a rock-solid mental model of how software actually executes. I'd seriously recommend working through CMU's Bomb Lab and Attack Lab (both freely available — just search ""CMU bomb lab"" and ""CMU attack lab"" and you'll find the assignments plus tons of writeups from students who've completed them). Bomb Lab teaches you to reverse engineer a binary using GDB and disassembly, figuring out what inputs defuse each ""phase"" of a bomb. Attack Lab goes further and has you actually craft buffer overflow exploits, including code injection and return-oriented programming. These aren't theoretical exercises — they're teaching you the exact thought process security researchers use: read the code or binary, understand the expected behavior, then ask ""what happens if I send something the developer didn't anticipate?""Once you've internalized that mindset, the web security stuff you're learning (endpoints, parameters, open redirects) starts to click because you realize it's the same pattern at a different layer. A security researcher looking at a web app is doing the same thing you do in Attack Lab — tracing how input flows through the system and finding the spot where untrusted data gets used in a way the developer didn't account for. Tools just automate parts of that process; the skill is in knowing what to look for and why.

Altogether, your line reads like this: button1.setOnAction( // when button1 is clicked, MouseEvent -> { // run the following code: button2.setVisible(true) // make button2 visible } );If you want to dig more into the details, i unironically recommend asking an LLM for two. although they can hallucinate, in my experience they are *very* useful for exploring popular, well-known, well-documented technologies like java. good luck!oh, one last thing -- the `` are what's called ""generics"" and they let you write code that's much more flexible than you'd be able to without them. very very useful stuff, but a little hard to explain in a couple sentences \^\^",fuckkkkq,2026-02-27 02:50:37,1,learnprogramming,t1_o7mpcb7,False,

Once those feel comfortable rich by Will McGuire is worth looking at just to see how someone writes genuinely elegant Python with good separation of concerns.

So SPF was silently failing for ALL outbound email, not just marketing.The worst part was nobody noticed for weeks because the emails that failed SPF still had valid DKIM, so most providers delivered them anyway -- except Gmail, which had started enforcing DMARC alignment more strictly. And of course Gmail was like 60% of our user base.The show original trick in Gmail is genuinely the single most useful debugging tool for this. I also learned the hard way to set up a DMARC policy with rua reporting from day one, even if it is just p=none. Having those aggregate reports would have caught the SPF overflow within the first weekly digest instead of waiting for user complaints to pile up.One thing I would add to your list: if you are using a subdomain for transactional email (like mail.yourdomain.com), make sure that subdomain has its own DMARC record.

I mean, if you're interested in software development, did you seriously *wait* to start doing it until college? I started with BASIC on the Commodore 64 when I was 12 years old. Switched to C at around 17 years old. In college, I had to show our *teacher* how to implement linked lists (not because I was good, but because he was inexperienced with C). Sure, there were things I learned in college which I probably wouldn't have learned otherwise - or at least not as soon - for example, SQL, and other things which I found boring. But all the advanced stuff I learned on my own, because I wasn't going to sit around waiting for college to finally get around to teaching the stuff I was interested in.So, yes! You can definitely learn software development as a hobby only. I know things are more complex now than when I was in school, but on the other hand there are so much more resources available for free now. Back in the 90's when I got started, while the net was around, there wasn't as much content as there is now. For most things I wanted to learn, I'd order an O'Reilly book. You don't have to do that anymore.Here's what I would do if I were you. Do some tutorials, but don't *only* do tutorials. Find something simple to build - something you *want* to build. And I do mean simple - really simple at first. I started with text games like ""Guess my number"" - ""Your guess is too high, try again"", and so on. You don't need graphics. Just find something that interests you.And when you get stuck - google it, ask an AI - not to do it for you, but to *teach* you how to do it - or come here, and ask us. Since you're not trying to do this professionally, only because it's fun, you don't have to stress about it. Just have fun with it.Good luck!",Enfors,2026-02-23 10:10:47,5,learnprogramming,t3_1rcckz6,False,

o7pswqk,"> I do have one or two senior developers I reach out to occasionally, but they’re very busy and I try not to bug them.I struggle with this as well, but to be honest, you just have to ask. Don’t be worried about bugging them, worst case they’re annoyed but they’ve got bigger stuff to worry about so they’ll survive. Best case, they’re happy to help, worst case, they forget about it in a day or two. As long as you’re not asking them to fix it for you, but to guide you to the solution and to help you better understand the problem, they shouldn’t complain.I don’t know what Axios, or interceptors are, but it sounds like your API key is rotating because you’re getting an auth Bearer token.In Bruno, you probably have an API refresh key that you’ve configured. This is your credential to the service, and it’s only used to request a bearer token, a temporary api token with privileges to the other endpoints in the API.It sounds like you’re copying the bearer token from Bruno into your application. Bruno is just an API client, so all its doing is sending an HTTP request (i.e GET/POST) and returning the results. Instead of fetching a bearer token manually in Bruno, you can change your code to send the api request that fetches your bearer token for you, process the response to extract the token, and then use the newly retrieved bearer token to fetch data from the other API endpoints.DO NOT HARD CODE YOUR API REFRESH TOKEN, you’ll need to use environment variables or a secret manager to fetch this in a secure manner.To sum it all up, add some code to use your refresh token in an http request to fetch a bearer, and use that bearer for your other api calls. If the calls that use your bearer token return an UNAUTHORIZED response (likely 403 status code, and it should include a message saying that the token is invalid or whatever), you know you need to request a new one, so call the code that uses your refresh token to request a new bearer.Hope this helps.

Today I had to figure out why a system that is expected to check the uptime of our service is sending empty notifications. Where is the text?3)I review the code that my team mates wrote. Code review. To catch some nonsense. To turn attention to some missing business cases. To suggest some improvements. etc.4)I do technical analysis and help our business analyst. He does not write the code. Reading code is difficult for him. So, he comes with his less-IT-questions to me and I provide answers to him. For new tasks for us to work on.5)I improve our infrastructure. Like this uptime checking service I mentioned in 2). Today I set it up because otherwise it would be more difficult for us to know when something just does not work at all.6)Attend meetings. May it be discussing new tasks, discussing some big problem in production environment, discussing team events, or something else.7)Write documentation. Not comments in the code but documentation for the business people for them to know how the stuff works and what it does.8)Do technical analysis for new projects.

o6kf2es,"Have you tried using a fake instead of a mock?As an example, let's suppose you're mocking a storage layer, where your main class saves data. You unit test a function and you assert that when you tell it to do a series of operations and then save, it should write A, B, and then C to the storage layer.Now you change the code around and it outputs C, B, and then A to the storage layer. Your test fails because the mock was expecting calls in a specific order. Or maybe it's more complex, like now it write A and B in one transaction and then C in another transaction.It can be really hard to express in a mocking framework the idea that A, B, and C need to be saved, but the order and number of calls doesn't matter.So instead, write a ""fake"". A fake is a tiny, trivial implementation of the storage layer's interfaec, maybe it just keeps track of the objects that were saved in a HashMap or a sorted list.Instead of asserting that certain methods were called in a certain order, have your method write to the fake storage layer, then fetch the list of things written to the fake storage layer and assert that A, B, and C are in them.Now your code asserts that the end result is correct without being nearly as tightly coupled to the implementation details.

o6miqvi,"I have done many lectures on this subject, which are difficult to summarize in a Reddit comment, but I'll do my best.**What to test**Each unit of code has a contract. Input: it expects specific parameters of certain types and/or a specific starting state. Output: it returns a specific type and/or changes states. When choosing what to test, you want to test only public methods, whose contracts are not expected to change frequently. Do not test private methods directly unless they contain something particularly complicated. In that case, try to refactor the complicated bits into separate pure functions to reduce churn during later refactoring.You also want to design and edit your code in a way that avoids changing contracts unnecessarily. For example, add new parameters to the end of the list and make them optional, preserving the previous behavior in which they did not exist.If you find your contracts changing all the time, this is a problem with your code design. Not only does it make unit tests fragile, it makes coordination with other people and new features far more difficult than it needs to be. Read up on clean code strategies and code architectural patterns. **How to test**The most common issue I see in fragile tests is allowing state changes to fall through from test to test. You must start and stop every test at a neutral baseline state, not allowing tests to affect each other. Every test should be able to run by itself or in any random order compared to other tests. In fact, there are many test frameworks that provide a randomized run feature to help you find and prevent this form of fragility.To do unit testing correctly with non-pure functions, you must make sure to create fixtures, which are state controls. Before each test, your fixtures set up the correct state. After each test, you tear down those fixtures back to a neutral baseline. Do this using the test framework's built-in services. In class format, these are often methods named like setUp and tearDown. In spec format, they are named like beforeEach and afterEach.Each test has the following pattern:1. Set up fixtures, mocks, fakes2. If state may change, assert beginning state3. Call the function under test4. Assert returns if applicable 5. Assert state change if applicable6. Assert mocks/fakes were called as expected, including the expected parameters passed in7. Tear down fixtures, mocks, fakes",Beka_Cooper,2026-02-21 16:46:55,1,learnprogramming,t3_1rakpui,False,

I used to have the same issue until I stopped over-mocking everything.One thing that helped a lot (tested this recently with GLM-4.7 while refactoring a medium project) was focusing tests strictly on observable behavior, inputs + outputs and mocking only true external boundaries (DB, API, filesystem).",Hot-Butterscotch2711,2026-02-23 13:46:35,1,learnprogramming,t3_1rakpui,False,

So, one can only check that once the function has been called, the data has indeed been stored. ""This function saves the data from the given data array in atomic write operations for each element of the array from first element to last element"" as interface contract describes a different behavior to check for - here the order and amount of calls to storage indeed matters.

o74t53x,"In fact, they aren't contradicting each other that much - it might seem like they do if you consider every function, every method, a part of the public interface, but that is not what they suggest.**Philosophy** (for short) suggests that *modules* should be deep - meaning that the public interface to ""something"" is very simple, and hides a lot of complexity underneath. It doesn't mean that everything should be inside the same function from a programming language perspective, but that the user of that module shouldn't be concerned about the underlying functionality. Think of private methods, or unexported functions - you can still have lots of these.**Grokking** takes a more ""inside-out"" look at code, where Philosophy assumes that you are designing something for other programmers to use, Grokking assumes that you are in the midst of building something complicated, and have to make sure that you yourself understands it. And of course you should build it with as small functions as possible - ensuring that each function only operates at a single level of abstraction.I'm not to sure about the parameter passing - it's been a bit long since I read either, so I'm not sure what exactly they are saying. But generally, receiving parameters or objects simply to send them on to other functions is considered somewhat bad design - but of course, if you want a deep module you'd have some ""facade""-functions that receive everything, but doesn't really do anything about it.My personal take on this is to consider whether a function is a ""worker"" or a ""delegator"" (my own nomenclature) and divide functions into those who do stuff, and those who just sends work on to a number of other functions. But if any function only calls a single other function - that might be a sign of bad design. Anyways - as always, these kind of suggestions are always suggestions, not hard and fast rules.

Whether you agree with one or the other book depends on your coding style your mental model of how the code works.I haven't read the books so i don't want to talk all that much about the exact points where they contradict but i am sure that if both authors talked to each other they would agree in many areas. From the limited summary you provided i get this impression from the authors. Both authors want to structure their code in such a way that allows them to understand their code better.Ousterhout does this by creating strong modules in such a way that you only have to use the module and dont have to understand its internals. This essentially lets you ignore large part of the codebase because you just use the module.Normand does this by making very clear where change happens and what change happens. This allows you trace through the code better because you can disregard those places that don't interest you right now.Both sound like good advice to me. You don't have to exclusively pick one and stick with it. Try one out and see how you feel about it and make up your own mind. Personally, after writing a lot of Rust the Normand approach sounds much more appealing to mean than large modules, but sometimes a large module is the way to go.One think i would like to point out where i strongly disagree with Ousterhout. If you have a function with a lot of parameters, i agree that turning those parameters into objects doesnt help. All it does is that it wraps up the parameters into a slight easier to work with package. Functionally the function still has the same amount of parameters. Here is the part where i disagree; Placing those parameters into a global context doesn't help for exactly the same reason. How you have a function with a bunch of effectively global variables and all the downsides that brings. If you want to reduce the amount of parameters you have to actually reduce the amount of parameters. One way to do that is to do what Normand tells you to do.PS: Great question",Psychoscattman,2026-02-24 14:16:51,2,learnprogramming,t3_1rdg2fh,False,

The idea there being, you don’t actually have to remember all the details of all the functions, you’ll simply know what they all do from a quick glance at the code. — The thing about these conflicting or seemingly conflicting advice is that they all come from a context which includes the authors entire personal background and the situations they’ve contended with, it’s possible you’ll never contend with the same kind of situation, and it’s possible that you’ll contend with “mutually incompatible” situations inside the same code base.

A similar book I can recommend is [Data-Oriented Programming](https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming), which is also about how Clojure does things, but with examples in other languages. Clojure was desinged very deliberately by Rich Hickey as a reaction to the problems of C++/Java OOP. Hickey's various talks go into more detail about his philosophy for Clojure.In Clojure, we just use (immutable) maps for most things. Keys in Clojure's maps are considered more fundamental than the mere aggregation of them, and can have a namespace independent of the map they happen to be contained in.Many Clojure functions accept and return a map. They may update a subset of the keys they care about and pass on the rest. You can test and understand these functions with just the subset, but easily compose them with functions that use a different subset. Clojure also uses ""global"" (albeit namespaced) objects for program state, but typically only a small number of them.

o74f8h3,"This is gonna sound even more demotivating at first so sorry.... what you're struggling with right now and what AI is obviously pretty good at... is literally the easiest part of a programmers job. ""Coding"" is truly not in any way the majority of the process of coding, or a programmers job at all. If i was told tomorrow that AI is eliminating any coding my job requires writing by hand because they added magic and it now can perfectly output code, than I wouldnt worry at all. Even if in the future all we do is read code given to us by AI and fix bugs, then my ability to code makes me uniquely suited for doing exactly that over someone who only has ever used AI. And they will never invent an AI that can take in a client's requests and create their dream program, because clients are literally the dumbest people on earth and cant even describe what they want to human beings yet, and research on inventing the perfect client who doesnt change their mind after a feature is built or prioritize the complete wrong thing is lacking. As far as code is concerned, you need to practice and apply the concepts you learn, forget leet code and homework, you need to build a million small programs and do that a few hundred times, its just practice. I dont think ""ok i need to make a variable to hold a number, what was the keyword for that? Oh yeah, int, but the number is going to be a value of currency so I should use a float. Ok, now I now I want to multiply that 5 times. Whats the keyword that starts a loop? Oh yeah, for. So i need to take that variable, and type the word for. Then I need parenthesis, and inside the parenthesis need to define the starting point and I was taught to set that to 0 so Ill type that. Then I need to define where to stop looping so Ill take that first statement and set it less than 5, whoops I mean 4 because I started at 0. What was the last part of a for loop again? Oh yeah, thats how much the counter will increase so ill increase it by 1 each time. Now I cant forget to use the curly braces for my logic.......""Thats how you first start out, and likely will think for every new keyword and bit of syntax you learn when starting out. Many ""intermediates"" still code at a snails pace that way and are convinced that an AI being able to do that instantly is doom for the entire field. Advanced developers arent smarter than you, we've just written thousands of for loops and defined a billion variables through sheer repetition and practice. I think ""it need to hold the value of money here"" and my fingers define a float variable. I want performance some action on that variable 5 times and I dont even think about the syntax, I type it. Ive done it a million times, its dont have to remember the keyword ""for"" or where the curly brackets go. Not at all because Ive planned out in my head to do that, Im not nearly smart enough to think 5 whole seconds in the future. Im dumb as shit. But because Ive used the keywords, seen the patterns, and practiced over my career everyday, it just comes out without ever thinking of the syntax.Beginners think coding is just syntax m. Syntax is the easy part, and literally anyone can memorize the syntax of a language. If you can read this comment written in English, you're proof of that, but you have 2 decades of practicing English. If you understand the CONCEPT of something like a loop or defining a variable, you've done the hard part. The part that seems hard, and the part that AI is great at is the syntax, which requires practice and repetition. As far as your concerns over the field transforming by the time you graduate... I gotta laugh, cause this field always has been seeing constant drastic shifts. Many of us here could tell of a time before Zuckerberg and his demons released the plague that is React into the web dev world, and suddenly if you didnt know React than you weren't hireable as a front end developer (according to some)... that was 10 years ago. Think about that, a whole new language and technology became almost a requirement for many jobs a decade ago, that doesn't happen in most professions.Take it even further, Javascript didnt exist like 20 years ago, if you want to work in web and you dont know Javascript you're boned. Doctors dont learn new bones every 10 years, and lawyers may learn new laws, but your countries entire consimtitution likely doesnt see drastic changes very often during the course of a lawyers entire career. There are programmers alive today that use to write code on paper. The fact that something new comes along and you get to learn it is a feature of development, not something to freak out about. At the same time, during covid, developers who were masters of a language developed by cavemen as they fought off dinosaurs were paid extraordinary amounts of money to come out of retirement and update welfare systems in the US because their skills using COBOL was desperately needed and the number of people with that skill set is very small. The last Java job a few years ago I was brought in for was working on a major upgrade of a codebase all the way up to the new and fancy Java version 8. We are currently, today, are on something like Java 24... There are so many jobs out there that will not budget major upgrades, or their systems are too critical to allow risking downtime or potential user issues, and chugging forward without the latest and greatest stuff is what the people signing the paychecks have determined is the best route forward. Corporate jobs are not startups that require microsecond code optimizations and the newest database architecture at the risk of user downtime. Hell, there's programming jobs where intellectual property or government security clearances are required and your VPN or workplace may not even allow for internet access, let alone an AI assistant reading every line of code and doing who knows what with, and your resources are the language documentation and whatever else the previous devs left for you. And in a world where even those jobs all somehow disappear and AI takes over... ok...? Use the AI tools? You want to be a programmer and build stuff, thats why im a programmer. If a client was going to pay me a ton of money to program an app, and that ""app"" was a sandwich, i wouldnt use Java, id use bread and turkey, and maybe a knife. Code is just a tool you use as a developer, if the project pays well and requires Java, ill use Java. If it pays well and uses French, I'll use French. What does it matter?

The overwhelm usually comes from trying to optimize the perfect path instead of just building something imperfect.About AI, it is changing things, but it mostly shifts the leverage, not the need for people who understand systems and problem solving.

It’s frustrating because I really want to build projects, create things, and deploy them… but I feel stuck when it’s time to actually begin. Is this normal in the beginning? How did you get past that stage?TLDR: Write it down. This is normal in any creative process. It's called writer's block. What I do to get past it is to write a one paragraph ""scope"" statement. This is a general description of the problem that I am trying to solve. It's important to write it because even if you think you understand things completely, you will often find there are details about the scope that you haven't clarified yet. Writing it down makes you confront the details.Once you have the scope clearly articulated and you better understand the problem, start writing your psuedocode; just a list of steps to get there. Each step will have sub-steps, but don't focus on them yet because you will overwhelm yourself. It always helps to define things generally before jumping into the details ( I think it has to do with the way the brain structures information, but that's a different topic). If you do get lost in the details, you can just back up to your scope statement and you will find that there is something that perhaps you didn't define as well as you originally thought.

On this journey, you will constantly be learning, and honestly you're probably always going to feel like ""something is missing"". I've been programming for like 7 years now and I still always feel like a dummy.Unfortunately, there isn't really a checklist of things to know, and once you complete that checklist, you're considered a ""good programmer"".The reality is, if you want to be a good programmer, you have to actually build stuff. By doing that, you'll start to to understand what works and what doesn't. And when I say build stuff, I mean doing it on your own as much as you can. Avoid following tutorials and using AI to help you - take the time to actually break down and solve problems on your own. It will be uncomfortable, but stick with it! It gets better over time. And that's what makes good programmers - those that can break down and solve problems, not those with encyclopedic knowledge of different design patterns or frameworks.Now having said that, I think it can be useful to supplement your journey with theory. There are plenty of resources out there for learning the most common design patterns, data structures, and algorithms. I think its important to familiarize yourself with them, know what they are and when to use them, but don't dwell on that stuff too much. You will learn far more actually building stuff.So if I were you, I would try to think of something interesting to you and try to build that - maybe a game, website, or an app. It doesn't have to be something unique either; trying to recreate apps or games you enjoy is a fantastic exercise.

o73unwh,Yes you are exactly right and I can tell you from my own experience that many developers hit this same wall after a few years of working with frameworks. It is very common to feel like something is missing because libraries and frameworks only teach you how to use a tool but they do not teach you how to think about the structure of your software. When I first started working on larger systems I realized that knowing variables and loops is just the beginning and the real skill lies in making code that other people can actually read and maintain without getting a headache.​To bridge this gap you should focus on learning SOLID principles and common design patterns which act as a blueprint for solving recurring problems in a clean way. You should also look into unit testing and the concept of decoupling because these are the things that make your software scalable and prevent it from breaking every time you add a new feature. A very helpful way to learn this is to take one of your old projects and try to rewrite parts of it using these principles so you can see the difference for yourself. Moving from just making things work to making them maintainable is what truly marks the transition to becoming a high level developer.,More-Station-6365,2026-02-24 09:04:44,1,learnprogramming,t3_1rd9oso,False,

o7mrko4,"I took a look at your code in an editor and found a few things. There are a significant number of errors and warnings. The else (res != 0) block near the exit question doesn't work because else can't take a condition like that. You need to change it to else if (res != 0). Also, your strcpy calls for the username and password are backwards. strcpy goes (destination, source) , so right now you're overwriting the user's input with empty variables instead of the other way around. On top of that, your fprintf calls are missing the file pointer. You need fprintf(fp....) or it won't know where to write. The struct initializer on line 74 won't work either because you can't assign strings to char \[\] members that way in C. You have to declare the struct first and then use strcpy to fill in the string fields. Also your do..while loop has the condition flipped. You set programexit = 10 when the user wants to quit, but the loop says while (programexit == 10), which means it keeps going only when they're trying to leave. Should be while (programexit != 10).Additionally, the reason your program exits after creating an account instead of going back to the menu is because you have a break sitting right after the ""account set up complete"" message. That's telling the program to leave the entire loop, so it never gets a chance to show the menu again. There is also an issue with your file pointer. You open the file in write mode which overwrites the existing content. If your intent is to add more usersnames and passwords to the file without overwriting, you need to open in append mode 'a'. There are a few more issues to point out, but incorporating the changes from the first paragraph will at least get it running.One piece of advice: It looks like you wrote a lot of code before testing anything.

Others will say whenever the moon is red and mercury is in retrograde. My typical approach is ""whatever makes the code self-documenting""; if I am reading code and the intent of the function becomes unclear or disagrees with its function name, the function is likely either too long, doing too many things, difficult to test, unreadable, or unmaintainable. Not necessarily all 5, but still. If I start thinking ""oh, I should add a code comment here"" I first ask if it should be a function, allowing the function name to describe intent instead of a comment. If I start copy-pasting code in many places, I start asking if it should be a function so that the code within that function can be understood once rather than in each location. If my function is 400 lines, I might (not always) think making it a 40 line function that makes descriptive calls to other functions is more readable (sometimes it won't). If I go to test my function and part of it is a pain to cover, moving that difficult-to-cover chunk to its own unit makes testing both functions easier.With practice, you'll get a better feel for when something should be its own thing.

Then whoever reads your code reads the function names and doesn't have to read code to understand what you are doing The general idea is to have 3 layers inside your file.

This is called the ""DRY"" principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). This centralizes logic that improves both maintainability and testability.**2. Concept extraction:**Extract code that represents a single step you could describe with a short comment. Example: # Huge block or multiple blocks of code to register a user ... ...As this code performs and clearly definable task, we can improve the structure and readability by bringing it together in a function: def register_user(user): ...But then we look at what that function does, we see that it does multiple things: # big block of validation logic # big block of password hashing # big block of database insert # big block of email sendingHere we have 4 blocks of code, each of which could be written as functions, which makes the logic more readable than one huge block of code. def register_user(user) validate_user(user) hash_password(user) db_insert(user) notify_admin()---**Category B - Treating Functions as Values:**This is conceptually different from the other two, and mostly applies to more advanced code, so I'll only mention it briefly for completeness.Sometimes we need to treat functions as first class values, where the value represents a behaviour. A common example is when binding behaviours to button presses we may pass a function object as an argument.Here's a Tkinter example: button = tk.Button(root, text=""Click Me"", command=function_to_run)In this example, the function isn't extracted for readability, it's because the API requires a callable.Other examples include closures, decorators, async tasks and more.---A final note about ""not overdoing it"".Functions are mostly about reducing complexity - they are a means rather than a goal. Avoid extracting trivial one-line wrappers that add no clarity or reuse, (unless required, for example by an API).Bad Example: def print_result(result): print(result)This adds an extra layer of indirection without improving readability, reducing duplication, or creating a meaningful abstraction.However there can be cases where wrapping a one-liner is justified. for example:Suppose you have this one-liner scattered in your code: if user.age >= 18 and user.email_verified: ...then we can wrap the condition into a function: def is_eligible(user): return user.age >= 18 and user.email_verifiedthen use it in each place that it is needed: if is_eligible(user): ...This is a good application of ""DRY"".",JamzTyson,2026-02-24 10:12:21,2,learnprogramming,t3_1rd90v9,False,

I’m pretty solid with Python, but I’m not good with flask or SQLite, which is something I need at the moment. So I need a lot of help in that area along with building a web UI. My main problem with using AI is that AI isn’t really good for niche, edge-case applications. So I spend more time prototyping so I can capture the logic of what I want to do at every step along the way before writing the prompt. The flask route seems really straightforward to me, but I have to connect overything over HTML, JS, and CSS. For me, AI has really democratized programming and allowed me to do things I couldn’t do before. I can get stuff done and still learn as I go. AI hasn’t been all that helpful in troubleshooting. My personal rule is AI has three chances to get something right.

Treat the models like an interactive version of Stack Overflow that won't be snarky and lock your questions.As long as you are internalising the knowledge through actual practice writing code, then LLMs are just another tool you can use. Don't ever ask them to implement features for you. Use them as tools to get instant feedback on the code you write and your understanding of concepts. Also remember they can be stupid and wrong!

Getting a job is a simple process to them.The weaker engineers who want to get a job, cruise, hope for an easy paycheck, can't contribute to technical discussions well, and feel entitled to a job because they have 8 years on the job? They will not survive without reflection and adjustments.But now the average senior engineers are in a new market. During the COVID mass hirings they were golden, they were in the ""good"" half by default. You could get the job done and that was great. Unfortunately, the bar has been raised where that's no longer the case. You *need* to be a good engineer or by default you are a poor one.At my work, I have seen the engineers I loved working with get a new, higher paying role just because it fell on their plate in a LinkedIn message and they decided to go through the process, nail it in 3 weeks, and put in their 2 weeks notice shortly after. Similarly, I have seen the engineers I detest working with, constantly argue and are not fun to be around, make the same mistakes constantly, etc. complain about how the market is dead and they can't find a new position anywhere.Who you are and where you fall in these categories is really up to you. I think if you are a senior engineer, you have the resources all available to be a good hire.

It does seem to be loosely correlated with how structured their processes are because if different people are making decisions than doing the implementation, process will generally be necessary to facilitate the coordination. The most obvious marker of this in my experience is the number of PMs or BAs or whatever they call them.

My productivity has gone up maybe 30% because I can accomplish boring, boilerplate tasks near instantly. That has not changed in like 2 years, and I’m trying my hardest to automate my job away but the technology is just underwhelming at anything outside of unit tests. Finance bros realize billions have been thrown in a money pit, bubble pops, recession. FAANG scoops up all of the failed AI companies, drives cost down with scale and in ~10 years we get a permanent 30% buff to productivity with consumer grade AI. 2. I’m completely wrong, AI goes exponential, we all lose our jobs. Then what? You’re smoking fine crack if you think that means utopia. Wealth gap increases exponentially, daily life implodes for 99.99% of humans. Societal collapse, anarchy, who knows? Yes I’m paranoid but genuinely how else do you think it’s gonna go? No middle class = no revenue for corporations = no revenue for blue collar workers = economy ceases to existScenario 1 is most likely. I’m friends with a lot of people in finance. Just hearing them talk about AI and what they think it is… mind boggling. Smart guys all of them but makes total sense how OpenAI exists as a corporation. In this scenario, maybe I lose my job maybe I don’t. It’ll probably be as bad as 2008, but I don’t think much worse. I’ll bounce back. If Scenario 2, nothing matters expect my immediate needs.

o7jgktc,"> If AI makes sloppy code now, what is stopping it from making good code in 5 - 10 years? What is stopping it from having the ability to check its own work and factor in countless variables that even humans struggle to think of? Couple of things about that1. We're approaching a plateau of what LLMs are capable of. They might be able to refine training data or build guard rails around existing tech to make it better, but throwing compute at the existing models is not showing the same ""line goes up and to the right"" growth from brute forcing the power. This plateau has some of the smaller companies without other sources of revenue like OpenAI absolutely shitting their pants. They do not have a business strategy beyond ""keep brute forcing it and hope it works out""2. LLMs are great at common tasks with lots of examples, but really struggle in unique situations. Think ""big enterprise monolith unique to x company"". And these systems are hard for humans to understand. You can ask the LLM to do an impossible task. A human might come back and say ""hey boss this isn't possible with what we have, here's what we could do instead"". The LLM will charge ahead, delete important files, rewrite unrelated things, fail to complete the task but report a success anyway, because that's what it's been told to do. I've had this happen. My buddy at Amazon has seen two post mortems that were caused by Claude deleting AWS clusters from production.3. LLMs exacerbate the most important part of engineering, communication. Same Amazon friend is witnessing this first hand. A decision needs to be made about some upcoming work. He builds a design document that takes him 2 days to write and passes it to his manager. His manager has a bunch of questions, so he spends an extra day writing clarifications. His boss then uses AI to generate a shitty summary of his document and passes it to the director. The director has questions which the manager doesn't know because they didn't actually take the time to understand, so my friend has to meet with his manager and write more clarifications wich get summarized by AI etc. etc. you see where this has going. It's been a week and a half talking about work that could be completed in a day or two. You see this everywhere but LLMs are giving people an undue sense of understanding. It convinces you that you can do more by offloading your critical thinking to the chat bot. And you see this everywhere, in education, in engineering, in design, more content is being generated than ever, but for what purpose? It muddies the decision making chain and paralyzes people who just stop making their own cohesive thoughts to make decisions I think 3 is the most dangerous. Same Amazon org fired a bunch of engineers in the last layoffs and kept all the management. The director of the org is using AI to summarize hype pieces saying engineers shouldn't be writing any code themselves anymore and sending it out to all of his staff, em-dashes and emojis and all.So yeah. LLMs are increasing the amount of code that is being generated, but it's muddying the most important part of software engineering: building the *right* software, not the *most* software.",FriscoeHotsauce,2026-02-26 16:38:05,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1reyzy6,False,

Or whatever languages, you get the drift. And that's just the languages, there are insane numbers of frameworks and tech stacks to learn as well.So what I would recommend is: don't doom about it, adapt. Like geneerations of SWEs before you. The learning curve has always been quick. Figure out the areas where Codex and CC are deficient, and focus on upskilling in those areas. Maybe that means not being a SWE at all, that could be true.

Right now, everyone knows it is not as valuable as it is valued at, which is leading to the intense speculative bubble we're seeing. It is the belief in what it will do later that keeps the bubble so strong; if several PhD level papers come out showing we're not even close... that will probably kill the bubble.And of course, that probably won't happen for a while. The folks who would do such research are also largely funded by the people who need the bubble to continue.This is normal for an immature technology.

They're not firing their teams and replacing them with unproven AI. And at this point in time, it is looking more and more like AI usage just shifts the bottleneck further down the line rather than eliminates it (as far as automated programming goes).Since the changes it makes can be breaking and it has no accountability, a lot of devs are being forced into code review for thousands upon thousands of changes.

o7j0uj9,"No. 2008 great recession was caused by banks giving money to people who couldn't be trusted with money. When they then raised the rates to make payments almost double, for some odd reason these people couldn't pay their house payments. This cascaded the crash into banks having made bets that failed and lost enough money to make them go bankrupt. As such banks decided it was best to not lend money to anyone... which crashed businesses as well. You then add in that all this free money to people caused housing prices to spike, which then nosedived leaving banks with assets worth much less then the loans on it. You also had pension funds buy in on the banking bets, so when they collapsed the retirement savings of many also collapsed. And lastly you had insurance companies actually insuring these bets, then also collapsing. None of this is similar to the AI Hype. The 2000 Dot Com Bubble was lead by a whole new market appearing from nowhere. Before 95 most people had never heard of the internet and few had home computers. With cheap internet via AOL and cheaper computers people starting buying computer and going online en mass. With it came a lot of opportunities. You had companies like yahoo go from nobody to household names overnight. Everyone wanted in on it. You had people standing infront of college trying to find freshman CS majors begging them to work for them. You had a ton of money pouring in trying to start the next yahoo. It crashed and burned when people figured out that it wasn't profitable to sent dog food via mail. That you can't have 1000 clone sites that nobody goes to. Then the federal reserve did the unthinkable and raised their rates. This caused the 'free' money investors used to prop up the companies to dissapear. Anyone who wasn't already profitable no longer had money to borrow on cheap rates and went bankrupt. This again isn't like the AI Hype. Interest rates are already high. Only big tech companies are trying to make AI. This is more pushing AI as a productivity tool instead of opening new untapped markets of consumers. The AI Hype resembles much more the hype around 'Cloud' and 'Blockchain' and next 'Everything is a Service'. 2000 crash was about vaporware. 2008 was more about rot that killed the banks.

o7pl1bs,"Are you paraphrasing? Or are these literal quotes from your manager? Because they sound strange, like you're changing the language to make your manager sound worse than it was. Because there's *very reasonable* questions hidden behind all 3 of those bullet points.* I'm a SWE... budgets aren't my department. I can tell you how much infrastructure costs, I can tell you the tradeoffs in infrastructure costs if we sacrifice X, Y, and Z. All I do is present facts. It's the manager's job to choose which of the facts they like. And employee salaries is a manager's job, not mine. I could tell you how many man hours something will take, it's up to the manager to budget.* This is a very valid question. I have a side hustle that has a decent amount of DAU, and my infrastructure costs for a serverless architecture with a database are \~$60/month and it's lightning fast. I'm obviously not operating on a massive enterprise scale, but I have more users than a lot of shitty startups, and I rely on uptime for my money so it's very stable. So.... why is $50/month not enough? Is your scale too high? Is the code just inefficient? Too much tech debt? Is the architecture itself bad? *Explain it*. Lack of money does not always mean slow. The fact your manager doesn't know *why* your shit is slow is a sign there's a lack of communication between engineering and management. This is a red flag from *both* ends, the fact your manager never thought to ask until now, and the fact this was an issue engineering's never communicated upwards.* ""If your timeline is a day, we'd need to sacrifice X, Y, and Z to do a quick MVP. I can do that if you'd like. But to do this feature properly, I need X days because of A, B, and C. Up to you."". Again, this is a very valid question, it boils down to ""why would this feature take longer to build than I think it would?"". That's a pretty common question between management/product and engineers. It's our job to answer it.So none of those questions on their own would make me consider leaving.... their *responses* to my answers might, but the questions themselves are fair to ask.Edit:Missed the 4th, cause it wasn't a bullet, but to this:>Coding is easy it is just binary which is literally 0 and 1 so ship the code fast or i will ship you from employed to homeless.Go ahead. Fire me. See what happens to your timelines. Any half competent manager knows it takes time and money to replace a SWE. We're all replaceable, at a cost. So if speed is their concern, replacing me is the worst possible option.And if my manager's threatening to fire me, I'll let him. That relationship has already soured, and has nothing to do with the other 3 fair questions. I'll start looking on the side. I wouldn't quit. I'd continue putting in my 8 hours a day, no more, no less. I'd continue giving accurate estimates based on facts.",CapableHerring,2026-02-27 14:59:12,-1,cscareerquestions,t3_1rg4bzv,False,

Promotions from Associate to mid and mid to Senior require only a ""budget confirmation"" in business justification, there is a maximum amount we can spend on promotions each year. In my experience, we've never exceeded that budget so these promotions always pass their business justification.Starting with senior to staff, then staff to principal and principal to senior principal the business justification becomes stricter. Staff is defined as a role that works ""across teams"", usually within an org. Principal is inter-org work and sr. principal is company level work. We must justify why we need individuals operating in those roles. For Staff it's not too bad, we produce a list of they type of work and project work that requires tech/engineering focus aligning teams (usually building something global/working directly with internal customer teams etc etc).Principal and Sr. Principal things get much harder. There's really not that much work at that level. My org of 100 has one principal, who focuses on cross-org database work, and one principal who is working torwards sr. Principal by focusing on aligning our entire orgs tech with other org tech leads. I really have no need for more than that.I have about 10 Staff engineers however, some recently promoted into that role from Senior. (We do a lot of inter-team work/support). They are all told if they want to make principal, it is /unlikely/ they will get the role within our current org (we'd either have to double in size, not likely, or one of the two principals would have to leave and require a backfill).For those staff engineers that want to ""grow"" by title change I encourage my managers to do several things. First, keep a constant eye on opening roles in the company, anything principal they should consider having their staff report apply to it and be considered. Likewise there are some other career paths, such as engineering manager (if they want to stop focusing on being an Individual contributor) or even other leadership roles (technical program manager etc). And lastly, yes, it is not a crime if my managers support their staff engineers in their next career step outside the company (referrals, helping be a career mentor, assessing other jobs etc). All of this is to say, yes, at some point, a ""promotion"" must consider business need, and that business need should get harder the more senior the role is.

Now, early career, you can generally show ""yes, we need person at L+1, we expect our L to grow into that role"", but major career transitions (Senior, or Staff) generally require a business need.In many companies, this is actually hidden by the modern practice of retrospective promotion, where you promote people after they demonstrate a sustained performance of L+1. Since there was L+1 work for them to do to demonstrate that, it is a lot easier to demonstrate a need. But it is also normal for people to be in a position where there are no career growth opportunities for them on their current team, or even at their current company. After all, if the company has a CTO, and you are ready to take on a CTO role, you are probably going to have to leave. A good manager helps employees realize that and make that transition.Think about it this way, if you tried to open up a new headcount for a Senior or Staff level role, would you be able to justify it with the work your team has to do? If you could, you can make the case for a promotion.

If not, that’s just an honest assessment of the business’ needs.

Would you care if your employee was skilled enough to sell 100 vs 1000 apples? Probably not, right?
