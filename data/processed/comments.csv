nyrdulv,"Once you learn one data stack, the rest become much easier. It’s like your first programming language, hard at first, but after that, new languages (or tools) are mostly syntax and platform differences.In data engineering, the core problems never change:* Where is the data stored?* Where does compute run?* How do I move data or compute efficiently?* How do I model and serve the data?Whether it’s Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, or Spark-on-whatever, you’re solving the same underlying problems with different interfaces. Many “new” platforms are abstractions over familiar engines (Spark) anyway.Most content creators aren’t learning everything from scratch each time; they’re reapplying the same approach to new tools. Once you’ve done that a few times, picking up a new stack is a breeze. Also, free tiers and cheap cloud setups make experimentation easy. You don't have to break your bank to spin up a Spark cluster. I’ve worked across multiple stacks as a consultant, and my approach has stayed the same: understand data, compute, movement, and modelling.

Some candidates tried inviting an AI ""note taker"" to the Teams call, that was denied access and was an immediate red flag (not one of them \*asked\* if they could do so).We then had people who seemed to hesitate before answering any question. Once or twice, nerves, every single question? It's pointing the way of stalling before waiting to see the text appear for them to regurgitate! There's also the tell of the eye darting off screen to read something... could be notes, but... given what they then said, it just gave the impression of reading from either someone else googling on their behalf, or AI LLM output.But every single one was derailed by this one simple trick... as hiring manager, I was interviewing the person for them, not their technical skills. There was some of that, but more in approach and mentality, rather than specific abilities, that would come in the next round. So I would just say to the candidate ""You have listed these ETL tools on your CV, which is your favourite and why?""Every single time, the ones reading AI output would turn into a marketing bot, sounding like an advert for the tools, bullet point after bullet point. Not one of them highlighted a favourite without being asked again, and then couldn't actually answer definitively as to why they chose that above another, almost as if they'd just picked one at random. The humans answering that question would do so in a conversational manner, often immediately blurting out their favourite and then going through the pros and cons as to why.I can see the appeal of using AI to help, to act as a pointer to guide your answers, especially in areas of theory where you're rusty because you've been at the coalface for a while.

A lot of good data engineers started exactly where you are, analyst first, then thrown into DE work.Those two books are solid choices, especially The Data Warehouse Toolkit. That already puts you ahead of most people watching random YouTube playlists.A few practical suggestions that usually help in this transition First you should lean hard into SQL beyond analytics use. Window functions, performance thinking, indexing basics, and understanding how queries behave on larger tables matter way more in data engineering than fancy Python at the start.Second, focus on systems, not tools. You do not need to master every framework. Try to really understand things like how data moves from source to warehousebatch vs streaming at a conceptual levelidempotency, backfills, and schema changes If you get those ideas, tools become much easier to pick up later.Third, build small but realistic projects. Not Kaggle-style analytics, but things like:ingesting CSV or API data into a warehousetransforming it with SQLhandling schema changes or bad data Even simple pipelines teach more than watching videos. For courses on a budget, I would look at Data engineering content from freeCodeCamp and similar channels, but selectively, some Udemy courses can be decent if you wait for sales, just avoid anything that is purely tool-driven without explaining why things are doneCloud provider docs and tutorials can actually be very good once you know what to look for. since you are already doing DE tasks at work, that is huge.

nye4vip,"This depends a bit on what you're actually joining. How big (in GB) is your data? What about the distribution of your join keys? Are some of your joins skewed? Are there null values in your join keys (this is usually a problem that causes a lot of skew and performance issues)? How much data are you joining per row, as in what is the content of the columns you're joining (if this is big this also causes problems)? Are you increasing the number of rows with these joins? Also, what is actually failing when it does? Try to see what's going on using the Spark UI while it's running to see what's taking so long, or what's going wrong.I think repartitions and partitions will mess up your performance. Repartitions will be pointless because I think Spark will reshuffle with the next join anyway, and persists make it more difficult for Spark to optimize the entire plan and may take up space on memory / disk, which you may already be lacking.If column renaming seems to mess up your execution plan try to do all of the column remaining before the joins (so rename columns for each dataset first) and/or do all the renaming at the end. I don't see how your action plan would result in anything other than a bunch of BroadcastHashJoins with no shuffling in between this way, given all of the joins are joining small tables to a large table on the same unique ID.Also check how much memory each executor is using and how the data is distributed across your workers. If your data doesn't fit in your cluster's memory it will become very slow either way.All that said, if you're doing 27 joins on 820k rows with max 64 cores it might just take a long time either way.

Tools like AQE exist to reshape joins dynamically, but in practice they are not always enough, especially if Spark does not recognize your joins as equi joins.What changed the game for us was three things combined:* Using explicit broadcast hints instead of letting Spark guess, for example `broadcast(df_small)` Forces a BroadcastHashJoin rather than a nested loop join.* Reducing the logical plan spike by collapsing intermediate transformations. This means fewer repeated `.withColumn()` calls.* Using DataFlint’s plan diff tooling to see where broadcast dropped out.

Compile is what is probably eating OPs compute and time. Even then it's kinda crazy how much time it's taking for them. We have 5000+ models (with thousands of tests too) and it doesn't take that long for a full compile. Like 3-5 minutes. And that's including a lot of introspective adapter calls.I've also seen other folks manipulate the hash that dbt checks so it doesn't think it needs the full parse as an alternative workaround. It does need something like airflow to do it, given I'm on dbt cloud I can't.",ianitic,2026-01-08 03:27:22,3,dataengineering,t1_nybm2jk,False,

nyivemw,"I have made this kind of transition from analytics to data engineering, so here's my 2 cents:I'd say Designing Data-Intensive Applications would be a good book if you really want to learn some foundational stuff, especially if you already have somewhat of a comp sci background. I don't think this information is really a hard requirement for getting started though.Data engineering is just so incredibly broad. So much of your day to day job is dictated by what size company you end up applying at as well as the industry. For example, Kafka is a foundational piece of tech for a high percentage (forget the actual number) of fortune 500 companies. But it's also totally overkill for many smaller companies who may not need near-real-time analytics or near-real-time data processing.I'd say to become very comfortable with SQL (postgres and one data warehousing dialect such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery), Python, and dbt. While some may classify dbt as an ""Analytics Engineer"" tool, I think it's a great bridge between the worlds of data analyst and data engineering. Plus it's very common at companies of many different sizes.Then become comfortable with some form of orchestration tool such as Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, or some equivalent of those. For Airflow, there is a MWAA local runner docker image that might be useful for running a local version of Amazon's managed Airflow instance. Just search ""github MWAA local runner"" to find the repo which should have instructions. This is way easier and cheaper than running a real airflow instance.Maybe just read up on data ingestion tooling such as Airbyte, Fivetran, or Meltano, just to fill in that gap so you understand how transactional data gets loaded into a data warehouse (ELT is a good term to know/research).At that point, I'd say the knowledge you've acquired is transferrable to most tools that small to mid-sized companies would require (or at least desire) for an entry level data engineer position.Good luck!",chmod764,2026-01-09 02:38:31,7,dataengineering,t3_1q7sc09,False,

Someone saw this post and sent to me so here I am writing my first Reddit reply lolLance does support most of the catalog on the market, check out this page: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/) I guess I did a bad job marketing these features. I did publish a few blogs, but mostly under the context of integration with compute engines, like [https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/](https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/) and [https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/) . For all the supported catalogs, you can basically use Lance side by side with your Iceberg datasets.But I think you raised a great question - ""anyone actually cataloging their lance datasets? or is everyone just yolo-ing it"". I did these integrations because we do have real customers using them. But I do see a common trend that data engineers in enterprise corporations that have data lake, data warehouse or data lakehouse setups, and trying to integrate Lance for AI features tend to want catalog support. For the frontier labs AI engineers, they tend to just prefer having storage-only solution and yolo-ing it.To bridge that gap, I also did one catalog within Lance, the Directory Namespace: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/) . It is basically a catalog living in a directory, backed by a Lance table, so everything still stays purely in storage. It is also compatible with just a plain directory of Lance tables, which is typically how people start using lance format, when they do pip install lancedb and create a table. In general, most of the users I interact with treat embedding as a part of real data assets. You can definitely store multiple versions of embeddings generated by different models for different use cases or just compare their effectiveness and switch over time. That is actually one key use case for Lance, which is you start with a table with just a single column, maybe images or videos. You continue to do data evolution - add embedding columns, caption columns, feature columns over time, and they accumulate and become a very wide table. That becomes your entire multimodal data asset. Check out some case studies with for example Netflix [https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/](https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/), Runway: [https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/)",Early_Watercress_413,2026-01-10 05:32:34,10,dataengineering,t3_1q8ble3,False,

nz34f0t,I would go with option b (ish). Merge the records so you can handle the inserts and updates. If you need history you can set up an SCD 2 pattern to capture changes over time. Merge should be pretty efficient. You can even land the data in a full append table option c and then do option b. You can set up a small job to clear out older data in the append table periodically.

There is 0 gain from making it a snapshot and eating the storage and eventually processing speed. I wouldn't worry too much about what others think of how and where the data should work in theory. Theory rarely ever applies in the real world, the data and how you get it dictates what you do and in this field most cases, you have 0 control over the source of the data. Which means almost nothing operates like it should and you just have to get the data as accurate as possible, as efficiently as possible space, and processing wise. To me, Bronze always matches source, or at least as close to it as you can possibly get. If it doesn't, you are going to have a horrible time running down why things don't match up. Snapshotting like option A is really only good for if you need to see how things have changed over time, or doing day to day comparisons at the Bronze level and I'd rarely ever want to do that because that's honestly a waste of space and processing. As for Option C, I would avoid anything that makes data right after the fact and there's a point in time where non-dirty read data is inaccurate.

So, you either will have a vendor lock or mixing different entities in one (like Hive Metastore + Hive SQL).Second option looks nice, for example, an OpenLineage standard can be used, but the existence of lineage in catalog will depend on query engine.If I would build a solution on open source technologies, I would prefer a second option.

ny7ppkb,"That overlap you’re seeing is real, and honestly, a combined solution is becoming the standard rather than a ""nice-to-have."" In my experience, separating them usually leads to one becoming stale because they rely on the same underlying metadata context to be useful.Here is how I’ve seen this play out in practice -1. The Platform Approach (Unity Catalog) **-** I’ve used Unity Catalog extensively for this. It essentially forces the catalog and lineage to live together. Because the governance (permissions, access controls) creates the lineage automatically as jobs run, you don't have to ""maintain"" the lineage separately. The catalog is the map of the lineage. If you treat them as separate tools, you end up doing double the work to keep them in sync.2. The Open Source Route (OpenMetadata) **-** If you are looking outside of a specific vendor ecosystem, tools like OpenMetadata are tackling this exact ""all-in-one"" problem. They treat data assets, lineage, and quality checks as a single entity. It proves that the market prefers a unified view. Data engineers don't want to tab switch between a catalog to find a table and a lineage tool to see where it came from.3. The Shift to Orchestrators (Dagster) - The most interesting shift right now is actually happening in the orchestration layer. I’ve been using Dagster, and they handle this through “software-defined Assets."" Instead of lineage being an afterthought or a documentation task, the lineage is defined by the code itself.* Assets **-** You define the data asset, and the lineage is inherent.* Asset Checks **-** You attach quality checks directly to those assets in the graph.So, to answer your question, Yes, a combined solution is useful. In fact, things are moving even further, merging Catalog + Lineage + Execution (Orchestration) into one view so that ""accountability"" isn't just a log you look at later, but part of the pipeline run itself.Hope this helps.",raahgir_33,2026-01-07 15:28:59,0,dataengineering,t3_1q6cug2,False,
ny84dh7,"**Yes - combined catalog + lineage is the way to go**, and it's becoming the standard rather than a ""nice-to-have."" From working on DataHub at LinkedIn, here's what I learned: **separating them creates semantic drift at scale.** Your lineage says ""user\_events\_v2"", your catalog says ""user\_events"", and nobody knows if they're the same thing. When you have 100K+ datasets, this breaks governance completely. **Why integration matters more than people realize:** • **Metadata propagation** \- tag one source table as PII, lineage cascades it downstream to 50 derived tables automatically. Manual tagging doesn't scale.  • **Impact analysis** \- ""this pipeline failed, who owns the upstream data?"" If you're jumping between tools, you've already lost.  • **Trust flows backwards** \- you can't assess data quality without tracing upstream. Separate systems = manual stitching every time. Most of the modern catalogs are moving to a model of \- out-of-the-box connectors that ""pull"" lineage into the system from external systems \- support reporting of lineage INTO the system via standard catalog-native API-s/agents/emitters or vendor-neutral protocols like OpenLineage **The caveat the other responses touched on:** some solutions like Dagster's ""software-defined assets"" are elegant but only work for what the orchestrator controls. Your data doesn't start in the warehouse: • Production systems feeding Kafka streams  • Real-time stream processing (Flink, Spark Streaming)  • Cross-cloud data movement that never touches your orchestrator  At my previous company, \~40% of critical lineage came from **outside** the orchestration layer. You need a catalog that can **aggregate lineage from multiple systems** (streaming, production databases, warehouses), not just generate it from one orchestrator. **The test:** can you trace a BI dashboard → warehouse → dbt → Kafka → production database in one query? That's 5-6 systems owned by different teams. The catalog is your aggregation point.

nysc1mt,"You want to have a landing area for the data that is your single source of truth. This would be a Datalake if you cloud storage it. DLs have cool uses, like Events. Snowpipes can be triggered when a new file appears. Airflow deposits the file in the DL.Then a staging area (schema) that links to the landing area and allows hashing to eliminate dupes. No transformations here. All columns varchar. A reject schema for data that cannot fit into bronze due to an error. Then Medallion architecture for schemas bronze, silver, gold. Bronze (column transformations to correct types) from the staging. Any data rows that do not conform go to reject schema. Also Bronze is a great place for SCD2 tables. Silver is new & inferred data that is valid but doesn’t exist in bronze. Like splitting customers by geographical zones based on their address. It can make sense for some silver tables to be SCD2, but that’s rare. For geolocation you go get another single source of truth, stage it and bronze it. Then the silver combines two different bronze tables. The silver geolocation could be scd2 for tracking the moves that PK did. And so on. To meet all Gold requirements, for dimensions and facts. Gold is dimensional tables that Kimball and Snowflake are famous for. DIM and FACT. Using Airflow for pushing the data in the Medallion layers is standard practice. To go from BigQuery directly to Snowflake FACT, this is called a Proof Of Concept. Nothing wrong with that. Suggestion, put it in a Dev environment and build a Prod environment.

In those cases, directory-level partitioning on a timestamp is usually sufficient and cheaper, because partition pruning is extremely effective and requires no ongoing reorganization.Liquid clustering starts to make sense at this scale when:* Queries frequently filter on high-cardinality keys (e.g. account\_id) in addition to time.* The table isn’t strictly append-only (MERGE/UPSERT, late data, corrections).* Access patterns evolve and you don’t want to constantly redesign partitions.* You want to avoid over-partitioning while still getting good file-level pruning.So the question isn’t “can liquid clustering handle 100 TB?”, but rather whether the workload actually needs it. For a truly raw, time-sliced dataset, partitions alone are usually the right tool.

One set will always be updated, so it will always get the v=6 record when it comes. The fact table I was writing about in the post will remain at v=5. Business reason comes from our Financial Controller. When the data comes in, we expect that after X days after a reporting period, if there are no upstream data changes, we consider it official. There is an audit requirement to keep a permanent record of this official data for that time period because this is the data that was reported. There is a main gold fact table that will always be up to date and that's used for other purposes, but will always be accurate.We are implementing 'write controls' on the gold layer partition to limit this, but it won't be perfect.

Your idea for learning to understand code completely is misguided. Your goal should be to build and deploy a working project. Something super simple. Do it in the next three days. Then immediately go to work on a slightly more complicated project, which you should also deploy within a few days. Then add a database and deploy that within a few days. Etc. Your big problem isn't that you don't understand everything about code, it's that you can't code on your own. There is a huge difference there. It isn't even the same topic. Keep learning but consider all lessons to be an expense you have to pay to build a project. All projects should be as inexpensive as possible. Learn the bare minimum to get building again. When you've built and deployed at least two non-trivial full-stack projects and you feel comfortable with a programming language, a full-stack framework, a database language, a testing framework, and a deployment strategy, then you can start researching better design patterns. Then build another project. I'm sorry to hear that your school let you down so completely. If there is a bright side, it is that all of us become self-taught eventually.

nywnte6,"I'm going to go out on a limb and argue this: It's not programming, it's the way school taught you how you should learn. School education is built on spiral patterns and a tonne of scaffolding. Both of these together make the natural position of learners so that it is clear what they should do to solve a given problem, so if they don't know what to do the assumption is that it is your fault. When in reality, learning is complicated, messy, and difficult. I'll give you an example. In maths, let's say that we are learning how to move variables around an equation. We provide the proof, completed worked examples, worked examples that are partially solved with hints, partially solved worked examples without hints, simple problems that are basically worked examples without hints, and some problems that can be breadcrumbed through multiple worked examples above. The end result is that you probably can go from start to bottom without encountering any trouble. Teachers might make questions that are tricky, compound, or both, but you've probably encountered *everything* before. The problem is that you've never learned how to synthesise something new (to you), and that's what you are trying to do here. I'll give you an example. You might have learned how to make an object. You might have even learned how to assign a variable to an object. But when you have to make your own simple data structure that stores a bunch of data like an array, but can dynamically add and remove stuff without empty spaces or resizing arrays ... well, all of the steps to smash your face into designing or inventing a linked list are really, fuffing, hard.So, what happens is that learners sit there and go: ""Man, I feel that fancy maths is easier than this because I always know what I'm doing,"" because they've hit a problem that could have a dozen or more possible solutions. Instead of simply accepting that they don't know and starting problem-solving, they just feel bad.I'm also going to extend a programmer's olive branch: I've been programming for twenty years. I'm not bad at it. I've built all sorts of complicated systems in multiple languages. Yet, every single day I'll be coding something, and I'll mutter to myself ""holy fuff I'm stupid"" because I couldn't solve some problem. I also couldn't tell you how long I have smashed my face into problems trying to understand how to build it, only to discover that once I learned the underlying systems, it was actually pretty simple (after I did a lot of work to learn new stuff). This is natural. In fact, I often wonder if you don't feel like this regularly, you probably aren't programming. edit: Lastly, I've been learning how to write novels. Not really to do anything with, but just to tell stories. I'm constantly frustrated at how hard it is to express what is in my brain in words. It has been a year, and I've learned heaps, but I'm still not good at it.

You one day realise 'wait a minute i would like a simple website about my new bakery that im opening up' so you do just that. You make multiple games and you realise that manually writing physics is a pain for each game so you decide one common code that handles this physics for you and call it the 'game engine', the name is all fancy but at the end of the day its just a bunch of code doing physics.You find it difficult at the moment because you're not starting bottom up, you don't start with a basic necessity in your life that needs to be solved and work from there. You start with knowing zero programming as you mention in your second and blindly just copy paste tutorials which are more complex and use stuff that you do not have the prerequisites for.

Another thing that might help is Python with its very easy to understand object model.OOP requires a different way of thinking - kind of a rewiring of the brain to look at things differently. In OOP it's more a dialog between the individual objects than the sequential command patterns we are used to in procedural programming. In OOP you more or less ""talk"" to the objects. You ask them to do things for you. You ask them to change their internal state if needed (yes, the ""immutability"" topic will now come up and I might anger a few people with my mutable approach).My breakthrough with OOP was when I got into my current job in Industrial Automation working with our DCS (Distributed Control System) and with our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems. There, everything was object oriented with inheritance and I started to see the advantages and how OOP works. Our SCADA even goes further in the direction of being an Entity-Component system where each Entity can have many components with many different aspects, but that leads too far (it's basically just some very extended form of composition, not inheritance).> it often takes me hours what my developer colleagues can do in minutes.This only boils down to practice, ample practice.You will feel stuck and dumbfounded for quite some time but you will eventually reach the point where things fall into place and you all of a sudden understand.

It's a natural instinct if you spend most of your time close to the machine itself, but it's actually disruptive to learning HLLs.HLLs are designed to be somewhat implementation-agnostic; they have rules, and they trust that some intermediary layer will implement a thing that makes those rules go. Getting bogged down in how that intermediary layer might work (\*) generally will impede your understanding of the higher-level layer. This is a skill I had to learn when learning SML/NJ: the fine art of no longer worrying about how the language represents a function, trusting ""It just does,"" and learning the language independent of its implementation. The language is just rules and math; you could implement it with pencil and paper if you had the time and patience. Once you have the language under your belt, you can start caring about how it was implemented on a Von Neumann architecture with registers, RAM, and the like.(\*) C++ might be an exception that proves this rule; there are actually quite a few features of C++ where the reason they work that way is ""It made it a lot easier to write the compiler"" or ""Look, this language is old, and older computers didn't have enough RAM to do things like lookahead compilation or multiple passes, so it is what it is.""",fixermark,2026-01-08 16:10:23,2,learnprogramming,t3_1q79dtu,False,
nyffud1,"So, I wrote [a few chapters on OOP in a free book](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/). I tried to think of the ways we incorrectly teach OOP (because that's the way we learned OOP.)I think the summary I can provide is:* A class is like a blank paper form template. You go to the doctor's office and fill out strings for your name, phone number, a list of allergies, etc. This form is a *class*; everyone fills out the same fields (i.e. the member variables) to represent a real-world thing. Each filled-out form is an *object*, a specific concrete thing.* I hate the isolated ""Car"" and ""Shape"" and ""Animal"" classes you always see in tutorials. What a ""Car"" class looks like in real code depends on what software you are making: a used car ecommerce site, a traffic simulator, a racing video game, etc. Meanwhile, the same real world person would be described by different classes: `Customer`, `Patient`, `Employee`, `WeddingGuest`, etc. Ask yourself how a paper form would describe the person in each of these roles and what fields it would need.* A common mistake is to write classes a certain way because we heard that they ""should"" be written that way. If you feel like classes and extensive hierarchies of classes are causing more bureaucracy than organization in your code, go without classes. (If you can; a complete rewrite has its own problems.)* For a second, forget about OOP: imagine you have **a bunch of functions and they all have the same data structure passed to them as an argument**: that's your class. That tells you what the member variables and methods should be. I have an example Python tic-tac-toe program done [with and without OOP in the book.](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/chapter15.html)* Inheritance is overrated.* For a moment, stop thinking of inheritance with genetic or grandparent-passing-away metaphors. Imagine you need a new class that is very similar to an existing one, but you just one to change one or two methods, so you copy-paste the code entirely and just change those methods. This is what inheritance does, but instead of copying-pasting code, you leave that out and make a subclass and then only specify the methods you change.Anyway, in general we explain OOP badly, and it is a bit (but not entirely) overrated.

The most close synonims for an *object* is: record, structure, set of variables, and now comes the difference: with the *methods* (functions, subroutines, procedures) operating on it.If you ever worked with files on Unix-like systems or Windows, you've already familiar with OOP. You create a File ""object"" by *open()* or *creat()*, which you can refer with the *file handle*, which these function returned. The variables of File is hidden for you, we have some idea how it looks, but we don't care as far we can call *read()*, *write()* methods to do what we want with the file, then we can *drop* or *destruct* it by calling *close()*.In OOP, instead of file handle, you got a pointer (sometimes called reference), and you can ""call"" methods. Now comes the part where you'll understand the whole shit:`read(file_object, &buffer, length)`is same as`file_object.read(&buffer, lenght)`In Python, you can call a method both way, although, highly recommended to use `obj.method()` variant.And again, as elctronics, programming is not *difficult*, but *simple and* *complex*. OOP is just as *difficult* like pull-up resistor: if you know struct, function, memory, OOP is easy-peasy, and if you know current, instable state, DCC and GND, pull-up resistor is straighfoward... but try these two simple things to explain someone who knows nothing about programming and electronics.",ern0plus4,2026-01-08 12:42:36,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q79dtu,False,

When the other code reviewers and testers also did their passes, I read their issues to see what I had missed.

Most universities will accept an associates degree as the first two years of a computer science curriculum. The advanced math comes into play if you want to get a bachelors in Computer Science.

The only things you really need to know are how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and maybe a little basic algebra. Many programmers go through their entire career with having to do barely any math at all.> Do note, however, that the answer is a bit different if you are interested in getting a degree in Computer Science. Many universities or colleges will have specific prerequisites you need to fulfill before you can either enter the major or graduate (calculus classes, etc). And, since Computer Science is, to a certain degree, applied mathematics, you will almost certainly end up learning about discrete math, writing proofs and other similar topics while earning your degree. You do not need to be inherently good at math in order to learn these topics (or any mathematical topic, really), but having some mathematical maturity certainly wouldn't hurt, and would probably smooth the learning process.",AlSweigart,2026-01-06 21:18:36,2,learnprogramming,t3_1q5hw23,False,

Part 1 would be a preparation for the exam done at home with whatever tools they want (ai, colleague,...) and they could take any code they would have done to part 2 (which was the actual part cut from Internet).The first part had exercises centered around getting every child from a node in a tree (and going deeper till getting the last).The first exercice from the second part was going up the tree till the first node was found and then, the exam was basically going down the tree either from top or from a specific node with the eventual join here and there on another table.All that to say : if you understood your code from the first part, second part should have been no problem at all. going up a tree being so close to going down but a lot less complicated to implement - It's a sole loop. And once done with going down and up, every other exercise could be done with some copy past from your own codeWhen the result was in, most of the student had the first part nailed in tight. But some would have no idea at all about what was what (one exercice asked to check the depth of the tree and one of the student thought that just taking the node.parentId was the answer. Not to throw shade at the guy (I'm pretty sure he's one of the smarter) but he clearly didn't understand the first part that was, most likely, generated (or copy pasted from a student. But since I checked every file before allowing them to bring them to part 2, I have some idea.)In essence, ai didn't write bad code. That's not the point.The point is, they used it in a way that didn't make them grow their understanding of what they were doing.That's the part I'm really critical when in comes to ai use in learning...

But thankfully, there are loads of resources out there that can help you choose your path! So, it's okay if you're not totally committed to building a career, my advice would be to measure the amount of resource you devote until you know that.You can teach yourself to code without access to any paid content or courses. It's a long road, it takes a lot of dedication and frustration, and drive to go find the answers yourself. But I'm not sure there's ever been a skill so thoroughly documented online as software development. Software developers largely love to share what they've built, and the very fine details of how it works. Youtube is full of tutorials. There are plenty of websites that will explain different programming languages or tools to you. Github is a massive source of real code that drives real projects which you can read and download and involve yourself in the discussions of. If you're looking into a career, I recommend finding a university within your state with an accredited computer science program. The degree matters a lot when it comes to job prospects unfortunately. I also think it's a medium quick way to actually develop serious development skills. I know for me personally, I was on the self-taught path for many years and just very stuck. It was my degree program with the help of professors and peers that finally unlocked things for me and got me over the tough parts of learning development. You'll find no shortage of universities that offer remote degree programs in computer science as well. This is an expensive path, but its the most reliable path to a career.If you're not sure what you want yet, and you're just out to explore maybe try joining some community projects. Hackathons, game jams, competitions. Even if you don't feel like you're ready, just be honest about your level and express that you're there to learn and you're bound to find loads of people just like you who would be glad to learn along-side you. That's a great way to 'explore' and get a sense of what actual development is like even before you have the skills yourself. Even if it means you're joining a discord call just to watch and hear how more experienced developers are working it'll give you a sense of what its actually like once you're in the middle of things.I won't recommend any particular course or source of information personally.

BASIC is dead and has been for a long time. (Yes, I know about SmallBASIC and VB.NET, but they have nothing in common with the BASIC of old) Python does the job much better nowadays.

It's what they can do with the language, how they can analyze and break down problems and create step-by-step solutions for the individual sub-problems that then can be implemented in a programming language, that makes a good programmer.The people of old didn't have too many choices (I was there - learnt programming in the first half of the 1980s).

nymvibm,"I grew up back then and frankly unless you where insanely rich, the only thing available where computers running on Z80 or 6502 chips. Great chips but all you easily had for programming was the built in BASIC. By the time I got to college, almost 10 years later the college was teaching with Modula 2 at the introductory level. Note the phrase ""teaching with"", if you are learning to program the language is really a tool to learn concepts. By the time one would finish the full program a student would have been exposed to at least 3 mandatory languages.People often ask why? The answer is pretty simple out in the real world you may end up working with a number of languages. The problem with BASIC is there is very little real world use of BASIC anymore, even gaming has gone to Lua for scripting.Now what do I suggest for beginners, that is easy C or C++ for the equivalent of the first 3-4 semesters of a Computer Science program. Why low level languages? This is again simple, you can be forced to building data structures at a low level. Personally I See languages like Python as damaging to the development of good programmers as it hands user modern concepts and unfortunately most programs designed around Python don't dive into how things work. The other reason is that properly done, by mandating the command line for the first few programs (2 semester equivalents) you also learn how compilers and linkers work, at the user level anyways. The command line is important because there are Python programmers out there that can't even create a directory at the command line. So I'm not a big fan of people learning programming with Python.However I really believe that most programmers need to learn Python at some point but properly educated that will be a piece of cake. The reality is Python has been relative simple for a scripting language. At some point a programmer will also have to learn the languages suitable for the platform at hand. The problem is platform languages are a moving target, you need a good understanding of the basics of computer science to adapt to what is new. Languages like RUST or Swift are literally works in progress, it is a continuous learning challenge to remain effective with these languages.",spinwizard69,2026-01-09 17:50:37,3,learnprogramming,t3_1q8ay1b,False,

You could take the remainder of the deltaPopulation and carry it over to the next step, this ensures that the population still keeps track of the fractional progress. A second approach would be to keep the population as a decimal digit and only use a getter which floors the value upon access by anyone else.",Patex_,2026-01-11 15:59:24,8,learnprogramming,t3_1qa2nu2,False,

And a population of 4119.7 means the exact same, but RoundToInt will round the previous result to 4119 and this one to 4120.So, use Floor or `FloorToInt` whenever you want to use the population in any other calculation - and also use `ints` for all other population-numbers, like `previousPopulation` and `deltaPopulation`.

The reason it was faster the second time is probably just because the JVM's files were already in your operating system's disk cache and didn't need to be loaded from disk again.When people talk about the JVM ""warming up"", they're usually talking about something slightly different. The JVM starts out in a ""bytecode interpreter"" mode, and only switches to JIT compilation when it detects that a certain piece of code is heavily used. This warmup process actually *improves* startup time, because it can start running code right away instead of waiting for everything to be compiled to machine code.",teraflop,2026-01-09 15:42:22,18,learnprogramming,t3_1q8b5an,False,

nyopvth,"There are 13 years between C++98 and C++11, there are 15 years between C++11 and C++26. It's always a good idea to work from the latest standard. C++23 IS THE latest standard - C++26 will go to final vote to ratify in March this year.C++11 is old and was incomplete even then. They missed shit like `std::make_unique` - which had to be added in C++14, the `chrono` didn't finish until C++17, which is when we also got `filesystem` and `variant`, and finally type punning was defined. We didn't get library support for type punning until C++20, which is when we also got the `ranges` library - a god damn revolution in implementing algorithms. C++23 gives us `#embeded` to bring us to parity with C, type-safe formatter strings, UTF-8 support, and more container types. Starting with C++11 also leaves almost all of `constexpr` on the table.1) Install the latest compiler package from your vendor of choice.2) Always direct it to use the latest ISO-strict standard it supports. The compiler will default to an earlier and non-standard tolerant mode. When C++26 is ratified, it'll be a following software update that suddenly you'll get the new features.3) Keep learning C++. We all learn variables, functions, loops, conditions, pointers, user defined types... You're still going to slog through all the basics. There's no point in limiting yourself to a specific standard in this journey. You'll arrive to the latest standard when you're ready for it and it's ready for you.4) It takes time for compiler vendors to catch up. Microsoft with MSVC is still scrambling to implement C++23 features. All the vendors are struggling with modules. Don't be surprised when stuff is missing. It's not actually a big deal. But keeping up with software updates means you get to capitalize on their latest additions day-of. C++26 also comes with some changes that are worth being there.5) Most teaching materials are going to teach you the same basics. For the most part, the rules of C++ have never changed since before the C++98 standard... Except when it does. And that's the thing about fixing on a specific standard - there are very standard version specific rules you don't want to get bogged down on. Template deduction, initializers, `auto`, constexpr, move semantics... A lot of that gets nuanced changes over versions, and there's always breaking changes between spec versions. I think it was C++14 that finally said you can't specialize standard library template functions, and fuck, I had a code base predicated on that.Ultimately, the differences between the specs MOSTLY won't really matter until you get through the introductory materials. C++26 does change that a little bit - because it's going to require catching the use of uninitialized variables, which was formerly undefined behavior.

My main criticism would be the name of the function `generate_board()` - I don't think that's an accurate description of what it does. The board is already ""generated"" and present in the `board` array. This function just *displays* it, so I think a name such as `display_board()` would be more accurate.There are many areas for improvement once you learn more and gain more experience, though. For example, your `check_winner()` function could be split up to make it shorter and more readable, e.g. create a function `bool is_tie()` which encapsulates the tie determination and returns true or false appropriately, then call that from `check_winner()`.You could try separating the game logic from the input/output. By doing that you make it easier to change how the game looks (such as making a GUI version, where the logic is the same, but the display mechanism is entirely different). For example instead of `check_winner()` printing the result, it could return a value that indicates the state of the game.

nz0uju8,"Adding on to what others have mentioned,Separate the input/output from the business logic (in this case, checking for winner, board generation). What you can do is to have functions that don't touch IO at all, and just take parameters and return values. For example, `generate_board` returns a board object (or sets a global variable for now, if you haven't learnt classes yet). `set_cell(x, y, state)` sets the value in the cell, `check_winner` returns the winner.

nyckdl1,"Yes, that's exactly how merge sort works.I like to imagine recursive function calls like your divide() function as a family of people who all know how to do some specific job (like historically the Baker family typically all knew how to bake stuff, the Taylor family typically knew how to tailor clothes, etc).I'm guessing your main function calls divide() with some array -- let's call that one Pat\_Divide. When your main function calls Pat\_Divide with an array of exactly 1 element, you should be able to see that the `if` statement is true and then Pat\_Divide immediately returns with only that one element.When your main function calls Pat\_Divide with an array of exactly 3 elements, more imaginary people get involved:* Pat\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\_Divide and the other list to Alice\_Divide.* Bob\_Divide gets one element, immediately sees that the `if` statement is true, and immediately hands back that one element.* Alice\_Divide, on the other hand, gets handed a list of 2 elements, and so is unfairly forced to do more work. * Alice\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists (of 1 element each) and hands those lists off to Mildred\_Divide and Leroy\_Divide. * Mildred and Leroy act just like Pad\_Divide did when Pat\_Divide was given a list of 1 element, and each immediately hand back that 1 element. * Alice\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) produces a sorted list of 2 elements. * Alice\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\_Divide.* Then Pat\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)* Finally, Pat\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.When your main() function calls Pat\_Divide with a very long array, even more imaginary people get involved, but we don't really need to know all their names:* Pat\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\_Divide and the other list to Alice\_Divide.* Bob\_Divide returns a sorted list of all the items in the left list (by involving other yet-unnamed family members).* Alice\_Divide does something similar to what she did before: * Alice\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists and hands those lists off to Mildred\_Divide and Leroy\_Divide. * Mildred\_Divide and Leroy\_Divide divide their individual lists into even smaller pieces, and hand them off to other family members, who eventually help them produce sorted versions of those lists. * Alice\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) combines the 2 sorted lists into a single sorted list. * Alice\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\_Divide.* Then Pat\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)* Finally, Pat\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.(Optionally, you may later learn multitaking techniques, so that Mildred, Bob's side of the family, and Leroy can each work on different parts of the problem simultaneously. ).Good luck trying to explain recursion to the next person!",D-Cary,2026-01-08 05:38:56,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q6ztxe,False,

Take a selection of playing cards, and put on the table in front of you, make sure they aren't sorted, but still layed out in a nice uniform ""array"".2. Then split the array in two halves - moving them a bit towards you (down the table)3. Split the two halves in another two halves each, so you have four groups of playing cards, and move them a bit further down.4. Continue until you have a number of individual cards layed out with space between them - it still looks exactly like the original array, and feels a bit silly at this point.5. But now, merge the two cards to the left, in order from lowest to highest, and move them a bit up the table - do the same for all the rest, so you have a collection of groups of two cards, each group sorted.6. Then merge the groups two and two, moving them a bit up the table, so you end up with a collection of groups of four cards, all sorted.7. And continue doing that, until you have only a single list of cards, all sorted ...It is important that you actually do it, and not just try to imagine it in your mind!Every time you move down the table, it is another call to the ""divide"" function, and every time you move up, it is a return from the latest ""divide"" function.

Very often, things don’t work the way you think they should and you have to figure out why. You have to be very open to the idea that you might be wrong, because accepting that is often the key to finding the answer you’re looking for.

Now, I'm trying to apply to other companies, but I'm scared of the coding assessments. Back in 2025, whenever I applied elsewhere, I would receive LeetCode-style assessments before even getting an interview. I lost hope immediately and didn’t continue with my applications.Right now, I’m using freeCodeCamp, but I struggled with one of the CSS labs, so I decided to take a break. I also started The Odin Project this new year, and I’m trying to learn it slowly.Since last week, I’ve been studying DSA because it feels like the only way to get hired in this job market. I try to code on my own first, but I get stuck—especially when there are nested loops. My brain just can’t comprehend the logic. I understand bubble sort and selection sort, but I can’t code them without looking at examples. I don’t know what will happen to me in the future; maybe if I keep learning, I’ll get better. The Odin Project says I need to practice a growth mindset, but studying DSA is so hard that it makes me wonder if I chose the wrong degree.I didn't choose my degree, my mother wanted me to take it, and I don't really know what I wanted to take before, so I just went with it.Back in college, I almost failed college algebra and my DSA subject, but I still managed to graduate on time. For algebra, the only reason I struggled was because I didn’t have eyeglasses. By the time I got them, it was already too late to catch up since I couldn’t see what the professor was teaching.

Last night I had an interesting dinner conversation with a friend who I consider a genius in tech and business, and he believes the cost of software dev will approach zero as current advances in AI are continually eclipsed by improved models. Another friend tells me the latest Claude code is unbelievably good. Having AI as your learning partner is going to remove so many friction points. Spend some time learning how to get the most from AI and you’ll be running faster than if you first try to learn one syntax and formal language. Example: my dinner conversation friend likes to make boardgames for himself and friends. He recently made it in his todo list to a really interesting one where people cooperatively roll dice to try to beat a timer, with a difficulty scaling and hero exhaustion mechanic so the longer some heroes play the more tired they get, causing late rounds of the game to be more challenging. He needed to build some simulation software to play thousands of rounds of the game in order to derive the right numbers to use as timer values for easy, intermediate, and hard modes. He started by using AI chatbots to “write by prompt” a python program (he chose python for familiarity) He had written about 30 txt files describing the game,!the dice, the heroes, the colors, the map, the paths of forking decisions to move from point to point on the map, the win conditions and on and on. They were his personal notes, and he hadn’t shown them to any LLMs yet. Then he opened the folder in Cursor. The AI agent read all the files, and a whole list of notes to self and future todo items written in his personal notes. Then it proceeded to upgrade and expand his simulation script into a ful featured and useful tool. He has used it to simulate around 200,000 rounds of the game, and even had AI wrote an evaluative controller which would make adjustments to the difficulty levels until simulated games reach a desired success/fail percentage (ie. hard mode should fail 65% of the time on level 1, scaling to 80% fail rate for level 7)He opened his laptop and we told AI to rewrite the entire thing in Rust, which completed flawlessly in about two minutes. Thousands of lines of python translated to rust trivially. Then we thought of a stumper: build it in Lisp… it succeeded in another minute or two.

nytvmmh,"> My question after all this intro is, is it possible to apply DDIA concepts to personal projects for the sake of it?Yes. Basically, what you should do is weigh the importance of having applications that can:1. Horizontally scale, and2. Tolerate/self-heal from outages ...much more strongly then you normally would for personal projects.Usually, we ignore reliability for personal projects. But if you're trying to practice distributed systems, it makes sense to make it your main focus, even if there isn't really a need for it.> Is this viable in the slightest to learn these technologies? While I understand the theory behind them, distributed systems is not something I'm learning or will learn at my job and it's something I found super super interesting.I think it'll be possible for you to pick up a solid basic understanding of these tools -- enough for you to get an understanding of their strengths/weaknesses, and when to use them.Picking up a truly in-depth understanding may be harder. Usually, that deeper intuition comes only after either dedicated study or after spending an extended amount of time using the tool in production, seeing first-hand the limitations and quirks of that tool.> If this is possible, are there ways for me to simulate many users or requests without breaking the bank in something like AWS?Some suggestions:1. Deliberately give your app very small amounts of cpu/mem, and/or deliberately add in sleep statements and such into your app to forcibly handicap your app so it can handle only 3 QPS or something. This means even modest amounts of traffic will cause a naive app to start becoming overloaded, which in turn gives you multiple opportunities to practice building support for horizontally scaling.2. Look into setting up automatic horizontal autoscaling of some sort, to automate downsizing your application when you're not currently stress-testing it.3. Alternatively, if your app is inherently expensive to run, just completely tear it down every time you're finished for the day. To reduce tedium, look into using terraform or something to automate the setup and teardown.4. Eventually, consider using something like Kubernetes to run everything. This will obviously take a lot more effort -- but doing it does mean you can test locally by setting up Kubernetes on your local machine, using VMs to simulate running on a fleet of machines. Aside from simulating traffic, also be sure to do chaos testing of some sort, where you randomly kill your machines to simulate unexpected hardware failures and/or temporarily network blackhole them to confirm your application as a whole can tolerate it, not lose user data, not enter an inconsistent state, etc.> Lastly, I know that Kafka is a little bit of an overkill for a toy project but I kinda wanna simulate this for learning purposes.Yeah -- I'd say it's overkill in general. In production, state is the enemy: the moment something is stateful, you have to worry about keeping it backed up/replicated in some way so you can tolerate unexpected hardware/network failure, which in turn often places constraints on how you can scale, etc...This is why DDIA spends so much time talking about databases and such -- figuring out how to manage state is by far the hardest part of designing and maintaining a distributed system.So for a prod system, it behooves us to go out of our way to design our architecture to keep as many of our components stateless as possible. (Stateless == they may maintain a local cache, but it'd be perfectly fine and safe to abruptly nuke a replica at any time.)But for a toy project, I think your instinct is correct. Now is the best time to play around with different technologies, even when they're not needed. This may end up causing your overall architecture to be more complex then needed, but I think that's perfectly acceptable if your goal is to become comfortable with different cloud/distributed-systems building blocks.",michael0x2a,2026-01-10 18:37:12,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q99oo3,False,

Do you have a sort of mental checklist that a project needs to qualify for before doing so, or is it more just a second nature kind of thing?I know you may never need a microservice as it might introduce more complexity than it's worth, for example, but I'm wondering when you are like ""yeah okay, we need a microservice here"".Example from my experience of when to decouple was, and I know this super small fry, I added a lambda to run some puppeteer code to generate PDFs on AWS as we ran into some strange IIS worker processor quirk where the chrome process was executed twice when running this on Node/Nest. Spent about 2 days trying to figure it out until I went the AWS option instead. This came with the benefit of not having a heavy dependency like puppeteer in our bundle, although it does come with the cost of vendor lock-in to a feature, which I'm okay with in this case since there's a daily S3 cleanup and the function is used 10 times a day most, so cost is non existent.Also thanks again, this really has been invaluable feedback/input, I wish I could upvote you more than once!",Prestigious_Towel_18,2026-01-11 08:47:58,1,learnprogramming,t1_nytvmmh,True,

As you've discovered, checking pixel-level collisions like this is a bit performance intensive.Most games don't check collisions this way. Instead, like ""You can't move through walls"" or ""If an enemy touches you, you die"" are determined by representing both the character and the object as simple shapes. Boxes and circles are the most popular (often the sides of the box are parallel to the coordinate axes which makes the math super simple). A ""capsule"" shape is also quite easy (it's just the union of a box and two circles).

The trick with personal projects is to make them using relevent skills e.g. study the job descriptions youre looking to apply to and decide which frameworks/libraries/languages to use based off what theyre looking for, and make sure to put those keywords in the bullet points for those projects. Hot take but it matters less what the project actually is meant to do rather than what you used to build it—as long as its at least a little interesting and not super generic (weather app, todo app, etc) , your idea is fine. This will increase your chances of getting interviews.When it comes to interviewing, its a separate skill, I dont think having internship/work experience necessarily helps with interviewing skills. Technical Interviews are either leetcode style (practice by doing leetcode), conceptual questions (easy to prep for via google/chatgpt or through your school notes), or system design (not usually asked for new grads, but I had one for the offer I landed and I genuinely think my experience working on personal projects are what made me not completely bomb it, and I highly doubt interns are learning system design skills well if at all).For behavioral interviews, when they ask about working on a team you can just talk about group projects you did at school.

It costs 8k and has a great course catalog. It'll give you a hard reset and gives you an opportunity to apply to internships alongside applying to full-time roles. As for your resume, you need to look at Jake's resume, it's a standardized template. Have gemini distill your experience and format it to fit in Jake's resume. I feel like gemini has the best creative and visual model so it'd be the best for this use case. There are other standardized resume templates, I'm not positive Jake's resume is still the most recommended so do your research. I remember his resume template being referenced all the time a few years ago.Use a mock interview platform to find where your weaknesses are (idk what they are, I think pramp is one?).

No excuses. Stretch it to 6 months if you want to target highly paid roles at tech companies. Take whatever salary you can get, even if it's 60k it doesn't matter.

I was heavily involved in terminating over 80% of the team, including my boss. All while trying (and obviously failing) to make forward progress and then playing catchup while onboarding the new team while dealing with an unhappy customer who just wanted results. I was very busy for a period with HR actions, customer engagements to appease an upset customer, serving the role of like 5 different positions, trying to come up with clever ways to meet impossible milestones, convincing company leadership that the project was completely screwed and we needed help, etc. I went from boring to extremely not boring.

nycmp5l,"They likely don't know. The way most companies set salaries is using market reference points - the market is roughly geographic and industry tied, though companies can kinda pick and choose who they think is competing for the same workers (software engineer at a FAANG and programmer in the IT department of a paper company are probably not in the same survey).So, junior dev in some industry group and city has a median of $X. A new grad offer might be 80% * $X and the company might say that the salary band for junior is 80%-120% of the market reference. Each year they get a new market reference and also adjust target points - performance based. So if the market reference is at $110k and you're at $91k, they might bump you up 2-5% on the target. If the market reference goes up, you might get a juicier raise. If it goes down, you get less of a raise. You'll have a target point and an effective point - they won't cut pay if you're target is lower than your effective, but your raises will be smaller.If you start getting above 100%, the raises are often lower. At that point they're thinking ""get promoted to get more money"" - part of the reason for the wider bands is to be able to make offers to people being hired away from other jobs.If your friend got 5 years of really good raises, I'd bet on a rapidly climbing reference point (2010-2022 were pretty good years) along with being below the midpoint target, then some pullbacks in reference point and being above target.Managers don't typically know what the reference points will be and also don't really know how you'll perform relative to expectations.",cballowe,2026-01-08 05:55:38,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1q73851,False,

Prioritize completing work that is measurable if you can. saves money, record all of that. Learn lots. Find opportunities to lead if you can.You'll need to try and break out of comfort zone. Use that sales experience. ""Fake"" it. Not literally. But just be outspoken, be agreeable, put yourself out there. Once you've built up some good job experience, metrics, more confident. Try and find that F500 chill remote job, where you can be left alone and just coast. If the job sucks, has little growth or opportunity, toxic culture. Then do enough to stay afloat and put energy to applying to another role.Edit: Push to be tactical now. Apply apply apply. Try to get anything that meets your absolute needs (enough pay, remote, etc) while staying interesting enough of a position. Dont be overly strategic yet. Be strategic once you get the job.

nyo34wh,"I worked on a project like this for nearly a year, it was an interesting time. Does the company have a dedicated Salesforce engineer? Otherwise, odds are good you'll be dragged into doing Salesforce dev work eventually, and that is not a fun time.Also keep an eye out for whether you'll be working with a Salesforce consultancy firm. Salesforce consultants are terrible.",Blazr5402,2026-01-09 21:08:35,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1q8k9zy,False,
nyp7fxe,I think it's fine. I've done a fair amount of sales force integration work alongside other normal full stack Dev projects at my current company. It's not like Salesforce is some niche company serving a small subsection of the market. They're nearly an industry standard in many categories and I think it's actually great for the resume to have Salesforce experience.It wouldn't be a reason for me to decline a job.,McKnitwear,2026-01-10 00:29:42,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1q8k9zy,False,
nypijz1,"You won't know until you actually start, but if the stack is as they describe, it's probably fine. Salesforce devs can be paid a lot, but you're locked into their ecosystem, and I personally hated what the languages looked like.",Chili-Lime-Chihuahua,2026-01-10 01:30:35,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1q8k9zy,False,
nz1i2g6,I work in a similar role now and it’s a slightly different stack but the job sounds similar. My org has dedicated teams for salesforce development too and while I have experience with Salesforce my current project is mainly aggregation and integration. I never touch anything on salesforce itself.As far as integrating with salesforce goes it’s similar to any other service out there. The main challenge is when salesforce is having issues or you encounter a quirk in their product.,Current_Can_3715,2026-01-11 21:07:32,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1q8k9zy,False,

ny1tu65,Progress to “senior software engineer” leading a small team technically. Make the lateral move to Tech Lead Manager. Transition to pure management if you prefer that and are done making technical contributions.,drew_eckhardt2,2026-01-06 18:21:44,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1q5p6p8,False,
ny22zwq,"Normally, you gradually take on more leadership responsibilities, starting with team development and then gradually getting into more of the ""managing up"" side of things. Mentoring others is one common avenue for exercising skills that relate more to peers' career development than strictly technical growth.People generally don't care about MBAs or certifications in tech leadership, the proof is in the pudding.",lhorie,2026-01-06 19:02:35,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1q5p6p8,False,

nyeg1os,I mean you can but 5 years in is kind of early for all but the absolute worst management jobs. Better to get to the Sr IC levels or beyond and reconsider when management roles that are more than glorified baby sitter are open to you.,devfuckedup,2026-01-08 14:14:18,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1q5p6p8,False,
