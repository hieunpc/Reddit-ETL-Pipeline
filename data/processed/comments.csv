nvkh7sp,The framing is a little off but the feeling is real. Fixing looks like the job because it is the only visible part. Building good systems is mostly invisible once it works. If nothing broke you would still be doing work but it shifts to boring preventative stuff. Data contracts. Upstream alignment. Cost control. Schema evolution. Access rules. Quality checks before anyone screams. That work is harder to explain to managers so it gets undervalued. Mature teams stop celebrating hero fixes and start measuring how quiet things are. Some teams make that visible with domo dashboards. Others track it through snowflake usage or monte carlo alerts. Same idea.

I’m assuming by mid-level you mean a title like senior data engineer in my response.This is the arguably the hardest point in your career to progress. As many point out you can go IC or PL route. PL route tends to make a higher bonus but you can still make very good money as IC so both are viable paths. I know many engineers who have stayed at the level you are at their entire career. Only a few percent move up from here. This is because a new set of skills are required. You are no longer just coding 8 hours per day. This looks different depending on the company size but these roles are responsible for architecting solutions and leading others in the solution implementation. I do both in my role on a smaller team but often these are split into a Principal Architect and a Manager role.So to move into these roles you need to demonstrate you can architect solutions and lead others via your work experience. Unfortunately almost no one will tell you that simply doing great work in your role doesn’t make you eligible for a promotion to the next one. Unless you demonstrate the skills required for the next level you will not even be viewed as a viable candidate by others. In practice this usually looks like partnering with business stakeholders to define a problem or need, designing a solution that addresses that problem or need, and organizing a team of engineers to deliver this solution. As a manager I could complete all the work which I delegate myself but instead I focus on turning business requirements into tasks, delegating those tasks to our engineers, and filling knowledge gaps so the engineers can complete the work.I could keep going here but I think I’ve made the main point.

nvcj7ub,"I'm doing a similar role, although at a very small firm - similarly no data culture to speak of, messy and fragmented processes and systems etc. I wouldn't have chosen it necessarily but some life circumstances have led me to it as a necessity at least in the short term. I'm also a humanities graduate who did the same pivot about 6 years ago.The major problem really is having zero reliability on upstream data which makes all analytics really difficult to do well. And cultural transformation is as important as technical in that scenario so you need to ask yourself if that's something you're willing to engage in - personally I feel the payoff is too uncertain versus the effort. On the generalist vs specialist question: you could stay a generalist if you want to go down one of 2 paths: 1) moving into management as quickly as possible or 2) carving out a niche as the 'first data hire'. In the second case, companies with no data team want a full stack data engineer / analyst / scientist who can do a bit of everything without investing in a whole team.If neither of those appeal, I would figure out what you enjoy most and focus on that. At least that's what I'm doing at my current place:1) building pipelines to move data around - focus on data engineering2) transforming data into usable, analytics ready data sets - analytics engineering3) speaking to stakeholders, answering business questions and building end user visualisation and analysis - data analyst4) building statistical / predictive models - data scientist6) strategy, leadership, management - project management, productI'm figuring out what I like most about the job, focusing efforts for the next 6 months on building stuff for that role specifically. Then I'm job hunting. This can be quite difficult given the demands of your firm might not align with what you want to do - e.g. if you want to be a data engineer and learn how to set up airflow on AWS but you've already got a vaguely usable set up using different tech, saying 'I want to learn this' might not cut it as a business case. You might have to figure out a way to be creative with the truth to get your way in that scenario, but honestly that's where your humanities background kicks in lol.So my personal take with these kinds of roles is that they rarely make sense long term. Use it to get the experience you want and feel you need and then move on to something else.You mentioned you like the architecture and design piece of the job - that's a good starting point and probably puts you more in the data engineering camp of the 6 roles above. Unfortunately 'architect' roles tend to be quite senior and you need to have some grunt work under your belt before unlocking those, but I imagine data engineering is the right place for that.Your tech stack is already a great starting point and tbh a good team will see python and SQL experience as enough - anything else is just learning tooling and reading the docs. I also think hiring someone who has stood up a serviceable stack on a shoestring budget with some creativity should be a more interesting profile than someone who just sets up Fivetran and Snowflake and calls it a day. But it might be worth just thinking through a simple pipeline and making sure you can talk credibly about all components of it - e.g. an orchestrator like airflow, a warehouse like BQ or Snowflake, etc. I think a good resource could be something like the Zoomcamp data engineering course - you could take a look at their materials and see if you can implement some of it at work.",Psychological-Suit-5,2025-12-22 10:11:50,10,dataengineering,t3_1psvmt2,False,

It sounds to me like you're doing quite a good job given the situation. > Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?This is just my opinion, and there are many opinions on this topic. I personally have always leaned a bit more toward being a generalist, and it has served me well. I also pivoted from a humanities background (linguistics), and whether this is true or not, I've internalized that I'm never going to be the whiz kid of hard coding skills and deep mathematical and algorithmic knowledge. I do think a humanities background tends to help with communication, asking questions, and defining a problem, especially compared to many of the pure CS grads I've worked with. On some level the tools don't *really* matter too much, you're solving a similar set of problems and you'll have to use whatever tools the company you work for has available. I lean on my ability to learn when I've had to pick up new tools, workflows, and programming languages - so far so good.Obviously it's good to have a few areas where you build deep expertise, but I think this happens as a matter of course for most people anyway. I think there's probably some trade off where deeply specializing early on can net you higher pay sooner, with a somewhat higher risk of getting really good at something that doesn't exist in a few years. All of that being said, we're really talking about two extreme ends of a spectrum.

Good code paired with good engineers that understand the code and know how to locate issues, fix them, support customers and add features on what they have without disturbing what they did before is not.I've seen lots of junior engineers using AI tools as fit for all tools which result in many of them being clueless of what's going on. That's a tremendous risk for a company. When something goes wrong things goes wrong in a big way. Tools have no accountability or responsibility but engineers do. Tip for engineers out there: AI tools are a game changer but NEVER deploy code you don't understand.> Unit tests and component-specific tests are worthlessMaybe if you miss what's the purpose of unit tests. I see lots of engineers using unit tests to give them coverage or just as a way to look responsible but mostly the tests are so tied to the components that are not testing anything specific. If there are edge cases on potencial user inputs that should be tested to guarantee that no one removes the actual piece of code that does the validation or fallback on the inputs. So I would say: bad tests are detrimental, good tests are amazing guard rails.> Dependencies has to be explicitSounds like a no-brainer but it's actually hard to enforce that because many teams/engineers lack the discipline to do so and only value that once the s* hits the fan (somehow similar to skipping the tests)> nowadays you can build something in 1 hour and wait 2-3 days for reviewBad engineering culture drives that. Mostly people are valued by the litres of code they add or the features they add (even if unbaked). Code reviews are good for aligning, learning and guaranteeing some standards. Running pipelines costs time and money so it's not the case they are free. So maybe code reviews investment might be something people should lean on.> REALLY GOOD data engineer (that can communicate well with business, solid data modeling skills, deep technical expertise to design efficient storage/compute, etc) rather than hiring 5 “okay” data engineersNot that linear. You need good leadership that knows what's implemented, running and what your customers want. You need to make sure that everyone understand what's going on and why the things are the way they are, that's essential part of leadership. When it comes to ambiguity and a decision needs to be made you need someone that is a good leader and has a strong sponsor (CTO, VP, Director...).If there is no leadership, sense of direction and accountability/responsibility is something exoteric even the best engineer will not be able to do the change and in that case maybe the 5 cheaper engineers might ship out more (despite risking shipping the wrong things at the wrong time with arguable quality).So, in other words, your 5 cheap engineers are not an alternative to the ""good"" engineer but rather a combination of both.",erbr,2025-12-20 20:27:20,4,dataengineering,t3_1prl5t5,False,

nviu0rs,"Yep, so this is a pattern dbt uses regularly. I am fairly new as well (been reading/learning for what seems like years, but work doesn’t want to go down this route).Basically, the idea is you bring each referenced source table in to the model you’re working on as their own cte. By doing this pattern you have a clear reference to every parent model you are using at the top of your model.You then perform the transformation steps, including the joining of those referenced tables as the next cte (or several ctes depending on complexity).Then you read directly out of your last cte - preferably with little transformation in the final step.All of this is to make things as readable and organised as possible.If you were to start transforming each source in the initial cte, you wouldnt be reading a simple, single line bringing it in to the current model, but reading more complex transformations that you would need to spend more time figuring out what that piece was doing and where it began and ended.Edit to add: this way you can tell at a glance at the top of your model all the referenced sources. Each of them as a single line cte with no complexity thrown in. After you have brought in each source as its own cte, then you start a new one with a name indicating the source and transformation step, etc.By bringing in your sources, transforming each, joining, performing joined transformations, aggregating, etc, each in a little code block cte, you are mimicking how programmers would use methods in code to logically break code into chunks.If you also read up about layering data models (medallion architecture), you’ll see how dbt likes to break it down further into separate models. This allows you to perform the simple single-model transformations, such as renaming, casting, etc at a ”silver” stage, and more complex transformations such as joining or calculating the values in two tables, aggregating, etc in a later, “gold” model. This takes the organising and simplifying of models from within a single model/step, to a process.——- /* Model header and configuration */ // bring in referenced models and sources WITH orders AS ( SELECT * FROM source_orders ), customers AS ( SELECT * FROM source_customers ) // transform table transform_orders AS ( SELECT col1 AS col1_rename, col2 AS cast(col2 AS string), .....

nvumpk9,"I was new to this not that long ago as well, so here's some of the basics I went through.- Store your raw data as it comes out of your API (raw), a cleaned up version of it (cleansed), and a curated version that (if someone in your company who isn't a member of your data team looked at) they could make sense of, and store them as three separate datasets / tables. Move data through them with ETL (or ELT).-I had to model my data using the Kimble method for my curated version (dimensions and facts). It definitely helps with Power BI reporting. There are lots of resources for this online.- Consider how your API works. When you call it, what does it give you back? Is it a full data set, or do you pass it a date and it just gives you back a smaller set of data? Which columns in that API call do you need and which are definitely not useful to your business (don't get rid of them in raw in case the business wants them in future, but think about if they are needed in cleansed). I was able to use watermarks to record when the pipeline last ran. I can pass that watermark to my API so it only gives me the data that has been inserted or updated since then. That's handy because you process a much smaller data set.-Think about what happens if your pipeline fails at each stage. Draw it out on paper if you have to, think about why parts could fail and how you would fix them or deal with the next pipeline run.- Spend some time thinking how your pipeline will handle deleted data. If someone deleted a record from November in your CRM, how does it need to be handled in your reporting? Does the business still expect to see it in the reporting or are they happy it should be removed.

nvqigji,"In an enterprise environment you are usually not in control of the data sources. So any type of data source changes can affect your pipeline downstream. As you mentioned schema changes are common, but relatively easy to detect. Most often I experienced renaming of columns, which manifests as a missing column in your expected schema and a new column at the same time. The pipeline cannot resolve this issue and will most likely fail if the missing column is used in transformations. You can detect schema changes with DBT-tests with dbt-expectations package or you can use great expectations package or dlt (data load tool) when using Python. Those tools also allow for detecting other type of problems, e.g. for categorical fields additional values that are not expected. You can also define simple tests or expectations that a column shouldn’t have NULL values, or fields need to be of a specific types and and and …Anything you can envision will happen eventually. And most often it requires human intervention to be fixed because most likely you need to talk to other people to either fix it at the source or you need to adjust the data pipeline to handle the new case. Your time is best spend in investing in detection and observability so you can spot the reason for the failure quickly.One way to minimize your disruption (and this is used in more mature organisations) is to create data contracts with your source system owners.

The salary I'm on at the moment is good, I get that but I'm mid 30s, I probably have 30 years left in work, it makes sense to consider what my future look like. When I think about progression there's a lot of stress and long hours that come for positions of more seniority as a DBA. Depending on the company, as a Head of/ Manager you can almost always be on call if that makes sense and I'm not sure the value is really there for me.I should clarify there are no plans to immediately transition, I'm on a good salary, it's remote and there's low demand, but when I think of 30+ years of working, I need to consider my options.

nvdvem1,"I made the very same switch OP is looking to make. I can say from my experience DE on call is significantly less frequent and easier. As a DBA a call might look like an emergency call at 3 am that a critical server / db was down. In a worst case situation you might work 24 hours straight to bring systems back online and still would need to be back in the office on time the next day. As a DE, depending on industry itnis much more common to get a pipeline failure alert and deal with itnfirst thing in the morning. Fixing a production pipeline is alsonalmost always easier than something like an emergency server migration / DR rebuild. The actual easiest way to make the switch is find a hybrid role as a DBA. Find a role whwre you have to do both jobs. Half 6our day is spent doing the normal DBA tasks. Other half is sepnt writing pipelines, architecting solutions, database design, ci/cd, etc. Then look for a role that is almost exclusively DE work.

nvepmti,"I didnt actively intend to make the switch until I was pretty far along down the path. Biggest driver is DE comes with higher pay than being a DBA. In my current role I still wear both hats fairly regurlarly. In fact I was hired more for my DBA skills than my DE skills.That said I found all the following skills very helpful in making the switch. 1. Expert level Powershell knowledge. This comes in handy both on prem and in thr cloud if you regurlarly work with Microsoft stacks. If not Bash would be more useful. 2. Intermediate Python skills. I learned python after powershell and the knowledge transfers easily between them. Somethings when you know both get hard just from do pythonism or powershellism in the other language. In Python focus on learning the common DE packages like pandas, polars, SqlAlchemy, pyodbc, requests these will get used constantly when writing pipelines for rest api endpoints. Dont worry too much about getting into the weeds with oop as most pipelines are not written that way. 3. If you want to go one step further learn Pyspark which is hugely useful in cloud pipelines and datalakes. Azure data factory, Databricks, etc is just spark underneath the sheets. 4. As a DBA for 10 years before making the switch. I was very familiar with On Prem / runnung SQL on VMs. A big switch for me was learning PaaS offerings like snowflake, databricks, Azure SQL, Azure data factory. So spending time learning the basics on these helped. I got lucky and was dealing with vendors / clients using these services so got paid to learn on thr job as it were. 5. Many older DBAs still have yet to embrace source control. If you are in this boat learn source control, ci/cd, and managing databases as code. If you get these under you belt it will make life better as a DBA and a DE. 6. Communication skills. I have to communicate with non technical and business staff more frequently as a DE than as a pure DBA. As a DBA we are kept locked up and kept away from business / non technical / dats analyst types. We are a bit like wizards who only send ravens when you have really fucked up.

Sometimes we would build of certain dashboard ( e.g show Average SLA times, Longest ticket open, and design metrics to track and sometimes we don't and BA takes over once we curate the dataset for BI consumption.That does not change the fact my role both in offer letter and in company system shows as Data analyst.",No_Song_4222,2025-12-22 03:25:45,3,dataengineering,t1_nvb4wt0,True,

I have played arround with the tools available in Snowflake, seen marketing materials, and spoken to several vendors in this space.My assessment of the current state of the art is I would trust it (more or less) on anything where a semantic layer was present. Similar to how Snowflake and the other major vendors in this space work currently.But I don't know how valuable this is, because at least for us if something is in our semantic layer it means that we have it in a dashboard or a report. These items tend to be our easiest most basic questions and things no one asks about anymore, because of how easy we have already made it for folks to find the answers.I mean most time our analysts spend on questions is spent trying to figure out what the heck our users are asking for. If the users knew the words for how to ask for what they were looking for chances are they would have known how to find the report or dashboard that answers their question.But I do think the current vendors can provide reasonably reliable text to sql on well modeled data with a complete semantic layer. And that is how plan to approach this problem when some executive decides we need text to SQL. Other engineers at my company have played arround with an MCP server based approach to provide limited data access an LLM and have gotten reasonable results that way as well, but for general text to sql I would stick to the semantic layer approach.Then this stuff is moving pretty quickly so it would not surprise me if this take is out of date in a few months.Edit as for security, I also lead our company's FGA solution and we have high security requirements.

nvhjbeo,"1. In C/C++, arguments passed into functions **get copied** into the function. They get copied because we may not want to modify the original argument, so it saves us a line of copying, separates areas of concern, and it's a bit faster.2. We **can** pass large values (complex structs, arrays, etc...) as function arguments. But they will be copied. That can be a lot of copying, especially if we can't anticipate the size of arguments `my_func(int arg[12])` vs `my_func(int arg[9999])`. 3. Since function arguments get copied, and large copies are expensive, it's cheaper and faster to pass the address (pointer) of the data as a function argument.1. Very low level programming can involve jumping forward and backward to memory addresses. We can do math on the pointer itself to get to different addresses. You may never do this yourself, but pointers gives us access to this capability.Why are you experiencing this in C++ when C++ is supposed to be modern? Because C++ was designed to be compatible with C and the preexisting C libraries. C was designed like this because it was one of the first successful abstractions above assembly and written in an era when compute, storage, and memory was very expensive (cost and compute cycles).Edit: I mostly mentioned functions + pointers and not pointers in general, but my goal is to justify the utility of pointers and mentioning their benefits with functions is good enough.",boobbbers,2025-12-23 03:44:51,9,learnprogramming,t3_1pthfk1,False,

Other languages abstract away this issue for you, but in environments where C++ is commonly used, such as 3D engines, operating system kernels, or embedded devices like arduino, we can't trust any other tooling to handle this efficiently enough for us, we need direct control.

That’s how you find out how it’s working and how you find issues. We can always redeploy dev “. And that changed my learning perspective.

At this point I consider it to be absolutely stupid to introduce CS to students with IDE's. To much basic material gets glossed over that often results in students not understanding what is happening underneath.2. Frankly this applies to trying to write any software as a GUI application, there is too much to learn to be distracted by GUI's.3. So what we need to do is to get back to basics.4. This means building software with command line tools and maybe a simple GUI text editor. 5. I'd suggest following a CS program that uses C++. You already supposedly have some CS under your belt but I'm really wondering if you learned anything. But the point here is that as each point is explored in class you just write code that leverages that technique in as many ways as possible. The usual first program is to write your name to the screen, often followed by simple looping. Explore looping for hours then continue with every other concept discussed in the program. the idea is to totally understand the ins and outs of every concept and be able to use with muscle memory. 6. Then start writing simple command line programs that solve things you understand well. Try to tie in these programs with hobby's or other thigns you know well. The point is you understand the the technology so you know what is right and you know the end result you want to see. An example would be writing a program that takes resistor band colors and returns the actually resistance value. Another example would be to display your favorite Chili receipt on screen. The idea is to start out dirt simple and grow from there.7. Once you fell comfortable building command line programs from abstract requirements then start building GUI apps. At this point you will likely want to shift away from C++ to a common platform programming language. For example on Apples systems that would be Swift. In some ways you will be starting over as Hello World is a common first GUI program. You will also need to become familiar with more advanced data structures and methods.8. Once you get past the introductory step you need to start crafting your own apps while you follow a platform specific program. Again the idea here is to take something you understand well, a hobby or something other and create programs that solve a problem within that domain. You can even start over with a receipt program but this time one that stores multiple receipts and allows more interaction. The idea is to get more and more complex. As you learn more and more you will realize just how bad the first receipt program was and can refactor it as much as possible.

Finally, optimized apps use Local Caching to show content instantly, whereas laggy apps force the UI to wait for the network and re-render everything from scratch, draining both battery and data.

nvk9jma,"Other than ""which language do I learn"" this is the most common programming question. The answer is to build projects and start small. Look, there's no way to just leap from tutorials to building complex software in one bound. So, start small. First, choose a project with a tight scope, like a Todo app with user accounts. Then, get a Trello account and start writing out individual tasks. You want to make these tasks super simple at first. One might be ""create a webpage with Ultimate Todo List as the title."" Your next task might be ""Create a CSS Page and make sure it's linked to the webpage."" Then do the same with JavaScript.If you run into something you don't know how to do, make a card for learning how to do it. You do not need or want to fully master new technologies at this stage. You want to learn the bare minimum to incorporate it into your project.If you get stuck, try to look up the specific thing you want to do. For example, if you're trying to make a checkbox the user can click, look up that specific thing. If you're unsure how to store your list of items, look that up, but not until you're working on that task.And then you just keep going. Try to complete one or two cards per day. This is almost exactly how professional software is built, btw. Only we break the cards into batches we can complete in two weeks and call it a sprint. Remember, the cards aren't complete features, they are small tasks. If you know Git (and you should) make a repo for your project and get in the habit of making a branch for each card. Once you complete a card, merge your branch into main and start the process again. Your Main branch should always be a working app with whatever features you've added so far. Start small, complete one or two small tasks every day, rinse, repeat.It's not just a way, it's the only way.

Others prefer Go for fundamentals around concurrency and simplicity, but it will not push you as hard on memory and invariants.Scope wise, I would pick tiny programs with one learning objective each and a hard ceiling on features. Stuff like a simple log parser with a strict state machine, a tiny key value store in memory, a CLI that does one thing well, or a toy HTTP server.

Different languages surface the same fundamentals from different angles. There’s value in contrast.The biggest trap to avoid is “exploration creep.” Pick problems that are almost boring.

nvqjp3r,"“Assembly language” isn’t a generic thing. It’s a way to write machine code with mnemonics rather than just heaps of hex or octal numbers. The mnemonics and their meanings are entirely dependent on the machine instruction sets of the target processor. So, if you know PDP-11 assembler language, you don’t really know ARM-64 or x86 or MIPS or whatever. If you find an embedded job, you’ll be using the processor your employer chose. If you start a company to make an embedded project, you’ll choose the processor. So your core skill will be getting your coding process up and running quickly on whatever instruction set.If your time is worth anything, you’ll hammer out most of the embedded code in C. Both GCC and LLVM have really good facilities for turning C code into astonishingly well optimized machine code for your processor of choice. It can prolly generate smaller and faster code than 99.9% of programmers ever will be able to. I’ve worked with a couple of the 0.1%, those folks are amazing. But they still use a lot of C.Assembly comes into its own for small chunks of an application that are time- or power- critical. And often the assembly code is embedded in some sort of pragma directive inside .c source code files.There’s still a lot to learn by programming machine instructions directly. Learning how registers, stack pointers, program counters, and other machine concepts work is helpful. You may as well do it for whatever machine you have readily at hand. C compilers generally have options that make them generate “listings” with the generated machine instructions displayed. That, combined with the instruction architecture document for your processor, will teach you a lot. Especially, compare the generated code with optimization turned off (-g) and on (-O).",Aggressive_Ad_5454,2025-12-24 16:20:09,-2,learnprogramming,t3_1pup6ow,False,

nvg7hnk,"You have to understand some programming history to understand why C and C++ exist.Lets roll back the clock to 1990 or so. Personal computers are just starting to become practical. For $3000 in todays money you can get a home desktop computer about as powerful as a super Nintendo is (286 or 386 PC running windows 3.1) At the time this is considered cutting edge, way faster than those atari and apple 2 computers people are using before. You can get real work done with these!Your options for programming languages really boil down to something like assembler, BASIC, or C / C++. Lets compare each.\- Anyone programming in 1980 to 1990 or so to do real work was likely using assembler. This is as close as you can get to actual processor instructions. Read value from memory address one into register 1, read value into memory address 2, compare the values with binary math, if they are equal then JMP to subroutine that outputs string from memory address 3, etc. This is literal processor instructions - it doesn't get any more raw and fast than that.\- You could learn BASIC, but BASIC is an interpreted language. Rather than the code being compiled into processor instructions BASIC is a program itself that reads the program you are running and figures out what it should be doing in real time. This makes it about 10 times slower. But good god, is it easier to write a program in BASIC than Assembler - you can just define an array, you can just write a function, you can just define subroutines that take actual arguments - its so much more clean. If you can write your program in BASIC it will be much easier to maintain and simpler to comprehend - but its going to run soooo much slower. In a world where making a FPS like wolfenstein 3D work stretches the limit of what is possible on the hardware, a 10x speed loss is just too much when your program relies on speed.\- Then comes C and C++. The idea behind these languages is that you can write your code kind of like interpreted languages instead of assembler - defining functions, data structures, complicated mathematical algorithms - but instead of the computer interpreting the program in real time, it can convert it all to bytecode - basically the same thing as assembler - and run it almost as fast as an assembler program as a result. C/C++ is written like a processor actually acts. But as nice as this is, there are still significant shortcomings. Dynamic memory allocation which is something that just happens like magic in an interpreted language, is not automatic in C++ - stuff like creating an array, creating a variable length string, or defining a variable, or converting one variable type to another - this is not actually provided in C, you have to manage it on your own. Which you most defiantly can - and doing so is easier than doing so in assembler. So now you have all the advantages of assembler and the complexity is significantly reduced.But its not 1990 anymore, its 35 years later. Computers are hundreds if not thousands of times faster, have multiple cores, usually have 32,000 MB of RAM instead of like, 4 MB, etc. There is enough extra speed in a computer that you don't really need that extreme optimization anymore. And the way computers operate with all this extra resources have also changed - with multi core systems you can have some of the cores or the GPU handling the graphics pipeline in your program, which is like 95% of the processing time - and this is all handled outside of the program you are actually writing.There are also many, many more languages that more elegantly handle the problem of ease of development balanced against speed. Most modern languages, like javascript or python, act like interpreted languages in that they are flexible and just run, but under the hood they still compile to bytecode for speed - the performance loss of using them vs C++ is not as much as it used to be. Modern Javascript in particular is \*\*king FAST, thanks to google throwing millions and millions of dollars into optimizing chrome. The way the async cycle in javascript works is far more flexible than what C/C++ offers, and in general all the features in C/C++ are now available in newer languages, and usually they do it better.Finally, you should consider that your programs don't need the extra speed and complexity that comes with C++ because all the heavy lifting in your program will not actually be done by the program you are writing. The graphics are done by the GPU. If you want a video or mp3 encoder or something, you bring in someone else's tool into your program as a library (probably written in C++) and invoke it and get the results. Programming in 2025 is more about gluing premade tools together and orchestrating them, and your code is the orchestration layer. It is much more beneficial for this layer to be simpler and easier to comprehend and manage and leaving the dirty details to other tools.

You can't change in the same way a float* into a float[5].We have these relationships:- operator & used on a float gives us a float*- operator * used on a float* gives us a float- operator * used on a float[5] gives us a float too.- operator[] used on a float* gives us a float- operator[] used on a float[5] gives us a float too.- float[5] decays to float*So when you do &somePtr[0], the [0] happens first, and gets you from pointer to float, and then & happens and ""reverts"" from float to pointer.Does that make sense?",Secoupoire,2025-12-23 23:46:29,2,learnprogramming,t3_1pu7i8v,False,

Thus, the code that calls the function with the pointer is also responsible for telling us how big it is. Note, size of socres in the function is the size of the pointer value, 64 bits or 8 bytes in this case. The int here is only 32 bits or 4 bytes.> So both *scores and &testScores[0] are float* numbers? Well... your pointer is always just a memory location. It's how you talk about it that makes it float. So here `scores` is a pointer when it gets to the function. We've told our program the type referenced by that pointer is float. To be clear, it could be a single float at the memory location or thousands. Once you pass that pointer, the actual size gets lost.

nvnabaf,"I find it useful here to make some distinctions because there's a lot going on if we take it apart. Key terms in bold. float arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};The **name/symbol** `arr` **aliases** the **address** (assigned by the compiler) of some **storage** (allocated somewhere at compilation time or runtime) that has a specified **value** (or values in the case of arrays) of a certain **type**. A **pointer** type is a type that stores addresses as values (pedants: yes, I've read the standard and this is good enough here). Example with address annotations in parens: float a(0x01) = 0.1f; // addr 0x01 (alias a) contains value 0.1f. float *b(0x05) = &a = 0x01; // addr 0x05 (alias b) contains value 0x01 (a's addr).Name/symbol, address, storage, type, and value, are distinct things. Names mean we don't have to write addresses (though you can, and do in embedded). Storage for a single object (not in the OOP sense, object = datum here) can of course be larger than a single address. Value is what is in that region of memory when read at a given time. Books can be written here (E.g. *Modern C*, Gustedt), this isn't supposed to be exhaustive.Answers:1. It's the address of the first byte of the first element in the array.2. Those are expressions that yield results of pointer type. Dereference and addressof operators can be thought of as inverses, yes. The reason you can write a function that takes a pointer and then pass an array is because of the language semantics, no doubt influenced by what is happening on the hardware. When passing by value in C++, the values of the arguments are copied into the target function's stack frame (usually, compilers are clever and will elide things). How do we efficiently copy an array here? We don't. We say that arrays ""decay"" to pointers in this scenario, and we copy a smaller fixed-size pointer value instead (fits in a register, nice!). Referencing the above, we've copied the (base) address of the storage of the array into the storage for the function parameter. We have a pointer value that we can dereference and/or do pointer arithmetic on. **Whereas the original name/symbol (arr) aliased the address of the first element directly, the parameter stores that same address as a value. In this situation, the language doesn't force us to explicitly take the address using an expression and then pass it, it effectively does it for us.**Hopefully that makes sense. I do recommend both K&R C and Modern C if you want to go beyond this summary. I simplified and left things out.",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-12-24 01:43:07,1,learnprogramming,t3_1pu7i8v,False,
nvnc111,"Arrays use contiguous blocks of memory to store values. When you request an array you are requesting a block of memory that is the size of a single element multiplied by the number of elements in the array.You will get a pointer for the beginning of the block of memory. This is also the memory location of the first element in the array.You can find the memory location of any element in the array with starting location of the block, the size of each element, and the index of the element you are looking for. There is a possible out of range error that will occur if you give an index larger than you initially requested. In C and C++ it will do the math and return a memory location that you didn't reserve for the array. This is called a memory overflow and will cause a lot of difficult to find bugs.The benefit of using arrays is that it is fast at finding the data you are storing. The problem is it is very difficult to increase the size of an array once you create one.I would suggest you learn about the different types of collections that are available and how they work. It will make you a better programmer even if an array is normally the best type of collection for most use cases.",WarPenguin1,2025-12-24 01:53:54,1,learnprogramming,t3_1pu7i8v,False,
nw2g2b7,"We have to go back to C for an understanding. K&R developed C on a PDP-6, which typically had ~144 KiB of memory. They thought arrays were too large to be passing around by value, like you could any other value type: void fn(int pass_by_value); int main() { int value_gets_copied_on_the_stack; fn(value_gets_copied_on_the_stack);So they decided that they would 1) pass by reference as a language feature to be more efficient, and 2) hide the reality from you: void fn(int array[123]); int main() { int gets_passed_by_reference[123]); fn(gets_passed_by_reference);In C parlance - a pointer references a value. What you DON'T see is how the parameter type decays: void fn(int *this_is_the_reality);The array itself doesn't decay - instead, it implicitly converts. You will not be informed, you will not be told, you will not be warned, and there's nothing you can to to prevent this. Again: LANGUAGE FEATURE. Notice the compiler completely strips out the array size.Thanks, K&R, for whatever the fuck this is about...The array is of type `int[123]`. The parameter is of type `int *`. The type system does recognize the array as a distinct type - where the size is a part of the type signature. We can even capture that in C: typedef int[123] int_123; typedef int* int_ptr; void fn(int_ptr pointer_to_int); int main() { int_123 array; fn(array);So what exactly is going on with pointers? The term is: Type Erasure. We are intentionally losing information about what the pointer points to. This can be powerful. Are we pointing to a single element or the first of an array? One past the end of the array? Heap or stack? Local, global, or member? Cast?We don't know SHIT about what that pointer is pointing at, other than that address right there ""is an int"". As far as the code and compiler is concerned, that's all we got. If you're willing to make some assumptions, you can write some abstract code that can do some interesting things. You can access, you can iterate, you can delimit, you can reinterpret...But unlike any other type in C, this means that when I pass an `int` by value, I'm working on a copy that exists on the stack, but if I pass an array by value, I'm reading and writing the original array in place. And remember that C didn't even GET `const` until C99...Type erasure is useful for writing all manner of abstractions. You can look at how `bsearch` is written and used, for an example. If you had to know what kind of thing you were pointing at, you'd have to have a local `int` pointer, a member `int` pointer, an array `int` pointer... It becomes an alias of limited value - often we want to operate upon a type without wanting to know too much detail.Oh, there are more specific pointer types... struct s { int i, j, k; }; int main() { s instance; int struct s::* ptr_to_member_int_of_s = &instance.i;Feel free to get more specific if it serves a utility. Such things are used less often.---So we've lost type information. Is there a way we can preserve it? Yes. void fn(int (*array)[123]);The extra parenthesis are necessary. This is still C; `array` here is a pointer, which means it can be null. C++ gives us references: void fn(int (&array)[123]);I hate the syntax. Luckily, this is what type aliases are for - since pointers are a distinct type: // C++ using alias... using int[123] = int_123; using int_123* = int_123_ptr; using int_123& = int_123_ref; void fn1(int_123 &pass_by_ref); void fn2(int_123_ref also_pass_by_ref); void fn3(int_123 decay_to_ptr);Don't get fooled by aliases. They don't make types, they only name them. You won't get value semantics for array parameters just because you've aliased it.This makes your code safer. Type information is preserved, you are referencing a more specific type. It also means the compiler can optimize more aggressively. But the size is a part of the type, so `fn1` and `fn2` won't work with ANY other type. `int[234]`? Go fuck yourself.Continued...",mredding,2025-12-26 19:08:53,1,learnprogramming,t3_1pu7i8v,False,

nvhyhws,">I have never felt so dumb and overwhelmed. I can't even solve basic array problems. I've been trying to study the patterns like sliding window and two pointer and can usually identify when to use them.For this kind of stuff, then for me it's essential to have a well-illustrated example, in order to really understand. For example, you used the term ""sliding window"", which gave my brain a vague inkling of what you're talking about, but not yet enough to have a ""picture"" in my mind of what you're really trying to solve.Then I used Google and found this Answer which is illustrated beautifully: [What is Sliding Window Algorithm? Examples? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8269916/what-is-sliding-window-algorithm-examples)Anyway, as the Answerer points out, calling it a ""sliding window algorithm"" is really a misnomer; it is a useful technique, though.So, how does one get better at using this technique? Well, you've got to practice it, of course. The example shown in that Q&A is a pretty good starter problem (find the maximum sum of n consecutive numbers); you can adapt that to almost anything (e.g. find the lowest average of n consecutive numbers, find a particular small sequence within a large stream of numbers, etc.).For this example, I'd see the ""sliding window"" approach as an optimization of the brute force approach. That is, solve it first with the ""brute force"" approach (which will still be 'efficient' in computational terms, but will be a factor of n slower than necessary), and then solve it again with a sliding window approach.Solving a problem twice may sound lame or may sound like unneeded extra work, but in a situation like this will be satisfying because first, you'll be able to measure exactly how much faster the better approach is, and second, you'll have a ""testing client"" against which you can test your 'better' approach. For something like this, it's usually easier to make a mistake in the implementation of the more clever approach, so a handy testing method is to make a testing driver that solves your problems using both approaches.(I.e. the test driver tests some sample testing inputs against the 'dumb' solution way, as well as against the 'clever' solution way) and then stops if two clients give different results (which indicates that ONE of the approaches must be wrong for that particular input). Usually you'll end up with a bug or two in the 'clever' way, but by systematically comparing with the 'dumb' way, you can normally lay such bugs to rest in a fairly straightforward way (debugging will still be work to do it, of course, but it will never feel like you're totally stuck, because you'll have the alternate version to compare against).>I've seen many people say they took courses or they learned it in college, but I just cannot afford an expensive course let alone going to college. Does anyone have some advice?Robert Sedgewick et al's course on Algorithms is available free of charge on Coursera, the last time I checked (for auditing it); it's a pretty good course.

I would recommend making a USB drive with a Linux installation you can boot to if you don't already have Linux installed (Puppy Linux, MX Linux, and Slax are all good choices for this - a Linux distribution you can use from a keydrive and save your changes and files), or have a virtual system with Linux installed on it, or if you're really determined, install Linux on a partition, which can be a bit difficult to do.

nv3hzid,"Is the newest thing also stable and reliable? Older thing can have its issues worked out and fixed. Perhaps only some very obscure corner cases are still generating Github issues. But other than that, the thing is stable and ""it just works"". Whereas the newest thing can have multiple open issues.Is the newest thing actually maintained? Recently I had to make a technical analysis for a new microservice and had to come up with an architecture proposal for it. I considered different alternatives. There was a library A and a library B. Library A had been around for many years. Sure, it had a lot of bloat and stuff, but it worked. Library B also seemed to work. Less bloat. Promising. BUT the maintainer/developer/owner of that library had abandoned that project. For 2 years there had been no commits. Github issues were abandoned. Yes, that B was newer than A but it was abandoned. Whereas A was older, did have more bloat, but was in active maintenance. Recent commits to update versions. Recent commits to fix vulnerabilities. etc.Is the newest thing that you should consider in the current geopolitical world? Let's say you are a developer in the US. Will you use a library made in China, in Russia, or in Iran? By itself the library can be newer and perhaps also better. BUT the decision makers can start making decisions where they tell the developers to make the library close sourced and you won't have any overview of the changes. Decision makers can introduce kill switches or backdoors. Or, the developers will collect data and send it to their data brokers. And then that data will be used in a competitive manner. One of the many reasons why one should think twice if he should use Deepseek AI, for example. Technically very promising LLM model. Also, it introduced many changes to other LLMs in the world. But, it follows the political agenda of China. It is not neutral.Does the newest thing have enough documentation? Older stuff can have massive documentation compiled by many developers over years. A new thing can have close to no documentation and you have to be one of the pioneers creating that documentation on the go.How is the new thing fitting in the existing infrastructure? Perhaps it does not even work? Yes, stuff often is meant to be backwards compatible, but not always it is the case. For example Spring Boot 2.x vs Spring Boot 3.x and different libraries. Some newer libraries expect you to use also newer Spring Boot version. Also newer Java version. You can't just throw the newest library in the code and hope that stuff works.Do you have resources (time, budget) to make upgrades to support the newest tools and the newest versions?How will you balance constant upgrades with adding new functionality and maintaining the project as a whole? A new library version can come out every month, for example. Will you concentrate on version upgrades over working what the client actually cares about? It is difficult to ""sell"" version upgrades to a client. You have to prove that it is needed. Yes, Dependabot is a thing but some time will still go into reviewing its MRs and doing smoke testing to ensure that untestable stuff (for whichever reason) works.With you updating stuff, will you break something that external service providers are using?

nvrstxb,"There are several reasons to use microservices:1. The biggest reason is to avoid coordination between teams. Each team can ship the services they own independently of other teams, which allows them to iterate faster and respond more quickly to issues.2. Security isolation. Isolating functionality reduces the blast radius if a component is compromised. If a monolith is compromised, then the attackers potentially have full access to everything.3. Reliability isolation. Similar to security isolation, reliability isolation means there is a smaller blast radius when a component fails. Following from #1, devops will also be easier when your teams only need to understand the components they own and deploy instead of needing to understand the whole monolith during on-call incidents.4. Scaling mismatches. Monoliths that contain multiple functional paradigms (for example both async batch processes and synchronous requests) can be very difficult to scale, performance tune, and cost tune. It is easier to scale and performance/cost tune systems when functional paradigms are isolated into separate services.5. Licensing/distribution issues. This one is probably the rarest in this list, but sometimes you need to isolate components due to billing/licensing/other business agreement purposes.

nvnl04i,"This is going to be a copy paste of a reply that I gave to a similar question. It’s my honest experience. No at least where I am, it’s not just a small companies thing. Here it goes:I can offer my perspective as a junior. Got a job a year before graduation.TLDR: It’s still possible to make it, but you need a degree *with* internships. If you want to guarantee yourself a job, it’s going to be *hard* work, unless you’re a genius. I’m not a genius. Caveat that I’m Canadian, the market might be better or worse where you are.More details to give you an idea: I left my previous stem degree in 2022 when I realized that it wasn’t likely to yield a stable job. I started the CS degree in 2022. I’d programmed a bit before, always liked math and it seemed like a field with a bright future. I jumped in. Things turned sour for my cohort very quickly. By late 2022, many internships were rescinded, postings on universities’ coop programs dropped dramatically, the layoffs *started*. I was pretty dismayed by this to be honest, I’d left a degree that I loved in large part for improved job prospects and now there was a very real chance that it had been a poor decision. My family and I are really not rich (lower middle class at best) so I didn’t have much a choice, I wasn’t sure what else I could do either so I decided to work *hard*. I got perfect grades, I worked on eyebrow raising side projects, I TAed a math heavy class (thanks to my previous background in my other degree), I prepped for interviews. Got my first internship in my first year of the CS degree. Had to move to a different city temporarily for it. I didn’t quite like the particular field that it was in but it was really important for my CV, I finished it and got a good review. Didn’t want to stay in the city I moved to, so I decided to find another internship. Kept doing all of the above mentioned extracurriculars and still kept my grades very high. Meanwhile, things kept deteriorating for most of my cohort, the “best” students got internships, the majority did not. Keep in mind that I’m in coop so internships are *mandatory*.Prepped harder for interviews. Got a bigger company for the second one. If my first internship taught me anything it’s that if you want to be kept on after in this job market, you better be really good. I hit the ground running at this one, lost track of the hours I put into upskilling for it. I also took classes to not put off my graduation date. By the end of the 4 months, I was shipping year end deliverables. They were pretty happy and kept me on. Salary is about 80-90k TC. Quite good for a new grad in Canada. It’s been a huge relief and I’m immensely grateful for it.End all be all, success story in adverse job market conditions, but I want to be honest with you. I haven’t had a life for the past 2 and a half years or so. It’s literally all been school and working on side projects and interview prep and TAing. Now it’s working and still going to school. My relationship blew up and I haven’t been able to date because I just don’t have time, I don’t see my friends often. My own family that I live with doesn’t even talk to me often because I’m always in my room working one way or the other, they’re understanding and supportive though.I don’t want to complain at all because this is a thousand times preferable to being poor, but I want to highlight that this is what it takes to *guarantee* yourself a job now. You have to be the best of the best, whatever best means to the job market. Most of my cohort has not gotten internships and quite a few universities are working out deals with students: decreasing the number of internships, loosening the requirements of what classes to take when, actively involving themselves in our search.

They ballpark a number based on what they know and slap it in there expecting nobody to dig in too far.I think having actual real metrics comes easier working at some companies vs others. If you are at a company where the SW team comes up with their own work then part of that is justifying why it's important to do. More times than not metrics are likely to fall out of that. All of my 15 YOE has been at R&D companies working on greenfield medical device projects, think dialysis machines. It was very top down management style where you do as you are told at the product level. SWEs have control of code level design, but not really the direction of the productSo asking me to justify why did I implement X major feature over 1 year is on the level of asking why did you put as gas and break pedal in a car or why is there an infotainment system in the car. It's there because it's expected to be there if you want people to use your product.So asking me to put in metrics on my resume is pretty hard since we are implementing things on the project for the first tome and not iterating and improving something. Why did we need some feature comes down to the product owner saying this is what is needed based on conversations with X/Y/Z important person at the end of the day.There is obviously all shades of grey between the two extremes I gave as examples. Frankly I have no actual metrics on my resume. My bullets are along the lines of: I accomplished \[X\], that provides \[Y\] value, by doing \[Z\].

Or it could be low latency code. Anything that is not web based usually will be subject to a tighter ressources allocation and thus performance being more important. Think of something mass produced, throwing 50$ more for better ram because you produced shit code and the price of the product is around 50$... It's just not acceptable.A real life example:Sicentific computing is usually very computing heavy for things like simulations or lots of dimensional processing (think RGBs processing but on 280++ channels instead of just 3). These sometimes have tight performance requirements such as processing before another data package is generated. My job is essentially that. I take bleeding edge reasearch code in python made by physicist and optimize the shit out of it so it takes little to no time to process.

This means it's processed in real time and you can have the results immediately which is neat for aviation decision, threat detection and all stuff highly critical.Usually it will require you to work with people of other domain which is very fun I think. You become good at physics, geospatial and other math heavy domain which makes leetcode feels even more stupid (because the time/space complexity is not all you look for in performance computing and usually one of the easiest thing to optimize). Overall, it's a very rewarding field as you may be recruted for satellites, geospatial, lots of physics project that are bleeding edge, quantum computing, etc.",Aware-Individual-827,2025-12-26 10:23:02,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1pvwuzd,False,

nva450o,"By applying ""professional"" tools and techniques to my own projects. For example, home automation is one of mine.Most ""smart home"" tech is incredibly stupid and as a result if you really want it to do smart things, you need to get into the weeds of the tech. That work needs to run somewhere, so that's an excuse for building a home lab. Having a home lab also opens up other wishes, like a Plex media server or backup solution for the family's computers, etc.If I'm building a home lab and building/running all these services, it only makes sense to build it all with IaC and keep track of everything with Git, just like I'd do in a professional setting. Maybe I won't PR myself and yolo it all right into main, but otherwise I'm building things out for my home with the same tools, tech, and patterns I use professionally.Because of this I'm very often doing ""POC"" work for my job on my own home lab first. *That's* where I built my skills first for example, in building and running k8s clusters and all the downstream details that brings for how I structure my code to run on k8s, how do I handle CI/CD cleanly to deploy, etc.When it comes to actual software, I'm coding a lot of family management apps to help track kid chores, keep our finances in order, etc. I'm also coding on robotics and drone projects, including some with/for my kids to run their Lego robot creations.

With my job and what worked for me was asking my team leader if there were any areas where he felt I was lacking or could improve. The company had fortnightly 1 on 1 with me and my team leader so I could have regular private conversations and ask about my performance. For “stepping up” for that getting ahead in your own time management is good, if I was running short on work and would have nothing to do soon, I would shoot an email to my team leader giving him an update on my progress, that I should be finished soon and ask if there’s anything specific that he wants me to work on next.

nvwglc5,"\> being on mobile just seems like being a super small part of the projectI think there's something more to be said about this. It sounds to me like you are thinking in terms of android apps that are front-ends (effectively, websites). Thus, your logical conclusion is that to gain 'more depth' and employability, you should develop expertise in all parts of the application (i.e., backend).I want to challenge that point of view, and emphasize a few job-niches where smartphone apps really leverage the local computing power of a Snapdragon-level processor. In these cases, the app is not only a *part* of the project, it is *integral*. The android expertise you have is incredibly valuable for this use case.Take [ATAK-Civ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atakmap.app.civ) for example. It is a micro-ecosystem of apps and plugins that are used as tools for first-responding and security. Companies develop ATAK plugins using standard android tools, to do things like build software controllers for drones within ATAK, or stream health data from smartwatches of field operatives.Alternatively, Android (the operating system) is used by some companies for their own non-smartphone products. I recently interviewed with a company that builds treadmills. The treadmills use stock android for their OS and applications to serve standard functionality to their users and control hardware.These are small companies, sure. There are hurdles to finding these, especially since you're not in the US. You will have to do research to find such companies. And they may pay less than a large company like the one you're at, because the scale of the revenue they generate is going to be intrinsically smaller (the other side of that coin is that the revenue is shared with fewer individuals, so you may actually get paid pretty well anyway).

XNA transitioned to monogame, and SDL is now SDL2. I believe Unity was around but it wasn't popular yet, unreal engine existed but the commercial license was expensive. I went with learning C# because I wanted to make games for the Xbox 360 and monogame was free to use, which I did, I launched two games before finding work in the industry doing web development. That was my path and it worked well for me.In your case, because you have a heavy math background and you're only interested in learning id try LISP or maybe Python. Those are less marketable languages but have heavier focuses on Math.Any mainstream language to start is a good one though. Game programming is fairly math intensive which you might enjoy but it's very labor intensive and requires a knack for art , if you don't mind trying to make your own graphics and aren't all that concerned about design philosophy then id still recommend C# and monogame. Maybe you could start by building pong and then transitioning to a game like tetris. Good luck!",dontdoxme33,2025-12-20 09:16:09,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1pr4334,False,

nvj53td,">I recently started looking again and even though I'm applying for entry level positions I haven't gotten even an interview yetFrankly, nothing you add to your portfolio is going to solve the ""I can't get an interview"" problem.Things in your portfolio can be useful points of reference in the absence of professional experience. That only matters if you're talking to an actual engineer, or engineering manager, who knows the difference between ""wrote HelloWorld in Rust"" and ""on the Rust board of directors"". Most HRBPs/recruiters don't know the difference, and speak ""years of accredited education"" and ""years of professional experience"" exclusively, and those are the people deciding whether your application/resume ever lands in the inbox of a manager with an open [req](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150317-00/?p=44453).Be sure to emphasize the internship and accredited education in your resume first and foremost. The portfolio, or interesting GitHub personal projects, can and should be a footnote below things recruiters/HRBPs are specifically looking for. I'll also add that tinkering alone, by yourself, on a project is not nearly as useful as collaborating with a team on a project. Because in the real world, most engineers work as a part of a team or teams to get stuff done. Consider contributing to well-known open source projects. Understand that step 0 of contributing meaningfully to most open source projects is: You understand what the project is, and who its end users are, on a deep level. That can take anywhere from days/weeks/years depending on the complexity of the project. And ""I was part of SIG release for Kuberenetes 1.31"" is easier for a recruiter/HRBP to grok than ""look at this chatbot I made, isn't it neat"". It's especially easier to grok if that recruiter/HRBP is staring at a req with the word ""Kubernetes"" in 5 different places.For extra emphasis; Fix your resume first before you spend time chasing shiny open source projects.

Unfortunately Dunning Kruger will make people think that these courses are actually rigorous and good to learn from.And 2023 polls are done in 2022 which was peak hiring for a while + the 87% consists of all degrees,coinbase-discrd-rddt,2025-12-24 06:45:29,4,cscareerquestions,t1_nvodv75,False,

nvmav41,"school is going to use the rote memorization - right answer - reward loop over and over. Until you hit a class where your professor just dgaf and throws yall in the fire, sink or swim, with material. And that's when you realize, you HAVE TO teach yourself. You don't really have a choice, just curriculum wise, you will eventually meet your maker if you believe in memorization as a true learning form. Computer science in that way breaks a lot of traditional learning isms about college in general. Because there IS some very real applied form of it (programming) unlike a lot of other fields that would require more set up.Anyway, i feel you. The only way to move forward imo is to have one foot in college and one foot out. When you're in school, listen, do the assignments, study etc. When you're out of class, be working on your side projects, doing leetcode, learning some other tool etc. It isn't easy.

nvmgt8x,"Seems less like a question about CS specifically and more about learning skills in general. You should probably ask yourself how do you actually learn skills.For most people, some combination of spaced repetition and recalling things from memory is usually how they retain information. So, transposing to coding, you may need to build the ""muscle memory"" in layers, e.g. first memorize syntax, then memorize specific API signatures, then eventually memorize semantics of the APIs.Syntax can be learned by just coding a lot and running the code to validate that the syntax is correct. API signatures can be memorized via exercises called Katas (basically do the same thing from memory multiple times) or just using them frequently enough. Semantics start to become easier to memorize once the ""lower"" layers become more second nature.",lhorie,2025-12-23 22:45:01,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1pu5qcz,False,

What databases have you used?Interviewing for juniors is very different than interviewing for seniors. And admittedly, the market is, I think, still pretty fucked for juniors at the moment. Questions I usually ask juniors are related to the above questions. But then also I tend to focus on ability to problem solve, take constructive criticism, and ability to work with a team. So I’ll ask questions like;Tell me about a time you were unsure of how to approach a solution. What did you do?Tell me about a time you and a coworker had a disagreement about something, how did you resolve it?Things like that. First one tells me about your problem solving skills and is an indicator of how recognizing you don’t know what you don’t know. I also ask seniors this except in a way that shows they have the ability to mentor juniors. The second one is important because in software there are a million ways to solve one issue. Some better than others, but they’re all a solution regardless. It will let me know how you approach these kinds of situations that come up a lot of times in code reviews and architecting out solutions (no I don’t expect a junior to do this) But as a junior, we’re expecting to have to hand hold for aGood bit to get you comfortable and get you onboarded.
