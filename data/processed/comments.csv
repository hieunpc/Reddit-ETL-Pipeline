o5unagf,"I sort of like a bit of lake and a bit of warehouse. A common loading pattern we have been using is:- for streaming: source --> Kafka --> snowflake (snowpipe streaming to tables)- for batches: source --> AWS s3 (~lake) --> snowflake (external tables)- in both cases once in Snowflake: raw staged tables (bronze) --> structured, type-cast, deidentified views (silver) --> Kimball/star/mart views with metadata (gold)I've been liking this system so far. The key difference with streaming and batch in the above cases are that the batch method keeps the raw/bronze data in s3 via external tables, so I guess that's a ""lake"", while the streaming method loads the CDC events into a table resting in the snowflake data warehouse. We use dagster to orchestrate and dbt to run the jobs. The technologies are good - the challenges are behavioural in nature.There's probably a more consistent way to do the above, but it does work. I guess the lake/s3 component just exists because it is simple and cheap to read from some provided s3 dump than to add a ""copy into"" step. We would probably would have done the same for streaming, but snowpipe streaming is a good enough solution at the moment so we can skip a redundant intermediate load to s3.",PossibilityRegular21,2026-02-17 11:50:58,75,dataengineering,t3_1r73l52,False,

Model the infrastructure (make it modular and scalable), create some processes, and give power to the people within some defined boundaries. It’s more work, but I feel it’s easier — after inital cost I can go do streaming, swap out tools, optimize DB tables, create alert systems and stuff.Plus the experience managing your own files, metadata, debugging fucking notebooks is atrocious.

But here are some general pointers from when I first started that might help.\- Learn general data engineering practices / lingo. You're going to hear things like: Data Governance, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage, Data Warehouse, ETL, ELT, Data Lake, OLAP, OLTP, Data Mesh, etc. You don't have to learn everything all at once, or even fully understand everything the first time. Start with who / what you'll work with, expand from there.\- Learn SQL VERY well. Two sides to this: learn a dialect VERY well and learn a database implementation well. The former will help you with your day to day job as a junior. Learning how to solve common patterns, use common functions, solve common SQL problems, etc will help you for your whole career. For the latter, you would want to really be able to explain things like indexes (which ones to use, why), data storage internals, how to read execution plans and optimize, etc. This is something you should be picking up gradually throughout your career, and I would only expect more mid level / senior engineers to know more and more about these things. For a junior, just begin learning it slowly, but don't stress out too much. \- Lots of companies are now on the cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP). If your company is one of them, you should learn the stack. Learn the services that your company is using, what role / problem it solves, and how to configure/work with it. Whatever your company uses, be it Azure Synapse/AWS Redshift for data warehousing, ADLS / AWS S3 for object storage, learn that tech deeply, learn how authorization/authentication works on your cloud platform, and those two alone will carry forth across cloud providers. Once you learn what you work with, you can slowly expand outwards if you so desire. \- Additional point to the above, lots of companies also use Databricks / Snowflake. If applicable, learn what each of those companies provide in terms of offerings or services. IMHO learning either of these opens the door for more data engineering roles in the future.\- Maybe a controversial tip, but as a software engineer turned data engineer, I personally still apply software engineering principals just through a data engineering lens. That means following best practices when writing clean code, working with things like CI/CD, git, code review, etc. This may seem like a no brainer, but not every shop hires data engineers from the software engineer / CS grad pipeline. Lots of DEs I knew came from data analyst or scientist positions, and had no clue of the SWE fundamentals. I think treating this job as a specialized SWE position will help you a LOT with the menial stuff, and it'll allow you to pivot if you ever want to.I omitted a lot, but I think this is good to start, and I think these are general enough to help you no matter what kind of DE position you're put into.",___ml_n,2026-02-18 08:52:07,78,dataengineering,t3_1r7u6sz,False,

o62806u,"SQL and Python are going to be your best friends in this career. I am not sure about your proficiency in either, but try to solve some difficult problems in both without using AI (or may be ask AI to generate questions for you to solve). In SQL, try to build common patterns in data engineering with some sample data - MERGE INTO, SCD Type 2, some small star schema design. In python, know common patterns used with data structures - list, dict, set and iterators. These will help you in first few months. You can slowly move towards understanding the bigger data engineering architecture - SQL Optimization techniques, ETL, Data Vault modelling. I recommend you get 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering' book and read it once in a while. Re-read the concepts again once every few months as it will add new perspectives as you gain experience. Once you master SQL and python, tools are not going to be difficult for you. You will get to see that irrespective of tool - Spark or Snowflake, Airflow or ADF (or any GUI based orchestration) - the build patterns and outcomes are almost exactly same. While you master technical things, also try to be curious about the business problem you are solving. It doesn't matter if you know 4 different tools, if you cannot answer what business problem you solved. For this, AI would be immensely helpful. Let's say someone wants to build a CRM dashboard for which you are building data model - You might hear terms like Sales Funnel or Conversion rate - Try to ask AI and get an overall perspective of the problem you are trying to solve. You will work with lot of business analysts who will be more than happy if you talk their language. These should be enough for now.",inglocines,2026-02-18 14:49:25,7,dataengineering,t3_1r7u6sz,False,

If he still cannot work with it after that, then the real conversation is whether the parent company is going to force their tooling choices down regardless of fit.Sometimes you lose these battles and the decision gets made above you.

We had a batch job that ran for 8 years with zero external packages beyond requests and psycopg2. Worked great.But rebuilding ORM patterns from scratch is different from just not using one. If you're writing your own query builders, connection pooling, retry logic, and type coercion, you're now maintaining all that code forever. Every bug fix, edge case, and security patch is on you. SQLAlchemy has had hundreds of contributors finding problems you'll never think of.The return code pattern concerns me more than the dependency choice honestly. Python's exception model exists for a reason and fighting it creates code that's harder to read and debug. If your senior prefers explicit error handling, that's fine, but there are Pythonic ways to do it without making every function look like C.The real question is what's the maintenance horizon here. If this is a one time data migration that runs and gets archived, vanilla Python is fine. If this is production infrastructure your team will maintain for years, the cost of rolling your own ORM will compound. Every new team member has to learn your custom patterns instead of reaching for documentation.Worth having a direct conversation about it. Ask what specific concern drives the no dependencies stance.

I try to stick to stuff that's in the Anaconda suite since it seems to get a buttload of community and support.If a vendor has their own libraries that they actively maintain, I'll use those. If it's a real niche thing by some dude and I can't find a way to feel good about it, hell no. I've never had anything bad happen, but it only takes one time. I don't think my situation is a very good comparison. Nobody was really supporting me or looking at my work. I just packaged code where I could reference a config file like a control table. Send queries, save them as flat files, do the things like package them into this or that or upload them here or there.I was never given the greenlight for an actual database, but it got us by in the interim as we grew. Again, my situation was very specific with weird constraints.If your senior dev dude is having you basically write your own stuff instead of using a library, take that is a chance to reverse engineer a process that many might take for granted. A few years from now you'll be that much more versed in things I guess? Like, I had nobody to review my code. If anyone had to go back and look at it, it was me.

You can't make up for the tech debt and disorganisation of some places.Documentation is a mess absolutely everywhere and those consolidation projects take years and fail every time, in that there will be N+1 repositories. And then they will do it again. It's the biggest boondoggle in the business. Funnily, they always go hard on permissions on that latest repository and will require multiple panel reviews and checkins for literally anything you want to put in, to the point it's impossible to use. So don't think about that anymore. Focus on building your own documentation silo wherever it is and however you want to. The goal is a foundation for your own work, not a general thing for other people. And you've got other responsibilities? That's also common. Try to see it as a good thing in that you get some extra job stability. That aside, are people complaining? Have you looked around and realised there are others who have been there for years or decades and not pulling their own weight? lol. They probably created most of these problems too!This is all extremely common. If you move on now you will likely experience the same thing and worse, so my advice: seeing as you are not fully invested in this job, try to see it as your personal playground to try some other working and thinking styles, until you find something that lets you function there without the anxiety.If anyone ever asks something you don't know, you're not the expert on that, but will try to find someone (and often, people will just forget it entirely!)

Example, any math theorem you learned in school, or theory in engineering. So the abstractions applicability is limited to the details covered.Thus how abstract is your problem space and what are the details, in rough terms it's variety. Then do the solving & problem abstractions vary in requisite ways?So to answer, if you are truly lost in core syntax and implements like debugging, you don't fully know the abstraction.

With all the abstractions these days, you won't know everything and a general knowledge is often where one starts.Lastly your final questions around AI model roles, my feel this is opacity not (your) competence.

It is a niche of DE but an important and interesting one, I think you should lean more into that side of things and find jobs there. Create some dummy projects showing off your skills with Vector and Raster data, intersect that with H3/s2 cells at different aggregations. Connect this with real world data like open street maps. You can explore using duckdb/bigquery geospatial functions. Learn about Apache Sedona and maybe try to set it up and get AI to help guide you along and learn. Use tools like OpenCode or ClaudeCode to start building and then ask a lot of questions and make it explain things to you.

The math is nontrivial. Linear algebra, especially rotation matrices and quaternions for coordinate transforms, and the Newtonian equations you'd learn in a 1st year calculus based physics class, and also a bunch of other stuff that I had to learn/relearn to work here. (I have an undergrad degree in math.) I don't have to *implement* everything, but I do need to understand what's going on conceptually and use appropriate mathematical libraries correctly.2. The folks I work with are PhDs, so a lot of building a pipeline is listening, very carefully to what the (let's say) rocket scientist wants and building exactly that. No creative metrics here. The physics is the physics. I ask a lot of questions about what is supposed to happen through a series of calculations. What does a good result and a bad result look like? Where are the best places along the way to spot-check things like an intermediate matrix becoming ill-conditioned?3. The PhD's are not hired for coding ability. I need to detangle messy MATLAB code to turn into data pipelines that I actually want to own and maintain over time.I work on the ""easy"" stuff that still fits in a Postgres database. So, I use python and other fairly standard tools. I want to upskill into rust/pyO3 which I'd hope would make some of the calculations complete faster than numpy/scipy.

o5yw3l5,"at \~100gb and a sql server target, i’d stick with the bronze db and keep dev and prod fully separated, linked server into prod bronze is the part i’d avoid because you’ll end up debugging cross env drift and permissions weirdness. a lake layer only really pays off if you need cheap raw retention, replay/backfills, multi consumer reuse, or you’re already planning a near term platform shift. what’s your refresh pattern and failure mode, mostly daily full loads or incremental with occasional backfills?",calimovetips,2026-02-18 00:58:36,1,dataengineering,t3_1r7o1vq,False,
o5zwajq,"I’d recommend factoring in polybase and external tables as options if you’re considering using ADLS as your raw storage. It allows you to virtualise the parquet files (and other sources) as a single db table (recent iterations also work with Delta tables with limited features, but I believe pushdown and partition pruning are supported) which removes the need to have the separate staging layer. I then just set it up with ‘staging’ model files which query the external table and set the right column types because it will do things like read your columns that are supposed to be CHAR(8) as VARCHAR(MAX) since most flavours of parquet that I’m aware don’t have that extra column metadata, and the rest of the project builds from there as normal. I had a similar thought process while I was designing this in terms of it enabling an easier transition to a proper lakehouse architecture in future, and it does help a bit with managing schema drift, but for an established DWH I’d be doubtful about whether the juice is worth the squeeze - the only reason I did it is because everything is new.",Froozieee,2026-02-18 04:22:26,1,dataengineering,t3_1r7o1vq,False,

o5z22uo,Mostly daily full loads with a couple bigger transactional tables being incrementally loaded. As well as occasional backfills which are usually just rerun pipelines of truncated big transactional tables. We wouldnt want to even retain the data in a lake forever and usually aim for a retention period of like 7-30 days depending on the source. I have another question then: if we wouldnt use linked servers what else would you propose so dbt in the dev environment has the same data pretty much at the same time as the prod environment. We also have 20-40 api scripts through azure functions ingesting to bronze prod. And a couple of bigger source systems that ADFs copy activity handles. But i wouldnt want to clone stuff and insert everything twice. Also the DDL statements to create and prepare th tables for dev ingestions would be needed twice too. Should we backup and redeploy the prod bronze db maybe after each time? Is Linked Servers really a bad option and what do you mean with cross env drift and permission weirdness?

o69term,Currently its just an overnight trigger that pulls and copys into the SQL server as Sink. As well as a bunch of APIs running at the same time at night so the bronze tables have yesterdays data. I ran into an issue using Linked Server in the dev dbt env as I cant reference it cleanly (different SQL Server on VM). As its a 4 part identifier. [Linked Server].[BronzeDB].[schema].table_name and dbt expects DB.schema.table_name Also I wont mind at the end if in the Source System of yesterdays data smth breaks. I would simply handle it with either a blue/green deployment and more precisely simply not updating the gold (presentation layer) if anything in bronze or silver broke. I am playing around with polybase rn tho and a data lake solution possibly as the linked server setup doesnt really work cleanly.,FasTiBoY,2026-02-19 17:16:08,1,dataengineering,t1_o65zg46,True,

We all see at this point that it’s a huge bubble similar to the .com bubble, and we’ll probably see similar result - AI is likely here to stay, but it probably won’t be used very differently than how it’s being used today and the demand to put AI into every app or service will die down.

Write a for-loop or an equivalent that prints every X amount of money spent on lottery tickets until you hit the jackpot. It'll teach you basics about for-loops, ToString(), classes and to avoid lotteries.* Create an API that you can test using Postman/Insomnia (real world valuable experience).* Create a windows service (if you are learning .net that is), that you can install, start, stop, restart in windows gui (also valuable experience).* Install Docker Desktop or the equivalent on your computer. Then create a containerized small project, doesn't matter what the project is. What matters is that it runs inside the container and you can interact with the project through the exposed port (very valuable real world experience).* Create a project where you split its component into several containers, then orchestrate them through Docker Compose or an equivalent (very valuable real world experience).",Fyren-1131,2026-02-14 13:43:12,42,learnprogramming,t3_1r4kpqq,False,

o641q4n,"I think that's awesome and most of the calculator apps out there are badly in need of an upgrade from Texas Instrument days, which they all strangely seem to still emulate.I wrote my own CRM in and now it's fully customized to a sales workflow, has dynamic scripts that populate for each client with name and info from the lead source. I can easily add or modify these scripts using a regular text file and put the fields I want in with {{ label }} tags and it will replace them with customer record data. I can just add a template file to a directory and it'll use it. That builds the texts I can bulk or individually send out. As I work, it dynamically keeps track of my availability across the day and updates the scripts for me on the fly as my schedule fills up.Although it has some required fields in the single SQLite table it uses, like first name, last name, phone, status, but other than that, it can import any csv file with at least those field names into it and it'll just slurp up whatever and show the fields from the csv in the GUI. It also has a customized note taking page where I can put the customer's data into a UI and it'll save is as a json document in a directory and attach the name of that file to the client record. That document is also a json document, so I can modify it without coding anything and those fields in the notes are not on the client record directly and they don't need to be. I could of course add them later to any data structure I want if I want to.Also, now I can parse PDF files for data, match them to a record and update the database and attach the now renamed pdf file to that client and open it in a window from the gui. I can also create a new record if one doesn't exist, or just fail and spit out a not found. Whatever I need it to do at the time.That pdf view window dynamically changes to the corresponding file if I change customers in the gui by selecting, hitting the next or previous client or page buttons, and doesn't break if it's not there, it just happily displays there's no pdf file found for that one.It also has color themes, a dark, light, slate, blue and pink themes. These are CSS files and if you want to add one you just drop it in by the name light.css, dark.css into a config directory and it'll pick it up and let you select that from the menu and save it so it always uses that theme until you change it again, with all the other config options that you set as well. They all stay active until changed across runs.It can build lists I can use for bulk texts or anything else I can dream up for it. I can just code that in.As I built it and made changes, I just kept adding the ability to customize it from the way it used to work, to the new capability. So, it basically just gets more and more powerful over time. Everything it could ever do, it can still do perfectly fine.It's awesome and it's 100% mine, 100% free, and 100% not on the cloud, it doesn't even use a web browser either, although it easily could, but I like that it doesn't for now.Would it pass corporate IT coding standards. NOPE! I wrote them so I know, NOPE! and I like it that way.Is it easy to use - Yep.Is it user friendly - Nope.Is it well documented - other than the code is clearly written - NOPE. lolThat's (Hell\^Nope)Did I vide code it? Kinda. I've got plenty of experience writing software. Big software. No direct experience writing anything quite like this before. It's got the simplest data model I've ever used in any DB lol. There's a lot of room for more things it could do here in the future if I get around to needing it. For now, I just don't.I started with free AI because I didn't know a some of the available API's and I wanted to try them out. I went through a few of these before I found one I liked and wanted to work with. AI got me off the ground with them,I got amazingly far down the line of a prototype and before I knew it, I had something basically working. As I kept adding more capability however, it quickly ran out of context area and now gets lost and makes so may errors and just poor coding choices I rarely use it anymore. The cool thing is I don't really need it now. I learned the API I landed on and I'm comfortable taking it from here. I also got a very good idea of what AI can and can't do these days as well.Replace coders and people with technical skills? Maybe some junior slog roles. It can be used to write slog job automation that would have otherwise been way out of scope and not cost effective.What are you going to replace them with? Don't even tell me business analysts. Don't even think about telling me corporate executives or nepo babies. They don't know their ass from a hole in the ground and AI isn't going to help for that.

People like you do not send your CVs, LinkedIns, Githubs, etc. Or they hesitate a lot before they start applying to places.Then there are people who do send but visibly are not confident during the interview. I do not mean that one should start lying and exaggerating things but I mean, be confident in what you know and in what you do not know. ""Yeah, I do not know frontend development but I'm considering learning it."" or ""I'm a backend developer but having to do frontend tasks seems to be a good challenge."" I have told these. Not during interviews but during 1:1s when I was moved to a fullstack position. And my boss was fine. Because she saw that I actually show an interest in improving myself. If I would be ""I'm worried about frontend tasks. I really hope I will not get any of these. Backend tasks are much safer bet."" then that would be bad. Lack of confidence, no wish to grow, perhaps even stagnation.Then lack of confidence when being on probation period. Cool, you got hired! You passed all these interviews. But the next 2-5 (however long time period) months are also critical. Either you pass the probation period or the company has to tell that ""Sorry. We considered it but we do not see how things will progress from here."" Perhaps different countries have different laws and such, but where I live, a person is put on a ""test period"" of a couple of months before his contract is finalized (meanwhile the contract is temporary). So, some juniors, they are not confident. They do not ask questions. They do not share their thoughts. They do not participate in discussions over new tasks and such. They get stuck and do not voice it out. They start comparing themselves with younger colleagues who have been in the field for longer time, then get some irrational fears, and let it affect themselves even more negatively.What I'm trying to say: this field indeed is difficult. But one should be confident in himself. Have a growth mindset. When you see you are lacking in something do not see it as a weakness but see it as an opportunity to learn new things.

Build shit.A learner needs to put it all together to make something work, it involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller actionable steps. Pseudocode can come in handy here where ou focus on the flow and shape of the code without worrying about methods and built-in functions. Once you have a plan then you can go into details.For example, lets build a lasagna. Ok, how tf do i do that, break it down into smaller pieces, stuggling, then google the steps, find out, look for solutions. Ok so we need 3 parts to build this, a meat sauce, bechamel sauce, and lasagna sheets. Cool cool how do i make the fucking meat sauce bro and wtf is bechamel... Google it, search, look for answers. Ok sweet so i need the following for a simple meat sauce but how do i put it together... Google it, search for answers....its all an interative process.

o5k3dwc,"Professional software developer here, and I agree with everything you've said. Building on your post, here's an analogy from my own experience that I think supports your point:I learned to write code before I learned to cook. I was equally interested/enamored by each of these skills when I first started to learn them.One of the first things I learned to cook was [stir fried chicken with rice noodles][stir-fry]. For at least a month, I made this dish several times per week. This repetition afforded me space to observe and learn - I noticed when the color of some ingredients started to change in the cooking utensil (an observation I wasn't previously able to make). I started adding other ingredients to the dish because I had learned some intuition (which gave me confidence that even if my didn't turn out great, it wouldn't be terrible) over repeated exposure. Slowly, I was able to rely on visual cues without needing to set a timer (""hey! the broccoli is starting to look like it's cooked"" instead of ""it's coming up on 3min, time turn down the heat""). This is how I learned how to cook and how to understand what I was seeing on the stove. Prior to this, I had watched many cooking shows/videos and family and friends had even tried to show/teach me - all of this was ""tutorial hell"" and I never felt like I knew what I was doing. One lesson from this experience is that ""know what you're doing"" doesn't come before you build something for the first time. It's actually the other way around - you learn by doing stuff. When I say that, I am reminded of providing tech support for my grandma. She'd always be afraid that she was going to accidentally break something. This is a real concern with programming languages - you could potentially delete files or crash your OS through some bug. But starter/learning projects rarely expose you to that functionality. If you're still afraid, consider using a virtual machine. It wasn't until I read this post, OP, that I made the connection between this cooking practice and something else I did when I was learning to write code (back in 2007 - I'm old, I guess). After I first learned python, I would often (and for no real reason other than ""I like to write code"") write a decimal to binary function in python. Sometimes it would take me a long time to write (30min was not uncommon), sometimes I'd write it in a few minutes. The point was never to write it quickly to ""beat my personal record"". The point was always to practice this new skill. Sometimes I'd write it recursively, sometimes I'd try something different.But this repeated practice did for me, the same thing that repeatedly cooking the stir fry did. I was able to study different ways of solving the same problem and hone my understanding of how python works. Now, I didn't write my decimal to binary converter every day - I think the most frequently I did this was ""once a week"" for a few weeks (then, about once a month, and I eventually started to use it to test whether I liked a new keyboard). At the time for me, it was like re-reading my favorite passage out of my favorite fiction book (the was before Netflix, so that might translate today as ""rewatching my favorite episode of a TV show"").That's really the secret sauce - practice for familiarity. When I use LLMs today, the value for me is that the LLM writes the code. The time savings for me comes from not having to physically type out the code. The thinking that goes into it beforehand (what architecture to use, what algorithm to use, what data structures to use, how to model the data flow and problem solving, etc; If I haven't yet made these decisions, I have a conversation with the LLM to help me decide) - I communicate all of that to the LLM and let it do very little beyond writing the code I described.It does feel counterintuitive that learning to write code requires as much time and practice, because this learning time is often compared to learning other skills that require more time and practice to acquire and gain proficiency in. The key realization is that while learning to write code is faster than (say) learning to become a neurosurgeon, it still takes a lot (nowhere near zero) of time and effort. And while the proficiency threshold to make a meaningful contribution is lower than in many other professions, that threshold is not a plateau - the proficiency curve does go a lot higher and I think this might be one reason why beginners often get a wide range of feedback (from experienced developers with a wide range of proficiency levels)Ok I took a couple of rambling tangents (sorry, it's Sunday afternoon), but the takeaways are:1. repeated exposure and practice are the key to escaping tutorial hell1. the proficiency threshold to ""build something"" is much lower to escape tutorial hell than it is to (for example) contribute to an existing project in a professional or opensource capacity1. the probability of accidentally making a catastrophic error is very low1. the notion that repeated exposure improves proficiency is not new (my cooking story), thought that's maybe more of a ""hard truth"" than a ""comforting fact"" as I had originally intended it to be[stir-fry]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8f752SdeAI",inspectorG4dget,2026-02-15 19:25:55,4,learnprogramming,t3_1r53h5t,False,

What is more important is if you can build backend systems and talk about them. After your gaining understanding of backend fundamentals, it will be very easy for you to learn Java.3. Should you stick with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) and learn OOP, DSA, Linux, SQL, and Git?Yup... Those are good to have backend skills. SQL, Git, Linux, and backend architecture are the things used all the time in real jobs and will make you employable no matter the language.The most significant factor is practical experience. I usually give a junior candidate, who has built and deployed projects and can talk about them in detail, a clear advantage in comparison with one who hasn't.",paragonmac,2026-02-19 18:12:13,2,learnprogramming,t3_1r95fxw,False,

The efficiency, the cost, when to use it vs another option, etc. To work on social skills and networking. The rest of the learning comes with experience. You'll have to make a choice for the coding language you learn, and none of them are bullet proof for you to have a great job and job stability. Getting in there and getting your hands dirty is all you can do.From what I've seen, the main positions that use heavy math are the AI, data analyst, and machine learning.

You have to learn to architect systems and break down work such that you can take the harder problems yourself and set your juniors up for success while also being responsive to your users.Another way to look at it is that junior and mid level engineers get their work from senior engineers while senior engineers have a more active role in defining the work. You have to do that in such a way that you carve out safe rails for junior engineers to work along and good bones to respond to often chaotic business needs. Don’t discount the degree to which that will strengthen you technically.It sounds like you are an experienced mid level engineer but a pure focus on directly improving your own technical skill will hold you back.

Almost like clockwork, the DBMS would fall to its knees and one or more senior people would do a little fire drill, 45 minutes wasted every day. They were just used to it and couldn't think outside the box. I did a proof of concept that did everything totally differently and placed almost no load on the DBMS, studiously avoiding any hint that the people who came up with the original system were idiots, and my project was adopted with me as the implementer.

o5w3gcs,"Everyone has answered things really well, but I want to touch on the question about whether folder structure is essential and does it depend on the framework.While others are correct that folder structure is not bound, required, or essential; it is often very important to the build tools you may, or may not, be using. Different build tools whether they are used in JavaScript, Java, C/C++, all follow some standard folder structure. Most Java projects are built with Gradle, Maven, or Ant and the Java folder structure is pretty rigid among these. Cmake for C/C++ is less picky about folder structure as your program's include statements control much of that. React, Svelte, and many JavaScript frameworks also use their own folder structure. Even Rebar3 for Erlang has a fairly fixed structure it uses.Build tools automate building of final product code so they expect certain files to be in certain places. These can be changed in the build configuration, but then working with a team used to standard structure can be chaotic. Also, many build tools will create the folder structure when you request a new project to be built.So, if you are building projects within a team or for a business, the folder structure will likely be mandated and essential. Even if you are planning to share a project, using a standard folder structure is still highly recommended.

Outside of getting a degree in CS, that has always been the most helpful, since it both keeps me busy and gives me something to gauge my learning by.If it helps, here was my road. I didn’t have a map for my programming career initially, but I’ve learnt that adapting is the best strategy for my own path. I wasn’t familiar with computer science at all growing up, despite having a father who was a programmer. I tried to go to college but dropped out to protect my grades. Then I worked at Lowe’s for a time. While there, I bought a game on steam that taught Python. Overnight, I fell in love with coding. I took a year and taught myself how to code in Python through learnpython.org. I also gave myself the framework of making a fully-Python-based game engine (which I still haven’t finished), so that I could learn how the language worked. Now I’m back at the university learning coding. I took the required course on C++ and also researched ahead on some C++ concepts before they were taught, such as C++ classes and templating. Now I have practiced with C++ for over a year and am working on my own language. So all that to say we each have different roads and different ways of navigating through life.If you think you’re an imposter, you don’t have as much of a right to feel that way as I do, since I’m so late to the game and my life has more twists and turns than yours has. And I don’t feel that, because I’d rather give myself purpose and structure than to feel like I’m useless.

o5aq5rl,"I'm working on a Kotlin math library for higher math. I was going to post my Cayley-Dickson construction to show how I generate the complex numbers from the field of real (double) numbers and then apply CD once again to get one of the six unital quaternionic (not commutative but still associative) involution division rings by doubling the complex numbers and mapping i to one of ±i, ±j, or ±k, but I would have to post too much code (a few dozen interfaces) to make it make sense, so instead, I'll post something more self-contained that will probably be more interesting to people here, i.e. the factoradic representation of a number.Still, it's a really cool algorithm and way to generate the ""Cayley-Dickson tower"" which creates an infinite sequence of algebras starting with the reals to create the complex numbers, the quaternions, the octonions, the sedenions, etc. without needing to explicitly code any of them.The thing about Cayley-Dickson is that you lose ""nice properties"" every time you recurse:When you go from the Reals to the Complex, you lose ordering, but you do get an algebraically closed field, which is always nice. (Every polynomial has a root in the field, and thus splits.)When you go from the Complex to the Quaternions, you lose commutativity (so xy ≠ yx for all x, y).When you go from the Quaternions to the Octonions, you lose associativity (so x(yz) ≠ (xy)z for all x, y, z, but you still have alternativity, which is a weaker form where (xx)y = x(xy) and y(xx) = (yx)x for all x, y.)The Sedenions are where the shit really hits the fan: you only have power associativity and you get nonzero divisors, i.e. ab = 0 where a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson\_construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson_construction)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4)**Instead: Factoradics**So you know how normally, we write numbers in base 10, e.g. 1234?And then we can write them in hexadecimal and binary?1234 in hex is 0x4d2 and in binary it's 0b10011010010?Well, another representation of numbers is called factoradic and is based on factorials. The rightmost digit is always 0, and the number is written: a_n * n! + a_{n-1} * (n-1)! + ... + a_1 * 1! + 0 * 0!where `0 ≤ a_i ≤ i` .Then 1234 in factoradic is: 1411200_! = 1 * 6! + 4 * 5! + 1 * 4! + 1 * 3! + 2 * 2! + 0 * 1! + 0 * 0! = 720 + 480 + 24 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 1234 (as expected in base-10)Here's my factoradic encoder / decoder and the explanation. Note that I prefer to use functional programming constructs when possible: hence why there are no loops here (tail call optimized recursion is my looping: in Kotlin, when you use the keyword val, you cannot reassign to a variable): hence why you see the `aux` function in encode. I (distastefully) use a MutableList all the same to avoid unnecessary list copies.I can't seem to paste it here (too long?) so I made a link to it:[https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS](https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS)Released under the 3-Clause BSD License, but not of much use to you unless you implement your own Factorial implementation (and there's a reasonable bit of machinery there as I represent a few dozen integer sequences and arrays).Right now I just finished polynomial rings / semirings and am working on quotient rings / semirings / fields so I can get the full gamut of finite fields for combinatorial constructions, elliptic curve cryptography (and other forms), coding theory, linear feedback shift registers, etc, as well as implementing geometric lattices nicely and naturally using rings like ℤ\[x\]/(x\^2 + x + 1) for the Eisenstein integers instead of jumping through hoops to replace ω\^2 = -ω - 1.(Not a beginner: I started programming when I was five and I'm 48 now and work in space astronomy.

Substitute your browser in. alias yt='yt-dlp -f '\''bv+ba'\'' --cookies-from-browser chrome --no-check-certificate'Then if you want, say, video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w) (you don't), you just exec: yt ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w""and it should download locally. Save it as ""XqZsoesa55w"" and search for that locally and play it if you have it, and if you don't, download it. (That actually downloads the video and the audio: you can also modify the alias to just download the audio if that's all you want.)You can also download entire playlists by putting in a playlist. (Quotes are probably necessary in that case, and optional in the case of single songs / videos.)You don't need a YouTube subscription or anything like that, but I recommend you be logged in (so the cookies will work).I have had way too many videos that I loved throughout the years get yoinked either by their creators or by YouTube, and I no longer risk that happening. Every time I find something I like or something educational that I want to check out at some point, I download the entire thing locally.The other option would be to just keep going the way you are, still cache songs locally, and keep a log of any files that are no longer accessible.

Those are tools that let you build for multiple platforms using JavaScript. The same is true for Capacitor. These tools make more sense if you already have a solid grasp of web development.In regard to Java vs. Kotlin, you'd be using Kotlin. Java usage has mostly shifted into development of the actual Android OS itself, with Kotlin becoming the preferred language for apps, and Kotlin is way more pleasant to work with.So, it's hard to give a strong recommendation without a better understanding of what you're interested in and what you are trying to pursue. If your goal is to become a web developer who also builds mobile (and desktop) apps, then I'd pick Tauri (personally) or React Native (which is technically better, since it produces real native apps, with real native bindings).If you're starting from scratch and don't really care one way or the other, then Kotlin with Android Studio is probably the more natural choice.Beyond that, you can also build apps for every major operating system using C#/.NET, which is a nice middle ground. Colleges are more likely to teach C#, and a lot of enterprise software is built on C#/.NET. The same team that created TypeScript also created C#, so the two languages play nicely together as well (and have a lot of the same features) - which is a good lead-in to web development.And then there's Dart/Flutter, which I wouldn't recommend (I usually recommend against it), but it is intended for making cross-platform development ""easier"", so as a beginner, it'd be easier to pick up (at first).Point being... you can build mobile apps in whatever you want.

The problem arises when you don't know exactly what N is supposed to be. But honestly, having to mutate an array while iterating through it, should NEVER be an excuse for using a traditional for-loop. Always use the foreach-version if you intend to iterate through an entire list, no matter the language. The only reason to use the traditional for-loop would be when you don't want to iterate exactly N times, but some other arbitrary number.And also you rarely want to mutate an existing array, most of the time you would want a new array with a different set of elements, created by filtering the existing array or something like that.And if not, most languages also have methods specifically for removing elements from arrays depending on certain criteria.",peterlinddk,2026-02-17 14:16:20,16,learnprogramming,t3_1r76ta3,False,

o5whdhf,"This is why I often say programming is easy, at least at this level. The real challenge is taking a specification (word problem) and turning it into code.One thing I can suggest is to take everyday tasks, that a person knows well, and turn them into a word problem and then turn that into code. It might be as something as simple as checking the mail. That might sound simple at first but you generally have to open a door or two, walk to the mail box, open the mail box, grab the mail and return. The more one thinks seriously about what appears to be a simple task, the faster one realizes how detailed one needs to be to get software to do the job. Creating the pseudo code becomes a challenge of iteratively walking through the code until you can actually get the mail. The interesting thing about checking the mail word problem, is that you can check your work by physically walking through your pseudo code.In any event there are lots of things in real life that can help you understand the conversion of tasks into code. The more ""everyday"" the task the more impressive the complexity of what a person does everyday not thinking about it. Brush your teeth in the morning and start to think about how all those actions would be expressed in code. Would the stroking back and forth, be a function to simplify your code.As for the OP I have to point out that this is an extremely common issue. That is turning written requirements into code and frankly it often has nothing to do with programming. However it is absolutely critical to becoming a good programmer. In the real world many times your specification might not be well defined causing one to do some research. That might mean reading a manual to get a device into a mode that you wan work with. The point is your word problems become outlines leaving out critical information you need to fill in. In other words in school you are lucky in that the word problems are generally complete, sometimes you need to figure out what a department really wants.",spinwizard69,2026-02-17 17:50:24,1,learnprogramming,t1_o5t2yst,False,

o5btqdx,"I'll list some things that might make you consider using message brokers, not in order of importance and not in a mumbo jumbo scientific way.1. A message broker is a separate, usually unchanging serviceThis means that redeploying your service has no effect on receiving data and storing event data. You could argue that writing events to a database is the same - and you'd be right, however we're not done yet! 2. Let's take a topic exchange as an example, you've created your topic exchange and have many routing keys for it. One of these routing keys is lets say for messages indicating that a payment has been completed.One day, you'd like to send these payments to a fraud detection company (totally random example, I'm still having coffee), you could make the most barebones service that simply registers a new queue/binding to this exchange listening to the same routing key your main service already listens - and you'll receive a copy of all the payment events.This plug and play style once your messaging system is set up is really comfortable and doesn't require extra work apart from occasionally adding a new field to your message.3. Manual acknowledgement + outbox/inbox patterns for your messages/events is intuitive and safe to work with . Retries are handled with minimal work from your side with the correct configuration for your queue - connectivity issues and the like can be glossed over and you can define a threshold for dead letters where you'll actually have to think if messages reach there - but little connectivity issues or temporary outages don't really hurt you. 4. It's super easy to scale! Apart from being able to plug different consumers into the same routing key to get copies of messages to do different things with them you can also plug multiple (usually identical) instances of a consumer to a single queue so they can fairly share the work. It's really simply to dynamically scale this by adding or removing consumers to a queue that isn't doing the work fast enough.4.5-ish. Like you already mentioned and as it might be a bit obvious it really helps keep your system tidy(er) where each instance can just do its own thing and if you need something *else* you just make something fresh and connect it without bogging down your existing services with more responsibilities. Obviously it's not all sunshine and rainbows and you can easily make a sprawling mess of events flying all over the place and eventual consistency does have its own considerations.",disposepriority,2026-02-14 12:09:58,5,learnprogramming,t3_1r4iu1u,False,

If the API actually also does stuff (goes to the kitchen and makes the stuff requested), it stops being interactive for that duration, which is its primary job. So the API delegates as much work as possible to keep being interactive, the work is done via queues and message brokers.In short, any (real) work should not be done by the API, it should get done by something else.

Like imagine there are multiple instances of your application each with their own local in memory queue, a message might be sent to both and the work is duplicated or some consistency criteria might even break. You can have this sync without queues but if you need queues anyways, just using a service for queues that can observe all the events is massively helpful.4) the queue can scale independently 5) observability, you have once central logical place where the queues report to even if internally they are all running in different physical/virtual systems. So you can then do 2nd level of adaptations based on the state of your queues.

o6fpoir,"""CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software"" by Charles Petzold is a great choice for understanding computer logic from the ground up without focusing on a specific language. It explains how hardware and software interact through historical examples like Morse code and electrical circuits. ""The Signal and the Noise"" by Nate Silver is also useful for learning the fundamentals of data and statistics in a broader context. Both books provide a solid big-picture foundation before you start writing actual code.

o66nr8q,"Loop centric can be genuinely interesting, but you probably want to be really explicit about what kind of “loops” you mean, because that choice basically defines the language’s power and what it is good for.If your loops are bounded and the bound is always known from existing values (classic “for i in 0..n” style), you end up in the territory of total programming where everything terminates. That is awesome for reasoning, resource bounds, and making performance predictable, but it also means you do not get general recursion or unbounded while loops without adding extra machinery. From a formal methods angle, that is a feature, not a bug, if you lean into it.If you allow unbounded loops or something like “loop until condition,” you are basically back to general purpose computation, and then the “loop centric” part is more about ergonomics and how you restrict or structure control flow.Two framing ideas that might help your design doc land with people: what is the smallest set of constructs you need besides loops (variables, arithmetic, conditionals), and what property do you want to guarantee (termination, time/space bounds, ease of verification). If you can say “Gamma Loop is intentionally total” or “intentionally resource bounded,” that becomes a clear conceptual advantage rather than just a vibe.Also, if you have even a tiny spec for the loop form and what is forbidden, folks can give much sharper feedback.

Everything will be explained once, any everything is built up from the foundations (axioms).

Just start, and if you happen upon a concept that requires maths, go and learn that, and only that.EDIT: Since you probably never had mathematics at university: It's hard work, but you don't actually need to be especially bright for the basics. It requires a lot of practice, as it basically teaches you a different way of thinking, which is required for computer science. Learning CS really is just learning a different way of thinking, and the only way to do that is to repeatedly bash your head into a wall until you break through. The wall is made of bricks.

Assuming you knew they existed and were they were hidden. It was not a good idea and didn’t last long.There’ a few HCI problems with the idea. Hidden non-noob features have no perceivable affordances, so users can’t discover them. When they are hidden behind the noob shield users can’t just gradually start to use more and more features. They have to remove the shield and then the UI looks entirely different than what they are used to.I don’t think the quantity of features even really creates issues. A powerful app will by necessity have a lot of features when it’s a tool for professional’s inherently complex work. That userbase can deal with having to learn the app’s basic functions while being exposed to the existence of other more advanced functions.The subscriptions maximizing UX focus of trying to make e.g. Figma accessible for every stakeholder is plain damaging to the core user base.

Designers get to do their work of making changes in ways that maintain the integrity of the whole project (e.g. one page doesn’t suddenly use different words for things than the rest). They also get to make the change in a way that doesn’t f*** up their figma workflow. I mean, when you are using Figma as a power user, you have your component libraries and larger components build from components. Then the right place to make changes is nearly always way somewhere else in a component library rather than on the screen that the stakeholder is looking at.

o5zd0lc,"One thing worth remembering is *why* Ruby and Rails were huge. It goes something like:At the time, backends were *huge* clunky things built out of Java, maybe .NET, and sometimes mainframes and COBOL. That means tons of Java-isms -- better bake a serial number into all of your classes in case you use native Java serialization to save sessions, but also you need an ORM with fifteen XML config files just so the ORM knows to set the `email` property to the `email` column, and that the `users` table goes to the `User` class. Except wait, you don't set the `email` property, you call `setEmail()` on the `User` class. And you don't create a `new User()`, you call a method on a `UserFactory`, which you need to get from the AbstarctDefaultFactoryImpl or whatever. And this isn't even Java 8, even a *simple* Java list looks like: List emails = new ArrayList();Yep, repeat `String` twice and `List` twice and generally be the most verbose, repetitive thing anyone had ever seen until Go gave us `if err != nil { return err; }` after every goddamned line.Or, at the other extreme, there was the LAMP stack -- stupidly-sloppy messes hacked together with Perl and PHP, the kind of thing people were building blogs out of. Wordpress was maybe the state of the art. PHP is a whole programming language that grew out of a glorified template language, so any notion of separating the view from the model was not really happening -- this is a world where you're taking some static HTML thing you built in DreamWeaver, renaming `.html` to `.php`, and adding a mysql query right to the middle of it with `` tags. IMO this explains a lot of why Facebook is the way it is -- it grew out of a tool that was built for adding a guestbook and a hit counter to your Geocities homepage.So Rails did a couple things: It cut out a ton of the boilerplate with ""convention over configuration"" -- if you have a `Users` model class and a `users` DB table, Rails can figure out that those are supposed to go together, and you only need to add configuration when you have something that doesn't fit the very obvious pattern. Ruby cut out more of the boilerplate by not making you repeat your type names five million times. It gave you a CLI tool that generates a working Rails project for you instantly, makes it super easy to get started filling in the blanks. It gives you enough structure that you're probably not building your whole app inside the HTML view like you would in PHP. On top of that, Ruby was a nicer language than most of the competition -- PHP and Perl are both pretty ugly, and Java doesn't even have lambdas.Other replies have pointed out things that made Rails less relevant -- more microservices and fewer monoliths, more web APIs and React and such instead of pure CRUD at the HTML level. But I think it's also because a lot of the basic ideas Rails had either ended up going way too far -- to do that `User``users` mapping, every Rails server needed a complex set of rules on how to pluralize English words! -- or ended up not being necessary for what they were trying to do. Like, turns out with decent type inference (Typescript, Golang), you can do strong, static typing and not constantly have to repeat yourself. Java and even C++ got lambdas, `var` and `auto`, and other basic quality of life code-level stuff.",SanityInAnarchy,2026-02-18 02:26:33,84,cscareerquestions,t3_1r7ks4e,False,

CIS heavily focuses on business operations, has a bit of coding, some network stuff, etc. It overlaps tech with business management and that sort of stuff. IT strongly focuses on Networks, servers, traffic, databases (which is a bit businessy), etc. The programming tends to focus on more automation type stuff similar to CIS. Some colleges have different curriculums for these courses, others don’t really and you can take any classes. It’s just a big toss up. That’s why almost all job posts have CS, CIS, CIT, IT, or other tech related field. Even if they don’t, it’s usually just implied. Someone with a CS degree that has an oracle box virtual home lab setup, has maybe messed with their home network, and builds computers would obviously be strong contender for Helpdesk. Vise Versa, someone with an IT degree built their own small OS in Rust, maybe has another project developing their own language from C++, and maybe does science and math simulations in OpenGL then they’d obviously be a strong candidate for a true entry level (0-3 years experience, unlike the 3-5 we see now) low level software engineering position.So, all of this to say, it just really depends.

On the surface that means 75% of devs get laid off. But in reality, this ignores the factor of human ambition and greed. The ultimate goal of a company isn't to punch off its current TODO list. It's to maximize profits. So at least some of those 75% should end up building new features and launching new products to generate more profits through efforts that wouldn't have been justifiable at the previous cost of development.And some of them will go off and start their own companies doing things with a person or two that previously would have taken a team, startup capital, etc.And so on.I think the same thing applies to the idea of people sitting idle overall. If you look at all of the laid off people coldly as a resource pool sitting idle waiting to be exploited to generate profits, it starts to look as silly to not find a way to put them to work as it would be to not tap into an oil well sitting idle in your backyard. Not because you're trying to do a good deed by giving them a job, but because you're trying to make more money. Which is really the only reason anyone has a job today.The truly difficult part could be the relative pace of all of this - if millions of people get laid off at an unprecedented rate, it will take time to figure out how to leverage this new human resource - what happens in that time? But in the long run, I suspect that the ultimate answer to how we keep ourselves busy in the face of these new tools will be the same answer that has accompanied every productivity increasing technological development in human history: we'll just do more.

Keep doing this project after project and you will learn a ton about systems, design, logging, communication, etc.I used to be a big book person myself, and they are good to get some ideas to get started, but it's better to go start building constantly, and then come back to the books when you need to reference, get unblocked, or learn how to do a specific thing. I think another aspect of this is that the building of systems/services/projects gives you more things to connect mentally when going through books on ""advanced topics"". For example, after building a bunch of projects, when you go through your next system design book, you will make mental connections to what you've already built and think up use cases and improvements with the topics they are talking about.

Your 8 years of keeping a production app running is honestly more valuable than most people realize bc that shows you understand the full lifecycle, can handle real user problems, and know how to maintain code over time. The fact that you've dealt with race conditions, auth systems, and layered architecture tells me you're not just copying tutorials.For the interview prep, I'd brush up on basic SQL optimization, maybe review some common C# patterns, and be ready to walk through your architecture decisions on your main project. They'll probably ask you to solve a simple coding problem, but it's more likely to be ""write a method that does X"" rather than dynamic programming puzzles. As for the full stack vs backend question, honestly your Blazor experience might be more of an asset than you think as lots of .NET shops are curious about it but don't have anyone who actually knows it well. I wouldn't pivot away from mentioning it, especially since it shows you can handle the whole stack when needed. Small companies love that versatility because they don't have huge teams.

It may take a LONG time to pay off (jobs are especially hard to get right now) but eventually it will succeed. Hopefully you'll find a position that is better than this one.In the meantime, there might be ways for you to work around the problem within your current organization. This advice will be appropriate for some companies and not for others so consider your situation before applying it.Sounds like you've effectively been ""demoted"" by being assigned less valuable work. Also sounds like you aren't being given enough work to actually challenge you (""haven’t touched a line of code in 2.5 months"" ""just got assigned the most absurdly simple defect""). Maybe you should go ahead and ""promote"" yourself without asking for permission.Figure out who at the company WANTS the system rebuild that you thought was a good idea (""rebuilding the existing native application with my language of expertise that I’ve worked with & loved my entire career""). Maybe this is a product manager outside of the tech world, maybe it's a VP who doesn't have the clout to get things moving. (If there isn't anyone who wants this done... maybe it shouldn't be!) Talk with this person. Say that you aren't being challenged in your current position and you have some free time. Offer to build what they are looking for as a ""Proof of concept"". Invest some time and just BUILD the darn thing (it's amazing how much faster a ""skunkworks"" project can go. If you succeed, maybe you end up as the tech lead for the project (which would consist of releasing the ""POC"" that you built).As I said, it's not the right solution for all companies, but it CAN be effective in some places.

Try to get any tech job during your break between school.Something you can try is look for full time jobs in your area.

Get the advice and just listen, don't ""but what about, or I heard, or people say"", just listen and ask actually meaningful questions. Right after, and I mean right after, write everything down, whatever you can remember.This is both local advice, networking, and a sort of introduction to an interview.Keep doing this as you can. Keep your eye out for and ask about any local events where IT people meet to talk IT stuff, if you can, try to attend. The goal is to be seen.Getting the degree and being a good fit for the company and the team are what is important. Regardless of what you take, you are not going to really know what you are doing for the first five years, so when people give you free advice, listen.Ideally, you will graduate having had a few tech summer jobs, and have networked with several people.

Idk how your experience has been with your current company, but my biggest takeaway from being at the position I am at currently is that you should switch jobs when you feel you knowledge has stagnated (as in not learning much) or you prefer to go in a different direction in your field (switching from a Full Stack Engineer to say a Back End Developer).It also appears getting past the 2 year mark is pretty much the golden rule. Now depending on how much you are learning or if you have stagnated, the 2 year mark could be a good indicator to look at how far you have come since starting and analyze how much you have learned. I specifically plan on getting to around the 3 year mark before I start applying to much higher paying position. Be it, I am only a few minutes from my house currently and don't have a house, car, or kids to worry about in terms of big monthly payments.

o6e7hjj,"Spent 6.75 years in my first job out of college in a defense contractor, and now am making my leave out of the defense life next month. It really depends on how much friction you want your next job search to be. It's easy to remain in the defense ecosystem, especially if you have a clearance, because getting interviews/callbacks from other defense contractors is much easier after having a proven track record in defense. It's also a very comfortable job outside of the work aspect; a 9/80 work schedule is game changing if you are in company that does that and the slow work pace can be relaxing. I honestly don't think I'll ever attain that same level of WLB anywhere else outside of defense after this. I will definitely consider defense again when I am older and ready to just coast to retirement. I think these factors are huge reason people get stuck in defense; it's what I've seen from my older, high tenured colleagues do and people that have left my company to go to other defense companies.I will say that defense is varied and even teams within the same company can have wildly different directives and experiences. I was fortunate to be in a team that got to do really cool stuff that also had a more relaxed pace, and I still got to learn a lot about SWE at the same time. Some of my colleagues that got placed into the big money maker team in my company were working left and right on different projects every month from what it seemed like. My recommendation is that you give this a fair shot for 1-2 years and make an adjustment if needed.You may actually enjoy the work you do and discover that your team isn't as slow or not productive for learning as you may initially thought, or you completely hit the mark on your initial assessment. As a general life advice, use this opportunity to really isolate what you want from a job, and align your next actions to directly support that goal and don't compromise it just because it's easy. If you want out, commit to finding a job that fits your desired career track or work towards joining a top company that can give you that clout you need to work at your end goal role.

Like if your profile was impressive, they might have thought your performance didn't match their expectations (for that experience or title before).Or ask for very broad suggestions on places to improve.

I don’t know if HR sends generic rejections or just ghosts you if we reject.Phone round - I stopped doing this because i felt it’s pretty useless, it was useful screening tool when we didn’t do virtual interviews and instead had in person interviews. Generally I go over work experience, poke around some technical areas, see if you know what you’re talking about or if the resume was exaggerated. Also good opportunity for both parties to calibrate expectations, so we aren’t wasting eachother’s time. Then wrap up with LC easy question, my go to is a graph search algorithm.Onsite/Virtual final round - now this highly depends on the role. For IC I usually do system design round, for other EMs, I’ve done system design and roadmap planning and strategic vision. Main reason I’ve failed people who solved the system design was due to lack of depth in understanding. It’s very clear when they’re regurgitating from a video they’ve seen rather than make live trade off decisions and ask clarifying questions. Did I really say speed was necessary? Or do we care about accuracy and freshness of data? Why are you adding a cache? Did you clarify the DAU and types of requests to be confident in your cache hit rate? You get the picture. For EM side, it’s usually their examples from their previous job lacks the scope we were looking for. “How did you drive alignment across the organization? How many teams were involved? Did you come up with a proposal for leadership? How much coordination tax would this take? What is the risk if we don’t complete?”TL;DR - we’re human, your interviewer needs to like you and you need to fit their similarity bias.

o5sjhfp,"i think there's a few issues here: 1. i could be wrong, but this seems like you're going over a page. generally for new grad, you should fit everything into a page.2. the projects you are showcasing are all class projects (i'm assuming). if a recruiter is looking through resumes from your school and see the same X projects every single time, your resume doesn't stand out. why pick you over one of the other applicants in the pool? i also think it helps to have your own projects, because it shows how you can solve a problem of your own. recruiters and hiring managers like to see people who take initiative. 3. since your projects are all class projects, it's very hard to describe impact. this isn't to say that you can't use class projects at all, but you better have metrics or it needs to have been extended in some way. recruiters want to see numbers - how many users did your project get? or if not user facing, how much were you able to optimize the performance and how much data could your project handle?4. if you are graduating, your education should be at the top. additionally, your skills section is a mess - for example, ""SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MongoDB)"" is a major red flag to me, given that mongoDB is not in fact a SQL-based database. you need to focus your skill section as well - ""Data Structures & Algorithms, Sorting, Tree Traversals"" - these are not skills that are particularly relevant. i'd highly recommend going through a bunch of job postings and taking a look at what skills they're looking for and condense. even senior engineers don't have a skill section as massive as yours. ""DevOps, Access Controls (RBAC, DAC, MAC, ABAC), Cloud Computing, Machine Learning / AI implementation, SaaS, Encryption / Decryption and Security, Concurrency, Distributed Systems"" - very hard for a recruiter or interviewer to believe that you have all these skills as a new grad without any work experience. and just speaking a bit from personal experience, as someone who's scanned a few resumes and interviewed people: candidates who list this many skills on their resume tend to not do that well during interviews. if my team was passed a resume like this, i (and my colleagues) would likely pass on you.5. i know you don't have much relevant work experience, but you can frame extracurriculars as experience as well (so long as they're tech related in some way)",LsForDays,2026-02-17 01:51:47,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1r6sdkf,False,

The ghosting stats would actually be super valuable, like if I knew a company had a 70% ghost rate I'd probably still apply but adjust my expectations and not put as much energy into customizing everything.The biggest BS right now is probably the AI resume screening stuff. You're getting filtered out by algorithms before any human even sees your application, and nobody tells you why. It's this black box where you could be perfect for the role but get rejected because you didn't use the right keywords or format. Companies are posting jobs they're not even seriously trying to fill, just collecting resumes or satisfying some internal requirement.Super cool bc I'm also building something in this space too (called Sprout) because the whole system feels broken.

It's not going to help you if no one takes you seriously. Pick a 24 hour period once a week to do no school work, you need to let your brain rest.Graduating with a bachelor's of science majoring in computer science, for me at least, was an exercise in stubbornness. I just didn't get ""it"". The thing about computer science is it is not about specifics, it is about concepts.If you can understand the concepts, you can code in any language. You aren't getting a degree to ""learn to code"", I know it might feel like that, but that's not it.Your degree is learning how to learn to code, and that is a very distinct difference.If you are a first year student with no coding experience and you jump right from class to assignment and expect to bang out code, it isn't going to work; to get it to work you need to build the synaptic pathways, to do that you have to work through it. To do that, you need to pseudo code.You can write out pseudo code like an essay.Let's take something very simple, adding two numbers.Do we need anything? I don't think so, but let's put a comment at the top where we can ask for anything that we need to be brought in.Next we need to numbers. How are we going to get those numbers? We need to decide what type of numbers we want. Let's say that we want two whole numbers, we need containers to hold those numbers, and we want the containers to be empty.Name container one and empty itName container two and empty itThen we want to get two numbers. Let's assume we are going to ask a person, then write a function.Ask person for two numbers and store them in the containers, then call the function we will write.The function will then be a box we put something(s) in and then something(s) come out.So we say we cut holes in the box for thing 1 to go in so the box knows that thing 1 has the properties of the hole for thing 1, and the same for 2. Then we cut another hole in the box for one thing to come out.Then that is it. You start very high level and then you write out what you want to do, then you try to figure out how to do it.You have be able to understand the concept of what it is that you are doing before you can code it. Once you know the code, then it is figuring out the syntax.You then start from the top and go to the bottom and change all that you know into code. If you don't know it, try to figure it out, look it up in a book, spend a good 15 minutes on it. Once you can't figure it out, put that specific part into AI and ask it to change it to code. See if anything clicks.Make a word document and name it whatever you are having problems with. Then copy and paste the pseudo code and the AI code into the document. Then tell the AI that you don't like that one and you want it done differently, and keep pasting in the different ways of doing things as you tell it that you want it different; there will be a finite number of ways of doing it.Look at the document, is there anything in that document that ""clicks"" and makes sense to you? If it does, put it at the top and highlight it. That's the way to remember doing it. Rinse repeat.There's no other way to code than understanding the concept of what you want to do and then turning that concept into a reality through syntax. Computer science is like a pyramid, the concepts you learn in year one will hold up year two. I still remember having to use the Jacobian from calculus and being like ""What the actual fuckity fuck fuck?""If you don't have the time to learn the concepts of how to psudocode at a high level, I think you need to consider making more time by doing less.If you can understand the concepts, but not the syntax, you'll be fine.
